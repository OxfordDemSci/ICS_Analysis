###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr **Irwin\-Rogers’** research on youth violence, particularly for the cross\-party Youth Violence Commission \(YVC\), has played a pivotal role in driving major changes to public, private and third sector policies and practices on youth violence. **Irwin\-Rogers’** work for the YVC led to the establishment of regional Violence Reduction Units in England and Wales and has been central in shaping the on\-going work of these units. In addition, acting on **Irwin\-Rogers’** recommendations, Google and the London Violence Reduction Unit have provided grants totalling GBP800,000 to fund *The Social Switch Project,* the primary aim of which is to reduce violence in young people’s lives. This innovative project has delivered safeguarding workshops to over 500 practitioners and provided work experience and skills training in the digital sector to over 40 young people. **Irwin\-Rogers’** research has also had a significant and direct influence on the funding priorities and work of the on\-going GBP200million Youth Endowment Fund.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since taking up his post with The Open University in January 2017, **Irwin\-Rogers** has conducted research into youth violence reduction primarily in England and Wales, focusing in particular on the potential benefits and feasibility of a public health approach. A key strand of **Irwin\-Rogers’** work has been his role as the lead academic for the cross\-party Youth Violence Commission \(YVC\), conducting research alongside economists from the University of Warwick’s Policy Lab. The YVC was established by a cross\-party group of MPs to identify and promote evidence\-based policies aimed at reversing the rising trend in knife crime and serious violence between young people. **Irwin\-Rogers’** research for the YVC has consisted of three main strands: 

1.  <ins>Interviews and Observations with the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit</ins> 

 The Scottish Violence Reduction Unit \(SVRU\) is widely acclaimed for its work in reducing levels of serious violence in major cities such as Glasgow. Between 2017\-18, **Irwin\-Rogers** conducted interviews and observations with senior members of the SVRU, including its Co\-Director and its Co\-Deputy Director. The research indicated that one of the key factors in reducing violence in Glasgow had been a move away from narrow, suppression and enforcement\-based strategies and their replacement with public health approaches, which involve identifying and adopting evidence\-based policies and practices across a wide range of social policy areas including health, education and youth services, driven and coordinated by teams of professionals such as the SVRU **\[O2, O3\]**. 

1.  <ins>National ‘Safer Lives’ Survey on Youth Violence</ins> 

 To address a lack of evidence on the levels of serious violence in young people’s lives, the YVC implemented a national youth survey in January 2018. Designed by **Irwin\-Rogers**, the *Safer Lives* survey gathered evidence on the nature and scope of violence affecting a diverse sample of over 2,000 young people in England and Scotland **\[O2, O3, O6\]**. The data revealed the high rate of violence in the lives of young people below the age of 16, and found that two thirds of respondents had been exposed to serious violence over social media, a finding that both confirmed the significance of social media that **Irwin\-Rogers** had highlighted in previous research **\[O4\]** and informed subsequent YVC recommendations and consequent policy and practice\-based initiatives such as *The* *Social Switch Project* **\[O2, O5\]**. 

1.  <ins>Expert Evidence Sessions</ins> 

 Between October 2017 and May 2018, **Irwin\-Rogers** played a central role in designing, organizing, and conducting six expert evidence sessions on the Parliamentary Estate. **Irwin\-Rogers** sat on panels taking evidence at four of the six sessions, each of which focused on a topic associated with the public health approach to violence reduction. Data was gathered from senior professionals and experts including the Head of the National Crime Agency, a Metropolitan Police Management Board representative, and the editor\-at\-large for The Guardian newspaper. Discussions from each evidence session were fully transcribed and analysed by **Irwin\-Rogers** and used to inform subsequent academic publications **\[O1, O5, O6\]**, as well as the YVC’s interim and final reports **\[O2, O3\]**. The evidence sessions further exposed the limitations of narrow policing\-based approaches to reducing youth violence and highlighted, for example, the importance of nurturing inclusive school environments under the broad scope of holistic public health approaches to violence reduction, overseen and coordinated by regional Violence Reduction Units. 

 <ins>Taking the research forward</ins> 

 **Irwin\-Rogers’** research for the YVC fed into an Open Grant application to the ESRC to build on and enhance some of the YVC’s research, engagement and impact activities. The application was successful, and **Irwin\-Rogers** is now part of a team of researchers \(led by Dr. Alistair Fraser, University of Glasgow\) who have secured GBP870,954.39 for a three\-year project on youth violence reduction which began in December 2020 **\[G1\]**. **Irwin\-Rogers** is leading on the London\-based component of this research, examining policy transfer between jurisdictions and informing the development of effective violence reduction strategies, policies and practices.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Irwin\-Rogers** has supported the Youth Violence Commission as lead academic, playing a central role in each component of its research, outputs, and impact and engagement activities **\[C1\]**. YVC research and reports have played a pivotal role in shaping public, private and third sector policy and practice through numerous channels. 

 <ins>Impact at a National Level</ins> 

 Through a series of meetings with key Government Ministers and other senior officials and debates and questions in the House of Commons, and the YVC has played a central role in shaping national Government policy on reducing violence between young people. 

 On 4<sup>th</sup> May 2018, **Irwin\-Rogers** met with the Prime Minister’s Special Advisor on Home Affairs and Justice at Number 10 Downing Street to discuss the YVC’s interim findings and recommendations **\[C2\]**. Among other things, **Irwin\-Rogers** made the case for tackling high rates of school exclusion and adopting a holistic public health approach to reducing youth violence, overseen and coordinated by regional Violence Reduction Units. In the House of Commons on 16<sup>th</sup> July 2018, the Home Secretary responded to a question from the Chair of the YVC, stating that he would make “ *a commitment to work with the all\-party Parliamentary group*” **\[C3\]**. Within three months, the Home Secretary announced ‘ *new measures’* to build on the Government’s Serious Violence Strategy, pledging his support for a public health approach to tackling youth violence **\[C4\]**. 

 Subsequently, the Chair of the YVC and **Irwin\-Rogers** met with senior government officials including the Minister for London and Policing \(18<sup>th</sup> March 2019\), the Prime Minister \(28<sup>th</sup> March 2019\), the Home Office Minister \(10<sup>th</sup> January 2019\), and the Minister for Schools \(10<sup>th</sup> July 2019\) to obtain high\-level commitment to implementing the YVC’s recommendations **\[C1\]**. In June 2019 the Home Secretary announced GBP35,000,000 funding for the establishment of 18 regional Violence Reduction Units **\[C5\]**. 

 MPs and Lords have formally recognised the work of the YVC and **Irwin\-Rogers’** research 72 times in the two Houses of Parliament **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins>Impact at a Regional Level</ins> 

 The YVC negotiated an exclusive campaign with the London Evening Standard to promote the recommendations of its interim report. Describing the publication as a ‘ *landmark report’*, the paper ran a front\-page article on 18<sup>th</sup> July 2018 aimed at persuading the London Mayor to adopt a holistic public health approach to reducing serious youth violence **\[C7\]**. In the same article, the Chair of the YVC called on the Mayor of London to create a London VRU to oversee the proposed public health approach. In response, the Mayor of London arranged a meeting with the Chair of the YVC on 30<sup>th</sup> August 2018 **\[C8a\]**, before releasing a press release on 19<sup>th</sup> September 2018 announcing his plans to develop and implement an “ *innovative public health approach to tackling violent crime*” **\[C8b\]**. In September 2020, in his 44<sup>th</sup> Report to the London Assembly, the Mayor of London welcomed the “ *many compelling recommendations”* of the YVC final report, and acknowledged that along with the then Home Secretary, he had endorsed and acted on the YVC’s recommended public health approach by establishing the London VRU **\[C9\]**. The YVC has worked closely with the London VRU since its inception and shaped its ongoing work and priorities. The Director of the London VRU said “ *the evidence of the report galvanised the policy agenda around the key wider issues from the role of schools to the importance of the health sector in playing its part. One of the key policies asked from the report was the establishment and long term support for violence reduction units across England and Wales; the Commission was a powerful advocate and used the parliamentary process to argue strongly and successfully*” **\[C10\]**. 

 <ins>Impact on private and third sector policies and practices</ins> 

 Following the publication of a research report on social media and serious violence **\[O4\]**, **Irwin\-Rogers** has participated in numerous private meetings with Facebook \(online\) and Google/YouTube \(London Headquarters\) during the period 2018\-2020 **\[C11\]**. During these meetings, **Irwin\-Rogers** advised on the development and refinement of the platforms’ monitoring and safeguarding policies. **Irwin\-Rogers** also recommended that Google/YouTube should take the lead in establishing social media safeguarding training for professionals working with young people. 

 In December 2018, based on these meetings and **Irwin\-Rogers’** research, Google announced a grant of GBP600,000 to fund the *Social Switch Project* **\[C11\]**. **Irwin\-Rogers** was invited to act as an Advisory Board member for the project and in this capacity has continued to inform its content and delivery **\[C11\]**. The project has three main strands: a series of social media training workshops for frontline professionals working with young people; a programme of work experience in the digital sector for disadvantaged young people; and direct funding to grassroots organisations working with young people. Interim evaluations have shown that the project has delivered highly\-rated social media safeguarding workshops to over 500 practitioners and provided digital skills training and work experience to over 40 young people **\[C12\]**. Among some of the most encouraging findings from an interim evaluation of the project, three young people have subsequently gained employment, two have secured apprenticeships, two have completed internships, seven have completed work experience placements, and another seven have set up their own social media platforms. As a consequence of its positive impact, the London Violence Reduction Unit has allocated an additional GBP200,000 to further support and extend the work of the *Social Switch Project* **\[C11\]**. 

 In October 2018, the then Home Secretary, announced the creation of a new ten\-year, GBP200,000,000 initiative known as the Youth Endowment Fund \(YEF\), the purpose of which is build up an evidence base for effective early interventions, and to fund programmes to steer young people away from crime and violence. The YVC has exerted a significant influence over the YEF’s work since its inception, with the YEF’s Executive Director acknowledging three specific forms of YVC influence and support: i\) the building up of a strong coalition of delivery organisations and politicians with whom the YEF will engage throughout its life cycle; ii\) the identification of key priority areas such as schooling, which will now receive GBP5\-GBP10million of YEF funding; and iii\) the development of a research and practice model that will “ *impact the spend of our entire GBP200m endowment*”. The YEF Executive Director acknowledged the wider impact of the YVC with “ *thanks and acknowledgement of the work that has been done, the direct impact it has on wider society, the youth violence sector, government and the lives of young people”* **\[C13\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr John Oliver’s research into strategic digital transformation was used to inform UK communications policy decisions and regulatory measures on Sky Plc, and contributed to the policy debate that resulted in Ofcom’s new remit as the UK internet regulator. It resulted in significant instrumental and financial benefits for leading media, communications and management consultancies, as well as direct economic impacts, including new jobs and multi\-million\-pound investments made by Tesco, John Lewis and Unilever. 

 The reach of his scenario planning research extends to government agencies and businesses in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan and Liberia, who invested significant resources into capacity building capabilities in strategic communications and new strategy practices. It also contributed to the consulting firm, Bell Pottinger, generating more than GBP3,500,000 in revenue from client fees.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Digitalisation and new media technologies have acted as key drivers of market disruption and the transformational change of media firms. The overarching theme of the research is the ‘management of media firms to include their regulation, strategy practices and performance’ in a digital environment. Two key themes from the underpinning research support the instrumental impact: 

####  Media firms managed the digital transition by adapting strategy and capabilities 

 Research by Oliver \[R1, R2\] presents a pioneering conceptual framework that developed an ‘intellectual bridge’ between the previously discrete fields of media strategy, dynamic capabilities and media firm performance. This provided a more holistic view of strategic transformation and how media firms had navigated a disruptive digital environment by adapting strategy, investing in new capabilities, and the impact of these changes on financial performance. 

 In addition, Oliver and collaborator R. G. Picard \(University of Oxford\) studied a 22\-year period of Sky Plc corporate strategies, and found that it had entered numerous media, telecoms and entertainment markets which had delivered increased competition \[R3\]. The research findings indicated that defining the UK media industry remained a relatively straight\-forward task, which is significant because previous knowledge suggested that digital disruption had created ill\-defined media industry boundaries, thus making policy and regulatory measures more difficult to address. 

 Oliver presented original findings \[R4\] which demonstrated that a transformative digital environment had affected the economic performance of different sub\-industries within UK creative industries. The research also benchmarked employee productivity for the first time, which contributed to the limited knowledge base on industry\-level performance in the creative industries. 

####  Scenario planning helps media firms create strategy in an uncertain digital environment 

 Oliver presented original findings \[R5\] on the usage and satisfaction of the methods that executives used to develop media strategy. The findings add to the limited knowledge on our understanding of how media firms are managed and highlighted significant levels of uncertainty in the UK media industry. It also indicated that media executives were not satisfied with their knowledge and skills in using scenario planning as a tool to develop media firm strategy. Oliver subsequently delivered Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) training in the use of scenario planning with two leading media and communications consultancies, Bell Pottinger and OMD UK, in order to improve their skills and performance. 

 Bell Pottinger used Oliver’s research \[R5, R6, R2\] and CPD training to develop strategic communication capabilities and strategies with government agencies and businesses in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan and Liberia. \(It should be noted that Oliver worked with Bell Pottinger’s ‘Sans Frontières Division’, which was not associated with the firm’s controversial campaign in South Africa.\) 

 The paper by Oliver and OMD UK’s Strategic Partnerships Director Emma Parrett \[R6\] provided empirical findings on the individual and organisational outcomes of using scenario planning to develop media strategies for Google subsidiary YouTube. The research concluded that scenario planning enabled OMD UK executives to make better sense of often conflicting macro\-environmental trends and find more advanced strategic solutions for its clients. The research findings also concluded that as ‘creativity’ is often considered to be an underpinning tenet of successful media firms, this method of scenario planning ‘culturally fitted’ with OMD UK as it combined rigorous strategic analysis with creative thinking in order to deliver a range of strategic media solutions.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Overall, Oliver’s research findings led to a number of significant instrumental and financial impacts in the UK with Ofcom \(the UK’s communications services regulator\), leading media, communications and management consultancies; and outside the UK with government agencies and businesses in the Middle East, Pakistan and Liberia. As a result of his research, Oliver also joined Ofcom’s expert group to measure the BBC’s performance under Public Purpose 3 \(Distinctiveness\). 

####  Impact on UK media regulation 

 Oliver’s research \[R1, R2, R3\] provided insight into how Sky Plc had adapted its media strategy and managed the digital transition. It provided evidence that enabled Ofcom to gain “a unique insight into their strategic approach” and the reasons behind Sky Plc’s growth strategy \[E1\]. 

 Previously, Ofcom had been concerned that Sky Plc were moving towards a monopoly position in the pay\-TV market, but the research findings enabled Ofcom to “think differently about their ‘growth strategy’ and presented them in a different light”. Ofcom used Oliver’s findings to conclude that Sky Plc’s entry into new markets \(broadband, Wi\-Fi, fixed and mobile telephony\) had “contributed to increased levels of competition in those sectors”, which resulted in a policy decision “not to implement more demanding regulatory measures on Sky” \[E1\]. 

 The findings also provided Ofcom with an opportunity to “consider the extent of their remit as a communications regulator, and the potential areas where they could use their expertise in the future”. The findings were used to inform strategic discussions on its \- ultimately successful \- remit on the UK’s “regulation of the internet” \[E1\]. 

####  Impact on firm strategy and resource allocation 

 The Hackett Group is a global management consultancy offering consultancy on digital transformation and firm performance to 97% of the US Dow Jones Industrial Index firms and 59% of the UK’s FTSE 100 firms. Oliver’s research into strategic digital transformation \[R1, R2, R4\] provided “an innovative approach that integrated strategy, firm resource allocation and key performance indicators” \[E2\], which directly influenced the strategic approach to the development of a new digital strategy and analytics service to improve the economic competitiveness of its clients. In particular, the research changed the company’s “strategic approach, particularly in terms of targeting CEOs as well as CFOs with this new consultancy service” \[E2\]. 

 The Hackett Group successfully launched its new consultancy service in 2016, which resulted in significant revenue and profits from consulting fees. The direct economic impact of the research has also resulted in multi\-million\-pound investments made by its clients \(Tesco, John Lewis and Unilever\) into resources and new jobs in digital strategy and analytics departments \[E2\]. 

####  Impact on how firms and government agencies manage strategic uncertainty 

 The findings from the scenario planning research resulted in instrumental and financial impact outcomes for the international media and communications agency, Bell Pottinger. 

 Bell Pottinger used Oliver’s research into strategic media transformations and scenario planning \[R2, R5, R6\] and Oliver’s CPD training on scenario planning in its senior communicators development programme, and wider consultancy projects, for a range of government agencies in the Middle East. Oliver was involved in client briefings, and subsequent Bell Pottinger engagements with government agencies were “based directly” on his scenario planning research \[E3\]. 

 Oliver’s research findings \[R6\] provided clients with a structured and creative approach that resulted in them changing their “ingrained behaviours” \[E3\] and developing adaptive strategies, whilst operating in uncertain working conditions. A former partner at Bell Pottinger stated that Oliver’s scenario planning approach resulted in the firm providing “better client advice and more appropriate strategic responses” \[E3\] and had been used “to launch a new business” \(Special Project Partners Ltd.\), which provides “strategic communication consultancy services to government agencies and multinational firms worldwide” \[E3\]. 

 In 2017, the use of scenario planning contributed to Bell Pottinger generating more than GBP3,500,000 in revenue from consulting fees, whilst its clients made significant investment in new communication resources \[E3\]. The scenario planning research findings were also used to develop flexible strategic responses for a political party in Pakistan and an agri\-business in Liberia \[E3\].

topic we find research that supports and informs business, entrepreneurialism, management as well as research informing public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",11.59,15.04,50.94,22.08,39.8,30.2,41,13,163,67,81,12,189,61,13,1,0.1599173553719008,0.1121742203374856,0.0999999999999999,0.1375578444543961,0.3571428571428571,0.1281765308482866,3681

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The well\-attested decline in numbers choosing languages at GCSE, A Level and in HE, and the lack of a UK languages strategy, reflect the relatively low status of languages with policymakers and the general public. Building on a National Languages Policy Workshop, Ayres\-Bennett and the MEITS team have worked ‘top\-down’ to change both the discourse about language policy and policy itself, through a policy journal, workshops, briefings, expert advice, and training of policymakers. A Pop\-Up World of Languages – designed to change public opinion ‘bottom\-up’ – demonstrates the value and the benefits of language learning through fun activities, especially for young people.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Multilingualism: Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies \(MEITS\) is a multi\-disciplinary, multi\-institution AHRC\-funded research project led by the University of Cambridge \(PI Ayres\-Bennett\). It seeks to demonstrate the value of languages to key social and political issues of our time, and the benefits of speaking more than one language – or of being multilingual. 

 The underpinning research is of two main kinds. Related to the policy work, Ayres\-Bennett has published extensively over a number of years on standardisation, language policy, and linguistic ideology in France, and on the relationship between prescription and usage \( **R1**\). Key insights include the complexity of the relationship between corpus planning, status planning and the implementation of language policy, and the role of ideology and linguistic attitudes in effecting change. Since 2014, this has evolved into research on language policy and theories of language standardisation more generally \( **R2**\); comparison with France has demonstrated the lack of a clear national language strategy, the need for champions both within and without government, and the need for more cooperation and focus across government on language issues \( **R3**\). 

 The editor of *Languages, Society & Policy*, an open\-access journal created as part of MEITS under the direction of Ayres\-Bennett, is Dora Alexopoulou, who researches second language \(L2\) acquisition with a focus on English as a foreign/second language and who has a strong interest in transferring research insights into learning and teaching practice and policy. A central question of her research is how L2 research can best exploit the increasingly larger and richer learner corpora that are becoming available in the era of big data in order to further understanding of second language learning, and, in turn, impact on practice \(e.g. assessment, teaching\) and practical technological innovation, in particular in online language learning. Working with an industrial partner, EF Education First, she has built an open\-access corpus consisting of the writings submitted to the online school of EF from learners from dozens of countries around the world across the proficiency spectrum, facilitating research into learning patterns for learners with different linguistic and socio\-educational backgrounds \( **R4** – winner 2016 Albert Valdman award for outstanding publication in *SSLA*\). 

 The Pop\-Up World of Languages is underpinned by research conducted by members of MEITS. Ayres\-Bennett was responsible for the museum’s overall concept and design \( **R5**\). Examples of underpinning research from the submitting unit include: John Bellamy’s research on notions of correctness and attitudes towards the standard in Luxembourg translated into an activity inviting participants to identify and evaluate people according to their accents and exploring attitudes towards linguistic differences \( **R6**\); Rhiannon McGlade’s research on humour, code\-switching, identity and translation informed an activity looking at loan words in English, which asked visitors to consider whether they were already multilingual \( **R7**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Marrying top\-down and bottom\-up impact is vital, since changes in the status of languages nationally and increased uptake of languages will not occur without the right policy framework, and without public buy\-in on the importance of languages, policies will neither change nor succeed. The 2019 BBC Languages Survey attested to an 18\-year low in language learning in schools, and the decline in languages in HE is well known. Ayres\-Bennett and MEITS have worked to shift the national debate about the value of languages, to raise the profile of languages in policy and the public imagination as previously achieved for STEM, and to bring about changes in public policy. 

 **Top\-down impact on UK language policy** 

 In order to begin tackling the lack of awareness of languages in government, the tendency for civil servants not to recognise the importance of languages in their portfolios and the lack of coordination across government, Ayres\-Bennett has: 1\) created a robust network of policymakers across Whitehall and the devolved governments; 2\) championed the value of languages at the highest levels of government; 3\) produced high\-quality policy documents which are widely cited and used by UK policymakers. 

 In October 2015, Ayres\-Bennett, supported by Cambridge’s Centre for Science and Policy \(CSaP\), organised the **first national languages policy workshop**, co\-chaired with Baroness Coussins **\[Text removed for publication\]**. This broadened the scope of language policy in moving beyond the educational sphere and in including community and indigenous languages. The morning session comprised of presentations from civil servants about language policy from a wide range of ministries and departments, including Defence, Trade and Investment, Hefce, Education \(DfE\), GCHQ, and the three devolved administrations. Over 100 people attended, and a number commented on the value of broadening the discussion beyond Whitehall and, in the words of one respondent, ‘How important it is to change a culture towards the importance of learning and speaking MFL’ \( **E2**, p.1\). The afternoon session \(Chatham House rules\), discussed: 1\) how to promote more strategic thinking about languages in government and ensure greater cross\-department cooperation; 2\) cross\-cutting policy issues including building UK prosperity; security, defence and diplomacy; community and social cohesion; 3\) education policy. In addition to the departments cited above, there were representatives from FCO, Defence Centre for Language and Culture, Business, Innovation and Skills, Ofsted, the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Modern Languages, British Academy \(BA\), as well as researchers. Significantly, most of the policymakers had never met, underlining the event’s convening power, and it was agreed, as a result, to enhance the Cross\-Whitehall language group and to appoint a language champion from the Civil Service **\[Text removed for publication\]**. 

 Following the insights from this workshop, Ayres\-Bennett authored, with support from the Cambridge Public Policy Strategic Research Initiative, a policy brief, **The Value of Languages**, which underlined the need for a cross\-government language strategy and champions, including a Chief Government Linguist. This has been widely cited, e.g. in the House of Lords debate on Languages in the Armed Forces, 27.10.2016 \( **E3**, p.21\); in the House of Commons Briefing Paper: Language Teaching in Schools \(England\), 19.12.2018 and 17.1.2020; and in *Languages in the UK: A call for action from the four UK\-wide National Academies* \(which also cites **R3**\). **\[Text removed for publication\]**. It received press coverage in the *Financial Times*, *Cambridge News* and *Tes* \( **E3**\). 

 Building on this success, **three policy workshops** were co\-organised by Ayres\-Bennett and Janice Carruthers \(QUB, AHRC Modern Languages Leadership Fellow\) on **Community Languages and Social Cohesion** \(Cambridge, Dec 2017\), **Modern Languages Educational Policy in the UK** \(Belfast, Dec 2018\), and **Languages, Business, Trade and Innovation** \(Westminster, Jan 2020\). Each has innovated in bringing together civil servants and researchers, and has achieved significant impact. The second workshop, for example, part of a five\-way collaboration between the AHRC, BA, British Council, UUK, Association of School and College Leaders, offered an innovative comparative perspective on primary and secondary education across the four jurisdictions of the UK, and its recommendations fed directly into their ‘National Languages Strategy: Education and Skills’, published spring 2020 \( **E4**\). Three related **Policy briefings** were published following each workshop \( **E4**\). The second on **Modern Languages Educational Policy in the UK** \(Jan 2019\), has been particularly widely cited, including in the NI and England British Council *Language Trends* 2019 reports, and on the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment website. 

 MEITS, through Stephen Kinnock MP, took the lead in organising an **OWRI event in Parliament** \(28.11.2018\), which had as its key policy ask the need for a Chief Government Linguist, as argued for in the *Value of Languages*. Amongst the audience were two Members of the House of Lords and seven MPs. Following the event, Ayres\-Bennett took the lead in writing to the Cabinet Secretary about the need for a coherent cross\-government languages strategy to build global Britain; **\[Text removed for publication\]**. 

 Impact has been achieved through **CSaP Fellows attached to MEITS**, from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the FCO, DfE, and NI Executive. The Director, Urban Villages & Communities in Transition Division \(NI Executive\) organised a meeting for Ayres\-Bennett and Carruthers with the Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling \(28.1.2019\) \( **E5**\). As a result, Ayres\-Bennett and Carruthers were invited to provide languages awareness training to 16 NI Policy Champions \(25.11.20\). Feedback from the attendees from across Stormont departments was very positive: 90% of those responding to a feedback survey said they were very likely/likely to implement learning from the workshop in their policymaking \( **E5,** p.6\), commenting, for instance, on a new awareness of the importance of home languages. 

 Following a meeting with three colleagues at the Office for National Statistics \(27.7.2019\), Yaron Matras \(Manchester\) and Ayres\-Bennett were invited to provide **expert advice** on the wording for the guidance about answering the language question in the 2021 Census, especially on the question of ‘main language’. Subsequently ‘multiple improvements/corrections’ to the language classification and indexation were made on their advice \( **E6**\). 

 Impact has also been achieved through the MEITS online, **open\-access policy journal, **Languages, Society & Policy** \(Editor Alexopoulou\), which makes language research and its implications for policy accessible to policymakers, stakeholders across the public services and industry and the wider public. Policy papers are authored by academics who explain a piece of their research with derived policy implications and recommendations. The 18 policy papers published as of 2.12.20 are achieving significant global reach with 85,055 unique pageviews, from readers in 216 countries, including the US, India and China, as well as across Europe \( **E7**\). Targeted publicity to stakeholders/policymakers has assured impact: for example, Myles’s paper on primary languages was promoted by the Association for Language Learning \(ALL\) which supports language teachers’ professional development. 

 **Bottom\-up impact on understanding of the value of languages, language learning and engagement with languages through the pop\-up museum of languages** 

 Working with policymakers reinforced the need to change public opinion about the value of languages and improve motivation by demonstrating that language learning is both possible and fun. Since the UK has no museum devoted to languages, despite languages being central to who we are and how we view the world, MEITS designed and ran a **Pop\-Up World of Languages \(PUWL\)**, the first UK languages museum. This comprises 15 activities and games, many of them interactive, of which 10 were researched, designed and produced by the Cambridge team, one each by researchers in the Nottingham, Belfast and Edinburgh partner institutions, and two by projects funded under the MEITS flexible funding scheme. Ayres\-Bennett was responsible for the PUWL’s overall conception and design, liaising with a professional designer, and managing all stages of production. 

 To maximise impact, the activities were refined over a number of iterations, with the Cambridge team piloting their activities at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas \(FoI: Oct 2017, 2018\), Cambridge Ethnic Forum Diversity Day \(Nov 2017, 2018\), and with Year 7\-9 students at Parkside School \(June 2018\). The 230 visitors at the 2017 FoI provided excellent feedback \( **E9**, e.g. ‘it made me think that I shouldn’t be embarrassed about admitting that I can speak another language badly’\), but the majority were adults, already interested in languages. For the 2018 FoI children aged 10\-14 were targeted via schools and community groups, resulting in many more families and young people attending \(total 202\). The feedback was again very positive, one child writing, ‘now I want to learn more languages’. 

 The PUWL itself ran in accessible, ‘non\-threatening’ locations in Cambridge, Belfast, Edinburgh and Nottingham, October\-December 2019 \(a planned ‘pop\-up’ in the Barbican Centre London \(March 2020\) was cancelled due to Covid\-19\). In Cambridge it was in a busy shopping centre, favoured by young people and attracting a different demographic from previous events on university property, including many drop\-in visitors. Promotional material targeted areas of multiple deprivation, and schools visits were organised with free transport provided. **Attendance figures were high, with a total of 3,108 visitors** \(the first figure refers to general visitors, the second to school visits\): Cambridge \(1666, 60\), Belfast \(245, 185\), Edinburgh \(464, 85\), Nottingham \(138, 265\). Visitors were encouraged to contribute to our research by recording the languages they spoke: in Cambridge, 85 different languages were named, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the attendees and their communities. The PUWL featured in the *Times*, *Tes*, and *Independent* \( **E8**\), and interviews with Ayres\-Bennett were broadcast on UCB radio \(25.10.19\) and in Radio Cambridgeshire news bulletins. 

 The PUWL created a space where visitors were able to engage deeply with the concepts of multilingualism and language learning, leading to new discoveries and changed attitudes. For instance, comments in response to a question about how the event changed visitors’ thinking about speaking more than one language included \( **E9**\): ‘I am now inspired to learn a not so popular language and about its culture’ \(p.5\); ‘I had preconceived ideas about languages and being involved in those games/activities changed my perceptions’ \(p.27\). There was clear evidence of stimulating conversations within families and groups and appreciation of the team’s ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘knowledge’, which contributed to transforming the understanding of multilingualism. One team member recorded, ‘A particularly memorable moment for me was speaking to a Finnish\-speaking girl who said she never really wanted to tell her friends before that she spoke Finnish at home with her family because she didn't want to be different, but now she felt it was something she should be more proud of’ \(p.87\). 

 We also collected feedback in Cambridge from the 60 primary and secondary school pupils \(all of whom qualified for pupil premium funding for disadvantaged pupils\). Research shows that lack of access to language learning is particularly acute in areas of relative deprivation, and we identified the PUWL as a way of reaching communities that might otherwise not engage with our work. One primary school pupil wrote that s/he had learnt ‘that languages are so important to so many things’ \( **E9**, p.35\). Importantly, one child saw how languages resonate with their own interests: Today I learnt... ‘that languages can help communicate with your teammates in sports’ \(p.52\). Senior school pupils showed new appreciation of linguistic diversity and its value: Today I learnt... ‘that there are over 7,000 languages in the world and how many people rely on them’ \(p.67\); and of the cognitive benefits of language learning: Today I learnt... ‘that learning a language is like revision for the brain’ \(p.70\). Comments also emphasised the practical benefits of multilingualism for future careers: Today I learnt... ‘what languages are required for certain jobs’ \(p.71\). 

 There is a film about the event \( **E8**\) \(1,799 views as of 3.12.2020\); a sustainable legacy will be achieved through an online games site for the activities, currently under construction. The material is available to take to schools, youth clubs, etc. Ayres\-Bennett has received requests for advice from language researchers in Australia and Germany wishing to run similar projects to the PUWL, many requests for school visits, offers of donations including from ALL and the UK Association for Esperanto, all testifying to the interest it generated.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Functional recovery following paralysing severe spinal cord injuries \(SCI\) has eluded science and medicine for centuries. Research by **Ichiyama** and colleagues has underpinned trials in the USA in humans with severe SCI extending the impact reported in REF2014 \(one individual\) to several people and, importantly, to further functional recovery <ins>\(actual walking</ins>\). Specifically, **Ichiyama** and collaborators used a combination of epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, pharmacological agents and rehabilitation training to enable animals with severe SCI to walk and this provided the essential foundation for translation to humans with severe SCI. These <ins>new</ins> results are unprecedented as this intervention is the first in medical history to restore <ins>walking ability</ins> to people with a paralysing complete SCI. In addition, the combination treatment has enabled these people to regain other bodily functions, including bowel and bladder function. This clinical impact has also generated further increased donations for charities and spurred commercial investments in this technology.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The intervention pioneered by **Ichiyama** gains access to spinal circuits controlling locomotion and restores motor function to animals with a complete spinal cord injury \(SCI\). Following his appointment at the University of Leeds in 2007, **Ichiyama** led the development of a detailed <ins>rehabilitative strategy</ins> in animals **\(R1, R2\),** which involved the combination of three elements \-  epidural stimulation of the spinal cord, daily rehabilitation \(locomotor training\) and the administration of quipazine \(a serotonin agonist\). This work **\(R1, R2\)** was performed in collaboration with researchers at UCLA. This research, which was based on previous proof\-of\-principle experiments, addressed critical issues including whether epidural stimulation was safe, what the effects of different stimulation regimes were on the animals, and the specific combination of stimulation, drugs and rehabilitation training that delivered optimal results. 

 **Ichiyama** and collaborators reported **\(R1, R2\)** that the intervention allowed animals with a severed spine to take weight\-supported steps. They found that epidural stimulation \(50Hz\) of lumbar segment L2 resulted in weight\-supported coordinated plantar stepping in rats receiving a complete spinal transection at thoracic level T9\-10; that intraperitoneal administration of serotonin agonist \(quipazine\) improved functional recovery **\(R1, R2\)**; and that epidural stimulation combined with serotonin agonists significantly improved weight\-bearing stepping **\(R1, R2\)**. The research also demonstrated that walking ability improved markedly when stimulation was combined with a locomotor training regime **\(R1\)**. Daily training using these three interventions resulted in stable and consistent stepping patterns, with increased and coordinated muscle activity. Rats with a complete spinal cord transection trained to step under epidural stimulation and serotonergic agonists developed a movement pattern with a narrower base of support better adapted to cope with the lack of postural control **\(R1\)**. The experiments also demonstrated that applying epidural electrical stimulation daily to the lumbar segments was a safe procedure that could also have further benefits not directly investigated in those studies. For example, a much more efficient recovery of bladder reflexes in treated as compared to non\-treated rats was observed.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In REF2014 we reported translation of Ichiyama’s work to one person, who recovered ability to stand independently.  Here \(REF2021\) we report substantial new impact: for the very first time in medical history, recovery of walking in people with a paralysing SCI was accomplished by using \(implanted\) epidural stimulation by two independent groups **\[A\]**. Another group also using epidural stimulation recently showed recovery of walking in incomplete injury **\[B\]**. No other forms of treatment have ever shown such level of recovery of walking in chronic completely paralysed people. This substantially furthers the impact reported in REF2014 where Ichiyama’s work was translated to one person with severe SCI who recovered independent standing and the ability to voluntarily move the legs when laying down or sitting. 

 As reported in REF2014, **Ichiyama’s** work provided the foundation for the development of the epidural electrical stimulation interventions that have been demonstrated to restore voluntary movement control in people paralyzed by SCI. Specifically, a detailed rehabilitative strategy developed at Leeds from 2007 \(i\) established the effectiveness and safety in animals of a particular regime of epidural stimulation, locomotor training and drugs and \(ii\) provided the necessary foundation and model for translation to humans. Professor V. R. Edgerton \(UCLA\) then took the leading role in translation of the work to humans and achieved the first recovery of standing and voluntary control of movement in a paralysed person using a rehabilitation strategy based on the Leeds’ rehabilitation regime \(Harkema et al., \(2011\) Lancet 377:1938\-47\). That article directly acknowledged the causal relationship between the animal studies \( **R1**\) and the later human work in its opening paragraph: “Adult spinally transected rats can step only with a combination of interventions of locomotor training, pharmacological intervention, and epidural stimulation \(<ins> **Ichiyama**</ins> <ins>et al 2008 \[</ins><ins>ie</ins> <ins> **R1**</ins><ins>\]\)</ins>. This evidence led to the hypothesis that if similar spinal circuits exist in human beings, then electrically stimulating the lumbosacral spinal cord epidurally coupled with intense training could facilitate…” 

 The <ins>new impact</ins> reported for REF2021 \(Fig.1\), substantially extends the number of people who have been treated with this combination approach, and includes people with both complete and partial paralysis. Crucially, it has been shown that this approach furthers **both** the extent of functional recovery \(paralyzed people are now walking and showing other improved bodily functions\) **and** the number of different groups/universities worldwide now successfully using this intervention. The widely publicised success in the first paralysed person to receive this treatment \(original REF2014 impact\) has now been applied to at least 29 more people living with SCI with unprecedented further positive outcomes \(i.e. restoration of <ins>walking</ins>\), in research centres in the USA \(Louisville, Rochester\) \[ **A**\] and Europe \(Lausanne\) \[ **B**\]. 

 <ins>In a significant step from the original 2011 Lancet paper</ins>, in 2018, Angeli et al reported that 4 people with SCI had been treated with the combination of locomotor training and epidural stimulation derived from **R1** and **R2**  **\[A1\].** Two of these participants, who had motor complete injury and were completely paralysed from a cervical or high thoracic SCI, were able to recover independent overground walking \(with only a frame for stability\). The other two participants, also with motor complete types of SCI were also treated and showed recovery of independent standing and some treadmill stepping components \(e.g., stepping with one leg\). <ins>Independently, another group</ins> \(Gill et al 2018\) also reported recovery of independent walking ability in a completely paralysed person with epidural stimulation and locomotor training **\[A2\]**. Prior to this <ins> **no other intervention**</ins> had ever been able to successfully restore walking ability in people with complete paralysis after a severe SCI.

 **Figure 1. Impact map. The impact reported in REF2014 covered translation of Ichiyama’s work to a Case Study reported in the Lancet with recovery of standing. This impact has extended substantially \(REF2021\) in both breadth and reach, with multiple centres now reporting recovery of actual walking.** 

 **Impact on people with SCI** 

 The significance of the human intervention for people with severe SCI is profound. As reported in REF2014, the first person to benefit from the intervention, was a 25\-year\-old man who had been paralysed below the waist. The benefits to this individual have been long term: “ *More than a decade on, he continues to strengthen and expand upon his recoveries*” **\[I\]** 

 Further to this original demonstration, other publications have repeated and extended those results **\[C\]** beyond the impact demonstrated in REF2014. Now, three independent laboratories \(University of Louisville, USA; Mayo Clinic Rochester, USA and University of Lausanne, Switzerland\) have independently reported recovery of walking ability in people with chronic complete and incomplete spinal cord injuries **\[A, B\].** The participant who has regained the most function can walk independently \(2018\) using a walker. She has stated: *“it makes me feel normal again. It makes me feel like I can be an active member of society. ”* **\[D\]** 

 There is significant activity in the new field with several initiatives extending the reach \(more participants\) and breadth \(investigating effects on other bodily functions\). For example, the effects of epidural stimulation on bowel and bladder, sexual and cardiovascular functions have also been reported in USA, Canadian and European clinical settings **\[E\].** In these studies, a total of 29 people living with SCI are reported as being treated, all showed significant improvement and control of the specified function that was the focus of the studies, including cardiovascular, bowel, urinary, sexual and volitional control functions. In some individuals, improvements were found in more than one of these functions following the treatment. In one study, two participants both showed improvements after the treatment – which took place 5 and 10 years after the original injuries. The importance of these results to the individual participants is immense; in addition this approach to treating SCIs is of high value to healthcare practitioners, providing a new and improved way to treat people living with SCI. 

 The health and welfare impacts of Ichiyama’s research have been of enormous significance to the people treated, and the reach of the research’s impact is already developing beyond the immediate clinical setting, as demonstrated by the commercial and public/charitable impacts below. 

 **Commercial Impact:** 

 The commercial medical device sector is investing in technology to support the intervention including established companies in the field and newly created ones. Medtronic devices were used in the currently published reports but those devices were off\-the\-shelf implants specifically designed to treat chronic pain. Significantly, new companies such as Onward \(originally GTX Medical \(Netherlands\) and NeuroRecovery Technologies \(USA\), prior to acquisition by Onward during 2020\)  have entered the market to produce new fit\-for\-purpose implantable electrode arrays **\[F\].** From 2014, at least 32 patents specifically covering epidural stimulation electrodes and technology have been filed by different groups, including GTX Medical, Medtronics and various clinical centres and institutes **\[G\]**. 

 **Impact on the public and charitable organisations:** 

 The breakthroughs based on **Ichiyama’s** work have been widely reported in the academic, medical and mass media and have stimulated interest in the new field **\[D, H\]**. Charities focussed on SCI have reported that the successful outcomes have “further fueled ES research in laboratories and clinics around the globe” and “Donors, active and potential, are excited by the prospect of a therapy” **\[I\]**. This interest has directly affected the number of research grants funding investigations on epidural stimulation for recovery of function **\[J\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Benjamin Noys coined the term ‘accelerationism’ in 2010 to define and challenge a way of thinking that expresses the desire to escape the insecurity of work by integrating humans with technology. Since its coinage, accelerationism has initiated significant global debate, informing and catalysing a new cultural movement. Noys, a major critic of the contemporary resurgence of accelerationism, has produced the first comprehensive survey of its historical iterations. This research has transformed public debate by revealing the dangers and seduction of accelerationism, challenging popular cultural fantasies of integration with the technological, and criticising how accelerationism treats issues of social and technological change as artistic rather than as social and political. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Noys first defined the term accelerationism in his monograph *The Persistence of the Negative: A Critique of Contemporary Continental Theory* \(2010\) \[ **R1**\], in particular as a criticism of philosophical positions of the 1970s that aimed to accelerate market forces in contemporary capitalism to push capitalism into crisis. This research has since resulted in the widespread circulation of the term, from blog debates in which Noys participated, to mainstream media discussion. Accelerationism became the first theoretical movement to fully embrace social media and was claimed by the political left in 2013 by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams in their ‘\#Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’ \(available  [here](https://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/)\) as a positive programme for accelerating technological change. 

 In response, Noys published the book *Malign Velocities: Accelerationism and Capitalism* with Zero Books in 2014 in their series of critical interventions for a wider intellectual public \[ **R2**\]. The book opposed the adoption of accelerationism as a positive term. Noys argued that while accelerationism drew attention to the insecurity of contemporary work, it nonetheless still treated that problem as susceptible to a technological solution – a notion that can lead towards exclusionary political and aesthetic practices. David Cunningham, in *Radical Philosophy* 191 \(2015\), writes how ‘the excellent *Malign Velocities*, …, while directly engaging Williams and Srnicek’s appropriation of his originally critical term in its conclusion, can also be read as offering a certain prehistory of its own’. *Malign Velocities* provided a critical prehistory of accelerationism by tracing the desire to escape the insecurity of work through integration with the machine and the technological in the avant\-garde and revolutionary moments of the twentieth century, from the Italian Futurists to techno dance music. This integration of human and machine, Noys argued, failed fully to grasp the problem of work insecurity, and instead produced cultural fantasies of speed dependent on a masculine conception of the ‘hard’ body. In contrast, Noys proposed, it was vital to address these fantasies politically through a conception of democratic and collective engagement with technology. 

 In tandem with the impact work detailed below, Noys also developed academic research using accelerationism as a critical heuristic to analyse cultural forms and representations of contemporary politics, popular culture, and art. This included exploring unmanned aerial vehicles \(drones\) as sites of real and imaginary fusions between humans and lethal technologies of violence \[ **R3**\], criticising the embrace of drugs as a means to accelerate experience by contemporary theorists \[ **R4**\], and considering how Britain’s decision to leave the European Union \(‘Brexit’\) was conditioned by a fantasy of escaping European inertia and embracing an accelerated modernity \[ **R5**\]. This last strand of research is continuing to explore far\-right appropriations of technology and acceleration for a future project. Finally, Noys has returned to consider accelerationism as a cultural movement, arguing that it is best understood primarily as an aesthetic phenomenon \[ **R6**\]. It is not only that accelerationism is influential among artists, but that accelerationism is itself a turning of politics into art that disables critical understanding in exchange for cultural celebration of technology and speed. Noys’s research demonstrates how literary and theoretical research is not detached from the real world, but vital for grasping the central role cultural fantasies play in framing contemporary anxieties concerning technological and social change.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Noys’s research has been a critical voice at the centre of the global debate on accelerationism since Noys defined the term in his research monograph *The Persistence of the Negative* in 2010 \[ **R1**\]. This definition was already informed by blog debates in which Noys participated and this has been public research both in conception and in process. In his 2017 ‘long read’ on accelerationism for *The Guardian* \(6 mentions; 3,686 online views; average print circulation of 114,168\) \[ **C1**\], Andy Beckett points out the central role of Noys’s research \[ **R1** and **R2**\] in launching and shaping the debate: ‘The label has only been in regular use since 2010, when it was borrowed … by Benjamin Noys, a strong critic of the movement.’ Noys’s research is confirmed as the origin of accelerationism in a 2016 article in *The New Statesman* \(1 mention, average print circulation of 36,591\) \[ **C2**\]. Noys developed the critical public intervention *Malign Velocities* \(2014\) \[ **R2**\], published in the Zero Books series defined by Mark Fisher as offering ‘another kind of discourse – intellectual without being academic, popular without being populist’. *Malign Velocities* has since sold over 4,000 copies \(as of 10 February 2020\) \[ **C3**\], been translated into Spanish, and been widely reviewed in both academic and non\-academic outlets \[ **R2**\]. Noys’s research also explored the resonances and circulations of accelerationism, especially as they have taken place in political debates about technology \[ **R4**\], in popular culture \[ **R2**\], and among artists \[ **R6**\]. Without Noys’s research and interventions, accelerationism would have been uncritically celebrated as offering technological solutions that have at their heart problematic gendered cultural fantasies of speed and the machine. 

 **Impact on Political Debates** 

 In a series of public interventions, Noys's research has significantly influenced popular political debates, demonstrating how accelerationism offers a politics that is both too reliant on technology and that fails to consider the need for public debate and collective action. Peter Robson, in the Australian online\-review and weekly newspaper for environmental activists, *Green Left* \(13 November 2017\), summarises how *Malign Velocities* goes beyond accelerationism and the alternative counter\-movements that call us to slow down, ‘in favour of \[a\] more nuanced approach, an approach that is more fundamentally political’ \[ **C4**\]. This political approach makes the insecurity of work central to the debate around accelerationism and criticises accelerationist claims that integrating humans with technology will resolve that insecurity \[ **R2** and **R3**\]. The impact of these arguments has been explored in the Royal Society of Arts podcast ‘The Seductive Dangers of Speed’ on Resonance FM, a 24\-hour London radio station with a core audience of 500,000 \(9 July 2017\); in public debate and discussion with the theorist Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi at the Institute of Contemporary Arts \(the  [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMzfW15ZRVA) has 7,200 views \(June 2019\)\); and in debate with the leading proponents of accelerationism at the Kaai Theatre in Brussels \(22 October 2016\) at a live\-streamed event \(video available  [here](https://www.kaaitheater.be/en/articles/video-faster-slower-future-4)\). In each case, Noys’s research has offered a political understanding of the shaping effects of work and labour as crucial problems obscured by accelerationism. 

 **Impact on Popular Culture** 

 Noys’s research has established the cultural dimension of accelerationism, especially as it is expressed in cultural fantasies of integration with the machine. *Malign Velocities* has featured as a source for Ales Kot’s graphic novel *Material* \[ **C5**\], published in 2015 by Image Comics, one of the world’s largest graphic novel publishers. The graphic novel explores contemporary anxieties surrounding the ‘war on terror’ and digital surveillance, citing *Malign Velocities* as a critical interrogation of technological speed. The writer and graphic novelist Warren Ellis, whose work explores technological and human fusions, described *Malign Velocities* as ‘a superb and largely non\-technical exploration of a very interesting space’, and accelerationism as a ‘as Science Fiction Condition philosophical enterprise’ \[ **C6**\]. Noys was invited to present research challenging the accelerationist assumption that techno music is simply the expression of its cultural fantasies at the Nordberg Techno Festival, Sweden \(28 July 2017\), an event held at a former factory site, and at the ’Digging the Global South’ Symposium and Music Festival, Akademie der Künste der Welt, Cologne \(2 November 2017\). 

 **Impact on Artistic Practice** 

 Noys’s critique of accelerationism has been richly explored within the arts and artistic practice. Dan Byrne\-Smith \(Whitechapel Gallery\) writes: ‘Benjamin Noys's original work in *Malign Velocities* on the concepts of accelerationism and 'cyberpunk futurism' have been widely influential on a new generation of contemporary artists today and are an indispensable contribution’ \[ **C7**\]. Professor Fred Turner, discussing *Malign Velocities* in *Public Books* \(9 January 2016\), points out that ‘Noys is not content to attack accelerationism as a philosophy. He also takes its aesthetics to task’, which is ‘a fantasy of becoming one with machine systems, of giving over their agency and taking pleasure in complete submission’ \[ **C8**\]. The  [award\-winning](http://www.deankenning.com/info.html) artist Dean Kenning’s cover image for *Malign Velocities*, inspired by the book’s critique of accelerationist aesthetics, has become a signature image in accelerationist discourse. *Malign Velocities* has also ‘continued to inform’ Kenning’s artistic practice in a broader sense, in media as diverse as anti\-techno\-utopian  [kinetic sculpture](https://www.mattsgallery.org/artists/kenning/KenningPoster.pdf), and images and animations he has contributed towards the  [Capital Drawing Group](http://bergenassembly.no/contributors/capital-drawing-group/) \[ **C9**\]. The independent curator and designer Benjamin Fallon has described Noys ‘as a marked influence on a younger generation of artists who are thinking through our implication with technology—providing an important critical ballast to the more breathless embrace of other thinkers’ \[ **C10**\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This project has directly transformed the lives of over 60 people born to black GIs and British women in World War II. These mixed\-race Britons were interviewed, and their histories presented on radio, television, in a book, articles and two exhibitions. Telling their stories \(of racism, the stigma of being illegitimate, racial confusion and a lack of belonging\) and being helped to find US relatives has increased their sense of belonging and enriched their lives. Many have met each other through the project, thereby giving them a sense of community. Their narrated stories have also changed public understanding of this largely unknown recent history. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 During World War II, of the 3,000,000 American GIs stationed in Britain, approximately 8% were African\-American. The latter’s relationships with British women resulted in the birth of an estimated 2,000 mixed\-race offspring, labelled ‘brown babies’ by the African\-American press. As the black population of Britain in the 1930s was 7,000\-8,000, these 2,000 children born over three years represented a 25% rise in British people of colour. Black GIs, in the then segregated US Army, were generally forbidden by their \(white\) commanding officers to marry their white girlfriends. Nearly half of the mothers of these babies, faced with the stigma of illegitimacy and a mixed\-race child, placed their children in children’s homes. However, few were adopted as adoption societies would not take a ‘half\-caste’ on their books, deeming them ‘too hard to place’. There has been minimal study of these children and the difficulties they faced, such as racism, lack of a father or a clear identity. Bland’s project is the first to undertake an in\-depth study of these ‘children’ \(now in their 70s\) drawing upon over 60 first\-hand accounts – oral histories – that chart and historically contextualise this important, but hitherto neglected, aspect of black history and of World War II, in terms of the period’s practices and beliefs concerning race, prejudice, illegitimacy, government policy and child welfare. 

 Bland was the sole researcher. She received a British Academy/Leverhulme small research grant for September 2015 \- December 2016 for travel and transcription. This enabled the employment of professional transcribers for the interviews and allowed the tapes to be edited for storage at the Black Cultural Archives \(BCA\) where they can be accessed by the public. 

 Key findings of her research include realisation of some of the difficulties faced by these children: illegitimacy; for those placed in homes, little likelihood of adoption; for all the children an extreme sense of difference, isolation, experience of racism and lack of role models, especially given that the vast majority of these children were growing up in predominantly ‘white’ geographical areas; very little knowledge as children of their fathers, giving a strong desire to find their ‘origins’; a sense of self\-worth if and when they found birth fathers or US relatives. Also discovered were the extreme difficulties facing the mothers of these children. Key publications disseminating this work are listed below, the main one being <ins>Reference</ins> <ins>3</ins>. <ins>Reference</ins> <ins>1</ins> considers the British Government’s ambivalence about these children being mixed\-race and half\-American, <ins>Reference</ins> <ins>2</ins> highlights the bravery of the mothers who kept their children, <ins>Reference 4</ins> focuses on the children’s search for their fathers’ roots.

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bland’s research has been extensively disseminated. Her book *Britain’s ‘Brown Babies’* has sold over 2,000 copies, in hardback and on Amazon Kindle. An exhibition, created by Bland with the support of a designer, was launched at the Black Cultural Archives \(BCA\) in November 2019, funded by a small grant from the *Being Human Festival*. It then started a tour of the country, but given Covid\-19, it was exhibited only in London and Manchester, November 2019 – March 2020. Footfall at the BCA, Brixton, where the exhibition was situated for 2 weeks, was c.800 a week; Church Street Library, Edgware, where it went next for 2 months, had c.1,800 a week, while Manchester Central Library, where it was for 2 months until lockdown, has approximately 2,000,000 visitors a year, so a footfall of c.38,000 a week. The exhibition, along with certain oral histories and new material from others who have approached Bland, was then greatly expanded and uploaded onto the digital website Mixed Museum in September 2020 \( [https://www.mixedmuseum.org.uk/brown\-babies](https://www.mixedmuseum.org.uk/brown-babies)\). By late December the online exhibition had had 1,120 visitors. On request, Bland and the Mixed Museum wrote an article for the Museum Association and a blog about the exhibition for The National Archives in December 2020. The museum’s profile is expanding through Twitter, Facebook and YouTube:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuPWq3Glb6D5VJTgZx1Odg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuPWq3Glb6D5VJTgZx1Odg). 

 In addition, the research has been disseminated through 50 talks \(to universities, libraries, museums, government departments, community groups\), 30 local, national and international radio and television programmes \(including the BBC’s Woman’s Hour, with an audience of 4 million\) and articles, including in *The Conversation*, May 2019 \(with over 66,000 reads and republished by Scroll.in\) and *BBC History Magazine*, August 2019 \(with a 98,000 readership\). A Channel 4 documentary with Wall\-to\-Wall production company will appear in 2021, currently delayed by Covid\-19. 

###  Beneficiaries 

1.  The mixed\-race GI babies whose stories were recounted in one\-to\-one interviews with Bland. 

1.  23 people not in the book but themselves mixed\-race GI babies who have contacted Bland on hearing of the project. 

1.  A wider public, in the UK, Ireland, Europe, US and Australia, who, in exhibition surveys, relate how they have now learnt about a new aspect of Black British history. 

### 1.  In what ways did the GI babies benefit? 

###  *Narrating personal stories* 

 Bland’s interviewees/participants benefitted greatly through the cathartic process of telling their stories. Since everything written about each interviewee was shown to them for their approval, they feel a real stake in the final product. To quote one: ‘I have an official history, as a member of a collective, and as a person of indeterminate, hybrid ethnicity. It also feels good to have an opportunity to contribute my small piece in the telling of that story…I feel like I belong here in the UK just that little bit more.’ Another wrote: ‘I can't thank you enough. It feels like vindication for what was a difficult start in life. My grandchildren will read it one day and hopefully learn about how it was in the words of us who lived it. If I could have put into words what I hoped for at the end of my life it would have been a book that told my story \- you did that.’ There are at least twenty such testimonials \(<ins>source 1</ins>\). 

###  *Creating a Sense of Community* 

 At the book launch in June 2019 there were over 160 people present, including many of the interviewees, and their families. Two participants gave speeches, one declaring: ‘It was a tonic for me to talk to someone who really wanted to know about me and how my life had been.’ Another summed up the main effects of the book on his life: ‘Catharsis, tears, healing and empowerment.’ \(<ins>source 1</ins>\). At this launch they formed a private Facebook group: ‘Britain’s “Brown Babies”’. Membership of this group is growing as Bland directs new contacts to it. It is a forum for sharing stories, photographs and meeting each other and is seen by its 50 participants as hugely valuable. For example, one wrote: ‘It is so comforting to know that we all share very similar experiences which until now we could not express. I am sure most of us felt alone in our anguish of those early days.’ \(<ins>source 2</ins>\). This growing community of self\-defined ‘brown babies’ is an important aspect of the project’s impact. 

###  *Finding relatives via DNA* 

 There are also the benefits of DNA testing, which have led to a greater sense of belonging and racial pride. When Bland first interviewed her participants, many said they knew little or nothing about their fathers, often not even a name. She encouraged them to undergo a DNA test then join the free organisation GI Trace \(an on\-line self\-help group that traces GI relatives\) and seek the advice of a freelance DNA researcher. The researcher has so far helped 13 of Bland’s interviewees. To quote her testimonial: ‘Without a doubt finding American birth families has changed people’s lives.…There is a common phrase used by many people…: “thank you, you have given me my roots”. Without Lucy referring these people and many others to me they would not have found their American families.’ \(<ins>source 3</ins>\). One recently found his half\-sister and commented: ‘the Brown Babies’ story is still unfolding, even as we speak. It's so important to know where you come from. It can mean so much to so many people.’ \(<ins>source 2</ins>\) 

### 1.  Those ‘brown babies’ not in the book 

 There are a further 23 ‘brown babies’ that Bland has come to know about since the publication of her book, many of whom approached her, delighted that ‘their’ story was at last being told. For example, one wrote: ‘Thank you for writing this book. It describes a part of Britain’s social history that was almost lost and here, thankfully, is recovered. The story you tell speaks directly and personally to me in a way that other race\-related social research has never done. I too was one of the “brown babies”. I am utterly amazed by the insight that your book gives me into my own experience.’ \(<ins>source 4</ins>\). Nine of these ‘brown babies’ have had their stories added to the new digital exhibition. 

### 1.  Raising awareness in the wider public 

 The wider public has benefitted from hearing about the research, learning about an unknown aspect of British black history, history of World War II and the post\-war childcare system \(<ins>sources 5\-10\)</ins>. <ins>Source 8</ins> gives feedback from the online exhibition in the form of surveys. Asked in the survey what they took away from the exhibition, one wrote: ‘The truth of our ""official"" histories hides in the stories people don't tell \- because we don't ask. Stories, questions, wonder \- they all take time, time we think we don't have. Thanks so much for asking the questions, taking the time, sharing the stories. My aunt, who survived Auschwitz, only told her own story after seeing *Schindler's List*. I hope others will be inspired to ask more questions, and to hear more stories. Thank you, thank you.’ Another commented: ‘The powerful nature of the personal stories which are so moving and also the amazing power of old photographs when well explained and contextualised. A really engaging exhibition \- full of life, and in turns poignant, sad and at times joyful.’ Another plans to share: ‘the whole exhibition. It's absolutely fascinating. I love the use of images and oral testimony. The impact of these resources is incredibly powerful.’ The exhibition is explicitly encouraging the writing of a ‘Responses’ section, a resource which is contributing further to the exhibition, and creating a new archive for other researchers, as is substantiated by <ins>source 9</ins>. A museum in Norfolk, Ancient House Museum, has used the findings from the book and the online exhibition in their educational programme with schools \(<ins>source 10</ins>\). 

 The research has made a very distinctive, tangible contribution to the lives of the ‘brown babies’, giving them a sense of well\-being, community \(ever\-growing as more find the Facebook group and the online exhibition\), empowerment and knowledge of their heritage. It has also made an important contribution to popular historical knowledge about the plight of these children and a new dimension to the history of World War II. The product of Bland’s research is innovative in creating a self\-sustaining community of participants which will last well beyond the end of the research project.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Liverpool Hope University has significantly increased awareness and understanding of environmental hazards in Malta, by changing and creating a cultural preparedness for hazard events at a national level. Tangible benefits are evidenced in greater stakeholder collaboration amongst national decision\-making bodies. Stakeholders are now actively seeking input and advice at different levels from the local to the national government. This has resulted, not only in an increased recognition of the importance of hazard education and training amongst the population, but also and more specifically amongst the transient tourist population upon which Malta’s economy is heavily dependent. 
","
### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research on hazard awareness in Malta has been undertaken since 2016, though underpinning research for this strand builds upon interdisciplinary research interests from researchers in the Department of Geography and Environmental Science leading back to 2003. 

 Four main themes underpin this research: 

 \(a\) **vulnerability and culture**, addressing human agency and responses to hazards; 

 \(b\) **hazard exposure in coastal locations**, identifying the vulnerability of the island nation; 

 \(c\) the **tourism industry in Malta**, recognising the importance of the tourism for the economy; 

 \(d\) and **stakeholder networks and engagement**, exploring key power relations and decision\-making. 

 Initially the research was informed by Professor Chester’s long\-standing expertise in vulnerability research in hazard exposed areas with a strong focus on human response to such events. Subsequently, the research has changed to incorporate a greater focus on Drs Kennedy and Crawford’s expertise in stakeholder engagement in tourism destinations and natural hazards in Malta. It further draws on the expertise of research collaborators at the University of Malta, specifically Professor John Schembri and Dr Ritienne Gauci. 

 Key findings include: 

 **\(a\) The role of indigenous knowledge on island vulnerability and culture** 

 Indigenous and local knowledge and their importance in disaster risk reduction \(DRR\) and preparedness frameworks have been studied widely, with Professor Chester focusing on human responses to disasters in Italy \(Sicily\) and the Azores \[R2\]. The research highlights the importance of acknowledging human agency in, and cultural understanding of, how natural hazards affect resident populations, whilst at the same time building a culture of resilience \[R1, R4\]. 

 **\(b\) Natural hazard exposure \(Malta\)** 

 Though perceived to be a non\-disaster\-prone destination, Malta is hazard exposed because of the impacts of volcanic eruptions \(volcanic ash from neighbouring Mount Etna\), earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, flash floods and slope failure \[R4\]. Due to the small size of Malta, much of the critical and tourism infrastructure is located in coastal areas, increasing the vulnerability of the islands should a disaster occur. Preparedness for disasters is currently ‘siloed’ in Malta, with different government departments and the civil protection authorities being involved in the development of disaster risk reduction \(DRR\) frameworks \[R1, R4\]. 

 **\(c\) The changing nature of tourism and changing tourists in Malta** 

 Malta has undergone a number of changes with respect to the development of tourism, moving away from traditional mass tourism, to more varied \(post\-mass\) forms of tourism. Increasingly there is a focus on niche markets. This shift has been evidenced in the work of Speake & Kennedy \[R5, R6\], outlining a clear migration of Malta’s tourism policy focused on niche markets and higher spending tourists. Evidently, Malta’s strategy has been successful with a thriving and growing tourism industry \(reached 2.8 million tourists in 2019\), yet communication between the major tourism industry players and the Maltese Government, and vice versa, is underdeveloped \[R1\]. 

 **\(d\) Understanding stakeholder engagement in networks in the tourism industry** 

 Stakeholder networks are dynamic and flexible, often resulting in changed networks over time which are based on stakeholder interests and role sets \[R3\]. In the tourism industry, stakeholder engagement can be particularly difficult to monitor and sustain, due to shifting power relations and relevant interests of stakeholders. Ensuring true engagement is achieved, stakeholders from all levels \(local to national\) have to be included in decision\-making, especially in policy environments \[R1\], where stakeholder engagement can contribute to improved destination leadership and resilience \[R1, R3\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Two conference workshops \(February 2018 and February 2019\) were held in Floriana, Malta, entitled *“Hazard awareness and vulnerability of tourism destinations in the Maltese Islands”*. 

 The purpose of the conference workshops was to present research into hazard exposure of the Maltese Islands to attendees and to then discuss the research presentation in workshops, which included focus groups and hazard mapping exercises. Overall, 20 stakeholders ranging from scientific academics, private sector, government organisations/ministries and NGOs contributed. 

 The research emerging from the conference workshops has created impact under the following four headings: 

 I1 \- creation of a national Tsunami Advisory Board 

 I2 \- improved communications amongst different levels of government with regards to disaster risk reduction \(DRR\) frameworks 

 I3 \- hazard awareness training to be included in educational establishments and tourism industry 

 I4 \- greater stakeholder collaboration between different sectors 

 **I1 \- creation of a national Tsunami Advisory Board** 

 From a policy dimension, the research has resulted in two members \(Professor Schembri and Dr Gauci\) of the wider research project team from the University of Malta, being invited to be part of a national Tsunami Advisory Board, which is coordinated by the Director of the Civil Protection Department \(CPD\) \[S1, S6\]. Following the conferences in 2018 and 2019, the Tsunami Advisory Board was set up in 2019 to help support and facilitate the work of the CPD in relation to tsunami preparedness and to form part of a scientific advisory team. Professor Schembri and Dr Gauci were invited as a direct result of the conference workshop, due to their scientific expertise \[R1, R4\]. 

 **I2 – improved communications amongst different levels of government with regards to disaster risk reduction \(DRR\) frameworks** 

 A consequence of the conference workshops has been improved communications amongst stakeholders from different organisations \(private sector, national government\) and specifically the sharing of resources related to hazards and early warning systems, such as the use of *Meteoalarm* \(Europe’s web\-based weather service\) on tourist facing websites \[S7\]. Following the 2018 conference, the Malta Tourism Authority \(MTA\) \[S7\] considered to broaden out training for MTA staff to focus more closely on environmental and coastal developments and weather\-related hazards. Improved communication, as well as an awareness of the remits of other entities, can help break down the ‘silos’ in DRR research in Malta as identified in R1. For example, the Head of the Marine and Storm Water Unit \(Ministry for Transport, Infrastructure and Capital Projects, Malta\) \[S4\] noted \(following 2019 conference\): 

 “*Our organisation is mostly involved in public works interventions related to marine and stormwater structures in Malta. Lately we have become very much involved in issues related to hazards related to coastal erosion mostly along the rocky formations along our coastline. Your presentations were mostly related to the relations between natural hazards and the tourist industry. In a way, your presentations, opened up a new perspective at how we should view our work* \[sic\].” 

 **I3 – hazard awareness training to be included in educational establishments and tourism industry** 

 One of the biggest impacts has been awareness raising of hazards events on Malta, with a particular focus on the tourism population. The Gozo Catholic Diocese have used the information from the conferences to implement staff awareness training with a focus on staff in tourist\-facing roles and visitor attractions \(churches/citadella\) \[S5\]. Furthermore, influenced by the researchers, a greater awareness of hazards has led to a cultural shift amongst Maltese stakeholders. For example, it has been recognised that it is important and necessary to integrate hazard awareness training into education, not only in schools but also in pre\-schools/nurseries and day\-care centres for the older generation. One measurable impact has been the translation of fire hazard education into kindergartens and primary schools by the CPD. Tailored educational materials/handouts for students were rolled out in September 2019 \[S1\]. 

 **I4 – greater stakeholder collaboration between different sectors** 

 The conference workshop has had a direct impact on stakeholder recognition of natural hazards on Malta as a national rather than local impact, requiring a greater collaboration amongst stakeholders in managing this risk in terms of preparedness and response \[S2, S3, S4\]. An additional dimension has been the recognition of the impact of the Covid\-19 pandemic on the need for better preparedness by the Maltese Civil Protection Department \(CPD\), which will be reflected on and researched by the CPD post\-pandemic \[S8\]. 

 From a tourism perspective, the researchers have induced a cultural change in stakeholders in recognising the vulnerability of the tourist population, particularly of those using individual \(e.g. Airbnb\) rather than collective accommodation \[S3\]. Individual accommodation is a growing sector in Malta and has resulted in stakeholders perceiving tourists in such individual accommodation as ‘being part of the neighbourhood’. A direct impact of the research has been the recognition that vulnerable tourists cannot be ignored or become the *de facto* ‘responsibility’ of local people, particularly if communication networks are interrupted. Tourists would then not have access to appropriate information but would be reliant on educated local residents in the event of a disaster \[S2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Lewis has played a central role in transformation of the protection available to whistleblowers nationally and internationally. In the 2014\-20 period this research further raised the public profile of whistleblowing, including via the International Whistleblowing Research Network hosted by Lewis at Middlesex, to produce two areas of impact. First, through *changing employer practice on whistleblowing in large public and private sector employers,* including the NHS and Irish Garda. Here, the introduction of codes of practice directly drawing on Lewis’ work shifted mechanisms of corporate and organisational accountability in respect of whistleblowing and improved employment protection for millions of workers. Second, evidence\-led *reshaping of legislation to protect whistleblowers internationally* resulted from Lewis’ work, informing the conceptualisation and drafting of whistleblowing law and policy. Notably this included the development of a new EU directive in 2019, covering not only the 27 EU member states of the EU but also influencing legislative development across a wider number of Council of Europe countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to the whistleblowing research undertaken at Middlesex University Business School during the 1990s, little scholarly interest had been shown in whistleblower protection. Researchers at Middlesex in the field of employment relations \(Lewis, Sargeant\) collaborated with staff in the Law School \(Barrett, Homewood\) initially in relation to employment protection for environmental whistleblowers. With publication of his edited volume Whistleblowing at Work in 2001, Lewis led the development of a body of research published across business ethics, employee relations and law journals, which clarified and defined both the principles on which whistleblowing statutes are founded in different countries, and the essential practical features of whistleblowing policies and procedures. This research has raised understanding of the importance of protection of whistleblowers nationally and internationally, with research findings making major contributions to promoting employer good practice and shaping the development of government legislation and guidelines. 

 *\(1\) Improving employer practice and understanding whistleblowers* 

 Empirical research into employer practice in relation to whistleblowing began with projects funded by the Employers Organisation for Local Government and the Nuffield Foundation. This focused on public sector whistleblowing procedures and then developed in relation to the practice of FTSE top 250 companies via major surveys funded by the British Academy \(2007\) and Sai Global \(2010\). 

 On the basis of this expertise, in 2014 the UK Department of Health commissioned Lewis to conduct quantitative research for the independent *Freedom to Speak Up* \(FTSU\) review of the NHS chaired by Sir Robert Francis. Findings showed defects in existing NHS procedures as regards encouraging whistleblowing and handling reports of wrongdoing and identified preferred mechanisms for both staff and employers in improving practice \[1\]. A quarter of survey respondents did not know whether or not their employer had a confidential reporting procedure. Where staff were aware of procedures, a lack of trust in the system and fear of victimisation hindered reporting. When concerns were raised, 20% of respondents indicated they were then ignored by management and 17% actively victimised by management. The research evidenced that those who did follow their employer's procedure when raising a concern had better outcomes, and identified measures to make it more likely that workers would raise concerns. These included an ability to raise a concern anonymously, an undertaking by the employer to protect a person’s identity, and the presence of an independent person or organisation to receive information about concerns staff wished to raise; aspects of good practice equally applicable to both public and private sectors. 

 Further research into institutional frameworks for protecting whistleblowers and responding to their concerns, explored the roles that trade unions might adopt in order to improve responsiveness in the whistleblowing process \[2\]. This research demonstrated a key role for trade unions in negotiating whistleblowing procedures, advising and representing their members, and raising collective concerns on behalf of the workforce, as well as in ensuring that proven wrongdoing was rectified and whistleblowers did not suffer retaliation. Research from the employee perspective studied the motivation to whistleblow and the impacts on the whistleblower. Findings identified key factors influencing the decision to whistleblow, especially morality and emotion, and the demonstrable effect of perceived negative consequences on the intention to whistleblow. Study of the costs on whistleblowers in terms of their jobs, economic security, physical health and mental well\-being, demonstrated negative health effects, and the implications of this for whistleblower protection \[3\]. 

 *\(2\) Whistleblowing legislation and enforcement* 

 Following initial research from 2001 into the position of whistleblowing in relation to employment and discrimination law within the UK, Lewis pioneered comparative research into statutory provisions for whistleblowing and their effect in Australia, the US and UK \(2004\), developed further through studies in South Africa \(with Uys, 2007\) and Norway \(with Trygstad, 2009\). This research demonstrated how national legislation on disclosure reflected different labour relations systems and democratic values, and the importance of enforcing statutory whistleblowing protection via an accessible legal system. In the UK, Lewis’s comprehensive analysis of the effects of 20 years of legislation showed the limited objectives of the legislation, its restricted personal and material scope, its complex requirements, and inadequate mechanisms for obtaining redress following victimisation. 

 Research into the relationship between employment law and other civil law jurisdictions clarified the interplay between whistleblowing and defamation. This demonstrated that defamation laws exposed whistleblowers to redress from persons innocently, but falsely, accused of wrongdoing, and argued whistleblowers should have absolute rather than qualified privilege if they made a protected disclosure \[4\]. Findings highlighted the unique role whistleblowers play in struggles against corruption and labour market abuses, where detection and enforcement are difficult. The lack of an effective labour inspectorate in the UK meant enforcement authorities relied on information about wrongdoing supplied by individual workers, as well as trade unions, competing employers and the public \[5\]. 

 A critical review of international official guidelines on whistleblowing procedures produced by Lewis and Vandekerckhove \(2012\) examined the principles on which legislation should be based and what constituted good management practice. Lewis subsequently developed this analysis to set out the case for a specific EU Directive on whistleblowing, showing the value of such a Directive in getting Member States to first base in whistleblowing arrangements and encouraging other countries to do likewise. This also argued that to achieve best practice in legislative provision, Member States would need to go beyond the minimum standards specified in the Directive \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Lewis’ research has raised the public profile of the significance of whistleblowing, highlighting the public interest in encouraging whistleblowing and showing that this interest cannot be adequately protected by general employment measures. Dissemination and review of specialist findings via the *International Whistleblowing Research Network* \(IWRN\) hosted by Lewis at Middlesex since 2008, has contributed to a new public profile for whistleblowing. The growing IWRN comprised of over 200 researchers, practitioners and policy makers from across the world has encouraged networking and dissemination of research and good practice including via regular conferences \(Sarajevo, 2015; Oslo, 2017; Utrecht, 2019\). In 2014, Lewis, with colleagues, edited and contributed to the landmark *International Whistleblowing Research Handbook* \[5.1\] widely read internationally by policy makers, and practitioners. Middlesex University has also sponsored the *Whistleblower of the Year Award* since 2013, presented to an individual or organisation in recognition of outstanding achievement in making a disclosure of information in the public interest \[5.2\]. Winners, selected by a five\-person international jury drawn from IWRN, have included whistleblowers from Oxfam, HMRC and the NHS, and have attracted considerable media coverage. 

 Lewis has been routinely engaged by a range of governmental, non\-governmental organisations and political parties to advocate protection for whistleblowers, including involvement in Transparency International and The Green Party’s agenda\-setting “Directive” on whistleblowing in 2015, through to advising on the whistleblowing provisions in the Labour Party’s Industrial Relations Bill in 2019 and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on whistleblowing in 2020. His contribution through commissioned studies, professional presentations, and evidence to businesses, governments and other bodies, has provided an evidence base for work towards reform, moving from a relative lack of public and political awareness of whistleblowing principles, policies and benefits to the introduction of corporate and legal initiatives in many countries. Impact has been evident in two areas: changed employer practice towards whistleblowers; and the reshaping of legislation internationally to protect whistleblowers. 

####  Changed employer practice on whistleblowing 

 The former Chair of the Industrial Law Society states of Lewis that: “ *His work has influenced mechanisms of organisational accountability in relation to whistleblowing through the introduction of codes of practice and guidelines that directly draw upon his research findings, which have been especially influential on large public and private sector employers*” \[5.3\]. In 2013, the UK's leading online Human Resources organisation Xpert HR, in seeking evidence\-led processes towards reform and innovation related to whistleblowing, commissioned Lewis to produce a widely used, comprehensive “Guide to good practice” and subsequent quarterly updates. This comprehensive good practice guide has been extensively used since by Xpert HR’s customers, which are spread across 45 countries, and employ one in four of the workforce and include one in three FTSE\-100 companies in the UK \[5.4\]. 

 A number of recommendations made by the 2015 *Francis FTSU Report* incorporated Lewis’ findings on defects in existing NHS whistleblowing procedures. Of the 20 principles identified to create an open and honest report culture in the NHS in the Francis report, six related directly to Lewis’s research findings: principle 3, on culture free from bullying; principle 7 on raising and reporting concerns; principle 8 on investigations; principle 10 on training; principle 11 on support; and principle 19 on primary care \[5.5\]. For principle 20, on enhancement of legal protection, Lewis advised the report author directly on the failure of the law to protect against discrimination against whistleblowers at the point of hiring. UCL Partners subsequently commissioned Lewis to deliver training workshops \(2016\-2017\) on the implications of the FTSU review, which encouraged human resource practitioners to base their own tailored approaches on underpinning principles and evidence. The principles of the Francis review not only shaped major changes in whistleblowing report culture in the NHS \(notably principles 7,8,10,11\) \- the UK’s largest employer of 1.2m staff \- but have been widely drawn on by other organisations across the public and private sectors \[5.3\]. A subsequent study of published procedures used by the FTSE top 100 firms showed how these principles have been widely applied in these companies \[5.6\]. 

 In 2016, in response to growing public controversy over the provision of a safe environment for whistleblowing in the Garda Síochána, Lewis was contracted by the Irish Policing Authority to review their policy and procedures for the making of protected disclosures. The review’s recommendations identified changes to ensure compliance with the 2014 Protected Disclosures Act regarding who could make a protected disclosure, how to make a protected disclosure, the role of the protected disclosures manager, and employee safeguards. Following consultation on the review, in November 2016 the Irish Policy Authority published a *Report of the policing authority on the Garda Síochána protected disclosures* policy. This set out 17 recommendations and led to the Garda’s introduction of an amended policy to cover its 15,000 workforce in 2017 \[5.7\]. 

 As part of work to embed an overall shift of employment culture internationally, since 2015, Lewis has served as a member of the British Standards Institute working party preparing an international standard on whistleblowing. This ISO standard will be the international benchmark for all whistleblowing policies and is expected to be agreed in 2021. 

####  Reshaping legislation internationally to protect whistleblowers 

 The whistleblowing model Lewis first proposed in 1995 in relation to the UK of protecting whistleblowers via employment protection rights, has since informed the conceptualisation and drafting of legislation and policy internationally, particularly as countries have recognised the value of whistleblowing legislation in fighting corruption. In 2016 a three\-day UNODC anti\-corruption mission to Liberia aimed at training judges and senior civil servants across 12 West African countries, engaged Lewis as a whistleblowing expert. The resulting *Monrovia Statement on Whistle\-blower and Witness Protection in West Africa* \[5.8\], jointly drafted by Lewis, was adopted by all participants to facilitate the establishment of effective whistleblower and witness protection systems within these 12 nation states. In Japan, Lewis provided evidence based on his empirical research and expertise on international best practice to a national committee in 2019, as part of an impact review of their 2005 Whistleblower Protection Act. In Australia, Lewis was adviser on the Griffith University’s *Whistle while you work* project, funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage scheme, as well as recent legislation providing whistleblowing rights under existing workplace arrangements. 

 In Europe Lewis has worked with particular European states to develop frameworks for whistleblower protection, particularly with a view to tackling corruption. Following Lewis’ address to a major OECD anti\-corruption workshop in Athens in 2017, he was commissioned by the Council of Europe as part of the *Project against Economic Crime in Kosovo* \(PECK\) to contribute to drafting a whistleblowing statute, subsequently enacted in Kosovo in 2018 \[5.9\]. The Council of Europe’s “highly positive experience” of engaging Lewis \[5.10\] led them to further commission Lewis in 2020 to produce two technical reports in support of action against economic crime in North Macedonia. These reports informed major revisions of existing legislation to enhance the protections provided to whistleblowers in Northern Macedonia. A resulting draft law is currently undergoing Parliamentary review with expected adoption in early 2021 \[5.10\]. 

 The impact of Lewis’ expertise and advocacy is most notable through his contribution in pushing the EU to adopt a whistleblower protection Directive, overcoming opposition from those who argued there was no legal basis or political will for such a measure. Previously in 2011, in oral and written evidence to the Budgetary Control Committee of the European Parliament, Lewis had urged the introduction of EU\-wide whistleblowing measures. In 2017, he was called on as one of two academic experts to advise during the consultation process, including participation in the DG Justice workshop in Brussels shaping the Directive \[5.11\]. In 2019, *Directive \(EU\) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law,* was adopted. Prior to this Directive, there was no EU measure devoted solely to whistleblowing. The Directive draws directly on Lewis’ body of research, which demonstrates the need to set detailed standards for handling concerns, offer wide access to whistleblowing procedures, ensure confidentiality, provide effective deterrents to retaliation, and access to justice. The Directive provides minimum standards for all member states and requires member states to put in place relevant legislation. The Directive was transposed in December 2021, with member states now consulting and drafting national legislation on their whistleblowing practices and procedures. Beyond direct impact on the 446 million population of the 27 EU member states, the Directive will have a further effect on countries wishing to join or trade with the EU. The 47 Council of Europe countries have been formally urged to comply with this Directive, and several have taken steps to do so, including North Macedonia and Kosovo, as advised by Lewis.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 MicroPasts is an online crowdsourcing platform where members of the public and specialists alike collaborate to develop new archaeological and heritage research data, such as archive transcriptions, translations, scientific dates, 3D artefact models and georeferenced sites. Co\-founded by UCL and the British Museum in 2014, it is an ongoing, sustainable venture that has led to new collaborations with 27 other archaeology and heritage institutions in the UK and around the world. More than 3,500 members of the public have completed 150,018 data collection tasks. Contributors come from more than 20 different countries worldwide and do not typically work in archaeology or heritage. This has: enabled co\-production of new cultural artefacts; enhanced heritage interpretation through collaboration with museum professionals; improved digital professional standards and training in the heritage and cultural sector, and enhanced public participation and learning.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Co\-founded by UCL and the British Museum and funded by the AHRC, the MicroPasts project \(i and ii, 2013\-present\) has been a collective endeavour involving multiple institutions from the start. The project brought together partner institutions to develop, implement and start to evaluate a novel model to support collaborative research in archaeology, history and heritage that drew on crowd\-sourcing, co\-design and crowd\-funding. This model led to the establishment of MicroPasts, an online crowdsourcing platform where members of the public and specialists collaborate to develop new archaeological and heritage research data. Although a product of genuinely collaborative effort, the project is a coherent progression of Bevan's research expertise and priorities. 

 Bevan has conducted pioneering work on the exploitation of the new kinds of increasingly large, often geo\-referenced, archaeological information, as well as the digital enrichment of so\-called ‘legacy’ datasets that lie under\-utilised in traditional print publications and interim reports. His work has also developed new ways to address well\-known problems in archaeological evidence, such as via adoption of relative risk models \(from epidemiology\) to mitigate distortions in the spatial distribution of known archaeological finds caused by present\-day investigation of land use patterns \(e.g. **\[R1\]**\). The harvesting of ‘legacy’ archaeological resources, in particular, opens up crucial new ways to involve the public in archaeology: as desk\-based citizen archaeologists at the frontiers of archaeological research, volunteers are unconstrained by the issues associated with involvement in fieldwork, such as accessibility \(an agenda set in **\[R2\]**\). Bevan has, for example, developed methodologies for both fully\-automated and crowdsourced extraction of published radiocarbon dates from pdf and web sources, as well as for their ensuing analysis using further novel methods, leading to the development of the software package ‘rcarbon’ that provides tools for analysis of large radiocarbon datasets \(latest version **\[R3\]**, now downloaded more than 20,000 times and used in over 65 publications\). As part of this work on radiocarbon, MicroPasts enabled contributors to check 40,000 UK ‘grey literature’ interim reports of UK archaeological excavations for radiocarbon dates and thereby contributed to the largest database of such dates in the UK. When combined with other sources, this led to publication in a world\-leading science journal **\[R4\]** of a large\-scale regional comparison of human population dynamics, food production strategies and climate change over the Holocene. 

 MicroPasts has itself enabled a critical, systematic evaluation of this form of desk\-based citizen archaeology. One aspect of this research agenda that spans the outputs of Bevan, Bonacchi, Wexler and Sparks \(as well as co\-founder Pett and collaborator Wilkin at the British Museum\), has been evaluation of the extent of digital engagement with archaeology and heritage resources – who uses such resources and why? This and other evaluations were built into the project by Bevan, Bonacchi and Pett from its earliest design phase, leading to several important peer\-reviewed outputs, including assessments of how to achieve better quality control in crowd\-sourcing tasks such as vector shape digitising, findspot georeferencing or document transcription **\[R5\]**, and **\[R6\]** the strengths and weakness the ways of that academic crowdsourcing and crowdfunding might interact.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The MicroPasts project has engaged members of the public in archaeology and heritage in non\-traditional ways, while also creating re\-usable open data, software and expertise, and building a crowd\-sourcing project that is sustainable in the long term. MicroPasts is an online crowdsourcing platform where members of the public and specialists alike collaborate to develop new archaeological and heritage research data. Contributors to the MicroPasts platform participate \(anonymously or as registered users\) to help wider data\-gathering efforts by completing short tasks online. Examples include transcribing a museum catalogue card or an archaeologist’s diary page, adding metadata tags of people and places visible in old archaeological photographs, tracing the outline of an object in one of many photographs to support 3D photogrammetric modelling, searching a ‘grey literature’ report for structured information such as radiocarbon dates, or georeferencing an archaeological findspot. This collaboration has led to four strands of impact: enhanced public participation and learning; co\-production of new cultural artefacts; enhanced heritage interpretation through collaboration with museum professionals; and improved digital professional standards and training in the heritage and cultural sector. 

 **Enhanced Public Participation and Learning** 

 Since April 2014, over 3,500 members of the public have contributed to data\-gathering projects by completing tasks on the MicroPasts site. Nearly half of users were in the UK \(26%\) and US \(20%\) while the other 56% were located in over 20 other countries **\[A\]**. Contributors have completed 150,018 task runs for 252 different MicroPasts projects **\[A\]**. User surveys indicate that 72% of contributors do not work professionally in history or archaeology, implying a reach well beyond traditional academic data collection projects. For example, one volunteer is an administrative assistant living in Canada and nearing retirement, who started helping on MicroPasts in 2014 and has now completed 4,323 tasks. She notes **\[B\]** that: “my small part contributes to something much larger and \[more\] academically important than I ever could have imagined when I registered to participate \[…\] I have expanded my knowledge and interest about archaeology and have developed my own set of reference information \[...\] I now also do volunteer transcription work for a number of other organizations including The British Library.” Other contributors describe a range of benefits including: the aesthetic pleasure of looking at old diaries or photos or artefact drawings; relaxing with something simple but useful; being able to help and give back to an institution they had visited in the past; contributing to scientific research, and reconnecting with people in archaeology, history or heritage **\[R2\]**. Contributing to MicroPasts has also had intellectual and professional benefits: at least three contributors have now moved into archaeological jobs or have taken up degrees in archaeology. 

 **Co\-production of new cultural artefacts** 

 MicroPasts’ core deliverable is new archaeological information: co\-produced in all cases, openly available online from the moment of its creation and freely re\-usable as new digital cultural artefacts. For example, by crowdsourcing “photo\-masks” to enable high quality photogrammetric reconstructions, it has created over 100 3D models of museum artefacts. These have been viewed online at  [https://sketchfab.com/micropasts](https://sketchfab.com/micropasts%20) over 53,600 times, downloaded over 3,000 times, 3D printed at public libraries multiple times, re\-purposed in virtual museums and widely shared **\[C\]**. For example, a Mary Rose shipwreck tankard has been viewed 7,500 times online, converted to a low\-poly version by an interested user that is well\-suited to use in on or offline gaming environments, and 3D printed by the Mary Rose Trust for outreach packs. The co\-production of 3D digital models has led to the creation of further cultural artefacts; for example a Bronze Age spearhead was digitally printed and accurately painted by a co\-host of podcast ‘3D Printing Today’. The project featured in the 9 April 2015 episode in which the presenters praised the importance for makers of MicroPasts’ commitment to sharing data for re\-use **\[C\]**. 

 **Enhanced heritage interpretation through collaboration with museum professionals** 

 Founded upon collaboration with the British Museum \(BM\), two initial Micropasts initiatives were the crowd\-sourcing of a Bronze Age metalwork card catalogue and 3D modelling of Bronze Age objects. MicroPasts contributors transcribed 100% of the uploaded material concerning this dataset which related to over 30,000 Bronze Age weapons, tools and ornaments. As the curator of these collections at the British Museum explains, this made these materials available to a much wider audience: “this internationally significant dataset had only been available to a small number of British based scholars” and its digitisation “brought some of the joys – and eccentricities – of Bronze Age metalwork to a much wider audience than hitherto reached by generations of museum curators” **\[D1\]**. They also produced 73 3D models of British Museum Bronze Age artefacts \(of the 100\+ mentioned above\) that were made available to the public via Sketchfab. While such an approach to museum artefacts has now been popularized, at the time it was, as Wilkin puts it, “trailblazing” and “provided important opportunities for new forms of dissemination of the museum collection and for collaboration between public and museum staff, in line with the museum’s wider aims and objectives for sharing the collection online and making it studiable worldwide” **\[D1\]**. The 3D printed models produced by participants also led to enhanced heritage interpretation in outreach settings. Co\-produced digital 3D artefact models were used to populate reconstructions of Bronze Age houses in the British Museum Samsung Digital Discovery Centre. These underpinned activities over a weekend \(8\-9 August 2015\) whereby 1,200 family, teen, and school visitors explored a virtual reality Bronze Age site, which included 3D scans of objects placed in their original settings. Participants could access multiple interpretations of how these objects might have been used across three digital platforms. Wilkin described how the virtual reality environment “proved valuable in providing a range of different media with which to engage a public audience through objects that have otherwise been the preserve of the Bronze Age finds specialist”, enhancing engagement with heritage interpretation for visitors **\[D2\]**. Feedback from participants confirmed the positive impact virtual reality had on learning about the Museum’s collection: “it made me feel as if I was actually there and gave me a sense of how things actually were in the Bronze Age” **\[D2\]**. MicroPasts enhanced curatorial practice: for Wilkin, the project “left an indelible mark on my attitudes to digital technology and on my curatorial practice” **\[D1\]**. 

 The success of this collaboration led to wider impact within the libraries, archives and museums sector. MicroPasts has enabled crowd\-sourcing projects involving 27 other museums, archives, libraries, heritage groups and research projects internationally, from the Society of Antiquaries of London to the Minnesota Historical Society in the US and Museo Egizio in Italy **\[E\]**. Each project has led to knowledge transfer and opportunities for institutional public outreach, as well as considerable media coverage in 17 major international newspapers as well as archaeology and heritage and culture and technology magazines, and on social media **\[F\]**. This includes features in *The Guardian* \(August 2014, shared 291 times\), Italian daily *la Repubblica* \(December 2015\), and Greek daily *To Vima* \(August 2014\) \(respective circulation at the time of publication 177,827; 331,446; 114,035\). The Mary Rose Trust has printed co\-produced 3D models of its artefacts for its outreach packs. Their Collections Manager notes, “We were hugely impressed by \[…\] the high quality 3D models that were produced as part of this project. The models opened up \[…\] the Mary Rose collection in terms of its accessibility to a wider \(and digital\) audience \[…and\] have been used by the Trust in everything from outreach projects, to educational tools and even for research and reference \[enabling\] visitors to get closer to and inspired by these fascinating, but very fragile objects.” **\[G\]**\). In 2015 contributors transcribed 500 object records for the Egypt Exploration Society \(EES\) in 10 days and, as the Director of the EES explains, this helped them in their project to “digitise and make available thousands of records \[…\] relating to historical excavations” in Egypt and Sudan **\[H\]**. They explain that ""\[w\]orking with MicroPasts was an exciting and transformative period for the Society’s archive. It allowed us to engage our supporters around the world with items ordinarily unavailable to them. The data gathered gave us new insights into our collections and allowed us to provide educational training to interns exploring pioneering research avenues.” Two interns undertook projects using the newly accessible data: one “completed an online exhibition about the colonial context of archaeological work in Sudan during the 1930s, and \[the other\] considered aspects of ‘Endangered Heritage’ in the wake of the Egyptian revolution” **\[H\]**. The collaboration has had a long\-lasting impact on the EES: “The legacy of the MicroPasts project continues as our collections remain accessible online, and those wishing to search for more in\-depth information can use our online catalogue to search more specifically”. It has led to knowledge exchange with other organisations: “Being invited to the MicroPasts conference in March 2015 allowed us to see how other organisations were working and develop various synergies to support our work further."" As the Director concludes, “The support we received from the MicroPasts team meant that a small organisation like the EES was able to achieve so much more.” **\[H\]**. The New Forest Park Authority were likewise able to build capacity through the collaboration with MicroPasts. They were able to translate diaries from a German wartime POW camp in the forest, and an archaeologist on the project comments, ""it soon became apparent that the German was, in places, technical, written in High German and contained German words that were ‘difficult’ to translate into English. \[…\] We would not have been able to do these translations of WWII German documents if it was not for this platform’s involvement and that of its volunteers”. They explain that “The work of the MicroPasts volunteers to translate these sometimes technical and challenging documents has gone beyond expectation. \[…\] allowing us and future researchers the opportunity to ‘hear their words’ from this important point in local, national and world history"" **\[I\]**. 

 **Improving digital professional training and standards** 

 MicroPasts has developed professional digital standards in a number of areas. For example, the project published 5 tutorials on 3D photogrammetry and crowd\-sourcing, which have been re\-used in several academic teaching settings \(both internal and external to the founder institutions\). As one person put it \(whose professional life had moved away from archaeology but has since found permanent employment in digital applications at the Natural History Museum\): “Public engagement is a key requirement for the type of Museum post I wanted to apply for \[and\] thanks to MicroPasts I was able to meet this \[… A\]ppreciation of the possibilities of crowdsourcing that I first experienced with MicroPasts has greatly influenced my own crowdsourcing transcription project \[launched by the Natural History Museum in 2020... and\] ensured that I understood good practice.” **\[B\]**. In 2014, the platform itself was the first in the UK to adopt and demonstrate the effectiveness of a crowdsourcing framework called Pybossa for cultural research and engagement **\[R4\]**, that has since also been adopted by the British Library and the British Film Institute amongst others. The platform immediately shares its data publicly and is built on reusable open\-source software: data, software and further learning resources or community expertise have all been re\-used, for new academic research for museum engagement and to a wide range of people’s personal interests. 

 Those who provide professional training and shape policy in the cultural sector benefited from a 2016 MicroPasts knowledge exchange workshop, which provided guidance on co\-producing knowledge online for the sector and the project has been cited in sector\-shaping publications **\[J\]**. For example, the 2014 report of the Towards a Collaborative Strategy for sector information management \(TACOS\) project, an initiative of two networks for heritage professionals \(the Forum on Information Standards in Heritage and the Historic Environment Information Resources Network\), used MicroPasts as an example “of how crowdsourcing might be put to use in the enhancement of historic environment datasets”. It saw MicroPasts as a test case “in assessing the feasibility of partially resourcing historic environment information projects this way” **\[J\]**. This new model for community archaeology has enhanced heritage interpretation, improved digital professional standards and training in the heritage and cultural sector, and provided professional development opportunities for volunteers who co\-produced archaeological research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Laughter is fundamental to humanity, but its neurobiological aspects have been under\-researched and poorly understood. Professor Sophie Scott’s research at UCL has helped millions of people to better understand and appreciate how and why we use laughter in our social interactions through appearances on television, podcasts, in national and international newspapers and at public talks, lectures and performances. Scott has influenced the approach of comedy writers, performers and producers both directly through workshops and seminars, and indirectly through her published work and appearances. She has broughtneuroscience to new audiences by shedding new light on international news stories involving laughter. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Sophie Scott has been researching the neurobiology of human emotional vocalisations since 1997. In the early 2000s, her research developed to include positive expressions of emotion, such as laughter, which she has studied with functional neuroimaging, experimental and cross\-cultural approaches. Research that Scott and colleagues conducted at UCL showed that laughter has a distinct acoustic profile, and they were the first to demonstrate that laughter is robustly recognised across cultures **\[R1\].** 

 In terms of neural systems, her research revealed that the perception of laughter primes orofacial mirror systems **\[R2\]** and that this effect is reduced in boys at risk of psychopathy **\[R3\].** Her work was the first to show a difference in brain responses to involuntary, spontaneous laughter, and more communicative, controlled laughter **\[R4\].** Scott has developed this into a theoretical model of the social\-emotional role of laughter in communication **\[R5\].** In 2019, her rigorous research demonstrated that adding laughter to jokes makes the jokes seem funnier **\[R6\]** and that the more spontaneous the laughter, the funnier it makes the joke. This finding has important implications for the experience of comedy in audiences, particularly when the audiences are under isolated COVID\-19 conditions. As part of her research process, Scott trained as a stand\-up comedian through the Bright Club initiative in 2010 to explore laughter in a performance context and to study the social nature of comedy, the way performers organise laughter, and the role laughter plays in the relationship between comedian and audience. 

 Before this body of research, laughter was conceived of as synonymous with humour and comedy, and not considered a scientific topic of study in its own right. Scott's work has been critical to a cultural shift towards a new public perception of laughter as being a crucial part of human communication and mental health.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 By its very nature, Scott’s work on laugher can deliver powerful impact among a broad demographic. In the words of Jimmy Carr, “ *Laughter is at the very heart of what it is to be human \- our superpowers as a species are communication & co\-operation & laughter is central to both. Laughter is the glue that holds families, tribes & societies together. Sophie Scott’s work is though provoking, rigorous & brilliant. She’s not only finding answers, she’s asking questions that reveal so much about our minds & our humanity”* **\[S1\].**  Scott’s in\-depth scientific understanding of the neurobiological basis for laughter, and the insights this offers into our social communications, has a broad inherent public interest. Scott’s engagement activities use her understanding of people’s own involuntary responses to open up discussions about humour, language, communication, brain systems, voices, mental health and evolution. Her talks give audiences a new and lasting appreciation for something they used to see as commonplace, bringing neuroscience to the public in an accessible way. Her work on the relationship between comedy, audience and laughter has a more specific interest for those involved in producing, performing or consuming comedy. 

 **Laughter as communication** 

 Scott was invited to speak at the main TED meeting in Vancouver in 2015 **\[S2\].** Her TED talk ‘Why We Laugh’ has since been viewed over 4 million times via the TED site and a further 522,000 times on YouTube. In this talk, Scott built on her findings of how the brain processes laughter to explore the complex ways that humans use laughter in communication and emotion regulation. Her talk has been translated into 35 different languages and is used as English language teaching materials in Japan. TED organiser Chris Anderson \(in his book, *TED talks: the official guide to public speaking*\) identifies the talk as an exemplary case of how to present a new idea \(that laughter is a form of communication\). He describes the impact on audiences: *“By the end of \[her talk\], everyone was basking in the warm glow of a deeply pleasurable experience. But there was something else. None of us would ever think of laughter in quite the same way again. Sophie’s core idea about laughter – that its evolutionary purpose is to convert social stress into pleasurable alignment – had somehow entered our heads. And now, whenever I see a group of people laughing, I see the phenomenon through new eyes. Yes, I feel the joy, I feel the urge to join in. But I also see social bonding, and a strange and ancient biological phenomenon at work that makes the whole thing seem even more wondrous”* **\[S3\]** *.* The talk was selected as one of the 5 best TED talks that bring us joy in the Covid pandemic: indeed, it was presented as “ *the most needed talk of all”* **\[S4\].** 

 The Royal Institution of Great Britain \(RI\) selected Scott to deliver their 2017 Christmas Lectures, the UK’s prestigious flagship children’s science lectures aimed at 10\-18 year olds. She had previously contributed a Friday Night Discourse **\[S5\]** about laughter for the RI in July 2014 \(over 25,000 views\). Her research into laughter was used as the opening into the first of the three Christmas lectures \(on the theme of ‘language of life’\). These lectures were broadcast on BBC4 \(1.3 million viewers over all broadcasts **\[S6\]**\) and subsequently recorded and filmed in Singapore as the annual Star Lecture \(broadcast in October 2018, 125,000 viewers **\[S6\]**\) and delivered live in Hong Kong and Tokyo. They are now available on the Royal Institution website **\[S5\]** where they have accumulated a further 11k views **\[S6\].** 

 In 2017 Scott was invited to give a plenary lecture in Week Six of prominent lifelong learning establishment the Chautauqua Educational Institution’s residential summer programme **\[S7\]**  \(approx. 7,500 residents per day\).  The weeklong event on Comedy and the Human Condition was organised jointly with the National Comedy Center, the USA’s first cultural institution and national\-scale visitor experience dedicated to the art of comedy. Scott was the only academic among famous comedy professionals who gave plenary talks, including stand\-up comedians/TV personalities Lewis Black and W Kamau Bell, and director David Steinberg \(Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm\). 

 In January 2020, Scott gave a lecture on *Why is laughter contagious?* to world leaders and senior policymakers at the World Economic Forum in Davos **\[S5\].** Historian Mary Beard \(who has cited Scott’s work in her writings on the Romans and Comedy\) described the session as the highlight of the meeting **\[S4\].** The stress and difficulty of life under lockdown has led to an increased interest in the importance of laughter as a social tool and its role in relieving stress. Scott appeared in a variety of broadcasts to discuss her research on laughter in the context of COVID\-19, including the BBC’s emergency COVID programming \(HealthCheck UK Live **\[S5\]**, 4<sup>th</sup> April 2020, \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] **\[S8\]\)** and the Talks at Google *Happiness Festival* \(25<sup>th</sup> July 2020\) **\[S5\].** 

 Scott has contributed her expertise to discuss international news stories involving laughter, including a Washington Post article about the laughter described by Christine Blasey Ford during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings **\[S4\]**, and articles for the Guardian and the BBC discussing the laughter at Trump at the UN **\[S4\].** 

 Other media coverage includes articles for the Guardian and Standard Issue **\[S4\],** on Radio 4’s The Life Scientific **\[S5\]** and regularly on Radio 6Music **\[S5\],** as well as an appearance on Scandinavia’s \(and one of Europe’s\) largest talk shows Skavlan \(average audience 2 million\) **\[S5\].** 

 **Laughter, humour and comedy** 

 The insights of Scott’s research into what encourages and prevents laughter and how the complex relationships between comedian and audience can influence it is of particular interest to those involved in producing, performing and ‘consuming’ comedy. Scott has used her own stand\-up performances and collaborations with comedians and comedy writers/producers to inform the work of comedy professionals and help audiences to better understand and appreciate the comedy experience. 

 She hosted a show at the BBC’s Edinburgh Fringe Tent in late summer 2013 where comedians performed and audience laughter was measured and then discussed by a panel on the science of laughter. As a direct result of these activities, her research was included in the training given to new comedy writers at BBC Scotland. Comedian Susan Calman received this training and has used Scott’s research to help explain how laughter is contagious \(Too Much TV **\[S4\]**, March 2016, \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] **\[S8\]**\) **.** 

 The Fringe format was repeated at another show in May 2019 to mark the reopening of the Bloomsbury Theatre \(hosted by comedian Stuart Goldsmith\) **\[S9\]**, which sought to capture and understand the dynamics in the space, breathing, and how laughter spreads. The event was picked up by BBC One’s The One Show **\[S5\]** who made a film about the night and then recreated the format live with their own audience and comedian Joe Pasquale. 

 In September 2016, comedian Jimmy Carr hosted an episode on The Science of Laughter for flagship BBC2 science programme Horizon \(\[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] over all broadcasts **\[S8\]**\) in front of a live audience, with Scott at his side throughout **\[S5\].** In May 2017, comedian Russell Brand featured her \(as sole guest\) on an episode of his podcast Under the Skin comparing the communication styles of Donald Trump, Theresa May and Boris Johnson and the role laughter plays in each **\[S5\]**. 

 In December 2019 Scott was interviewed about her research findings \( on how other people’s laughter makes a joke seem funnier\) as part of a workshop about AI and comedy at St Peter’s College Oxford, organised by comedy writer Charlie Skelton and Oxford’s Head of Computer Science **\[S10\]**. The event was aimed at high\-level comedy professionals including the BBC’s Head of Comedy and comedian Robin Ince **\[S10\]** and computer scientists. Scott was the only neuroscientist to present among experts from philosophy, artificial intelligence, Google’s DeepMind and linguistics. 

 In July 2020, the first episode of the BBC show QI to be recorded without a studio audience because of the COVID\-19 restrictions featured Scott's findings about how laughter makes jokes seem funnier to explore how the lack of a live audience affected the show. They cited the UCL research and recreated Scott’s experiment to demonstrate how laughter affects the perception of humour \(QI, Series R, Ridiculous\) **\[S4\].** 

 Scott is the leading expert on laughter and comedy science, providing articles such as for BBC Science Focus commissioned by the publicist of the Karl Pilkington Sky TV series ‘ *Sick of It*’ which addressed why Karl only laughs in his sleep **\[S4\]** *,* and being interviewed about laughter and jokes by Sky news and the BBC as part of their coverage of the Edinburgh festival 2018. In recognition of her research and public engagement, in the 2020 Birthday Honours she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research conducted at the University of Bath has increased the resilience of Position, Navigation and Timing \(PNT\) systems to the criminal operation of devices that can jam Global Navigation Satellite System \(GNSS\) signals and specifically Global Positioning System \(GPS\) signals. Deliberate jamming can now be detected and located in real time, allowing rapid and efficient law\-enforcement response, and protecting critical infrastructure. Chronos Technology markets two handheld detectors, CTL3510 and CTL3520, developed by the University of Bath and the CTL3530 GPS JammerCam developed in a collaborative project. These are now in use by many police forces in the UK and overseas, and have resulted in the detection and arrest of organized crime activity related to high value asset theft \(30 cars \[text removed for publication\]\). \[text removed for publication\]. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The timing signals from GPS satellites are very weak when they arrive at a receiver on Earth. The signal to noise ratio is much less than one, and a GPS receiver must extract the time and position information by comparing the received signal with templates of the known transmissions of the different satellites at different times when observed from different locations on Earth. When a match is found, that gives the current time and location. 

 Watson undertook research at the University of Bath using the propagation of GPS signals through the atmosphere to map the density of free electrons in the ionosphere by recording the dephasing \(or scintillation\) of the signals received by a fixed ground station in a known location \[1\]. This analysis relied on Watson’s deep understanding of the propagation of electromagnetic waves, both in the bulk of the troposphere and also in the final few 100 metres to the receiver, where local multiple path interference from buildings or traffic can disturb the signal \[2\]. The result of this research was an understanding of how GPS signals can be used to observe the effects on the ionosphere of events like coronal mass ejections from the sun, and conversely how these space weather events can affect GPS navigation and timing on Earth. It also gave Watson a detailed knowledge of the delicate effects of many different natural noise sources on the GPS signals. 

 \[text removed for publication\]With his understanding of the usual variability of noise in the GPS frequency range, and also knowledge of the magnitude of intermittent events associated with space weather, Watson was immediately able to see that the disruption did not fit any of these existing patterns. It quickly became apparent that the events seen by Chronos were man\-made in origin, and Watson set about to devise an instrument able to distinguish automatically between natural and man\-made interference in GPS signals. This interference may also be very weak; the GPS signal is already below the natural noise levels and so can be swamped by something that itself is barely above that background. This makes deliberate GPS jamming devices cheap to buy, but also very difficult to detect. To make a detection system particularly useful it would need to be hand\-held, and would also need to detect the direction of the man\-made noise in order to locate it \[3,4,5,6\]. Watson designed a detection and analysis system to identify different types of additional man\-made noise, which became the product CTL3510 \(late 2013\). He further developed an interferometric detector to give direction information, which became the product CTL3520 \(2013/14\). A particular challenge here was to devise an interferometer that is smaller than the 20 cm wavelength of the GPS signals, in order for the complete system to be hand\-held. 

 Technology transfer to Chronos Technology Ltd was accelerated by three joint Innovate UK projects, GAARDIAN \(TS/G002592/1, 2008\-11\), SENTINEL \(TS/I00257X/1, 2011\-13\) and AJR \(UKRI 131602, 2014\-15\). Continuing engagement between Watson and Chronos Technology has led to the development of the JammerCam \(CTL3530\), which combines jammer\-triggered camera technology with automatic number plate recognition.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research at Bath has translated into economic impact through the development of a new product range and service from Chronos Technology since late 2013, and societal impact through removing threats to critical systems and uncovering criminal activity, resulting in enhanced security for businesses and people. 

 There are many reasons for individuals to use deliberate GPS jammers. Fleet operators often install location systems in their vehicles and individuals may want to defeat that system, for example to conceal personal use of vehicles, to sleep at home rather than a lorry park, or to manipulate working hours. These jammers are small and just plug into the cigarette lighter socket of the vehicle, but the jamming can affect others in the area, including infrastructure. Jammers are also used by criminals, particularly to defeat in\-car GPS tracking systems. High value vehicles often have concealed tracking devices to relay their location if they are stolen. Organised crime gangs targeting vehicle theft use GPS jammers to remove vehicles without them being tracked. \[text removed for publication\]. Criminals may also fear that law enforcement have fitted trackers to their vehicles and so use GPS jammers. Using GPS jamming is itself an offence in the UK, but it is also associated with higher\-level crime. 

 GPS jamming may also be unintentional, for example from faulty installation of GPS equipment causing leakage of the amplified signal that it is using. This may be in vehicles or in fixed installations and will disrupt local systems. 

 **Economic impact** 

 Chronos Technology Ltd is a UK SME specialising in bespoke products for time and frequency synchronisation. In 2016 it had 45 full time staff and a turnover of GBP5,500,000 \[A\]. The collaboration with Bath researchers has led to commercialisation of a new range of products during the REF period: the CTL3510, CTL3520 and CTL3530 GPS jamming detectors \[B\]. **The key features of these products are that they are hand\-held and that they generate alarm signals in real time when jamming is detected.** From August 2013 up until end of December 2020, more than \[text removed for publication\] devices have been sold to the civilian, defence and security markets in the UK and \[text removed for publication\] other countries, \[text removed for publication\]:

 **Protection of critical infrastructure** 

 Many critical systems rely on GNSS\-derived timing and navigation, including aviation, shipping, transportation of high\-value or hazardous goods, banking transactions, mobile phone networks and emergency service communications. The protection of these systems is vital to the daily operation of a nation's infrastructure \[D\]. 

 Port systems rely heavily on GPS for container handling and operations can be seriously disrupted by jammers. Chronos have test installations at port entries \(\[text removed for publication\]\) and motorway services in collaboration with UK police \[E\]. These regularly detect and image vehicles carrying jammers \[text removed for publication\]. As an example of the effective protection of port systems using Chronos products, \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Not all jamming is intentional. Chronos detectors are also used to quickly identify jamming signals coming from faulty cables and antennas, enabling rapid restoration of timing information in critical commercial operations \[F\].

 Chronos Technology continue to work with Bath to develop new products. The latest Chronos product to emerge is the “JammerCam” \[H\] and is the first GPS jamming detector in the world to be able to identify and photograph a moving vehicle which is carrying a GPS jammer. This product is currently in trials with various local police forces, with the apprehension of jammer users, seizure of jammers \[text removed for publication\]. 

 **Summary of impact** 

-  Multiple police forces in the UK and across law\-enforcement agencies internationally \(including Europe, USA\[text removed for publication\]\) are now aware of the problem of GNSS jamming and have access to new detection techniques.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Cambridge researchers developed the first automated network of ultra\-violet sensors to monitor volcanic gases at active volcanoes. Since the initial work on prototype instrumentation in 2002, the design has been implemented on 42 volcanoes across 18 countries and five continents. Sensors have been developed to be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles, which allows monitoring of highly active and difficult\-to\-access volcanoes. Worldwide, 500 million people live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions. The impact of this research has been to: 

-  Protect life, property and livelihoods through: 

  -  enhancing the capability of volcano observatories worldwide to forecast eruptive activity in order to provide warning of imminent eruptions 

  -  providing critical input into government decisions leading to a\) evacuations and b\) mandatory exclusion zones 

-  Allow safe industrial re\-development \(e.g. geothermal on Montserrat\) 

-  Allow the people of Manam to stay on their own land, rather than being permanently displaced, through developing the ABOVE project community\-led resilience programme 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Up to the mid\-2000s, volcanoes were monitored largely using the occurrence of earthquakes and displacements of the ground surface, because these data were available at a high temporal resolution \(several measurements every second\) and were a reliable indicator of magma movement. Geochemical monitoring, which yields the only direct indication of magma close to the surface, was in its infancy, yet increases in gas fluxes from volcanoes often preceded eruptions and so provided a tantalising yet untapped source of information about eruptive activity. Gas flux data were available so infrequently \(once per day or per week, using cumbersome instrumentation\) that their utility was severely limited, despite their potential to track magma ascent and forecast eruption style. 

 Sulfur dioxide \(SO<sub>2</sub>\) fluxes are a critical part of volcano monitoring. When magma ascends towards the surface and decompresses, sulphur exsolves from silicate melt and enters the gas phase. This process is analogous to removing the cork from champagne, which results in CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles forming. The gas phase may migrate to the surface ahead of the magma, through permeable bubble networks. Increases in gas flux \(SO<sub>2</sub> is one of the primary gas species, the others are H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>\) therefore indicate the impending arrival of magma to the surface, i.e. they can be used, in tandem with seismicity and ground displacements, to forecast eruptions \[R1\]. 

 The impact described in this case was underpinned by research that took place within the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge between 2002\-2019, during which time a miniaturised UV spectrometer was developed for measurement of volcanic sulphur dioxide \[R2\] and the first network of scanning UV spectrometers was installed at volcanoes by **Edmonds, Oppenheimer** and co\-workers \[R3, 4\]. A network of three UV spectrometers was developed and installed in Montserrat during the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano in 2002 \[R2, 3\], whereby the spectrometers were connected to a scanning optical assembly and fibre optic cable, with power and telemetry, and code – which was made widely available \- was written to both acquire spectra and to retrieve SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts. SO<sub>2</sub> column amounts were combined with meteorological data to derive SO<sub>2</sub> fluxes every few minutes through the day, allowing the geochemical and geophysical data to be compared and interpreted on similar timescales, revolutionising the integrated monitoring of volcanoes \[R1, R5\]. 

 This development provided the model and basis for UV spectrometer networks elsewhere \[e.g. R3\]. In 2006, a modification of the instrument was awarded a US patent \(number 7,148,488: ""Apparatus for measuring radiation and method of use""\); **Oppenheimer** is a co\-holder of the patent and the instrument described has been distributed under the name of ‘FLYSPEC’. Scanning spectrometer networks were installed on 42 volcanoes \(for context, around 50\-60 volcanoes erupt every year\) across five continents between 2002 and 2020 \( **27 since 2013**, the period covered by this impact case\) by a number of research groups \(e.g. EU\-funded NOVAC, led by PI B. Galle, Chalmers University, co\-I **Oppenheimer**\) and volcano observatories *,* based on the design of the first installation in Montserrat, West Indies in 2002. 

 The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle \(UAV\) technology provided the opportunity for the ABOVE project, led by University of Cambridge researchers **Liu** and **Edmonds**, funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation, and including collaborators from the University of Bristol, USA, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica. The project developed cheap and portable sensors that could be mounted on UAVs to be flown into dangerous, highly active and difficult\-to\-access volcanoes \[R6\]. The data from these sensors showed previously unrecognised patterns in gas emissions related to bubble bursting, puffing and conduit dynamics \[R6\]. Subsequently, field campaigns to Guatemala, Montserrat and Papua New Guinea \(places with active volcanoes and particularly vulnerable populations\) in 2017\-2019 have established these UAV\-based methods, through training and sharing knowledge, as part of the regular toolkit of local volcano observatories for monitoring and hazard assessment. 

 Following the eruption of the White Island volcano in New Zealand in December 2019, and the tragic loss of life that followed, Edmonds was asked in August 2020 to provide consultant expert advice on gas monitoring data to the New Zealand Health and Safety Executive \(Worksafe\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Worldwide, 500 million people live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions \[E1\]. The spectrometer networks first developed by Edmonds and colleagues at the University of Cambridge have been adopted by volcanological observatories on 42 volcanoes \(27 since 2013\) across 18 countries and five continents \[E2, E3\]. They are used to protect life, property and livelihoods through forecasting eruptive activity and informing critical decisions on evacuations and exclusion zones; to allow safe industrial re\-development; and – through the ABOVE project resilience programme \(Aerial\-Based Observations of Volcanic Emissions\) \- to allow the Manam islanders to remain on their island.

 The Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences \(GNS\), New Zealand, were among the first government bodies to develop a spectrometer system based on the design Edmonds and colleagues pioneered. Senior Scientist at GNS, Dr Craig Miller, states \[E4\]: 

 ‘*the UV scanning spectrometer network installed by Edmonds, Oppenheimer and colleagues in Montserrat provided the template for GNS volcanologists to develop a similar system at White Island, New Zealand. It is used for monitoring volcanic activity at this hazardous and unpredictable volcano. An increase in gas flux, along with increased levels of seismicity and ground deformation, would significantly increase the probability of eruption and consequently the alert level at the volcano, which is used for decision\-making surrounding issues such as restricting access and warnings to the public*’. 

 In October 2019, SO<sub>2</sub> fluxes measured by the scanning spectrometers \(and accompanying tremor\) at White Island increased to the highest levels since 2016, suggesting an eruption was imminent over the coming weeks and months \[E5, 6\]. On 18 November 2019, the alert level was raised to ‘2’ \(the highest before eruption\) signalling ‘heightened volcanic unrest’ and ‘potential for eruption hazards’ \[E7\]. 

 Tragically, an eruption on 9 December 2019 killed 19 people. In this case, clear warnings were not heeded, and preventative action which could have saved lives was not taken. 

 At Volcán Tungurahua \(Ecuador\), 30,000 people live in areas at risk from pyroclastic flows and lahars. A spectrometer system based on the Cambridge design was installed in 2004. Eruptions in 2013, 2014 and 2016 have had considerable impacts on livelihoods, particularly agricultural activities \(with crops damaged and land made unusable due to the deposition of volcanic ash\). The scanning spectrometer stations provide SO<sub>2</sub> flux data for the assessment of risk and early warning of eruptions. In February 2014 >600 people were evacuated after alert levels were raised in response to increasing SO<sub>2</sub> flux \(to over 2000 tonnes per day\), as well as increased rates of earthquakes and ash venting at the summit: 

 ‘*The automatic scanning DOAS stations as first developed at Soufriere Hills* 

 *Volcano, and which nice results have been shown by Edmonds and colleagues in 2003,* 

 *have been widely adopted by volcanological observatories over the past 15 years*… *At Tungurahua, we installed 2 DOAS systems directly based on the Montserrat UV* 

 *spectrometer system, the UV scanning spectrometer network yielded important data which,* 

 *when used in combination with other monitored parameters as seismic activity, allowed us* 

 *to assess hazard levels and advise local authorities on the general level of volcanic* 

 *activity’* \[E3, Instituto Geofisico, Ecuador\] *.* 

 **Providing critical input into mandatory exclusion zones** 

 In Montserrat, the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano ceased in 2011, yet it remains restless. One key characteristic is continued high flux of SO<sub>2</sub>, as measured by the spectrometer network, leading the government to retain an exclusion zone around the volcano. The Montserrat Volcano Observatory \(MVO\) and Scientific Advisory Committee \(British Foreign Office\) continue to rely on the SO<sub>2</sub> flux data to assess whether the eruption is over or has merely paused. The March 2019 MVO Scientific Report \[E8\] states: 

 ‘*the potential for continuing activity has been considered against the following three criteria:* 

1.  *Seismicity* 

1.  *Gas – daily SO<sub>2</sub> emission rates above 50 tonnes per day* 

1.  *Ground deformation* 

 *Criteria 2 and 3 are currently being met*.’ 

 Consequently, the volcano remains in an elevated state of unrest, with an exclusion zone including over half the island. 

 **Allowing safe industrial re\-development** 

 However, on Montserrat, the monitoring networks are now making economic recovery possible. The Government has permitted a geothermal plant to be established in the exclusion zone, a decision informed by advice from the MVO, based partly on gas flux information. The Director of the MVO \[E9\] states: 

 *‘In 2014 the Government of Montserrat gave permission for a geothermal company, the* Iceland Drilling Company *, to begin operations generating two boreholes from which it was projected that much of the island’s energy needs would be provided. A third well is planned for 2020. This permission was based on advice from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory on volcanic risk; gas fluxes were one part of the critical evidence upon which the low risk level for that particular area was assigned.’* 

 Test results indicate that geothermal power could generate more electricity than is needed by the island, freeing it from reliance on diesel\-powered generators – among the most expensive electricity in the world – and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by replacing fossil fuel generated electricity \[E10\]. 

 **Allowing islanders to remain on their land** 

 The ABOVE project, led by University of Cambridge researchers Liu and Edmonds, involves field campaigns to Papua New Guinea volcanoes Rabaul and Manam to deploy UAV gas sensors and train local people in these techniques. Manam is a small island with > 2000 people, who are regularly evacuated to the mainland during eruptions every few years \(there have been nine since 2000\). Islanders live with extreme volcanic risk, as permanent relocation is unacceptable because the island is essential to their way of life and rehoming on the mainland brings risk of conflict. The UAV technology and training provided by the ABOVE project offers a means for them to remain. An ABOVE project video includes interviews with local people: 

 ‘*Those major eruptions \[in 2004\] were never addressed properly by the government… we have been waiting for 15 years and nothing is happening… We are regarded as IDPs – Internally Displaced Persons \- on our own land*.’\[E11\]. 

 The ABOVE project provides equipment and training to the local volcano observatory to continue measurements of gas fluxes using UAVs. One representative from each province in Papua New Guinea came to the training workshop in February 2019 and, thereafter, successfully lobbied provincial governments for additional funding \[E1\]. The islanders had relied on visual monitoring, but now fly UAVs over the volcano to monitor gas flux and activity to see what and who is most at risk, allowing them to remain on their own land.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Scottish Highlands has for centuries been a culturally\-rich and internationally\-connected region, but since the 1700s it has been more frequently characterised as peripheral. Research from the Centre for History \(CfH\) at the University of the Highlands and Islands \(UHI\) has challenged this characterisation, emphasising instead human agency: the vitality and resilience, sometimes against the odds, of the region’s social and linguistic communities. This research has then helped change cultural practice in the Highland Council locality, the largest local government area in the U.K. High Life Highland \(HLH\), the partner for the case study, is a service delivery organisation providing cultural, leisure, and learning services on behalf of the Council. HLH has incorporated this new understanding from our research in its approach to its museums, libraries, and archives. CfH research has underpinned several collaborative projects with HLH since 2015, and influenced the concept and application of the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, the organising principle for the multi\-million pound Inverness Castle Project, the biggest single heritage development in the region of the last century. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research has been carried out in public and regional history by Hunter, Worthington, and, in particular, MacPherson. It focuses on and contextualises the agency of the region’s often marginalised communities \[3.1\]. 

 The Centre for History \(CfH\) has developed an approach to collaborative research which emphasises the historical resilience of the Highland people and the ways in which this can effect positively on cultural, social, and economic development. This agency has too often been overlooked in accounts which focus on the long\-lasting, destructive aftermath of the Battle of Culloden, on the Highland Clearances, and on emigration. Hunter has argued that an appreciation of the Highlands’ rich and diverse history over the longer term is essential if people in the region are to have a sustainable future \[3.2\]. Worthington has formulated an historiographical approach that responds to the varied work of scholars including Rod Aya, Walter Johnson, and Jon Wilson since the 1990s, all of whom have used ‘agency’ as an umbrella term to describe collective responses among marginalised communities. Worthington has applied this to show how cultural and social influences have travelled southwards from the northern, ‘Highland’ littoral of the Moray Firth to its southern, ‘Lowland’ edge, as much as vice versa, reversing most previous assumptions \[3.3\]. The work of MacPherson takes direct inspiration from Hunter’s pivotal re\-evaluation of Highland communities and applies these concepts of agency to collaborative research which empowers those same communities to effect social, economic, and cultural change. MacPherson has pioneered a collaborative mode of PhD supervision and research which has put into place a practice\-based philosophy that is unique in a sub\-national context in Scotland \[3.1\]. Drawing on elements of postcolonial thought, it is based on principles of public history that give power to local people, enabling them to become agents in the creation of knowledge. 

 A bridge towards the impact that has occurred was the awarding of an AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award funded studentship, Badenoch Textiles, led by MacPherson, and founded on the research principles described above. This saw co\-production of CfH research with an HLH\-run museum, the Highland Folk Museum \(HFM\). The project highlighted the importance of flax growing to the Highland economy and the region’s place within global and imperial commercial markets and intellectual culture in the eighteenth century. By using eighteenth\-century techniques for flax growth and production, it explored how a ‘learning by doing’ approach could help HFM to become involved in the research process and drive forward their public engagement activities both at regional and national level.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Distilling the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ with High Life Highland since 2015** 

 After centuries of being marginalised, the Highlands has begun to experience some signs of cultural revival, in which the Centre for History and High Life Highland’s collaborations have been vital. The CfH’s research on Highland agency influencing the approach and activities of HLH via a chain of interlocking events initiated at the Kingussie Heritage Festival of 2015: the abovementioned Badenoch Textiles project, which started later that year, and its outcomes, along with a range of interconnecting influence on cultural practice in Highland museums, libraries and archives. Assisted by this, a new concept – the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ – is today manifested in the form of the Inverness Castle Project. In the words of the Head of Service at HLH until 2019: “ *History is about people, their actions, and their responses: their ‘agency’ if you like, this being a term that Centre for History researchers have used in showing the vitality of Highland communities in the past. And in the Highlands, this is a magnificent and uplifting story that also has a present and a future. For me, this is what the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ encapsulates*” \[5.1\]. 

 By working with HLH, an organisation with nearly 800 full\- and part\-time staff as of early 2020, the CfH has fulfilled a shared aim of making co\-produced academic research more accessible to the general public, and of placing the region’s collective agency and ‘spirit’ to the fore to ensure cultural renewal. Senior managers at HLH’s museums, libraries and archives – the Highland Folk Museum, Inverness Library, and Highland Archive Centre, in particular – have prioritised the benefits that have accrued from practice\-based partnerships with us since 2015, as will be shown. This has altered HLH’s approach to their cultural assets and helped them embed local cultural facilities into their communities. It has also supported closer connections between them and national cultural institutions. 

 **Oil, putty and paint: a flagship study of how CfH research gave a national platform to cultural practice in a regional organisation** 

 CfH collaborative work with HLH commenced at the Kingussie Heritage Festival in 2015, an event which brought together local heritage bodies, including the Clan Macpherson Museum. The presentation of research concepts via community\-focused public history was attended by HLH’s Head of Service and the CfH’s MacPherson, who identified common ground. Discussions between them and others present inspired a strategic partnership between HLH and UHI and new collaborations between HLH and both Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\) and the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\). The Badenoch Textiles project, which emerged from the Kingussie discussions – and for which MacPherson was Director of Studies – allowed for firmer connections to be made between HLH and these national bodies. First, it helped HLH “ *expand and deepen our relationship with Historic Environment Scotland*” according to their Curatorial Manager at the time \[5.4, p.1\]. The doctoral research, based at the Highland Folk Museum \(HFM\), led to the museum and a researcher being funded to cultivate and harvest flax using eighteenth\-century techniques. This was of great interest to the technical branch of Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\), which has a strong sustainability agenda built, in part, around increasing the use of traditional building materials. Indeed, they had a key objective of experimenting in the production and use of traditional, non\-lead\-based paint from linseed oil, which is produced from flax. Inspired by the flax project’s research, which the key member of HES’s technical research team involved considered an essential “ *academic stepping stone*” for them \[5.3, p.9\], they produced linseed oil from two annual harvests of the flax. One batch went to the Engine Shed, Scotland’s dedicated building conservation centre, which emphasises training and education, while HES turned a second batch into putty and paint for The Ridge charity in Dunbar \[5.3\]. This community interest company, which works with socially\-excluded groups to offer them skills training, acquired a derelict complex of eighteenth\-century buildings which they are rebuilding in partnership with HES. The output of CfH research, in the form of putty and paint, was used in the restoration of the windows \[5.3\]. 

 **Inspiring HLH’s approach to the region’s ‘spirit’: museums, libraries and archives** 

 From there, our research helped inspire new collaborations linking the communities of Badenoch, the CfH, and the Highland Folk Museum \(HFM\). According to the HLH Curatorial Manager at the time, it expanded the range and depth of HLH’s working practices, the ways it communicates with the public, and its collaboration with external agencies. While embedding doctoral research in the curatorial work of museums is common practice at national\-level institutions, such an approach has had limited application at regional or local levels. But the former Curatorial Manager considered that the CfH’s work showed a capacity “ *for bringing research to bear on contemporary issues*” \[5.4, p.1\]. In much the same way that Historic Environment Scotland used the material outcomes of CfH practice\-led research with socially excluded groups, HFM developed aims of establishing “ *a centre for learning and teaching … of traditional rural skills*” \[5.5, p.17\] that would empower marginalised people, bringing the museum also additional income, employment, and further research opportunities \[5.4, 5.5\]. Enhanced confidence and dedicated work by the HFM staff brought recognition of the museum as ‘nationally significant’ by Museums & Galleries Scotland \(MGS\). This was followed by a successful application to MGS for a grant, invested in two HFM staff to undertake work on conservation and documentation, a focus apparent also in the museum’s ‘20 Year Vision’ statement in 2016, in which collaborative research with universities rose to the fore. A shift in practice had occurred, from cataloguing to research, that, as the then\-HLH Head of Service stated, had *“in part come out of the partnership we have had with the university”* \[5.6, p.11\]. 

 Moving beyond the HFM, as a result of working with CfH, senior managers at HLH had also authorised the loan of the Inverness Library collection of rare books written by James Macpherson \(1736\-1796\) to the 2015 Festival in Kingussie, allowing the people of Badenoch to engage intellectually and physically with these works in ways that they had not done before. Here too, CfH research on Highland agency had a transformative effect on staff and institutional attitudes, engaging them with an eighteenth\-century, local author, James Macpherson, who is of global significance. This demonstrated the cultural value of HLH’s collections and drove HLH’s strengthening relations with another national organisation, in this case the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\). According to the current Head of Culture at HLH, special collections are “ *an absolute headache and a nightmare for public libraries*” \[5.5, p.1\]. This situation was transformed for them, however, by the CfH’s research, which revealed to senior library managers the value of bringing the special collections to the public. It involved ’Meet the Books’ events run by CfH staff in collaboration with other UHI researchers, which attracted capacity attendances, excellent feedback, and enhanced senior managers’ understanding of the collections \[5.5\]. CfH\-led collaborative research was, HLH’s Head of Culture asserts, “ *giving me real food for thought about how in future we can facilitate/publicise the whole process again*” \[5.5, p.4\]. Such new\-found awareness of the latent power of Inverness Library’s special collections took HLH’s cultural services in three directions. Firstly, it led to the idea of a ‘centre for the book’, which they would propose as part of the Inverness Castle Project \(see below\) and which could integrate academic and “ *public learning; teaching; public engagement*” \[5.5\]. The second direction was to draw library staff and volunteers further into the research process through staff development sessions, creating “ *a new model*” that “ *can be replicated throughout our entire cultural \[provision\] right across the Highlands*” \[5.5, p.14\]. Thirdly, CfH research strengthened the relationship between Highland library services and the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\), raising awareness of the significance of their special collections, with the NLS confirming to HLH that their social and historical context made them particularly precious \[5.5\]. 

 Another HLH priority is the Highland Archive Centre \(HAC\), with whom the CfH ran five collaborative events between 2017 and 2020. On three occasions, these were accompanied by exhibitions of archival material which had been used in our recent publications, towards inspiring further collaborative research. First, in March 2017, CfH staff co\-organised, along with the Imperial War Museum, ‘Researching the Impact of the First World War on the Highlands and Islands’, an event at which CfH and HAC staff both presented along with numerous other national and local historians and archivists; there was a lunchtime exhibition at HAC of relevant holdings, while two major follow\-ups would take place, one at HAC and the other in Lewis. The second occasion relates to the archival collections of the Caledonian Societies of Kenya and Zanzibar, donated by a CfH alumnus in 2013, and the focus of a 2017 display at HAC held in conjunction with an introduction to the archives for the public and a lecture on Scotland’s Imperial past and relevant records in the archive by CfH visiting professor, John MacKenzie. The third occasion was a sold\-out book launch and lecture in Inverness Town House for a 2019 work by Professor Hunter, chaired by Worthington, and at which material from HAC that Hunter had used in his research was, similarly, displayed. As the Highland Archivist at HAC states: “ *On each occasion, these collaborations have given us the opportunity to share our archives with new audiences … The partnership with the UHI Centre for History is one which we greatly value as it enables us to promote, publicise, and grow engagement with the archives in our care*.” Furthermore, as she expresses it, the CfH’s research “ *plays a vital role in highlighting the spirit of the Highlands and the lives of the people who call, and have called, this area home*” \[5.7\]. 

 **Manifesting the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’: the Inverness Castle Project** 

 Ultimately, and through the concept of the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, our research has led to the CfH taking up a vital role, alongside HLH, in the largest, most expensive cultural project ever undertaken in the Highlands: the Inverness Castle Project. This is a collaboration that has been supported at the highest strategic level of the partner organisation, embracing academic research by university\-based academics. As HLH’s former Head of Service expressed it, the “ *symbiotic relationship”* \[5.2, p.3\] with UHI’s research was a backdrop to the ‘Officers Group’ of the Castle Project after 2015, as they came up with a ‘hook’ that would bring in the region’s stories and ensure the political support to be obtained. This hook was the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, a concept now central to the Castle Project \[5.2\]. 

 CfH research, and its application to working with the region’s museums, libraries, and archives since 2015, has helped convince HLH of the need for a new, research\-led cultural approach. This new vision for the organisation is visible today in the Castle Project. The project forms part of the Inverness and Highland City\-Region deal, which is now in full progress, and which will see up to £315 million investment from the UK and Scottish governments aimed at stimulating sustainable economic growth regionally, with £15 million of this going directly to Castle Hill. The Castle Project is creating a gateway for tourism and becoming an anchor for economic growth in the city and throughout the region, and the content for the attraction thereby created celebrates, above all, the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ \[5.8\]. The project runs over three phases: Phase One involves the development of the North and South tower of the current Castle; Phase Two envisages the building of a new, adjacent visitor attraction on Castle Hill to an international standard; Phase Three is the commercial aspect. The net result is intended to be “ *a large cultural hub in the centre of Inverness which …will lead down to the archive centre, to the library, cultural trails*” \[5.5, p.9\]. 

 CfH research has had a significant physical impact on Castle Hill already, with Worthington acting as one of two historical consultants for the bilingual English and Gaelic text on the Castle hoardings, which went on display on the current exterior in September 2020. The narrative for the hoardings focuses on a fictional character, Flora, a young girl, and her enthusiasm for the Castle’s and the Highlands’ past. The involvement of Worthington comes in part from a 2019 Scottish Graduate School for the Arts and Humanities\-funded workshop he organised. At this event, HLH’s Head of Culture highlighted to the audience – including senior curatorial staff at National Museums Scotland – the inspiration provided to the project by UHI research. The newly\-appointed Creative Director of the Castle Project also talked about the historical elements of the development, emphasising the importance of the CfH’s and broader UHI research practices as the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ began to materialise \[5.9\] **.** This influence is further evidenced by Worthington representing UHI on the Inverness Castle Project Delivery Group, chaired by the Scottish Government’s Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Tourism, Fergus Ewing MSP. Moreover, Worthington’s leadership of the UHI\-HLH advisory group to the project, established in 2018, distributes agency further, focusing on how the CfH’s community\-oriented research can be applied in a wider, cross\-disciplinary way. 

 CfH researchers have positioned their work as a fulcrum around which relations between the Castle Project team and the university hinges, challenging the entrenched opinion that the marginalisation of the region and its voices is irreversible. Finally, in this regard, the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ is involving HLH’s gathering and curation of at least 100 ‘stories’ from across the region, a process launched online in September 2020, with a video narrated by multi\-award winning Gaelic singer and composer, Julie Fowlis. Fowlis affirmed, shortly after, that *“historical research at UHI has been an inspiration to me as an artist in recent times, particularly through their work showing the strength, agency and spirit of Highland people, past and present”*. Soon after, Fergus Ewing MSP asserted that *“the involvement of the UHI, and in particular its Centre for History, has already brought huge benefits to this project in helping research and display the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ stories’”* \[5.10\]. The stories will provide the content for the visitor attraction on Castle Hill and the CfH will take a significant role in their selection. In this way, our research continues to inspire the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, helping it materialise as the framework for a project that is having tangible, transformative effects on the region’s cultural life, on a scale bigger than that of any other development of the last century.

 **Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\)** 

 Research conducted at Buckinghamshire New University \(BNU\) has influenced decarbonisation, environmental and government policy and has led to improved management of natural resources. The research enabled the establishment of decarbonisation and climate mitigation schemes and facilitated private sector access to funds. It also led to changes in the EU, Ghanaian, Zambian and Malaysian Governments’ decarbonisation policies. 

 Effective natural resource management has thus resulted in international action to mitigate climate change. Our research demonstrated that decarbonisation approaches in the wood related sector, combined with effective measures of biomass, leads to mitigation of impacts on climate change. Consequently, the Malaysian Government, Ghanaian Government, European Islands Authorities and Romanian Government amended their national policies to motivate landowners and wood\-based resource users to include mandatory Monitoring Reporting and Verification criteria. BNU researchers co\-established with a number of businesses in European Islands, Ghana, Romania and Malaysia support for carbon mitigating plans, resulting in the total investment of £2.5 million towards the decarbonisation of rubberwood sawmilling in Malaysia, decarbonisation of coastal Tourism in European Islands, and the protection of forest in Romania \(200,000 hectares\) and Ghana \(400,000 hectares\). Our research underpinned a natural resources\-based climate mitigation scheme resulting in the investment of an additional £1.4 million in decarbonisation initiatives.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The world’s natural resources influence climate through a complex set of physical, biological and chemical processes that affect the planet’s energy balance, atmospheric composition and hydrological cycle. In turn, climate change impacts upon resource availability leading to interlinked interactions and feedbacks between natural resources and climate. Florin Ioras and Ioan Dutca have led research to improve the understanding of these processes, and this research has subsequently allowed decarbonisation initiatives to be crafted that effectively mitigate climate change. 

 The terrestrial ecosystems, with special emphasis on forest ecosystems, are important components of the global carbon cycle. They contain immense reservoirs of carbon and can remove significant amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, so contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Although there has been some research into carbon storage in lowland tropical forests, observations in temperate ecosystems are limited. 

 Work conducted by Ioras in Zambia and Ghana on REDD\+ \(Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\) between 2014\-2016 has influenced the national Forestry act and enabled the country to trade carbon credits worldwide \[1\]. In 2016, Ioras co\-authored a study on non\-conformities in several EU countries including the UK, concluding that minor non conformities were more frequent and were influenced in occurrence in the majority of the cases by country economic development \[2\]. 

 An article co\-authored by Ioras in 2017 reported some of the first observations of carbon storage and sequestration in rubberwood in Malaysia.  This paper demonstrated that the carbon sequestered by protecting and restoring forests is considerably greater than the carbon emissions avoided through the use of liquid biofuels. This research group was the first to highlight the large land\-use carbon emissions that result if forests are cleared to make way for biofuel crops \[3\]. Further research on carbon footprint in Malaysia challenged the green label status of rubberwood because of the inefficient processing technologies. 

 Climate change also impacts forest ecosystems. In 2018, Dutca and Ioras led a project that calculated that effect and subsequently the impact of climate change. The research was based upon historical data on the relationship between site exposure and biomass values, and the predicted modelling patterns that are likely to arise as climate change proceeds \[4\]. 

 In 2019, Ioras evaluated the extent to which practicing architects in Malaysia were familiar with timber products as a construction material \[5\]. This was the first study to use observations to demonstrate how, by boosting the material’s use in the construction industry, architects can support a decarbonisation strategy in Malaysia. 

 In 2020 Dutca and Ioras co\-authored an article which demonstrated that forest carbon estimations depend on the selection of sample trees. The results help partitioners selecting the sample trees characteristics in such way that prediction of biomass is accurate and precise \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Established forest\-based climate mitigation schemes leading to government and environmental policy change** 

 BNU co\-supported and implemented forest protection projects to access funds from private forest owners in Romania. Working in partnership with the Transylvania University and Private Forest Owners Association the Public Private Partnership \(PPP\), and launched in co\-operation with the World Bank, these initiatives brought together national business, non\-governmental organisations and academia to drive climate change mitigation. In Romania, the General Manager of Husqvarna states that the partnership enabled *‘…rural tourism operators in forested areas to access renewable energy’* and that it provided *‘…support for different levels of energy access through a forestry based mitigation scheme*’ \[ **H**\]. Collaboratively, with these organisations, BNU had established a database of forest protection projects, which is used to match EU businesses interested in carbon sequestration to the most relevant forest protection projects in Romania. BNU supported a detailed assessment of these projects against community, climate and biodiversity criteria. This thorough academic assessment has given confidence to private sector investment in forest protection through environmental security outputs. 

 The Public Private Partnership Project \[ **C**\] has allowed the Ghana Forestry Commission to generate significant awareness that has, according to their Director of Operations *‘…yielded a number of new investors in the sector and contributed positively to support carbon sequestration policy at national level*’ \[ **C**\]. In 2016, Ioras was invited by the Ghana Forestry Commission to write quarterly market reports on tropical timber markets to support national policy underpinned by REDD\+ \(Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\) for carbon sequestration \[ **C**\]. The Director of Operations acknowledges that the reports by Ioras have *‘…promote\[d\] our lesser known timber species and our country ambition to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation*’ \[ **C**\]. The Project Manager of The Forest Investment Programme continues: ‘ *At country level this project has been instrumental in supporting* \[Ghanaian\] *policy on de\-carbonisation through agro\-silvopastoral initiatives around the cocoa plantations*’. 

 In 2014, Ioras provided research evidence and debate \(1\) to contribute to a decision in December 2017 by the Zambian Forestry and Forest Industries Corporation to amend the Finance Law. This was to include outcomes and recommendations made to facilities for carbon credit brokerage such as the trading program called the Clean Development Mechanism \(CDM\), which, for the first time, address carbon benefits from the forestry sector with encouraging results. The Director of Corporate Communications at the Corporation acknowledges that the project ‘ *has been successful* *indeed*’ and that ‘ *The outcomes and recommendations have been adopted and the results has \[sic\] been encouraging’* \[ **G**\]. 

 **Influenced the Romanian government and partner organisations to consider Climate Change and forest\-based climate mitigation schemes both in policy and practice** 

 As a result of their research into allometry \(6\), Dutca and Ioras contributed to the drafting of scientific policy documents for the Romanian National Panel on Climate Change \[ **A**\] and their work conducted on forest protection and reforestation supported the integration of sustainable development principles into their definition and implementation. Similarly, through Norwegian FORCLIMIT programmes, Dutca and Ioras provided presentations and draft policy documents to staff responsible for informing Romanian government bodies on climate change; these included EC DG Research and Innovation, the European Science Foundation and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. As highlighted by the UNECE report ‘ *The influence of the research carried out by the carbon group at Buckinghamshire New University has ensured that forest policy, and the potential of carbon sequestration trades, are now being considered in depth alongside potential solutions to the problem such as improved biodiversity conservation and the role of Carbon resource for Romanian* \[sic\] *economy*’\[ **I**\]. 

 The research has also been used as evidence in drawing up the Romanian FORESTRY Act in 2018; and has been incorporated into national and international strategies \(e.g. National Research Council of the National Academies 2010\). In Romania there was explicit reference to Buckinghamshire New University’s carbon sequestration and allometry work by Dutca \(http://www.mmediu.ro/app/webroot/uploads/files/2015\-09\-24\_Raport\_Mediu\_CRESC\_final.pdf \) in advice received by the Romanian Government on drafting a biodiversity and conservation and forestry\-based climate mitigation scheme for private landowners. The Romanian Academy of Scientists acknowledge that *‘A number of IP components developed … in the field of forest certification, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration have improved the sustainable management of forest, the performance of carbon sink and facilitated the transfer of carbon credits value to land restoration projects*’ \[ **A**\]. 

 **Supported EU and Malaysian economies through decarbonisation of sport marinas, carbon storage in temperate forests and the mandatory use of timber in housing policy** 

 The underpinning research has impacted both the EU and Malaysian blue economies respectively. After the reports on socioeconomic impacts in European islands for 2030–2100  were published \[ **D**\], Ioras was invited to lead a project on decarbonisation of sport Marinas in Europe, where he argued that climate change impact on sport marinas combined with decarbonisation initiatives will bring benefits to the marina and the surrounding areas \[ **E**\]. As the President of the Associacao Comercial E Industrial Do Funchal, Madeira attests, ‘ *\[BNU’s\]…teamwork with over 20 national and international organisations has enabled our Marinas to deploy a pro\-active resources \[sic\] management approach, based on sustainable water use and adaption of waste management systems aided by green technology.*’ The President continues ‘ *The Madeira Chamber of Commerce and Industry…*’ estimate the ‘… *financial/economic output as a result of collaboration has a total… estimated value of around Euro 1.1 million. This takes account \[sic\] of the environmental security outputs and the sustainability of our marinas*’ \[ **B**\]. 

 The research that quantified carbon storage in temperate forests \[3\] supported the Romanian Government to develop the *‘…protection and administration of environment*\[al\] *components for sustainable development’* and to make *‘improvements…* \[to the\] *monitoring system of environment*\[al\] *factors’*, all key elements of the Romanian National Development Strategy \[ **A**\].  Over the period 2015 to 2019, the scheme has resulted in the investment of over US$1.6 million in forest protection and reforestation activities across Romania \[ **A**\], of which the Brasov County Councillor *‘…acknowledge*\[s\] *a total value of avoided emissions of about 620,000 tons of carbon dioxide’* \[ **C**\]. About the work delivered by the team at BNU he concludes ‘ *Your team work on sustainable management that support* \[sic\] *our national initiatives for meeting the Paris Agreement is commendable’* \[ **A**\]. 

 In 2018, Ioras provided research evidence and debate to contribute to a decision in December 2018 by the Malaysian Government to amend the House Law to include mandatory use of timber based products in their housing policy, which for the first time addresses carbon emissions from this sector. The Senior Director involved states ‘ *Your work on timber use in domestic dwellings has been instrumental to support the amendment of House Law. The department… is undertaking the necessary steps to evaluate the existing policy related to the matter*’\[ **F**\]. This policy amendment ensures that the timber\-based products used in Malaysian properties contribute to the sustainable use of natural forests due to 7% increase in wood use in 2020 \[ **F**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Do extreme events have to turn into disasters with huge losses of life and suffering? Dercon’s research shows that by planning ahead and, in particular, by putting in place insurance\-based financial instruments to fund relief efforts, the costs of extreme events may be mitigated. This framework, set out in his 2016 book *Dull Disasters? How Planning Ahead Will Make A Difference,* has transformed the approach to disaster\-risk financing adopted by the Department for International Development \(DFID\), the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the World Bank, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \(OCHA\). Dercon’s recommendations have led to these organisations putting in place anticipatory financing mechanisms to ensure timely, cost effective and reliable funding in response to extreme events, and to provide incentives to build resilience. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A long\-standing focus of Professor Dercon’s research has been the costs to impoverished people in terms of their lives, livelihoods and assets from exposure to extreme events and how these might be mitigated. His research was the first to quantify the long\-term consequences of the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, identifying the effects on the physical well\-being, education, and earning capacity of infant survivors, twenty years after the event **\[R1\]**. In this paper, and other research **\[R2\]**, he shows that the impact of famine relief efforts such as ‘Live Aid’ are marginal at best and often statistically insignificant. 

 In other work, Dercon examines why insurance against extreme natural events is so limited. He focuses on mechanisms to address the underlying ‘market failure’ that leads to the lack of an insurance market. Standard indemnity insurance products that are based on declared losses by the policy holder have proved not to be feasible due to high transaction costs and problems of moral hazard. An alternative is parametric \(index\) insurance products, which are triggered on the basis of some objective observable indicator \(such as rainfall level\). However, the take\-up of these insurance products by vulnerable households tends to be low due to lack of trust and poor understanding, and the vast majority of people remain unprotected. In **\[R3\]**, Dercon and co\-authors demonstrate the possibility of improving uptake through the provision of group\-based products. Dercon concludes that relying entirely on private insurance products to protect large vulnerable populations is unrealistic and risks exposing them to considerable hardship, and therefore effective public responses remain a key requirement **\[R4\]**. 

 Between 2011 and 2017, Dercon was seconded to the UK Department for International Development \(DFID\) as Chief Economist while retaining a part\-time academic position at the University of Oxford. In this role, Dercon observed the limitations of existing public responses at times of crisis, whether from within countries or as international relief efforts. For Ebola in West Africa, between 2014 and 2016, drought in Ethiopia in 2015, and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, public responses came late, were poorly prepared, and underfunded. In their book *Dull Disasters* **\[R5\]**, Dercon and co\-author Daniel Clarke \(Oxford DPhil 2007\-2011 and Senior Financial Sector Specialist at the World Bank, 2012\-2016\) synthesize learning from earlier research **\[R1\-4\]** and direct experience to set out the problems that can cause extreme natural events to turn into disasters and to provide solutions. They argue that the main problem lies in a funding model based on a ‘begging bowl’ approach that relies on appeals to the UN and donor governments, on fundraising by NGOs after the disaster struck, and on political pressure to reallocate funding in government budgets **\[R5\]**. The solution lies in a co\-ordinated plan for post\-disaster action with, most importantly, financing on standby to ensure that the plan can be implemented **\[R5, pp 3\-6\]**. Dercon makes the case for a publicly\-funded insurance\-based systems with pre\-agreed financing mechanisms \(such as sovereign insurance, catastrophe bonds and pre\-committed donor finance\) to fund disaster response plans that are determined in advance. Pay\-outs under these arrangements are triggered by objective data \(such as wind speed, Richter scale reading, or number of drought days\) as they are for index insurance products. The title of the book, *Dull Disasters*, highlights its goal of making disasters less ‘exciting and adrenaline fuelled’ events by offering well\-prepared, more effective, well\-targeted responses and a framework of lessons and principles to guide future thinking and practice.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since the publication of *Dull Disasters* **\[R5\]**, Dercon’s framework has been adopted by several organizations, leading to major policy innovations at DFID\*, the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the World Bank, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \(OCHA\). These organisations have each implemented a range of significant and pioneering activities to operationalise Dercon’s proposed framework that aim to bring insurance\-like approaches \(based on pre\-agreed financing including from insurance markets\) into the responses to humanitarian crises and natural disasters. 

 ‘*Dull Disasters, alongside the World Bank’s DRFIP* \[Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Programme\] *and the Red Cross forecast\-based financing work, has helped build political consensus in the UK and globally that has led to work on establishing anticipatory financing mechanisms within the* \[UN\] *Central Emergency Response Fund \(CERF\) and the IDA* \[International Development Association\] *Crisis Response Window…*\[this\] *has led to the exploration of anticipatory financing mechanisms across several countries and humanitarian agencies \(Malawi, Kenya, Afghanistan, Somalia, and WFP* \[World Food Programme\] *, FAO* \[Food and Agriculture, UN\] *, ICRC* \[International Committee of the Red Cross\] *, IFRC* \[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\] *, Start Network etc\).’* Former DFID lead advisor on Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance and current Senior Consultant on Disaster Risk Finance within the World Bank Group **\[E2\]**. 

###  DFID: Creation of The Centre for Disaster Protection 

 According to the former DFID lead advisor on Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance  it is: ‘… *no overstatement to say that ‘Dull Disasters’ transformed the way that DFID thought about the role of disaster risk financing, its linkages to humanitarian financing and UK objectives on Humanitarian Reform… The transformation that ‘Dull Disasters’ ignited led to, for example, the creation of a new team in DFID \(that I led and worked closely with Stefan and his former student and collaborator, Dr Daniel Clarke\) that worked to develop and operationalise the framework postulated by Dull Disasters within DFID’* **\[E2\]**. 

 The proposal for a Centre for Disaster Protection within DFID was announced by then UK Prime Minister Theresa May at the G20 meeting in July 2017, stating that it ‘ *will use world\-leading UK expertise and innovation to help developing countries strengthen disaster planning and use insurance to provide more cost\-effective, rapid and reliable finance in emergencies, such as the severe drought in East Africa. This will reduce the need for expensive humanitarian aid, reassure private investors and help people rebuild their lives. Insurance protection built through this centre could provide £2 billion when crises hit to ensure that the high costs of disasters aren’t borne by people or businesses trapping them in cycles of poverty*’ **\[E3\]**. The approved Business Case **\[E1\]** extensively and directly references *Dull Disasters* and Dercon’s research as the framework and source of inspiration for the centre. The centre became active in 2019 with Daniel Clarke as its first Director and is initially funded by GBP30,000,000 from Prosperity Fund and GBP3,000,000 from Commonwealth Summit 2018\-20 Fund **\[E4\]**. London\-based, it is a partnership between the UK Government \(DFID and the Government Actuary’s Department\), the World Bank, leading research institutions and the private sector. 

 Early benefits of the Centre for Disaster Protection include the provision of technical assistance to the Caribbean, the Association of South East Asian Nations \(ASEAN\)’s new regional risk pool, Indonesia, the Philippines and Kenya **\[E6, p.2\]**. Key activities include Disaster Risk Finance training to executives in South Africa, the Caribbean and Asia and innovation labs prior to the replenishment of the International Development Association \(IDA19\) **\[E5, E6\]**. 

 The basic concepts and frameworks put forward by *Dull Disasters* have inspired, through the Centre for Disaster Protection, a series of wider innovations in the use of disaster\-risk finance for broader applications including the establishment of an Innovation Lab, in partnership with Lloyds of London, focused on developing new financial instruments that combine incentives for resilience with risk transfer, such as Resilience Impact Bonds **\[E4, pp.3\-4\]**. Work is also underway by the Centre for Disaster Protection and the International Rescue Committee on how risk financing can be used to speed response in refugee crises **\[E5\]**. 

###  World Bank: Creation of the Global Risk Financing Facility \(GRiF\) 

 A Multi\-Donor Trust Fund designed in partnership by DFID, the World Bank and the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development \(BMZ\), the GRiF was launched in October 2018, with over USD200,000,000 in pledges from Germany and the UK. Utilising the framework described in *Dull Disasters* **\[R5\]**, the GRiF’s objective is to strengthen the financial resilience of vulnerable countries by enabling more timely and more reliable responses to climate and disaster shocks, ‘ *and over time to a wider range of crises, through establishing or scaling up pre\-arranged risk financing instruments, including market\-based instruments like insurance’* **\[E7a\]**. The former DFID lead on Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance states: ‘ *I led the design and implementation on DFID side until January 2019, and now have some involvement in the projects it funds on the World Bank side. On this DFID side, this was directly inspired by ‘Dull Disasters’, and I worked closely with Stefan Dercon and others in the early stages to design the underlying structure and principles that guide the operation of the Facility*’ **\[E2\]**. 

 The GRiF co\-financed a range of World Bank projects with the International Development Association **\[E7b\]**. Projects include the ‘Resilient Livelihoods Project’, designed to improve resilience among the poor and vulnerable population of Malawi, to which USD125,000,000 has been designated. By March 2020 nearly 128,000 people had benefitted from the resulting Social Cash Transfer programme **\[E7d\]**. In Mozambique, USD132,270,000 was assigned to support Mozambique’s Disaster Risk Management and Resilience Programme, which seeks to improve Mozambique’s financial protection against natural disaster, strengthen disaster preparedness and response, build climate resilience into vulnerable education infrastructure and establish a sovereign risk financing program. It is estimated that the programme will directly benefit a total of 3,360,000 people **\[E7c\]**. 

###  IMF: Informing Policy on Small States’ Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change 

 The framework underpinned policy proposals presented within an IMF Board Policy Paper in 2016 on small states’ resilience to natural disasters and climate change, highlighting the need to increase focus on preparedness and funding **\[E8\]**. The new policy has been implemented in the Seychelles, where climate change, compounded recently by El Nino, has put Seychelles’ archipelago and biodiversity systems at risk. The IMF’s June 2017 Country Report outlined how Dercon’s Risk Management framework might be applied to the Seychelles **\[E9, p.16\]** and further cited his research multiple times **\[E9\]**. 

  

###  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \(OCHA\):  Influencing Policy Change and Humanitarian Outcomes 

 The Under\-Secretary\-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator invited Dercon to New York in January 2019 to work with his team to improve their approach to humanitarian financing, and thereafter took ‘ *direct action to implement some of the policy recommendations from Dull Disasters in OCHA’s work’.* He describes how they: ‘ *initiated work to develop OCHA’s policy position on anticipatory action for natural disasters, modelled closely on the conclusions of Dull Disasters. This culminated in… our collaboration with the World Bank on their Famine Action Mechanism, and pilots through the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund \(CERF\) to respond to drought in the Horn of Africa. The launch of anticipatory action pilots in the CERF led to increased donor support, in particular from the UK and Germany, resulting in a historic record year of funding of over $800m.’* **\[E10\]**. 

 This initiative has had profound impacts in mitigating the consequences of disastrous situations. In 2018, Madagascar faced ‘… *one of the largest outbreaks* \[of plague\] … *in decades’* with more than 2,700 cases predicted between August and October **\[E10, E11\]**. Through the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund \(CERF\), OCHA provided USD1,000,000 to interrupt disease transmission through community engagement activities. In total, the CERF funds benefitted 1,460,000 people and only 250 cases \(including 50 deaths\) were reported in that period **\[E11\]**. 

 In July 2020 a high probability of severe flooding was forecast for mid\-month along the Jamuna river, Bangladesh. This triggered the immediate release of USD5,200,000 from a CERF pilot **\[E10\]** to help communities urgently prepare and protect themselves. Before the event it was anticipated that some 61,500 families in the flood plains would receive a one\-off unconditional cash transfer of 4,500 taka \(USD53\). This release of funding is the first time CERF has been used in this way and was the fastest CERF allocation in history – within four hours of the trigger being activated, the delivery agencies had been given authority to spend the money **\[E12\]**. 

###  Summary of Dercon’s Research Impact: 

 The Under\-Secretary\-General, and former Permanent Secretary for the UK’s Department for International Development \(DFID\) says ‘ *Professor Dercon’s work set out in ‘Dull Disasters’ is having an impact on the lives of millions of people affected by crises and is playing a significant role in re\-shaping the way in which the global humanitarian system is meeting the challenges of the next decade’* **\[E10\]**. 

 \*Note – DFID was merged with the Foreign Office in June 2020 to create the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at the University of Southampton studying the effects of time\-limited, early institutional deprivation on development as part of the world\-renowned English and Romanian Adoption \(ERA\) study, have generated impact across clinical and social work, public policy, and educational sectors. 

 1\)  Child clinical and social care practice: Our work changed understanding of attachment in children and young people who are adopted from care, in care, or at risk of going into care \(e.g., The National Institute for Clinical Excellence, NICE, 2015\) and influences current clinical, child and family welfare practice. 

 2\)  International campaigns to end institutional care for children: Non\-governmental and inter\-governmental organisations use the work of the ERA study \(e.g., Better Care Network, 2019, LUMOS Foundation, 2019; UNICEF, 2015\) to inform their campaigns which influenced the UNGA Resolution on the Rights of the Child in December 2019. 

 3\)  Education: Our ERA study is used as an example to teach about risk and resilience associated with exposure to early severe neglect at A\-level and university level \(e.g., it is a case study in the AQA Psychology A\-level curriculum and higher education\-level textbooks\). 

 Our research has also received international media attention for example via the BBC, Deutschlandfunk, and special interest outlets such as German Ärzteblatt, the official journal of Germany’s leading medical bodies, and the Mental Elf.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The pioneering research of the ERA study, set up and led by Professor Sir Michael Rutter, has been undertaken jointly at the University of Southampton and KCL since 2003. Core members of the ERA study team were all employed by the University of Southampton during the recent phases of the study \(e.g., Kreppner since 2007, Sonuga\-Barke until end 2016\). ERA researchers have produced over 60 scientific publications relating to institutional deprivation, of these more than 40 were authored by Southampton researchers and cited over 3000 times \(see **5.15**\). 

 **Background to ERA study:** ERA is the first comprehensive prospective longitudinal study of the long\-term effects on development of early severe deprivation following adoption. It systematically documents the development of a representative cohort of ‘Romanian orphans’ who were raised in the institutions of the Ceausescu regime during infancy and early childhood and who were subsequently adopted by families living in the U.K. Children and their adoptive families were assessed when children were 4, 6, 11 and 15\-years old and in early adulthood \(aged 22 \- 25 years\) \[ **3.1**\]. 

 **Methods & Scientific Strengths:** Based on a ‘natural experiment’ design, the ERA study comprises a representative sample of 165 Romanian adoptees, removed from their depriving circumstances aged only a few weeks to 43 months old. ERA includes a comparison group of 52 non\-deprived within\-UK adoptees, all placed before 6 months of age. Children and their families were assessed using a multi\-method and multi\-reporter approach. The range of assessments included interviews with parents and children/young people, questionnaires completed by parents, teachers and adoptees, standardised cognitive and achievement tests, behavioural observations, DNA and cortisol sampling, and brain imaging. ERA’s core research questions concern \(i\) the impact of such severe early deprivation on children’s psychological and social development and the extent to which recovery is possible, and \(ii\) how adoptions from such severely depriving circumstances would work out and what the needs would be of the families and children. 

 **Summary of key findings:** At the time of adoption, the severity of developmental delay and ill physical health of the children was evident. On average, the children were reported to function at a developmental level of two to three standard deviations below the expected levels for their age. They were equally severely delayed in their physical growth and many presented with significant health problems, including respiratory, skin, and gastro\-intestinal infections \[ **3.2**\]. 

 By the time the children were 6 years old, substantial recovery in psychological, social and physical development was noted but a significant minority presented with a surprisingly specific set of psychological difficulties involving autistic\-like features, disinhibited social engagement, inattention and overactivity and cognitive impairment. Difficulties in these areas persisted for many across childhood and adolescence and was associated with experiencing prolonged deprivation lasting beyond the first 6 months of life \[ **3.3**\]. Importantly, most of the children adopted from institutions before 6 months appeared to have ‘caught\-up’ with the non\-deprived comparison group by the time they were 6 years old, and they remained indistinguishable from the non\-deprived UK adoptees across adolescence and early adulthood \[ **3.1**\]. ERA’s work on attachment has changed our understanding of attachment and associated disorders following early deprivation \[ **3.4**\]. Importantly, our most recent data provides the first evidence of the long\-term neurobiological toll of childhood deprivation demonstrating that it is related to alterations in adult brain structure despite intervention through adoption in early childhood into caring, supportive families \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Taken together, the work by Southampton researchers on the long\-term impact of institutional deprivation has significantly influenced knowledge, practice, and policy across clinical, social care, educational and scientific communities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **i. Changing our understanding of attachment and attachment disorders in children with histories of severe early deprivation and informing new treatment approaches:** ERA’s findings provided “ *crucial evidence to underpin the re\-classification of attachment disorders in the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \(DSM\-5; APA, 2013\) which is a manual for assessment and diagnosis of mental disorders used internationally by experts in all areas of mental health”* \[ **5.1**\]. ERA’s work has since been central to the new diagnostic classifications of early childhood disorders \(DC:0\-5; ZERO TO THREE, 2016, see \[ **5.1**\]\), which complements the DSM\-5, and the NICE guidelines \(2015\) on ‘Attachment in children and young people who are adopted from care, in care, or at risk of going into care’ \[ **5.2**\]. Specifically, ERA has provided evidence to enhance knowledge in this area as corroborated by Professor Charles Zeanah who states ERA has “ *contributed to a real shift in our understanding that variations in attachment security and insecurity are distinct from reactive attachment disorder \(RAD\) and disinhibited social engagement disorder \(DSED\)”* \[ **5.1**\] *.* This is also referenced in the NICE guidelines \[ **5.2**\] with explicit reference to \[ **3.4**\]: “ *A significant body of research has investigated the causes of variations in the attachment patterns shown by infants and young children. The evidence is quite clear that the causal factors giving rise to security versus insecurity are distinct from those influencing the development of attachment disorders \(Rutter et al., 2009\).*” \[ **5.2,** p.21\].  Zeanah adds “ *these are quite crucial distinctions that clinicians must appreciate.*” \[ **5.1**\]. In addition, the ‘American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry’s Practice parameters for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder’, co\-authored by Zeanah \[ **5.3**\] “ *relies in part on ERA’s findings”* as it is currently “ *the only data available for DSED presentation in young adulthood and the longest longitudinal study of disinhibited social behavior conducted to date*” \[ **5.1**\]. Dr John Simmonds, Director of Policy, Research and Development at CoramBAAF, Britain’s leading membership organisation of agencies and professionals involved in supporting children separated from their birth parents emphasises that *“The work of ERA has led to enhanced understanding and interventions of children with complex histories of deprivation and neglect. The research has informed a change in classification of these behaviours, documented in NICE guidance which has been crucial to developing changes to legislation that include improved assessment, treatment, support approaches, service provision and ultimately better outcomes for families.”* \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **ii. Influencing campaigns to end institutional care for children world\-wide:** Over the last 10 years, the number of children worldwide living in residential care has substantially reduced from an estimated 8 million to 2.7 million \(Petrowski, et al. 2017\). ERA findings have played an important role in forming a wider body of evidence that has contributed to global progress to better the lives of children without parental care. 

 Evidence from eight ERA scientific papers authored by Southampton researchers was included in the highly influential Berens and Nelson review 2015 \[ **5.5**\] in which the ERA study is explicitly mentioned \(i.e. six times\) to evidence the developmental sequelae associated with institutional care: *“The ERA Study published detailed results through to 17 years of age on the developmental outcomes* \[ *…*\] *with analysis indicating persistent developmental deficits associated with institutional care experienced past 6 months of age” \(p.391\)*, or *“… decreased head circumference among neglected children could arise from an excess of neural pruning in response to under\-stimulation. Supporting this contention, the ERA study noted that duration of deprivation longer than 6 months* \[ *…*\] *was associated with smaller head circumference independent of nutritional status” \(p.391\-392\)*. The Berens and Nelson review, informed by the ERA, was used to underpin **key recommendations** \[ **5.6a**\] for the 2019 United Nation General Assembly \(UNGA\) Resolution on the Rights of the Child put forward by the **Better Care Network \(BCN\)**, an international network of organisations and agencies committed to supporting children without adequate family care around the world, which promotes collaboration, research and information sharing, and advocates for changes to national and international policies to improve alternative care provision. In their key recommendations to the UNGA, the BCN emphasised the need to put an end to child institutionalization by highlighting the harm it does to children’s development. Specifically, **BCN key recommendation** **4a** *states “Recognize the harm of institutionalization and institutional care to children’s growth and development across domains and throughout the life\-course…” \(p.4\)*.  The evidence cited for this key recommendation is the Berens and Nelson review which explicitly reports the findings from our ERA study. The Resolution on the Rights of the Child was formally adopted by the UNGA on 18<sup>th</sup> December 2019, including the recommendation and commitment to put an end to child institutionalization \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Two additional campaigns, informed by ERA’s work, also targeted the same UNGA Resolution on the Rights of the Child: i\) LUMOS, a UK and US foundation created by author J.K. Rowling actively campaigns for ending institutionalisation of children across the world. ERA research \[ **3.1**\] informs Lumos’s recent report \(2019\) ‘A Goal Within Reach: Ending the institutionalization of children to ensure that no one is left behind’ \[ **5.8**\]; ii\) UNICEF’s \(2015\) Making Decisions For The Better Care of Children: The role of gatekeeping and strengthening the family\-based care and reforming alternative care systems \[ **5.9**\] discusses and references findings from the ERA study including reference to \[ **3.3**\]. Moreover, ERA’s recent findings \[ **3.1, 3.5**\] continue to inform the BCN via inclusion in their recommended evidence library \[ **5.6b**\] **.** 

 In June 2020, The Lancet Group Commission on institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation of children launched, which ‘advocates global reform of the care of separated children’. The Chair, Professor Sonuga\-Barke, PI of ERA’s young adult assessment phases, is senior author of the Commission’s systematic and integrative review of evidence regarding effects of institutionalization on development \[ **5.10**\]. This review extensively references the work by the ERA study team and explicitly discusses its findings \[ **3.1**\] “ *The clearest example of the relationship between duration of deprivation and the scale of post institutional recovery comes from the English and Romanian Adoptees study. In this study, even after 20 years in adoptive homes, children who had extended institutional care showed significantly elevated prevalence of autism spectrum disorder, attention\-deficits hyperactivity disorder, and disinhibited social engagement symptoms. Children exposed to shorter durations of institutional care were largely indistinguishable from the non\-deprived adoptive control group. This difference between children exposed to extended or short periods of institutional care was already established by the age of 6 years.”* \(p.714\). 

 **iii. Impact in Education:** The ERA study has become one of the most influential studies in developmental psychology and child psychiatry over the last 10 years, cited many thousands of times in the scientific literature. The most recent version of the AQA A level psychology syllabus, revised in 2015, specifically requires students to learn about Romanian orphan studies as an example of the effects of institutional care. \[ **5.11a, b**\]. Over 60,000 pupils were registered in 2020 for A\-level Psychology in the UK, about 80% of which study the AQA curriculum \[ **5.11a**\]. In 2016 the ERA team was invited to share their findings in the UK’s leading Psychology Review Magazine for A\-level students \[ **5.12**\]. This Magazine has approximately 3000 subscriptions in the UK and internationally \(as international schools often follow the AQA exam\), including students, teachers, and libraries. Our ERA article is re\-published by Hodder Education as part of a new resource called ‘Psychology Review: Exam Skills and Practice’, which combines new revision material and practice questions whilst incorporating past Psychology Review magazine articles. The re\-publication of ERA’s original article for this new resource underscores ERA’s critical relevance to the teaching and learning of A\-level Psychology with a three years sales projection of 7,750 \[ **5.11b**\]. Cara Flanagan, Senior Editor of Psychology Review states: “ *As the findings of the English and Romanian Adoption Study have been so influential in informing our understanding of the long\-term effects of early institutional deprivation on human development, Psychology Review was keen for the ERA team to share their most recent findings with our readership to provide a clear and up\-to\-date account of their results and conclusions. Their study is a model of good research as it has enabled controlled investigation of so many different aspects of child development.”* \[ **5.11a**\]. ERA’s importance in the field of developmental psychology is further reflected in its inclusion as a case study in many higher education\-level course textbooks nationally and internationally \[ **5.13a & b**\]. 

 **iv. Media coverage of Southampton’s research on the long\-term impact of early life adverse experiences:** ERA’s most recent young adult findings \[ **3.1, 3.5**\] have been widely discussed in national and international news and social media \[ **5.14**\]. According to Altmetric data \[see **5.15**\], both \[ **3.1**\]’s and \[ **3.5**\]’s attention scores places them in the top 5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric, and both are in the top 1% of outputs of the same age. Almetric data for our publication in the Lancet \[ **3.1**\] records >400 tweets by >370 tweeters with an upper bound of >1.5 million followers. The PNAS publication \[ **3.5**\] has >300 tweets with an upper bound of over 750,000 followers. Our publications \[ **3.1, 3.5**\] were reported in several national and international public media outlets \[ **see 5.14**\] including BBC articles on adopted Romanian children ‘still suffering in adulthood’ \(Feb 2017\), and ‘Neglected children end up with ‘smaller brains’ \(Jan 2020\). Further media coverage appeared in  [](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51010388)Deutschlandfunk \(Jan 2020\), and in Mental Elf’s blog \(Feb 2017\) ‘Early life deprivation, neurodevelopment, mental health and resilience: ERA study’. Both ERA articles are also discussed in the German Ärzteblatt, the official journal of Germany’s leading medical bodies, the German Medical Association and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Tierney’s research has enabled UK lawmakers to limit executive discretion in planning for Brexit. Through his role as one of two legal advisers to the House of Lords Constitution Committee, together with Mark Elliott \(Cambridge\), Tierney’s work shaped the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Act 2018 in two crucial ways: \(i\) clarifying the status of ‘retained EU law’ and case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union; and \(ii\) constraining delegated powers exercised by the UK Government, through ensuring rigorous scrutiny by parliamentary committees. These reforms curbed executive discretion and built vital safeguards for Parliament into the Brexit process. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The impact is underpinned by a programme of research on the UK constitution conducted by Tierney and Elliott, culminating in analysis of the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Act 2018 \(EUWA\) from the perspective of UK constitutional theory. Tierney’s main contribution concerns the supremacy of the UK Parliament, set out first \(with Loughlin, LSE\) in ‘The Shibboleth of Sovereignty’ \(3.1\), and developed further \(with Elliott\) in ‘Political Pragmatism and Constitutional Principle’ \(3.2\). 

 In this work, Tierney focused on the risks that the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Bill, later passed following significant amendments as the EUWA, posed to Parliament and especially to the appropriate limits of delegated powers. Three strands of research come together in his critique. 

1.  **Parliamentary supremacy**: Tierney and Loughlin addressed the amorphous nature of parliamentary sovereignty as a constitutional doctrine and, in parallel, the unclear status of Court of Justice \(ECJ\) case law within UK law \(3.1\). For his contribution, Tierney emphasised the lack of conceptual clarity that has afflicted the status of EU law within the UK, where parliamentary sovereignty competed with EU law supremacy, and argued that the original version of the Bill exacerbated this ambiguity, leaving UK courts without clear guidance for resolving post\-Brexit disputes. 

1.  **Rule of law**: Tierney and Loughlin argued that the conceptual problems affecting the status of EU law within UK law intensify through post\-Brexit retention of EU law within the national legal system. Tierney and Elliot emphasised that the Bill failed to distinguish properly between ‘pre\-departure’ and ‘post\-departure’ EU law \(3.2\). They warned that, as a result, ‘retained EU law’ would compete for status with other post\-Brexit UK law if the role of each category was not clearly delineated. That work exposed, once again, how UK courts would struggle to make sense of the complexity. Tierney further underlined the threat to the proper functioning of the constituent parts of the UK if rule of law parameters built into the devolution framework were not respected \(3.3\). In particular, he highlighted how the Bill promised extensive delegated powers for the devolved territories without any effective system for managing these in relation to UK powers. 

1.  **Separation of powers**: Tierney and Elliott offered detailed doctrinal critique of the rise of executive law\-making powers within the UK constitution; the dangers to Parliament of the shift in power to the executive; and the risks that this creates for the balance of powers within an unwritten constitution \(3.2\). This exposition built upon analysis of the history and supremacy of Parliament \(3.1\). Tierney investigated how committees can be used to ensure that secondary law \(law made by government ministers\) is subjected, first, to a filter to assess its significance and, second, to heightened substantive scrutiny, offering detailed, practical suggestions for how the Bill could be improved \(3.2\). These mechanisms, he argued, would help to rebalance powers under the Bill in favour of Parliament, particularly through the adoption of ‘sifting committees’ whereby Parliament can ensure heightened scrutiny of particularly important draft legislation.

 4. Details of the impact 

 The Brexit process is a huge undertaking requiring rapid legal change. The House of Lords Constitution Committee issued three reports on the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Bill \(5.1, 5.2, 5.3\), causing the Government to accept critical amendments, many in direct response to the Committee’s recommendations and alleviating serious constitutional problems in the original text. The constitutional danger was that the executive would have considerable unchecked power. Tierney and Elliott’s research on constitutional risks informed the Committee’s work in concrete ways and resulting recommendations accepted by the Government had a substantial impact on the constitutional efficacy of the final Act. Tierney was appointed as legal adviser to the Committee in 2015, an ongoing appointment since then. Elliott was co\-adviser from 2016 to 2019. As the Committee’s only legal advisers, Tierney and Elliott played a central role throughout the Bill’s process through Parliament. Their research underpinned advice on the Bill’s constitutional defects and achieved reform in three main respects. 

 \(i\) Retained EU law 

 Tierney and Elliott identified glaring inconsistencies in the status of ‘retained EU law’, highlighting problems for legal certainty and rule of law \(5.3, based on 3.1\). In particular, the Bill did not distinguish between technical matters and retained law of real substance. The Government accepted that the Committee highlighted *“undeniably an important issue”* \(5.5\) and it reshaped the status of retained EU law significantly, delineating ‘principal’ and ‘minor’ areas of law to which different forms of parliamentary scrutiny apply. 

 \(ii\) Court of Justice case law 

 Tierney and Elliott highlighted the vague status that ECJ case law would have after Brexit \(5.3\), emphasising how confusing this would be for Parliament’s own supremacy and for UK judges who could be drawn into political controversy – issues at the heart of rule of law \(3.2\). The original provision offered courts an open\-ended instruction to ‘have regard to anything done…by the European Court…if it considers it appropriate to do so’. Tierney and Elliott recommended that this provision be changed to ‘taking account of matters relevant to the proper interpretation of retained EU law’, which the Committee adopted \(3.2\). In light of the Committee’s recommendations, the Bill was amended and the EUWA, section 7\(2\), adopts this relevancy test \(5.4\). 

 \(iii\) Delegated powers 

 The Bill conferred extensive delegated powers to correct ‘failures’ or ‘deficiencies’ in retained EU law, heralding a fundamental shift in power from Parliament to Government. Tierney and Elliott advanced three main criticisms \(based on 3.1\). 

 *Breadth of power*: The Government agreed to accept a duty to provide an ‘explanatory statement’ when making secondary law, facilitating proper parliamentary scrutiny \(5.1, 5.3\). Significantly, explanatory statements have since been accepted for other bills. For example, a similar provision was inserted into the Sanctions and Anti\-Money Laundering Act 2018 following the Committee’s recommendation, again informed by Tierney and Elliot \(5.6\). 

 *Limited exclusions:* Tierney and Elliott criticised the unlimited range of discretionary powers in section 8 of the Bill \(5.3\), signalling that they could be used in constitutionally inappropriate ways to create new public authorities or amend the devolution statutes for Scotland and Wales \(3.3\). The Government accepted this criticism and the Bill was amended to ensure that section 8 cannot be used for such purposes. Tierney and Elliott also questioned an international obligations\-related power in clause 8 of the Bill. The Committee adopted this advice, leading to the removal of clause 8 through an amendment tabled in the Lords \(5.7\). 

 *Delegated powers*: Tierney and Elliott gave detailed advice on improved scrutiny of delegated powers. The Committee adopted their approach, asserting that the original provision \(clause 17 of the Bill\) seemed to permit very broad regulations to be made under the cover of ‘consequential’ measures \(5.3\). Key reforms are that stronger scrutiny is now in place for regulations that make policy changes and the creation of a ‘sifting committee’ to determine what these measures are \(5.4\). Another key recommendation was that delegated powers should be subject to a time limit. The Government agreed to a 10\-year ‘sunset clause’ \(5.3\). 

 These changes ensured for Parliament a significantly greater role in controlling the executive’s delegated law\-making power after Brexit *.* The Clerk to the Constitution Committee confirmed: *“The work of Professor Tierney and Professor Elliott on the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Bill assisted the Constitution Committee’s scrutiny of this important legislation and the influence it was able to bring to bear on the final form of the law”* \(5.8\).

 **1. Summary of the impact:** In Arab culture, the history of cancer is often the history of a silence \- of shame, taboo, prohibition and repression – and this silence particularly affects women. This case study outlines the impact arising from staging Arab women’s testimonies of their cancer experience both to the general public and to the medical community in Lebanon. The impact of this project includes: breaking the social taboo of cancer and minimising fear of it, influencing how doctors evaluate patient narratives of cancer, facilitating a support network for female cancer patients, creating a dialogue between the dramatic arts and the medical community in Lebanon and facilitating the implementation of an arts\-in\-health strategy at the Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute of the American University of Beirut Medical Centre. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research:** This case study emerges out of Abir Hamdar’s research expertise in Arab medical humanities and, in particular, her research on female illness, disability and cancer in Arab culture. Her monograph *The Female Suffering Body: Illness and Disability in Modern Arabic Literature* \(Syracuse University Press, 2014\) is the first major study of the representation of female illness/disability in Arabic literature and culture. The book highlights the culture of silence that surrounds female illness in the region and connects literary representations with wider cultural discourses on illness and disability. This book and two other research outputs make an original contribution to furthering research in the medical humanities in relation to Arab women’s illness narratives \[R1, R2, R3\]. 

 Building on her earlier work, Hamdar’s second research project on the Arab cultural history of cancer is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Open World Research Initiative. This is the first study to address the complex social, gendered and political discourses on cancer in the region and explores literary, filmic, theatrical and media representations of cancer. As part of her research on theatrical representations, Hamdar conducted ethnographic research \(in the form of personal interviews\) with female cancer patients from the Arab world \(Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Palestine\) in April 2016. In 2017, these testimonies formed the basis of Hamdar’s original play/ethnodrama *Wasafuli al\-Sabr* \[ *I Am Waiting For You*\], which draws on verbatim quotations from the interviews, recurring tropes that emerged amongst the interviewees as well as their emotional state to highlight women’s subjective experiences of the disease. This arts\-based research output dramatised the cultural taboo of cancer in the region, the implications of this \(self\-\)enforced silence on Arab female patients and the impact of the disease on women’s relationship with others – doctors, husbands, lovers, children, fellow sufferers \[R4\] with the intention of raising awareness of these issues to medical stakeholders and to relevant communities and institutions. Hamdar also wrote the script for a short film, which was based on the qualitative research. The film \(also entitled *Wasafuli al\-Sabr*\) was used as a video installation at the start of the play. In addition, Hamdar’s journal article on the Palestinian artist Rim Banna offers a cultural anatomy of the artist’s post\-illness body from her cancer diagnosis to her death \[R5\] while her article on staging silence offers a critical reflection on the fieldwork, methodology and creative strategies that informed the writing and staging of *I Am Waiting For You* \[R6\].

","
 **4. Details of the impact:** The case study involved the staging of Arab women’s real\-life testimonies of their experience with cancer. It is based on extensive interviews with female cancer patients and their family members, whose testimonies were then adapted for the stage. The outcome is a stage play/ethnodrama written by Hamdar, *I Am Waiting for You*, which premiered in Beirut, Lebanon in July 2017 \[R4\]. Further performances have taken place to medical staff and cancer patients at three leading University hospitals in the country as well as to the general public. **\[REDACTED\]** The performances in Lebanon were highly significant because Lebanon is the center of medical tourism in the region, the site of the Arab world’s most renowned medical school \(American University of Beirut/ American University of Beirut Medical Centre \[AUBMC\]\) and provides advanced cancer care to patients across the Arab world. Hospitals in Beirut are also regional centres of excellence for cancer treatment and influence cancer care across the Arab World. 

 The staging of the performance was undertaken in collaboration with the award\-winning Lebanese theatre director Lina Abyad. A cast of Lebanese, Iraqi, Palestinian and Syrian actors participated in the play, some of whom were cancer survivors or had lost family members to cancer \[R6\]. Two leading oncologists from the American University of Beirut Medical Centre acted as consultants on the project and facilitated the Q&As with the general public. The performance marked the first instance in which cancer testimonials were embodied on the Arab stage and performed to both the general public and to healthcare practitioners and trainees in the region. A documentary about the play, directed by Paloma Yañez Serrano, from the Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology at Manchester University, was screened at three international film festivals in 2018: the Estonia World Film Festival in Tartu \(attracts approximately 3,000 attendees\), the Pakistan International Film Festival \(PIFF\) \(1,766 attendees\), and the Film Festival of Zadar in Croatia \(E10c\). 

 In addition, Hamdar presented her research at a meeting organised by DIPEx International, an association of academic and non\-profit groups working to enhance understanding of health and illness experiences globally for communities, healthcare professionals and policy makers. This meeting took place on 5 November 2019 at the University Medical Center in Groningen, Netherlands \(approximately 150 participants\) \(E10c\). A screening of the film followed the presentation. In 2020, the script of the play was also turned into a video installation directed by the Lebanese film\-maker Dima Alansari and premiered at the Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute \(NKBCI\) of AUBMC to mark World Cancer Day. In total, approximately 1,200 cancer patients, medical staff and interns have watched the Hamdar\-scripted play and the film. Overall, the research generated four key strands of impact: 

####  Breaking Taboos and Lessening Fear of Cancer 

 The initial impact can be detected in the extensive media coverage of the play in national, regional and international newspapers, radio and TV \(15 reviews \+ 10 interviews \+ documentary\) \(E10\). The subject matter of the play and the Q&As that followed enabled it to play a key role in addressing a subject that historically, and even today, has the status of a cultural taboo. Some of the reviews described the play as follows: “taboo\-breaking” \( *al\-Akhbar* newspaper\); “De\-demonises Arab women’s cancer”, “participates in a profound humanitarian mission: to clarify, to console and to calm” \( *L’Orient Le Jour*\); and “a sophisticated, distinguished and brave work” \( *al\-Mayadeen.net*\) \(E10a\). Following the premiere of the play, an award\-winning Lebanese novelist and critic said that one of the distinct features of this play is that “despite our fear of cancer, we come out of this fear” and “we \[…\] become more able to discuss cancer” \(E7a\). 

 During the opening night of the performance, Iraqi actress and breast cancer survivor Namaa al\-Ward shaved her hair on stage to challenge the taboo of hair loss that Arab female cancer patients often experience. Al\-Ward also revealed her breast cancer scars on stage. Both acts were unprecedented in the history of modern Arab theatre and generated discussions on social media. A Lebanese journalist wrote: “I was so impressed by the courage to speak and especially to show … the one who has shown her scars, the classic symbols of femininity, breasts and hair. What courage and strength from her part … in a country that always wants to cover it up, deny it” \(E7c\). Commenting on the performance, the Clinical Professor of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology at AUBMC who is both the Director of the Breast Cancer Centre of Excellence at NKBCI and the Lebanese Breast Cancer Foundation, told the cast that the play “has achieved what takes us years to do”, i.e. raise awareness and alleviate fear of cancer \(E8\). 

 Overall, the public performances and the Q&As that followed challenged the general perception that cancer is an end\-of\-life experience and gave public voice to female cancer patients. To this end, comments and feedback from the general public repeatedly pointed to the fact that the play’s very subject matter was significant in breaking the taboo of cancer in Lebanon and the Arab world. Feedback also focused on the manner in which the subject was addressed with many stating that its approach had minimised their fear of cancer. Some of the comments included: “Thank you for making me realise that it’s fine to be open about it”; “Very daring”; “Humanisation replace denial and taboo”; “Makes you think and change your perception”; “Thank you for turning negativity and fear into positivity and strength”; “your play was a closure to my relative’s death from cancer”; “I am ready to face it now” \(E4\); “Thank you for making me feel like it is not the end of the world” \(E9\). 

####  Giving A Voice to Cancer Patients and Facilitating Support Networks 

 Following each public performance, and inspired by the stories embodied on stage and by the Q&As, many cancer patients and survivors spoke for the first time about their experience with the disease. In some cases, patients and their family members were able to share experiences for the first time: a woman who had kept her five\-year treatment a secret from her teenage children discussed her case openly, while a young man described the trauma he felt as a child at being kept away from his mother because he was not “supposed to know about her illness” \(E4\). In the words of the theatre director, “something very special is happening during these sessions. The theatre is transforming into a support group for cancer patients and their families” \(E5\). One actress also noted: “I feel transformed … I feel I have more room for emotional empathy and caring” \[E5, testimony 1\]. 

 In addition, cancer patients and survivors, medical experts, cancer NGOs and support groups were invited to participate in the public Q&As to facilitate dialogue, knowledge\-exchange and networking. To this end, three leading oncologists from the American University of Beirut Medical Centre and seven NGOs and cancer support groups \(including the Lebanese Breast Cancer Foundation, Spread Awareness Increase Detection \(SAID\) NGO and Balsam: The Lebanese Centre for Palliative Care\) participated in the Q&As.  SAID NGO also reserved one performance night to raise funds for Colorectal Cancer Awareness \(E6a\). Some cancer support groups noted that the number of patients who contacted them increased because of the performance. Overall, the performance and the Q&As created a new support platform which brought together health care professionals, patients and support groups in the same space for the first time as well as spreading awareness and synergies between existing groups. 

 Testimonials from cancer patients, physicians and cancer NGOs indicate that the performance and Q&As had a beneficial impact on cancer patients \(E4, E6\). In some cases, they helped cancer patients adopt a more positive approach to their treatment and in other cases they empowered female cancer patients by enabling them to confront some of the social challenges they were encountering. For example, a breast cancer patient who was being subjected to domestic violence because of her illness “went from being sorry for herself …to standing up for herself” and even decided to seek help from a local organisation that targets family violence \(KAFA\-enough\). As she told her physician, “watching the play gave me the strength to do this. I am feeling very empowered and I am going to change my approach” \(E6d\). Additionally, patients were able to seek direct support from cancer support groups, whose representatives were present at the performances \(E6\). 

####  Forging New Relations and Enabling Dialogue with Medical Community 

 Following the success of the public performances, the Lebanese American University Medical Centre\-Rizk Hospital requested a special performance at the hospital for its medical staff, interns and students on 8 August 2017. A Q&A with the medical community also followed. The performance marked the first instance in which Arab adult theatre was performed at a hospital. By enabling the dramatic arts to enter into dialogue with the medical community, the performance was able to forge new relations in which the dramatic arts play a role in informing patient care as well as promote new themes, contexts and audiences for the performing arts more generally. In the words of a renowned Lebanese actor, with this play Arab “theatre has taken a different turn \[…\] It is no longer simply art designed to treat society \[…\] it has become treatment for doctors and patients” \(E7b\). 

 Another special performance took place in Beirut on 8 February 2018 to mark World Cancer Day \(4 February annually\). The performance was hosted by NKBCI of the AUBMC, which is one of the leading cancer institutes in the region that offers medical care to patients across the Arab world and shapes cancer education and practice. The event took place on the premises of the hospital. The play was also the opening event of BBCC\-6: Annual Beirut Breast Cancer Conference which is organised by NKBCI. Over 200 national and international physicians, nurses, medical students and interns, as well as cancer patients and representatives of cancer NGOs, attended this performance and participated in the Q&As that followed. The significance of this event was multifold: 

-  It allowed the play to be performed both to leading physicians in the Arab world as well as to medical staff and patients at the centre. The additional performance also enabled the project to consolidate the relationship between the dramatic arts and the medical community established by its earlier hospital performance. In the words of the play’s director: “This production has offered us all, theatre makers, audience, doctors and patients the opportunity to meet. To experience theatre as a tool in the process of knowledge\-exchange is empowering \[…\]. This play proved \[it is\] a force of change and a tool for transformation” \(E5\). 

-  The performance prepared the ground for the implementation of an arts\-in\-health agenda that NKBCI has identified as part of its strategic aims. To quote the Director of NKBCI: “The play has paved the way for our new awareness strategy of combining arts and medicine. It has impacted the AUBMC family as well as our community. Such performances \[…\] should become the standard of communication within our societies for change to take place in people’s attitude \[…\] towards cancer” \(E1\-Letter\). 

-  Hamdar’s work on this play led to her appointment as Creative Consultant at NKBCI where she will support the delivery of an Arts\-in\-Health programme over the next four years \(E1\-Memorandum\). 

 In addition, the play was performed at the Nabih Berri Government University Hospital in the South of Lebanon on 1 December 2018, thus allowing engagement with hard\-to\-reach areas and with medical practitioners who deliver healthcare in rural parts of the country. 

####  Informing How Doctors Evaluate Patient Narratives 

 The play’s focus on patient testimonials had an impact on physicians’ understanding and perception of patient narratives and subjectivity. While cancer treatment in Lebanon and other parts of the Arab world has a good reputation, little attention has been paid to patient narratives. By highlighting women’s individual experiences with the disease as well as their affective response to oncologists and their clinical practice, the play provided new insights for understanding patients’ experience of cancer. In the words of the Professor of Clinical Medicine and Chair of the Department of Internal Medicine at the Lebanese American University School of Medicine and LAUMC\-Rizk Hospital, the play “led us to question ourselves and to reevaluate our approach to patient care and self\-education. I believe that this play is a landmark in the area of reality theater and a must in medical education” \(E2\). An oncologist at LAUMC\-Rizk Hospital also told the cast after one hospital performance: “I never realised this is how my patients felt when they came to see me” \(E3\). A general medical practitioner also felt that the performance and the post\-play discussions allowed “us not just to empathise but to understand” the experiences of cancer patients \(E3\). A medical student at LAUMC\-Rizk hospital also wrote: “This was meaningful art…it has been incredibly beneficial to me both as a med student and a human being more importantly” \(E9\). Finally, following the success of the play, the cast will continue to perform it independently of Hamdar’s work.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 St Andrews Classics research on military culture and practice has changed perceptions of ancient Roman military society and influenced present\-day military culture. Our research has expanded modern understanding of ancient military culture and its ever\-pressing relevance for the modern world. The research has led to better understanding of the influence of historical events on individual and group attitudes and behaviours in modern conflict zones, and has helped to improve relationship\-building \[text removed for publication\]. In addition, our research has shaped the cultural sector by influencing curatorial practice in 7 museums \(21 exhibits between 2014 and 2019, including the Victoria & Albert, London in 2017\), by influencing theatrical practice in 1 theatre company, and by influencing 4 military reconstruction groups as well as 7 high\-circulation magazines. Moreover, through sustained engagement with museums \(e.g. Victoria & Albert, London; Arles, France; Koblenz, Germany\) and regular and specialist press \(e.g. *National Geographic*\), this research has directly engaged approximately 10,500,000 and reached approximately 44,540,000 people \(general public\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 St Andrews research into ancient military identity, visual imagery and writing underpins this impact case study. This work centres around research on ancient constructions of military identity by both soldiers and civilians \(R1\-R3\), and on military discourse and the evolution of military ideas in a range of ancient cultures \(R4\-R6\). 

 Research by Coulston on ancient constructions of military identity is in three related areas of Roman archaeology: \(i\) Trajan’s Column in Rome \(R1\), \(ii\) soldiers and military equipment in figural art \(R2\), and \(iii\) the imagery created for and by Roman soldiers, especially cavalrymen, in the culturally diverse frontier region of Hadrian’s Wall, UK \(R3\). Trajan’s Column has been central to the study of ancient warfare, imperialism, and triumphal display since the Renaissance, influencing 19<sup>th</sup> century painters and 21<sup>st</sup> century filmmakers alike. Coulston’s current research \(including analysis of the sculptural frieze directly accessed via scaffolding covering the monument, on visits conducted between 2014 and 2017\) builds on a much larger body of work going back four decades. He has also conducted extensive comparative study of military artefacts and iconography from other archaeological contexts, across the territory of the former Roman empire. His research demonstrates how the Column provides a view of military achievement and of the roles of soldiers in Roman society as seen from the imperial capital \(R1\). 

 He has published research on arms and armour, archaeological *corpora* and comprehensive regional and subject studies: for example, analysis of figural gravestones and other monuments depicting Roman cavalrymen \(R3\), sculpture found along Hadrian’s Wall, and the standard work on Roman military equipment \(R2; Spanish edition 2016\). His research has transformed understanding of how soldiers were represented and perceived in Roman society, including issues of their training, identity, status, welfare, trauma experience, societal dysfunction, and family dependents. The range of his projects illuminate continuities and changes over time and place, allowing for more nuanced appreciation of Roman military society as a comparative window into modern military cultures. 

 St Andrews research on the evolution of Greek and Roman military ideas and their influence on other cultures and communities, ancient and modern, focuses on three interlocking areas, \(i\) ancient technical writing \(R4\-R6\), \(ii\) interplay between battle narratives and discourses of war in ancient and modern cultures \(R5\), and \(iii\) interactions between Greek, Roman and ‘barbarian’ military thinkers and soldiers in the Roman empire \(R6\). König’s publications have shed new light on classical military theory and on ancient methods of learning and teaching strategic leadership and decision\-making. In showing, for example, that some ancient military handbooks function like battle\-simulation exercises \(R4\), König has enhanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between ancient military theory and practice, and illuminated the role played by exemplary anecdotes in shaping military mindsets and proficiency. Her study of Medieval and Renaissance uses of ancient military handbooks has underlined the powerful resonance of historical narratives in visualisations of future war, leading to new research on the complex feedback loop between narrative and reality in the planning, conduct and prevention of armed conflict \(R5\). In 2017, König co\-founded an interdisciplinary research network \(‘Visualising War’\) to explore the ways in which ancient battle narratives migrate across different genres and media, in different periods and places, canonising particular ideals about military culture and practice, and shaping different communities’ discourses of war. From this project, several of König’s contributions have emerged: 

-  her field\-changing research into literary and cross\-cultural interactions in the Roman empire \(R6\), which has pioneered new methodologies for studying the transmission of values and ideas between different cultures; 

-  more recent publications have explored how the accumulation of battle narratives from many different periods and places in Frontinus’ *Strategemata* might have complicated Roman definitions of and attitudes to ‘civil’ war \(R5\); 

-  how military experts from different cultural communities in the Roman empire exchanged military know\-how and represented their respective military identities \(R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Coulston and König’s research has enhanced the experience of defence professionals, museum professionals, broadcasters, theatre professionals, re\-enactors and school teachers, delivering significant social, cultural and educational benefits: \(a\) by equipping over 100 people \(serving soldiers\) with historical knowledge and cultural understanding that enhances their operational effectiveness, and \(b\) by shaping the cultural sectors through influencing curatorial and theatre practices, military reconstructions, and high\-circulation magazine articles. 

 **Enhancing Military Training: Professional Development for Cultural Advisors in the Army, Navy and RAF** 

 König has helped improve the cultural awareness and decision\-making abilities of cultural advisors in the Army, Navy and RAF. \[text removed for publication\] Her teaching drew directly on her research into ancient military training manuals \(R4, R5, R6\), the feedback loop between battle narratives and behaviours in military contexts \(R4, R5\), and cross\-cultural interactions in the Roman empire \(R6\). The soldiers she trains need to be able to \[text removed for publication\]. The overarching goal of these courses was to improve the operational effectiveness of British armed forces at home and abroad. Evaluation of course feedback by \[text removed for publication\] reveals that König’s use of ancient military history and texts has positively influenced trainees’ role\-preparedness and decision\-making in the field. \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Shaping the cultural sectors through influencing curatorial and theatre practices ** 

 Since 2014, our research has transformed curatorial and theatre practices regarding the Roman army and war narratives, primarily through promoting a series of events in the cultural sector. Testimony collected at these events demonstrates the benefits delivered to a variety of constituencies, specifically museum and gallery professionals, the museum visiting public, theatre professionals, and the theatre\-going public. 

 Coulston has been instrumental in restructuring several museums and exhibitions, which has in turn influenced museumgoers’ understanding of the place of the Roman army in its contemporary society. In 2014\-15, Coulston worked with McManus Galleries in Dundee to produce the Roman armour display for the  [*Power & People*](https://www.dca.org.uk/assets/general/McManus_Roman_Empire_Exhibition.pdf) exhibition. He advised on captions and images for the exhibition and gave gallery talks and a public lecture, ‘Roman armour’ \(see R1\). This exhibition attracted 50,583 people \(visitors\), 15% higher than its average attendance numbers \(S2\). In addition, the exhibition led to a change in museumgoers’ habits, with 22% saying they would be more likely to attend other cultural events after this, as well as opening up collaborations for the McManus with the British Museum and other collections \(S2\)., as well as opening up collaborations for the McManus with the British Museum and other collections \(S2\). Similarly, through Coulston’s work with English Heritage, refurbishing the museums along Hadrian’s Wall at Corbridge \(the largest site\-based collection of Roman sculpture in Britain\), Housesteads \(Northumberland; the most visited Roman site in northern Britain\), and Birdoswald \(Cumbria\). Coulston wrote the consultation document and the full captioning for all sculptural and epigraphic exhibits at Corbridge and Housesteads, many of which vividly present Roman soldiers to the modern viewing public \(S3\). This work was instrumental in increasing footfall at Corbridge from 16,000 to 25,000 people \(visitors\) \(S3\). Museum visitors came away from the exhibitions with a new appreciation for the place of the Roman army and soldiers’ own self\-understanding. The value of this consultation is summed up by the Senior Curator at English Heritage: “ *Dr Coulston has contributed to five projects over the past decade. His advice and academic analysis has helped steer research strategies, improve object catalogues and enabled English Heritage curators to deliver more nuanced and informed exhibition content, drawing on the most current academic thinking*” and “ *The input of Dr Coulston over the past 10 years…is crucial if we are to present the most up to date analysis, and interrogate our collections to bring out new and engaging narratives for our visitors*.” \(S3\) Between November and December 2017, Coulston advised on the Casts Court project at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, dedicated to the restoration and cleaning of the only ‘assembled’ cast of Trajan’s Column. This helped disseminate knowledge of the monument’s creation, recording, preservation and modern reception among museum visitors \(footfall of approximately 4,400,000 people \(general public\) in 2017\-18\), but also had a direct effect on the museum staff. According to the Senior Sculpture Conservator at the V&A, Coulston’s St Andrews  [website](https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/trajans-column/) on Trajan’s column \(based on R1\) was a key resource for V&A staff: “ *we referred to this often and followed up references suggested on the website*”, and “ *V&A colleagues agree with me it has be \[sic\] a valuable aid to our understanding and interpretation of the form and narrative of our Museum object*.” \(S4\). Coulston also wrote the keynote paper for the exhibition catalogue for an exhibition on the Roman army at the Musée départemental Arles antique, “ *France’s top\-ranking provincial museum in terms of Roman Archaeology, with \[approximately\] 160,000\-200,000 \[people\] visitors annually*”. The resident archaeologist confirmed the exhibition “ *was of tremendous success, since 41,390 people came to see it between the 15th of December 2018 and the 22nd of April 2019, despite the tense local situation due to the ‘Yellow Vest’ demonstrations in full swing at that time …\[it\] is to a great degree due to Dr Coulston’s involvement, and its impact will be long\-lasting through his important contribution to the exhibition catalogue*” \(S5\). 

 König has also helped change thinking about war narratives in the cultural sector, through her consultancy work in 2019 and 2020 with  [NMT Automatics](https://nmtautomatics.com/) theatre company, which updates classical texts to give them relevance for a modern audience, fusing dance and drama and taking music as a primary source of inspiration. König’s work has helped to inform the creative practice of this up\-and\-coming theatre group: “ *König’s research… has had an enormous impact into the way we have approached creating a show*”; “ *Her research has given us an impetus to explore the way we, as performers, can break cyclical habits of visualisation, and impact a general public in a way which edifies their acuity in regards to war*.” \(S6\). Through the mouthpiece of NMTA, König’s research on perceptions of warfare, ancient and modern, has also won a wider audience via the webinar of Love, War, Myth and Reality’ of the  [Army at the Fringe event](https://www.armyatthefringe.org/virtual/two/love-war-myth-and-reality/), launched 19 August 2020. 

 **Increasing public awareness of the Roman Army through influencing historical re\-enactment and high\-circulation magazines** 

 In addition to museum and theatre collaboration, St Andrews research \(as described in Section 2\) has also increased awareness of the Roman army through public re\-enactment events. Coulston organized the Nineteenth International Roman Military Equipment Conference \(RoMEC XVIIII\) at St Andrews in 2016, taking the theme ‘Cavalry in the Roman World’, and incorporated both a dedicated session for planning the *Hadrian’s Cavalry* exhibitions, and mounting a tactical display by two reconstructed Roman cavalrymen. The conference series is inclusive, appealing to a broad, interested public, with the approximately 100 people \(attendees\) having varied interests and backgrounds. According to the Head of Programmes and Collections at Tyne & Wear Museums: “ *This event provided an unheard of opportunity to bring academics, museums professionals, heritage resource managers and members of the general public together in an open forum to plan and discuss exhibition organisation, themes and content.*” \(S7\) Sustained involvement with cavalry projects thereafter led to Coulston’s collaboration in *Hadrian’s Cavalry* \(between April and September 2017\), a multi\-location exhibition held in 10 museums along Hadrian’s Wall \(UNESCO World Heritage Site\). This led to a “ *12% increase in visitors to the Wall and garnered international coverage*” \(S7\). Coulston advised on the acquisition of loan\-objects, gallery design and reconstruction of cavalry equipment. This climaxed with the *Turma\!* event in Carlisle \(1\-2.7.17\), featuring 30 people \(Roman riders\) in a unique re\-enactment of exercises described by the Roman writer Arrian \(S7\). Audience feedback for this event was extremely positive: for example, “ *The Turma was awesome*”; “ *Turma was a real experience of Roman history*” \(S7\). 

 Similarly, Coulston gave 9 talks and seminars for re\-enactment groups in New Zealand \(July\-August 2019: Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin\), holding workshops with members of the public in order to advise on equipment and improve reconstructions. In the words of an Associate Professor at the University of Auckland: “ *This instilled a renewed ethos of faithful reconstruction within these groups, brought them up to date with the latest archaeological finds and developments, and directly impacted their construction and display practices for the future*.” \(S8\) 

 Finally, St Andrews research has engaged wide public audiences through influencing high\-circulation publications in 7 popular magazines. Among these, Coulston contributed to graphic reconstructions and text for a major article on ‘Trajan’s Amazing Column’ in *National Geographic* \(227.4, 2015, 116\-29; online version is available here:  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan\-column/article.html](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/article.html)\), for which the gatefold won gold in the prestigious Malofiej graphic design prize for 2016 which is “ *akin to winning an Oscar in the infographics field*” according to the Senior Artist at National Geographic \(S9\). In 2016, National Geographic had a  [worldwide circulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic) of approximately 6,100,000 people per month, with a worldwide readership of approximately 30,000,000 in 41 languages \(S9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Professor Laura Bear has provided anthropological insights to Covid\-19 responses at the highest levels of the UK Government. Bear is the only anthropologist to be a member of the central coordinating group of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours and the Ethnicity subgroup, which deliver expert advice to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) on behavioural interventions. She has introduced a social calculus \(reduction of inequality and prevention of adverse impact on disadvantaged/minoritized groups\) to government policy. Since March 2020, her work has significantly impacted scientific advice provided by SAGE to the Covid\-19 Strategy and Covid\-19 Operations committees in No. 10 and to the Health Secretary. In addition, her work has directly led to policy design in the Government Communication Service Behavioural Science Unit, Public Health England, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Bear has conducted extensive work on the anthropology of policy, including analysis of the effects of austerity on relations of care and kinship **\[1\]**. Drawing on long\-term ethnographic research funded by the ESRC among precarious workers in India, she has stressed the need for government decision\-making to be informed by a “social calculus” and new practices of the public good that prioritise the reduction of inequality **\[1\] \[2\]**. The social calculus measures policy according to whether it improves the capacity of precarious communities to plan for the future and the extent to which it reduces entrenched disadvantage **\[3\] \[4\]**. Unusually this approach considers impacts on relations of social reproduction and kinship. Continuing this research in the UK as part of the ESRC\-funded Rebuilding Macroeconomics project, Bear argued for attention to be paid to whether fiscal and welfare policy allows community networks of care and family relations to thrive **\[5\]**. The ethnographic methodologies she deploys are uniquely suited to reveal the multilayered impact of government decision\-making on communities. 

 Bear’s expertise in the anthropology of policy and ethnographic methods, and the concept of the social calculus, in particular, led to her being invited in late March 2020 to join the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours \(SPI\-B\). At the same time, she convened a group of LSE anthropologists to research the unequal impacts of the Covid\-19 pandemic on communities and their networks of informal and formal care in the UK \(funded by an LSE Covid Rapid Response Grant\). Under Bear’s leadership this group has conducted rapid\-response research throughout the pandemic **\[6\]**, focusing especially on disadvantaged and minoritized communities in London and the Midlands. This research has been ongoing and responsive to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) and government department policy needs, feeding via Bear’s contributions into 14 evidence papers and policy measures related to co\-production, care, and community support. It has also provided an independent analysis of community concerns, charting the following, in particular: excess death and commemorations **\[7\]**; an increasing care gap in areas of multiple deprivation; new forms of mutuality and community self\-help linked to local authority pandemic responses; and rising forms of stigma and exclusion **\[6\]**. 

 As its first project, the LSE group, led by Bear, carried out a public survey and 58 cross\-community interviews leading to the report, “‘A Good Death’ During the Covid\-19 Pandemic in the UK” **\[7\]**. The report explored the ways in which government communications and policy could be used to support and prepare communities and households for Covid\-19 deaths. Research explored “what a good death looks like” for people across all faiths and especially for disadvantaged groups. It examined how communities were already adapting to processes of dying, burial, funerals, and bereavement during the pandemic, and how they were responding to new government regulations. The report focused specifically on five moments in the process of death: pre\-admission; hospital admission; disposal and release of the body; funerals; and bereavement. It proposed policy measures to ameliorate the experience of loss and foster social cohesion in each of these settings. These included the assertion of a right to a dignified death for all communities, with a prioritisation of this in all future social restrictions; compassionate government communications around the scale of the national loss; dignified practices of death in hospitals and in crematoria; and special targeted communications for those bereaved as a result of Covid\-19. 

 Bear then directed the LSE group, from April 2020 to the present, in a study of how national and local social restrictions had disrupted formal and informal support networks, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged and minoritized groups **\[6\]**. This work \(based on extensive interviewing over several months and a survey of 3,800 people\) shows that, because government policy was initially blind to the significance of community care and kinship, it had broken relationships essential to socio\-economic life in the UK. Its pandemic, social welfare, and economic policies at first did not recognise the new care burdens emerging at the local level. Alongside this, austerity had undermined essential financial support, links, and information exchange between third sector, voluntary, and community organisations and local authorities. This left the UK ill\-prepared to deal with and recover from the pandemic. Further problems were caused by a rise of political blame narratives and a stigmatisation of minoritized communities or places under lockdown, particularly as national restrictions changed into local interventions from June 2020 onwards. In addition, government rules were difficult to follow and caused alienation because they ran against the grain of social practices of childcare, religious life, and elder care, while prioritising economic opening. These rules and policies have caused particular problems for the extensively networked families of minoritized or socio\-economically disadvantaged groups, undermining government legitimacy. The research also gave a detailed account of the ways in which the pandemic had reverberated through, and caused deep distress to, the community and relational life of those in other sectors. Overall, social recovery and cohesion were potentially placed at risk as a result of policies that had not yet fully adopted a social calculus **\[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bear is currently the only anthropologist member of SPI\-B and the Ethnicity subgroup of SAGE. This position has enabled her to contribute a unique perspective based on a social calculus to the UK Government’s handling of Covid\-19 policy. She has led on or co\-authored 14 papers for SAGE on key strategies related to: support bubbles; social restrictions and interventions; ethnicity and Covid\-19 disparity; co\-production; and community aid initiatives **\[A\]**. She has also worked with the Cabinet Office, Civil Contingencies Secretariat \(CCS\), Public Health England \(PHE\), and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\) on the design of communications and policy. 

 **Informing new policy relating to the management and commemoration of death**The “Good Death” report **\[7\]** was produced in response to an urgent CCS and Government Communication Service Behavioural Science Team \(GCS\) request to investigate how to deal humanely with excess death during the first wave \(47,243 excess deaths from 7 March to 8 May 2020 in England and Wales; 37,295 Covid\-19\-related\). They wanted to understand attitudes and practices towards loss, funerals, and burial among different ethnic and faith communities. The research revealed a common concern across all communities, which was that they wanted a dignified process of death enabled by access to relatives in hospital, larger observances at funerals, and national acknowledgement of the traumatic losses occurring. In addition, the report recommended that particular effort should be put into briefing and funding bereavement charities. Once finished, the CCS and GCS circulated key insights to communications teams in the Department of Work and Pensions, HMRC, Ministry of Justice, MHCLG, and the Daily Covid Conference Briefing Team **\[B\] \[C\]**. As a result, on 15 April the Health Secretary announced a range of new policies that would give families the “right to say goodbye to loved ones” in care homes, hospitals, and at funerals, and for the first time acknowledged the national losses occurring **\[D\]**. This humane policy, emphasising the right to a dignified death and altering the experience of mourning the dead for families across the UK **\[E\]**, has continued through the second lockdown. 

 The influence and value of the ""Good Death"" report has subsequently been confirmed by the GCS Cabinet Office Behavioural Science team leaders: "" *The 'Good Death' report was one of the most influential pieces of external research that we have been able to draw on during the CV19 pandemic...\[It\] has helped the GCS Behavioural Science team put anthropological approaches as one really key learning of what communications should draw on going forward, and we embedded the 'Good Death' report also in more tangential communications challenges such as communicating with the BAME community \(where we were able to draw out differences between groups and their socio\-political relevance\). It has changed our Behavioural Science approach to incorporate anthropological ways of thinking about problems, and we will be looking into deepening our own expertise in this area, too*"" **\[B\]**. Furthermore, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser has described how the report has been “ *recognised as a paper of particular distinction and impact by colleagues in the Cabinet Office*"" **\[A\]**. 

 **Changing the UK Government’s approach to care** 

 In the first wave of the pandemic from March to April 2020, families were unable to form support bubbles, except for childcare between separated parents. In early May, as SAGE were considering how to open up after the national restrictions, they asked SPI\-B to explore the behavioural considerations around social bubbling as practiced in New Zealand, Canada, and Guernsey. Bear was asked to lead on this paper and to consider the social support implications and behavioural effects of the sequencing of allowing various households to join. Drawing on the concepts of a social calculus **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\] \[4\] \[5\]** applied to the specific community and kinship structures of the UK, she recommended that social connections between households should be allowed early in the reopening of UK society **\[F\]**. This policy recommendation was designed to relieve the burdens of care in UK families and enable extended networks of socio\-economically disadvantaged and minority groups to reconnect for support. It was also intended to signal the importance of mutuality and care as central to government policy. This advice was conveyed through SAGE to No. 10 committees dealing with the pandemic. The government subsequently prioritised childcare ties between all households and single individuals joining with households in their 11 May 2020 recovery plan. Bear drew on the ongoing findings of the LSE Covid and Care Research Group **\[6\]** to amplify and extend this advice on social connections to SAGE and the Ethnicity subgroup and the range of permitted support bubbles has been greatly extended **\[G\]**. In addition, bubbles were deployed during Christmas to enable families that had been apart for a long time to meet in areas of the country where transmission levels permitted **\[H\]**. The Government Chief Scientific Adviser has attested to the usefulness of Bear's input and the continuing influence of her advice: "" *In particular, advice titled 'Well\-being and Household Connection' \(14 May 2020\) which Prof Bear was the lead writer on, contributed to support bubble policies deployed by the government in the recovery from the first wave, and which have continued through the Christmas period and now as we emerge from the second wave*"" **\[A\]**. He also highlighted her contribution to the Ethnicity subgroup which led SAGE “ *to focus on household transmission in general and its specific risks for some groups, which will be particularly important as we embed new practices in everyday life to emerge from the second wave*"" **\[A\]**. Bear held the government to account in relation to these issues by authoring a newspaper article and Lancet article **\[I\] \[J\]**. The impact of a changing government approach to the significance of care relations and social support can be seen in the current regulations **\[K\]**. 

 **Altering the UK Government’s approach to local interventions** 

 In the government’s 11 May 2020 recovery plan, “local lockdowns” were an important means of preventing and limiting the transmission of Covid\-19. A priority was to manage new outbreaks by detecting infection “hotspots” and using targeted measures to tackle these. Effective local lockdowns were integral to the release of the national lockdown: by controlling the spread of the virus within a particular area, they were intended to delay the need to re\-impose social distancing restrictions across the whole country. 

 However, the ongoing research by the LSE Covid and Care Research group on the effects in the first local restriction area, Leicester, demonstrated the great social costs of this policy **\[6\]**. Not only was social support restricted, causing care burdens to intensify, but also social cohesion and the legitimacy of the measures were adversely affected. PHE were also concerned by the potential negative effects of local interventions and asked Bear to carry out some rapid\-action research for them in Leicester, which was also shared with the Cabinet Office **\[L\]**. At the same time, SPI\-B, with co\-authorship by Bear, presented a briefing to SAGE **\[M\]**. This drew directly on the research carried out at LSE and a paper on co\-production co\-authored by Bear **\[N\]**. This paper emphasised how a more just set of social policies could be generated even in rapid response situations by prioritising engagement with “local experts”. These were not people in formal roles, but individuals who sit at nodes of dense interconnecting social networks and can speak to a variety of experiences. These engagements would need to go beyond well\-known “leaders”, to explore a range of usually excluded perspectives including those within sub\-communities. The paper encouraged deep reflection on the part of local authorities on who their key communities were. It also recommended that existing spaces of mutual engagement between communities should be the setting for these consultations. The aim of these would be not just to give feedback on policy but to develop different policies at the local level in relation to particular situations. 

 The SPI\-B local interventions briefing recommended this form of local planning through co\-production with regional public health teams; public health officers in the local authority in consultation with a wide range of communities. It also suggested the renaming of local lockdowns as “interventions”. This terminology was subsequently reflected in government guidance for local decision\-makers on containing Covid\-19 **\[O\]**. Even more importantly, co\-production and ethnographic research were embedded in PHE to ensure consultation and co\-production in areas of local intervention. A broader debate on local interventions also began in the press, holding the government to account **\[P\]**. As stated by the PHE Head of Behavioural Science Covid\-19 Behavioural Science and Insights Unit, research by Bear and her team “ *has been pivotal to the strategies of local social interventions during the Covid\-19 pandemic, through rapid responsive research and evaluation, and the use of ethnographic methodologies… \[it\] contributed to the implementation of PHE and its partners’ local response. We began to focus on liaisons with local authorities and community groups and started to use more extensive ethnographic methods and evidence to generate greater co\-production*” **\[L\]**. 

 **Initiating community responses and new forms of co\-production** 

 The importance of community consultation and co\-production in generating policy moves in line with a social calculus is at the core of Bear’s research **\[1\] \[6\]**. This has now become central to the UK Government’s response to preventing transmission, improving vaccine uptake, and developing greater health equity. Bear co\-authored a briefing for SAGE on Community Champions as a response to dealing with the pandemic, particularly among disadvantaged and minority communities **\[Q\]**. This included findings from the LSE Covid and Care Research Group in relation to the importance of cooperation between local community groups and local authorities in responding to public health and trust issues around Covid\-19 **\[6\]**. As a result of this, Bear has been directly advising MHCLG on the design, implementation, and evaluation of its Community Champions policy since October 2020. Drawing on her recommendations on supporting community recovery, co\-production, and cooperative efforts in areas of multiple deprivation worst hit by the Covid\-19 pandemic, 60 local authorities are now running Community Champion schemes with government funding to achieve these ends **\[R\] \[S\]**. MHCLG intend this approach, based on a social calculus, to be the foundation for a more equitable recovery from the pandemic across the UK **\[T\]**. Bear's research and advice have been vital to the development of this programme, as confirmed by the Deputy Director, Faith Integration and Communities at MHCLG: "" *Professor Bear has since October 2020 provided crucial advice that has been central to our design, implementation and evaluation of our new MHCLG Community Champions programme...It was on the basis of \[her\] writings and our weekly conversations that we formulated our approach to the Community Champions initiative. Professor Bear contributed directly to the overall design, call for proposals from local authorities, training, and evaluation process. Her ideas, writings and assistance have led to the current success of the programme which is running in 60 local authorities in the most deprived areas of the UK*"" **\[T\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 The pressure for better policies and practices to promote desistance from crime is a longstanding problem for criminal justice systems and the societies they serve. Strathclyde’s research around supporting desistance \(giving up crime\) and social integration has driven the introduction of a new desistance\-informed, strengths\-based assessment and short\-term intervention framework across the Scottish Prison estate. It has also directed a shift in governance practices in community justice contexts leading to the diversification of and innovations in service delivery and provision, and shaped policies encouraging service\-user involvement in community justice. Furthermore, it has incentivised the development of new work integration social enterprises in both Scotland and Canada; informed Scottish legislation on progressive approaches to the disclosure of criminal records; and encouraged policy\-makers across the UK to recognise the need to develop work integration social enterprises in justice contexts to address labour market inequalities for people with convictions.

 Scotland’s prison population, per capita, is the highest in Western Europe, and the proportion of people under community supervision is the highest in Europe. This signifies a rapid expansion in recent years in the numbers of people involved in the justice system, the collateral consequences of which include widening inequalities and social marginalities. Despite policy commitments, existing rehabilitative endeavours are limited in their capacities to ameliorate these effects and support the social inclusion and \(re\)integration of people with convictions. Indeed, while desistance is both the implicit focus and intended outcome of penal policy and practice, the dominant short\-term focus on abstinence from/reduction of offending, which is characteristic of contemporary rehabilitative practices, is limited in its efficacy at supporting longer\-term behavioural change. Contemporary rehabilitative practices tend towards risk\-focused, programmatic models of intervention which are implemented in a one\-size\-fits\-all manner, concerned with ‘correcting’ thinking and behaviour. Evidence suggests that such interventions may be effective at reducing re\-offending in the short\-term, but are insufficient to support desistance in the longer\-term, which requires a different set of practices that are strengths\-based, personalised, enable participation and support social integration. Led by Weaver, Strathclyde’s programme of research helps address this problem by exploring and advancing innovative justice approaches. 

 Seeking to explore new desistance\-supportive interventions based not only on ‘what works’ but also on *how* and *why* change happens, Strathclyde has undertaken a series of mixed\-method, empirical and participatory action studies in collaboration with policy\-makers, practitioners and people with convictions. Notable projects include: 

-  **The importance of social relations in offending and desistance** \(Weaver, 2009\-2015\): This project included a detailed investigation to understand the role of a co\-offending peer group in shaping and influencing offending and desistance. The research took the form of life story analysis, examining the onset, persistence and desistance of criminal activity among men who previously comprised a gang, which revealed the relative contributions of individual actions, social relations and social systems to both offending and desistance \[ **R1**\]. 

-  **Management of High Risk Offenders under Multi\-Agency Public Protection Arrangements \(MAPPA\)** \(Barry and Weaver, 2013\): This project used interviews with 26 professional respondents \(9 probation; 5 police; 12 policymakers\) and 26 service\-users to explore professional and user experiences and perceptions of the high\-risk offender community supervision process and outcomes in an English Probation Trust \[ **R2**\]. 

-  **Custody to Community Voice: An Evaluation** \(Weaver and Barry, research leads 2014\-2016\): This mixed\-method evaluation of Prison and Community Councils encompassed 6 prisons and 3 Community Rehabilitation Company \(CRC\) areas in England and included 235 initial and follow\-up questionnaires, 301 initial and follow\-up Intermediate Outcomes Measurement Instruments completed by Council participants, and 68 interviews with Council members, User Voice, prison and CRC staff and senior managers \[ **R3**, **R6**\]. The findings highlighted the ways in which User Voice Prison Councils have contributed to improvements in prison governance and practice but emphasised the need for greater engagement with front\-line staff to increase buy\-in and reduce resistance. 

-  **The Role of Social Cooperative Structures of Employment** \(Weaver, 2015\-18\): This ESRC\-funded investigation into the role of social cooperative employment structures comprised observations and interviews with 22 prisoners/former prisoners and 18 professionals across 3 social cooperatives in Italy; interviews with 24 professionals \(95% from disadvantaged backgrounds\) and ‘participants’ across 8 social cooperatives in Sweden; and interviews with 54 staff at three social enterprises in the UK providing paid employment to people with convictions \[ **R5**\]. 

-  **User Engagement: A pan\-Ayrshire project** \(Weaver, Lightowler and Moodie, 2016\-19\): This project used action research, participatory community planning, community mobilisation and knowledge exchange undertaken with service\-users and professionals involved in Community Justice Services across Ayrshire’s 3 local authorities to inform and support the design, development, implementation and review of a multi\-layered service\-user involvement strategy/plan and practice. The research culminated in the publication of a practical guide to service\-user involvement in community justice entitled *Inclusive Justice: Co\-producing Change* \(June 2019\). 

 These studies provided original insights into the type of relational contexts within and through which social integration and desistance can be ‘co\-produced’, and how such practices can be developed and realised; the role of social cooperatives/enterprises in supporting social integration and desistance; and user\-involvement and co\-productive approaches to designing, developing and delivering justice services. The **key research findings** were: 

-  Desistance occurs in and through social relations and taking a relational approach can inform how practitioners might reconfigure relationships between individuals, groups and communities to ‘co\-produce desistance’ through innovative, integrative and inclusive policies and practices that harness their experiences, expertise and resources e.g. via peer\- and co\-productive practices, asset\-based and participatory approaches, mutual aid and social cooperatives/enterprise \[ **R1**\]. 

-  Social cooperatives/enterprises providing holistic, multi\-sectoral practical and relational support in addition to paid employment are particularly effective in supporting desistance, work and social integration. Those which include diversely situated people, and that practice co\-operative values and principles, co\-produce the relational contexts and cultures that can support desistance and social integration, with particular reference to the development of bridging and linking social capital, their participative nature, collectivist values, community focus and solidaristic characteristics which foster cultures of acceptance, belonging and mutual support \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. 

-  User\-involvement, participatory, integrative and co\-productive approaches to ‘rehabilitation’ are inherently more inclusive and empowering than the short\-term focus of many existing practices. Such approaches can improve service effectiveness; enhance feelings of trust and respect between professionals and service\-users; and support processes of change and social integration \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R6**\]. 

-  Given the centrality of employment to sustaining desistance, and the importance of reducing existing barriers to work integration as a consequence of contact with the justice system, a closer policy relationship between community justice and social enterprise is required. Broader legislative and policy reform around the nature of non\-conviction information, and the lengths of time criminal records are disclosed, is also needed \[ **R5**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through sustained and responsive engagement with a wide range of bodies concerned with community justice, Strathclyde’s research has directly informed policy and practice in Scotland \(with broader influence across the UK and in Canada\) leading to the enhancement of justice services and advances in social integration and desistance. Since 2014, the research has: 

-  Improved relationships and experience for prisoners, prisoners’ families, and officers in Scotland through provision of a participatory/co\-productive assessment framework. 

-  Enhanced service development and delivery in Scotland by enabling diversification and innovation through Co\-productive Community Justice Councils. 

-  Encouraged new models of prison industry and work integration in Scotland and Canada by informing and supporting the work of social enterprises. 

-  Shaped legislation, social policy and practice to address labour market inequalities for people with convictions in Scotland and the UK. 

###  Improved relationships and experience for prisoners, prisoners’ families, and officers 

 On the basis of Weaver and Barry’s research into the supervision of high\-risk offenders \[ **R1**, **R2**\], the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\) commissioned Strathclyde to develop a distinctive participatory/co\-productive assessment framework for short\-sentenced prisoners and support its implementation through prison officer training. Intended to provide an alternative to existing risk\-based rehabilitative approaches, the resulting AIRMAPS framework – designed to assist officers to support desistance, identifying and enhancing prisoners’ strengths and social resources within and beyond the prison sentence – was piloted in 7 Scottish prisons between September 2015 and March 2016 and subsequently rolled out across the Scottish prison estate. Confirming that this was ‘the very first person\-centred asset\-based approach to be implemented within the SPS *’,* the Director of Operational Delivery acknowledged the positive outcomes achieved through the application of Strathclyde’s AIRMAPS framework, including improved relations, behaviour changes and positive aspects for prisoners \[ **S1**\]. 

 A 2016 independent evaluation involving 427 prisoners across 3 prisons observed the following benefits: improved relationships and trust between staff and prisoners, and between some prisoners and their family/friends; shifts in prisoners’ confidence, self\-esteem and attitudes towards change; and an improved relational environment and atmosphere \[ **S2**\]. A number of examples were cited, including a prisoner who reported: ‘I’ve built a really good relationship with…staff \[and\] my son that I never had contact with before, and that’s come out of AIRMAPS’, and another who reflected: ‘It does make you think, “Why did I do that?” and… it does make you pinpoint things’ \[ **S2**, p.53\-55\]. Staff also noticed a difference in their practice. A case manager noted: ‘It’s like night and day. Before there would be no chat… but now you have to engage with them and… \[that\] can break down a lot of barriers’ \[ **S2**, p.55\]. 

###  Enhanced service development and delivery in Scotland 

 Building on the Custody to Community Voice research \[ **R3**, **R6**\], in 2016 Community Justice Ayrshire commissioned Strathclyde to establish the UK’s first 3 co\-productive community justice councils, bringing social workers, service\-users and other agencies together to influence service development and delivery. From 2017, around 200 individuals participated in peer support and related activities. North Ayrshire County Council described the initiative as ‘the first of its kind’ and ‘a significant shift in justice social work’ \[ **S3**\], and all 3 Ayrshire authorities employed former offenders as development workers. As one worker explained, their role in co\-producing service changes and providing peer support gave them a ‘chance at a new life. I’m clean, I’m providing for my family, my Mum is proud of me, and I’m helping \[make\] a difference to other people’s lives. It’s a million miles from where I thought I would be’ \[ **S4**\]. 

 Service\-users reported ‘a sense of purpose . . . positive relationships and increased confidence’, and co\-produced interventions included a support needs questionnaire, film events, a mentoring service, peer support/mutual aid groups, a community gym, football tournaments, and a community breakfast. Participants felt ‘encouraged and inspired . . . to drive forward changes in their own lives’, with one stating ‘I feel that my voice is heard for the first time. That I matter’ \[ **S3**\]. 

 Practitioners experienced enhanced motivation, confidence and new interpersonal and professional skills. A Justice Services Manager reported social workers feeling ‘more motivated … it has changed the way they approach service\-users and…enhanced their understanding of the experiences of those involved in the justice system . . . they are developing more confidence in terms of pursuing innovations in practice’ \[ **S3**\]. One social worker said: ‘It has changed my approach . . . broken down some of the barriers . . . \[and\] helped relationships improve, leading to better outcomes for Service\-Users…Working in this new way has become infectious. . . \[and\] we are seeing results’ \[ **S5**\]. 

 In 2019 a fourth local authority, East Dunbartonshire, implemented the justice council model, and in 2020 this model informed work ongoing in Stirlingshire. 

###  Encouraged new models of prison industry and work integration in Scotland and Canada 

 Established in 2015, ‘Freedom Bakery’ was the first Scottish prison\-based social enterprise providing employment plus post\-release opportunities. The scheme was extended to 3 Scottish prisons, and by November 2019 had provided 32 day\-release training placements and employed 5 former prisoners. Freedom Bakery’s CEO acknowledged Weaver’s research \[ **R5**\] as a ‘pivotal influence’ which enabled them ‘to understand co\-production and the role of responsibility and co\-working within the prison context in the UK and informed the development of what has become Freedom Bakery \[ **S6**\]. Confirming the positive influence on those involved, the CEO noted: ‘We are making a big difference. Our employees now have work, they have hope, and they have not re\-offended. We are giving people \[a\] chance to move on, and the skills they need to move into employment and gain qualifications’ \[ **S6**\]. As one prisoner commented, ‘You feel more trusted, you feel like you’re outside, you feel like a civilian’. 

 Weaver’s research and expertise also informed the establishment of related initiatives in Peterborough, Canada which has co\-created ‘a model for social reintegration and transformation’. Designed, developed and led by a former prisoner, Clean Slate Enterprises, a recycling service, has been established as a federally\-incorporated non\-profit organisation, employing former prisoners and others who face barriers to employment. They have also signed a joint venture agreement to start a mattress recycling service in Peterborough \[ **S7**\]. 

###  Shaped legislation, social policy and practice in Scotland and the UK 

 Implementing the recommendations from Weaver’s ESRC research into the role of social cooperative structures of employment \[ **R5**\], a Strathclyde\-led Scottish Universities Insight Institute project \(2018\-19\) resulted in the establishment of the Coproducing Justice National Steering Group in 2019. This group, comprising industry leaders, and representatives of the Scottish Government, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations \(SCVO\), Convention of Scottish Local Authorities \(COSLA\), Community Justice Scotland, the Scottish Prison Service, Society of Local Authority Chief Executives \(SOLACE\) and academics, provides strategic direction and leadership to support social enterprise and related social firms in Scotland to make a greater contribution to addressing labour market inequalities for people with convictions. With the overarching aim of supporting work generation and integration for this group, the Steering Group produced a three\-year strategy and funding model for the development and diversification of social enterprise in justice contexts in Scotland. While Scottish Government resources are currently prioritising supporting statutory and third sector agency recovery from the impact of Covid\-19, the Steering Group are actively seeking funding to enable a full national roll\-out of our strategy. 

 Weaver’s social cooperative research \[ **R5**\] also informed the submission of evidence to the Scottish Parliament regarding disclosure of convictions. It highlighted the systemic barriers to work integration – and thus desistance – faced by people with convictions, exacerbated by the length of periods for which convictions should be disclosed, and the nature of the non\-conviction information disclosed by professionals \[ **S8a**\]. This directly shaped the *Management of Offenders \(Scotland\) Act 2019* and *Disclosure \(Scotland\) Act 2020*. In particular, Weaver recommended that what constitutes other relevant information \(ORI; disclosure of non\-conviction information\) should be clarified, and that guidelines to inform and streamline decision\-making should be provided, to ensure that if ORI is to be disclosed, it is both proportionate and relevant. This was taken forward in the legislation \[ **S8b**, **S8c**\]. Furthermore, outputs from the pan\-Ayrshire project \(2016\-19\) have influenced a wide range of UK bodies to enhance community justice policy and practice. For example, the findings have: informed the HM Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\) Standards of Excellence in Service User Involvement, with Weaver serving on the Service User Advisory Group \(SUAG\) \[ **S9a**\]; underpinned HM Inspectorate of Probation’s strategy to involve service\-users in its inspection methodology \[ **S9b** research cited on pp.8,9,27,32,34\]; supported Community Justice Scotland to develop service\-user involvement in community justice contexts \[ **S9c** research cited on pp.14\-15\]; and been earmarked for inclusion in the redraft of the National Outcomes and Standards for Criminal Justice policy guidance by the Scottish Government \[ **S10**\].

 Summary of the impact 

 STACK is an online assessment software for mathematics and other STEM disciplines.  At December 2020, STACK is used across UK HE within over 1300 registered learning management systems, including the Open University.  Translated into 20 languages, STACK is used by over 30 universities in Germany, by every university in Finland, and in Japan, Israel, Kenya and the USA.  STACK is used for international development and commercial school textbooks. Through all of these instances, it has improved the learning of hundreds of thousands students, it has supported institutions to pivot to online learning during the COVID\-19 pandemic, and it saves tens of thousands of hours of human marking annually. The underpinning research has directly influenced the development of many similar/competitor products.

 Underpinning research 

 Assessment and feedback are essential for effective learning. Bloom's work on ""Mastery learning"" in the 1980s found that the gap between tutors and traditional large\-group teaching could be closed by regular testing with carefully designed mastery tests.  Using online assessment provides an opportunity to implement Bloom's ideas, however, online assessment has predominantly relied on multiple choice tests.  Multiple choice questions are particularly problematic in mathematics because, in addition to elimination and guessing, students can reverse\-engineer many questions. Research with STACK found that when faced with a reversible mathematical process, students solve a multiple\-choice version by verifying the answers presented to them by the direct method, not by undertaking the actual inverse calculation, see \[3.1\]. 

 Development of STACK is based on the observation that authentic and valid assessment requires the student to provide an answer which contains substantial content, rather than using a multiple choice \(or similar\) question. Students must input mathematical expressions, and complete mathematical arguments; the software establishes objective properties of those arguments and provides outcomes including feedback and statistics. This technology is essential in developing fully online courses, thereby changing teaching structures, which move away from large groups to enable students to progress at an individual pace. 

 Professor Sangwin initiated the STACK project and platform from scratch, and subsequently worked in partnership with other institutions such as the Open University and Loughborough University to develop different aspects of STACK. His leadership has enabled the research from other universities to have a global reach.  Since 2015, The University of Edinburgh has been the home of the STACK project. We hosted the second international STACK conference in April 2019. 

 STACK focuses on using computer algebra to provide teachers with very carefully designed tools to enable online assessment.  Key research at The Maxwell Institute includes \[3.2\] which expanded the computer algebra features to include dimensional numerical quantities, based on SI and fine\-tuned to the needs of assessments.  Further work carried out at the Maxwell Institute \[3.3\] has expanded the functionality to include algebraic line\-by\-line reasoning. Reasoning by equivalence is where an equation is manipulated to generate a new and equivalent equation, typically ending when the equation is solved. Professor Sangwin’s research \[3.4\] found that approximately a third of the method marks are awarded for reasoning by equivalence in final high school mathematics examination questions. There are many other forms of reasoning but reasoning by equivalence forms a stepping stone to advanced proof \[3.5\]. In STACK a student's whole argument then becomes a single mathematical object \(just as an equation can be treated as a single object\) which is to be subjected to formal verification. The research reported in \[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\] led directly to significantly extended functionality.

 Details of the impact 

 STACK is a contemporary assessment software for mathematics. It is installed on the learning management system of over 1300 registered websites with groups of up to 1500 students \[5.1\]. Extrapolating, we estimate 1.2 million students worldwide are benefitting from this methodology.  Having been translated into 20 languages, STACK is used in over 30 universities in Germany, every university in Finland and many other countries including Japan, Israel, Kenya, and the USA \[5.2, 5.3, 5.4\]. The abacus consortium, established to share STACK and other mathematics assessments, currently has 38 partners \[5.5\], further extending the reach of STACK. 

 In comparison with other online assessment software, STACK offers unique additional functionality that changes the way that both learners and teachers engage with learning and assessments. Students enter mathematical expressions and STACK will assess the properties of these expressions; teachers author their own questions; STACK can generate questions with random variables, to reduce copying of answers; STACK allows teachers to give partial marks and tailored feedback depending on the different mathematical properties of the students’ answers.  STACK supports multipart questions, enabling teachers to write step\-by\-step questions; STACK automates the “question testing” process enabling robust questions with long\-term support.  This means that there is almost double the assessment per student using half the staff time, increasing the efficiency of staff while improving student learning \[5.3\]. The research described in \[3.4\] has led directly to uptake for physics textbooks by the commercial textbook publisher, Physics Curriculum & Instruction, and more generally wider use in STEM subjects. The publishers write “ *Instructors using our system have stated that students have greater success with solving physics problems, and gain deeper understanding into problem\-solving strategies, when compared to traditional homework environments of working alone without computer aided assistance”* \[5.6\]. 

 Combining online assessment with human marking saves institutions thousands of hours of work each year: the University of Edinburgh estimates the School of Mathematics saves over 8,300 hours of work annually, through 7,500 accounts, equating to over GBP200,000 of savings year on year. This is replicated for STACK users across the world, for instance *“STACK is used for both summative and formative assessment. Over 1.2 million STACK questions were answered by Open University students in the 2019/20 academic year. This saves a significant amount of staff time each year. Marking this volume of questions, even if only taking 5 seconds per question would take approximately 1 year of staff time each year”* \[5.7\]. 

 As a result, STACK enables institutions to redeploy human resource and maintain quality despite growing student numbers.  The University of Edinburgh consolidated online assessment in most year 1 and 2 mathematics and general science courses with the support from a dedicated learning technologist \[5.8\]. The University of Durham established a similar post in 2020 \[5.9\], and University College London appointed two people to 3\-year posts to create STACK questions. This has changed the way courses in mathematics and science are delivered across these institutions.  The Head of Department, Mathematics, UCL writes: *“The impact of this change of assessment on our year 1 students, most of whom will end up studying the whole year remotely, is immense. They get much more detailed feedback than they would have had in a normal year; and this is vital when we're exactly at the time when the support structures \(such as informal contact with tutors and peers\) that would have formed the academic safety net have been damaged by the pandemic”* \[5.10\]. 

 The novel work described in \[3.3\] extends assessment capabilities to entire mathematical arguments in a well\-defined class by assessment of students’ working itself. Feedback is provided to increase students’ understanding of mathematics, improve students’ experience, and raise their competence. The Open University comments “ *Whilst it is difficult to isolate the effect of STACK ….. modules within Mathematics and Statistics enjoy some of the highest student satisfaction ratings within the University. The use of STACK questions within modules is often praised by students in unsolicited comments within end\-of\-module feedback”* \[5.7\]. 

 In 2020, to mitigate the effects of COVID\-19 on teaching, the Maxwell Institute ran 12 practical workshops on question authoring, with over 350 academic staff attendees from across the world, and presented 15 online talks about STACK, the underlying research, and how to use this technology in teaching \[5.11\]. These “ *seminars and conference talks have guided and challenged colleagues’ thoughts on the nature of assessment and how to assess different mathematical topics, particularly for distance\-learning students. The most recent example of this was Chris Sangwin’s online workshop on the assessment of mathematical proof, given in September 2020”* \[5.7\]. As a further response to COVID\-19, STACK was used in December 2020 to replace university examinations, in Edinburgh reducing the marking time in one module alone from 35 person days to 22 person days with a combination of automatically marked STACK assessments and human marking of more complex proofs. 

 In addition, the research underpinning STACK has influenced the design of other successful online assessment systems, particularly the open source NUMBAS system and “Learning Algebra” from Haese Mathematics, \[5.12\].

 **Summary of Impact** 

 Professor Scraton’s leadership, management, and direction of the Hillsborough Independent Panel \(HIP\) research team and his primary authorship of the HIP Report was submitted as a QUB REF 2014 Impact Case Study. Since 2014, Professor Scraton’s continuing, in\-depth research into the Hillsborough disaster, accumulated over three decades and involving work with bereaved families, survivors and their legal teams, has had a direct and material impact. First, as consultant to the families’ legal teams throughout the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster \(2014\-2016\), his research informed their examination of witnesses throughout the legal hearings, the exoneration of those who died, the verdict of unlawful killing and the jury’s detailed findings against all public agencies involved. Second, through extensive media engagement his research uniquely shaped public understanding of the tragedy’s context and consequences, throughout and beyond the inquests. Third, his Hillsborough research is a significant resource for lawyers, activists, and NGOs as a model advocating for reform in the conduct of public inquiries and inquests into controversial deaths.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Overview** 

 Professor Scraton has an established, international reputation researching official inquiries, investigations, and inquests into controversial deaths **\[R1\]**. His in\-depth Hillsborough research – interrogating context, circumstances, and aftermath – exposed institutionalised flaws in police, coronial, government and media responses to avoidable loss of life and severe physical and psychological injury **\[R2, R3, R5\]**. The HIP Report **\[R4\]** was research\-led and written by Scraton. Subsequently, his research received a Home Office grant \(2014\-2016: £157,181\) and a Leverhulme Trust Fellowship award \(2017\-present: £17,285\), focusing on the Hillsborough Inquests and subsequent legal processes. Seconded as a researcher to support the families and their legal teams \(2014\-2016\) his new research, detailing the Panel’s work and the new inquests, culminated in a revised edition of his ground\-breaking, *Hillsborough: The Truth* \(2016\) **\[R6\]**. 

 Scraton’s qualitative research with bereaved families and survivors is underpinned by exhaustive documentary and policy analysis, contrasting official discourse regarding the disaster’s context and circumstances with an authoritative ‘view from below’. His extensive published research revealed: insufficient analysis of inherent dangers and foreseeable risk; corruption of police statements; compromised investigations including medical/ pathological evidence; systemic failure in the coronial process. Scraton’s research was central to establishing the irrefutable case for reopening criminal and Independent Office for Police Conduct Investigations \(2013\-ongoing\) and new inquests **\[R3, R4\]**. His continued contribution, as research consultant throughout the inquests, had a direct and material impact on their conduct and outcome **\[R6\]**. His research continues to be an invaluable resource for others seeking to learn and apply the lessons of the Hillsborough experience.

 4. **Details of the Impact** 

 The context in which 96 women, men and children were killed, 766 injured and thousands traumatised, at a Hillsborough Stadium FA Cup Semi\-Final in April 1989 is well documented and internationally recognised. Within hours of the tragedy, police representatives and politicians had briefed international media that drunken, violent fans had caused fatalities. A judicial inquiry found serious institutional negligence in managing the capacity crowd, yet no criminal prosecutions resulted. Inquests were held in 1990\-91. The families received no legal aid for those inquests. The coroner directed the jury towards an accidental death verdict, returned by a majority. A 1993 judicial review of the verdict failed in the High Court. It exonerated the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and the emergency services and remained the official ‘truth’ about Hillsborough for over two decades. Denied legitimacy, survivors criticised the parlous state of the stadium, inadequate stewarding and policing, emergency response failures, and flawed investigations. In 2010 the HIP was established and its 400\-page report meticulously documented these failings, the negative media coverage and failures in the legal processes \(including the original inquests\) and subsequent reviews. Professor Scraton’s leadership, management and direction of the HIP research team and primary authorship of its Report was submitted as a REF QUB 2014 Impact Case Study. This REF Impact Case Study details the subsequent impact of his research. 

 **The Second Inquests, 2014\-2016** 

 Following the HIP findings **\[R4\]**, the accidental death inquest verdicts were quashed. The Lord Chief Justice ordered new inquests. Scraton was appointed research consultant to the families’ legal teams \(103 families/ individuals represented by 14 firms of solicitors; 31 barristers at a cost to legal aid of GBP63,600,000\). Throughout the five preliminary hearings and two\-year inquests \(2014\-16\), the longest running inquests in British legal history, his research had a direct and material impact on the conduct of the legal hearings. Scraton was seconded to the bereaved families’ legal teams: drafted submissions to the Coroner throughout preliminary hearings \(2013\-2014\); and also wrote thirty comprehensive background papers informing presentation of the case, including detailed appraisal of witness evidence \(2014\-2016\). 

 The Hillsborough Research Archive compiled under his direction and housed at Queen’s University Belfast, was key to informing team briefings and the focus, presentation and interrogation of evidence **\[R1\]**. Deploying an academic research archive in live proceedings, prioritising and challenging evidence, was a unique development in UK legal history. A senior barrister who represented the families, now a Coroner, summed up Scraton’ s impact on the inquests thus: *‘His very species\-being was invested, emotionally and intellectually … This was manifest … in the laser like focus on the detail that mattered for the conduct of the 96 fresh inquests themselves.  He produced some 30 briefing papers that were utterly invaluable in, repeatedly, drawing the lawyers’ perspective and clarity back to the process of ensuring that accountability and truth were drawn to the fore\-front of the evidence that the court and the jury were required to consider, and drawing out the details that informed the humanity behind the sheer numbers killed and forever damaged.  This, I suspect as much as anything, enabled the conclusions of the 96 inquests to emerge as they did: confirming that 96 men, women and children were unlawfully killed and, critically, exposing and destroying once and for all the malevolent strategies, the lies, that sought to blame the victims for their own fate’* **\[Source A\]**. 

 Another Senior Counsel, who acted for 77 Hillsborough families, similarly assessed Scraton’s contribution as: ‘ *His written and oral contributions were informed by an encyclopaedic knowledge of the events of the day...He “coloured in” the black and white of the words and images…Phil provided a bridge to the families as well as to the work of the HIP panel*.’ **\[Source B\]**. 

 Consistent with Scraton’s research findings **\[R6\]**, the unanimous jury verdict delivered in April 2016 was unlawful killing. Further, the jury found multiple systemic failings by the South Yorkshire Police, the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Hillsborough stadium’s engineers. It exonerated the Liverpool fans, including those killed and injured, of any responsibility. The following day in the House of Commons the then UK Home Secretary Theresa May stated: 

 ‘*Clearly, the jury’s determination that those who died were unlawfully killed is of great public importance. It overturns in the starkest way possible the verdict of accidental death returned at the original inquests. Thanks to \[the HIP report\] and now the determinations of the inquests, we know the truth of what happened on that day at Hillsborough...this raises significant issues for the way the State and its agencies deal with disasters. Once formal investigations are concluded, we should step back, reflect and act \[to\] better respond to disasters and ensure that the suffering of families is taken into account. For 27 years the families and survivors of Hillsborough have fought for justice. They have faced hostility, opposition and obfuscation, and the authorities that should have been trusted, have laid blame and tried to protect themselves instead of acting in the public interest. But the families have never faltered in their pursuit of the truth. Thanks to their actions, they have brought about a proper reinvestigation, and a thorough re\-evaluation of what happened at Hillsborough  \[Source C\]**. 

 In July 2016, in remarks to coincide with the launch of the 4<sup>th</sup> edition of Scraton’s book *Hillsborough: The Truth*, the then Labour Shadow Home Secretary and Culture Secretary Andy Burnham, commented: ‘ *Of this I am sure* *the full truth about Hillsborough would never have been known were it not for his meticulous efforts over many years, turning over stones that others have walked past Professor Scraton has done a huge service not just to the Hillsborough families, but to this country’*  **\[Source D\]**. 

 In September 2016, alongside posthumous awards to the 96 who died, Professor Scraton, Sir Kenny and Marina Dalglish were awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool in recognition of their contribution to the truth finally being established as a result of the inquest findings. The then Lord Mayor stated: *‘The Hillsborough campaign was a long, heart breaking journey for all involved. It seemed fitting that after the latest inquests brought the families the truth and justice outcome that they had fought so hard for, we mark this monumental moment by awarding the 96, and those outstanding individuals who have given them their support, with the city’s highest honour’* **\[Source E\]**. 

 **Contribution to the Public Understanding of Truth Regarding Hillsborough ** 

 Prof Scraton’s research has made a seminal contribution to shaping public understanding of what happened at Hillsborough and the subsequent inquiries, investigations and inquests. The reach of his research is evidenced by the breadth and diversity of his Hillsborough related media work. On Hillsborough alone, between 2014–2020, Professor Scraton was interviewed, referenced or quoted on 258 occasions in print, broadcast and online media. 

 For example, in print, he has appeared in the *Daily Mail* \(28 Nov 2019, 16 Nov 2017 & 28 June 2017 \- circulation of 960,000 and 24,900,000 unique online visitors/month\); *The Times* 9<sup>th</sup> May 2016 \(circulation of 400,000 and 300,000 online subscribers\); *The Daily Telegraph* \(29<sup>th</sup> December 2016, 27<sup>th</sup> October 2017 \- circulation 317,000, 460,000 on\-line subscribers\);  *The Guardian* \(28<sup>th</sup>  April 2016 *,* 21<sup>st</sup> February 2017 \- circulation 125,000 and 85,000,000 global monthly website users\); *The Daily Mirror* \(25<sup>th</sup> May 2016, 29<sup>th</sup> December 2016, 1<sup>st</sup> November 2017 \- circulation of 366,000 and 25,000,000 unique visitors/month\); *The Irish Times* \(13<sup>th</sup> May 2016, 17<sup>th</sup> August 2017, 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2019 \- circulation of 79,000 and 10,800,000 monthly online users\); the *Belfast Telegraph* \(29<sup>th</sup> Dec 2016, 15<sup>th</sup> May 2017, 6<sup>th</sup> Nov 2017 \- circulation 31,000 with 3,400,000 monthly users\); *Liverpool Echo,* 42 separate occasions \(circulation 26,000\). He has also appeared in the international print media including in the *New York Times* \(15 April 2014 & 12 April 2014 \- circulation 850,000, 4,700,000 digital subscribers\) and the *Australian Daily Telegraph* 31<sup>st</sup> October 2016 \(circulation 1,191,000, 3,440,000 digital readers\). Online, Phil Scraton was referenced on the BBC news website on 12 occasions, 2014\-2020 \(the world’s most visited News website with 179,000,000 unique monthly visitors\) and the Argentinian news website Infobae \(15 Apr 2019 – 38,000,000 unique monthly visitors\) and on CNN.com \(26 Apr 2016, 147,000,000 unique visitors/month\). On 1<sup>st</sup> December 2016 the *Times Higher* published an unprecedented 8\-page, cover story on Scraton’s research in securing justice for the Hillsborough families \(380,000 on\-line readers\). 

 Between 2014 and 2020 he has given over 70 local and national radio and television interviews on Hillsborough related matters. For example, he has been interviewed on the *BBC Radio 4* programmes *PM* \(28 June 2017 – 4,200,000 listeners weekly\) and *Today* \(30 December 2016 & 9 January 2015 – 6,720,000 listeners weekly\) as well as *Radio 5 Live* \(12 times \- total reach of 4,980,000 listeners/week\). He has been interviewed on *BBC News at 10* \(28 June 2017, 4,200,000 viewers per episode\) and *Channel 4 News* \(28 June 2017, 1,300,000 viewers per episode\). 

 He was research consultant for and primary participant in the *BBC/CNN* film *Hillsborough* \(2016\) screened across Europe, Australia, Latin America, the USA and Canada. Short\-listed for an Emmy, the film won the 2017 Best Documentary BAFTA. At the awards ceremony, February 2017, the film’s Director Dan Gordon stated: ‘ *I thank Professor Phil Scraton, who is standing right behind me, who has worked so tirelessly, diligently … and shown a dogged determination to expose the full truth of Hillsborough. I am in absolute awe of you*’ **\[Source F\]**. Scraton was research consultant for the *S4C* documentary, **Hillsborough: Yr Hunllef Hir** \(The Long Nightmare\), awarded the 2017 Celtic Media Festival main prize. He was consultant and interviewee for the 2017 film documentary *Kenny* on the impact of Hillsborough on the former Liverpool manager Sir Kenny Dalglish. 

 As the North West Correspondent for BBC News states in a letter to the UoA, *‘I cover the subject of the disaster and its aftermath closely for national BBC news programmes. I have interviewed Prof Scraton many times, and also speak to him regularly off\-air, for advice on developments in the story. In my estimation Professor Scraton is a world authority on the labyrinthine subject of Hillsborough … Myself and my colleagues often approach him for interviews, and are grateful for the time he gives us. He gives important context to our reports, and puts a priority on being able to explain complex findings in an accessible way. This has ensured that his research isn’t solely the preserve of academia, but has travelled far beyond the university campus to newspaper readers and television and radio audiences.* **\[Source G\]**. 

 The impact of Scraton’s contribution to public discourse was well illustrated by the former *Radio 4 Desert Island Disc* host Kirsty Young, introducing him as a ‘castaway’ on 5th November 2017 \(2,900,000 listeners/ episode\): ‘ *at the heart of much of his life and work has been the Hillsborough Disaster … My guest’s relentless and meticulous quest for the truth has been fundamental to our understanding as to what really went wrong*’ **\[Source H\]**.  In the New Year’s Honours List, December 2016 he was offered an OBE in recognition for his research and advocacy on Hillsborough. He declined the award. 

 Between January 2017 and February 2020 Scraton delivered c.60 visiting lectures and conference plenaries to over 12,000 academic, professional and public audiences \(in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany\), together with numerous webinars, on Hillsborough and its implications for truth recovery, state power and researching deaths in contested circumstances. Endorsing *Hillsborough: The Truth,* David Downes, Professor Emeritus at the LSE commented on his research and research dissemination strategy as being characterised by ‘ *a tireless determination to uncover the truth; a unique example, accumulating evidence and grounding analysis in so masterly a fashion, reactivating better informed public debate and making a compelling case to release a mass of undisclosed police and official document*’ **\[Source I\]**. 

 **The Continuing, Wider Significance of the Hillsborough Research ** 

 The high profile of Professor Scraton’s research and its significance in reopening investigations and inquiries, revealing the precise circumstances of the Hillsborough disaster, and the lessons learnt, underpins more recent research in other contexts. For example, the legal team representing families bereaved by the Stardust Fire in Dublin 1981 \(in which 48 people died\) have drawn directly on his Hillsborough experience and expertise in securing new inquests to reassess causation, originally and erroneously considered to be arson **\[Source J\]**. His Hillsborough research was the reason he was appointed to the JUSTICE working party into inquest and public inquiry reform, published in August 2020. Its membership included Sir John Golding QC, the Hillsborough inquest coroner. Its recommendations on the treatment of families, drew directly on the Hillsborough research, to ensure that the pain and suffering experienced by the Hillsborough families would not be repeated **\[Source K\]**. Drawing directly on his Hillsborough related research, in 2018 he co\-facilitated a funded six\-week research workshop at the University of Sydney into deaths in contested circumstances. In 2019 he was appointed by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties to conduct a comprehensive review of the Irish Coronial System, funded by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission \(2019\-2021\). It focuses on the issues central to Scraton’s Hillsborough research: c **oronial independence; legal aid and legal representation for families at inquests; families’ access to investigation reports; the role of juries; and narrative verdicts.**

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 ‘Avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland’ was one of the top three priorities in the UK\-EU negotiations \(2017\-2020\) and central to their most complex deliberations, but it was highly contentious and little understood. UK and EU policymakers, diplomats and negotiators used Katy Hayward’s research to shape their understanding of, and approach to, the problem. Hayward’s work also benefited a wide range of stakeholders, including those in private, public and local community sectors most directly affected, and helped equip them to meet the challenge. Overall, Hayward has made an essential contribution to managing the impact of UK withdrawal from the EU on this fragile region. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Hayward’s research on the impact of European integration on the island of Ireland has long\-evidenced the connection between cross\-border cooperation and peace\-building. This came into its own following the 23 June 2016 referendum on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, which would see Northern Ireland bordered by the EU’s external border \(between Ireland/UK\) and a new customs/regulatory border \(between Northern Ireland \[NI\] and Great Britain\). There are four elements to Hayward’s work that underpins the impact her research has had since the referendum. 

 First, Hayward was a partner in the  [*Borders In Globalization*](https://biglobalization.org/) project funded by Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, with 54 partner organizations across 11 countries \[2013\-2020; PI Emmanuel Brunet\-Jailly, University of Victoria, British Columbia\]. The project sought to inform border policy around the world through a global network of expertise on country case studies. Hayward was Lead on the Ireland/Northern Ireland case study. Informed in part by her work on European Cross\-Border Cooperation Policy, \[1\] Hayward organised knowledge\-transfer workshops for some 60 cross\-sectoral public, private and community stakeholders in 2016. This formed the basis for a policy and practitioner network that Hayward would continue to draw upon. It also informed single\- and jointly\-authored articles by Hayward and Komarova on Brexit and the Irish border. \[2, 3\] 

 In early 2017, the Irish Central Border Area Network of local authorities commissioned Hayward to carry out three ‘rounds’ of research and reports on the impact of Brexit in the border region. \[4, 5, 6\] In total, the research consisted of 3 online surveys \(which generated c.1400 responses from across the central border region\) and 15 focus groups of over 100 participants altogether. The findings of these reports were unique in being substantial, ‘up to date’, cross\-border, and cross\-community qualitative studies on the potential effects of Brexit in the border region of Ireland/Northern Ireland. They showed the connection between the open border and the peace process and the negative impact that even the mere anticipation of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU was having on cross\-border cooperation and movement. 

 Working with economist Eoin Magennis \[InterTrade Ireland, and later Ulster University\], Hayward conducted research in 2012\-13 on the all\-island business community using interview and ‘witness seminar’ data, as well as statistical data on trade flows. \[7\] This research showed the importance of the 1998 Good Friday \(Belfast\) Agreement for creating the conditions in which businesses on both sides of the border began to make the most of EU single market membership in developing the all\-island economy. Overall, it showed how sensitive cross\-border business and trade is to political and societal conditions. 

 Finally, after the negotiation of the UK\-EU Withdrawal Agreement that contained the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, Hayward’s interdisciplinary expertise was applied to analysing the potential change for Northern Ireland and its borders \(including the Irish Sea border\). Her work on the implications of the Protocol and the future UK\-EU deal built upon her expertise in border studies and in the 1998 Agreement. This included research commissioned by the Department for the Economy \(Northern Ireland\) and reported in May 2020. Hayward was the Principal Investigator and lead author \(co\-investigators and co\-authors were David Phinnemore and Milena Komarova, both QUB\) on this research. The research comprised case studies of comparator non\-EU regions plus two rounds of workshops with 100 stakeholders from across public, private and community sectors in Northern Ireland and resulted in 80 policy recommendations. \[8\]

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 When setting their objectives for the first phase of the withdrawal negotiations, the UK and EU agreed that one of their top three priorities was to ‘avoid a hard border’ on the island of Ireland. \[1\] Katy Hayward brought research expertise and evidence to what became the most high\- profile and sensitive topic in the reformulation of the UK\-EU relationship in the period 2016\-20. The subject is intrinsically international, as well as of major national significance and local consequence. It is therefore appropriate that the impact of Hayward’s work has been transnational, cross\-sectoral and multi\-level. It has taken four main forms: informing, shaping, benefiting, illuminating. Overall, Hayward has equipped policymakers and stakeholders to better understand and manage the consequences of Brexit for Northern Ireland \(NI\). 

 *1\) Informing all sides of the international negotiations* 

 A lead official in the Northern Ireland Office \(NIO\) and later the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) describes Hayward as “highly regarded” as an “authoritative voice” by UK government officials. \[2\] She has given invited talks to UK officials at critical moments in the UK\-EU negotiations \(including a masterclass at the Foreign Commonwealth Office, 15 Jan 2019, and to over 120 BEIS officials, 2 July 2019\). \[2\] Since mid\-2019 she has held frequent confidential meetings to advise and liaise with senior officials in UK Government and Northern Ireland departments tasked with managing Brexit for NI. \[2\] 

 Hayward’s research informed the briefings and recommendations regarding the Irish border provided internally to the UK government throughout the Brexit negotiations. The Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy in Dublin testifies her reports on the central border region “provided very useful, fact\-based evidence to support the analysis and advice of officials”. \[2\] 

 Hayward was one of only three academics appointed to the UK Government’s 15\-member Technical Expert panel on the Advisory Group on Alternative Arrangements in June 2019. In his letter of invitation to Hayward to join the Group, Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and Chief Negotiator for the UK, Stephen Barclay, stated that the Government would engage with the group to develop “the UK’s understanding of alternative arrangements to inform negotiations with the EU” and confirmed that members had been “chosen on the basis of their expertise and experience”. \[3\] Secretary of State Barclay attended all meetings of the Advisory Group and was the lead UK minister for the renegotiation of the backstop with the EU in 2019. 

 Hayward’s work was also drawn upon by EU negotiators and EU26 leaders. In his public lecture at Queen’s University on 27 January 2020, which was livestreamed and received international media attention, the EU’s Chief Negotiator for the UK/EU withdrawal and future relationship negotiations, Michel Barnier, remarked: “On Brexit, researchers such as Dr Katy Hayward and Professor David Phinnemore have made an important contribution to the debate, in Northern Ireland, in Westminster, and beyond. Thanks to you, Northern Ireland’s unique political, social and economic reality is understood more broadly.” \[4\] 

 The Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU during the Brexit negotiations confirms that Barnier’s EU negotiating team “spoke to me on a number of occasions about the value and importance they attached to \[Hayward’s\] work”. \[5\] He states that he “found Katy Hayward’s informed, sophisticated, sensitive, and logically and factually rigorous research work on the Brexit process to be of great value to me and my team in Brussels, to my colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, and to the European Commission” and that it “filled a crucial gap”. \[5\] 

 Hayward was one of 15 individuals, and the only academic, invited by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to a private audience with Chancellor Angela Merkel on her visit to Ireland in April 2019, to brief her on the Irish border and the effects of Brexit on local border communities. The discussion and contents of that meeting are confidential but in the press conference afterwards, Merkel stated that “the EU will do everything it can to avoid a hard border”. \[6\] 

 Hayward’s research also informed the interventions made on the topic of Brexit and the Irish border by influential actors in the United States. The Ad Hoc Committee for the Protection of the Good Friday Agreement is a bipartisan group of over 50 leaders, advisors, experts and diplomats \(including two former US Senators, five former US Ambassadors, and leaders of prominent Irish American organisations\). It holds frequent meetings with the highest levels of government. It is co\-chaired by Democrat and Republican former congressmen who testify: 

 “Hayward’s research has proven to be a trustworthy, rigorous and an independent source of information that we have used as we have developed our policies and engaged with senior \[US\] government officials… 

 \[Her\] presentations and briefings became a unique opportunity to keep all Ad Hoc members keep up to date as the Brexit negotiations unfolded as we engaged leading political actors in the USA, the UK and Ireland.” \[7\] 

 *2\) Shaping legislation for post\-Brexit Northern Ireland* 

 Between October 2016 and December 2020, Hayward presented oral evidence to parliamentary committees on over twenty occasions, and has presented written evidence to committee inquiries in both chambers in of the UK Parliament, the NI Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the Oireachtas, the British\-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and the European Parliament Committee on Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs. Her evidence has been cited in nine reports made by Westminster committees, including in their recommendations. \[8\]  For example, she gave oral and written evidence to the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee inquiry on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. \[8\] Hayward was cited ten times in the subsequent report \(published 16 March 2018\). Her explanation of the increased cost and complexity of doing business across the post\-Brexit UK/EU border due to tariff and regulatory divergence was reflected in the report’s conclusions and recommendations. In its response \(15 June 2018\), the UK government stated it wanted ‘as frictionless trade as possible in goods’ with the EU and sought to avoid a hard border. \[8\] 

 Hayward was also the only academic cited in the House of Lords European Select Committee inquiry report on Brexit negotiations and the Protocol \(published 25 March 2019\). \[8\] The report’s conclusion repeated her suggestion about the governance of the Joint Consultative Working Group for the Protocol. \[8\] Hayward has also been cited in oral contributions to Parliamentary debates in Dáil Éireann, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. \[8\]  Hayward’s briefings informed amendments tabled to the UK Withdrawal Act, the Withdrawal Agreement Act, the Trade Bill and the UK Internal Market Bill in the UK Parliament. \[9, 10\] A former Secretary of State to Northern Ireland credits Hayward’s expertise “including her timely research in the central border region” as providing “a fount of evidence to inform my contribution to the debates.” \[9\] For example, “Her collaborative work with business leaders in Northern Ireland drove the tabling of key amendments in the Lords to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.” \[9\] These particular amendments on ‘unfettered access’ between NI and GB appeared in the names of Lord Peter Hain \(Labour\), Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick \(cross\-bench, former \[nationalist\] SDLP\), the noble and right reverend Lord \[former Archbishop\] Robin Eames, and Lord Reg Empey \(Ulster Unionist Party\), with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party – a rare example of cross\-party collaboration from Northern Ireland. \[10\] An amendment tabled by Lord Hain on the Trade Bill that was informed by Hayward’s expertise passed the House of Lords on 6 January 2021. \[9\] 

 *3\) Benefiting a wide range of stakeholders* 

 Providing detailed information, explanation and analysis of Brexit, Hayward’s work has enabled stakeholders to know what to expect after the end of the transition period and to be better prepared for it. The NI Business Brexit Working Group is a group of 14 business bodies and representative groups, covering thousands of businesses in Northern Ireland across all sectors. It testifies that the papers she has collaborated with them on: 

 “have had a major influence and direct impact on shaping the response and asks of Northern Ireland Business, the operation of the internal market and the engagement with UK Government and the EU. She has given the business sector confidence to speak out with the knowledge that our papers are based on the solid foundation of academic research. Her academic analysis has proven useful in helping us as a group compile complex arguments and information, as well as explain it to a public audience.” \[11\] 

 Her reports for the Irish Central Border Area Network, its CEO testifies, “have been reviewed by those involved in Brexit negotiations at the highest levels of the EU and in the governments of Ireland, UK and N. Ireland.” It notes its appreciation “that it has been the very good standing of Prof. Hayward and her command of the subject that has enabled the voices of citizens and workers in our region to be heard at these levels.” \[12\] This research “also provided an invaluable evidence base to inform the development of our new strategy for the Central Border Region”, proving an impact that goes beyond the immediate event of Brexit. \[12\] 

 *4\) Illuminating the subject for the wider public, through global and social media* 

 In the period October 2016 \- December 2020, Hayward was featured in over 1300 news and current affairs articles, items and programmes across 36 different countries. \[13\] She was awarded Political Communicator of the Year \(2019\) by the UK Political Studies Association and a special Ewart\-Biggs Memorial Prize \(2020\) for her media/social media contributions on Brexit. \[13\] David Allen Green \( *Financial Times*\) described Hayward’s Twitter account as “A perfect example of sheer expertise laid out practically and informatively for lay people”. \[13\] Hayward uses social media to communicate insights and explanations based on her research expertise. Her Brexit analysis has been publicly endorsed by diplomats on both sides. \[14\] Her 25,000 Twitter followers include politicians and diplomats key to the Brexit negotiations, including Donald Tusk, then\-President of the European Council, and Lord David Frost, chief UK negotiator on the UK\-EU future relationship and Joint Committee co\-chair. \[14\] Her Twitter threads on Brexit have often reached hundreds of thousands of people; and her tweets in the critical last 3 months of the transition period were seen a total of over 3.8 million times. \[14\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Robotic systems were introduced into surgical practice in 2001 at high cost and with no evidence of clinical benefit. Over 2011\-15, the ROLARR trial randomised 471 patients with rectal cancer from 40 worldwide centres, to robotic or laparoscopic surgery. Robotic surgery was safe, with similar oncological outcomes and conversion rates. ROLARR has changed NICE guidance and focused surgical practice on technically difficult cases more likely to benefit from robotic surgery. 

 Economic analysis showed that robotic surgery was £1000 more expensive per case, driven by higher consumable costs and longer operating times. This influenced commercial thinking and on\-going research, informing the design and evaluation of more versatile, affordable robotic systems.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Robotic surgery was introduced into clinical practice in 2001, driven by commercial pressures, clinical enthusiasm, and promises of increased market share for healthcare providers. There was no evidence regarding clinical outcomes or cost effectiveness to inform international policy. The uncontrolled introduction of such an expensive technology \(\~£1.5M per robot\) drew strong criticism and divided the clinical community. 

 The NIHR EME ROLARR trial \(£1.2M, 2009\-2016\) addressed this evidence gap. It was led by a Leeds interdisciplinary research team with expertise in complex trials \(Brown\), surgical trials \(<ins>Jayne</ins> in UoA1\), and health economics \(Hulme\). ROLARR was an international study involving 40 surgeons from 29 sites in 10 countries providing, for the first time, a randomised evaluation of robotic versus laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer – one of the main indications for robotic surgery \[ **1**\]. 

 The short\-term outcomes from ROLARR, published in JAMA in 2017, showed that robotic rectal cancer surgery was as safe as laparoscopic surgery with similar oncological outcomes and functional outcomes \[ **2**\]. Conversion to open surgery, the primary endpoint, was 8.1% robotic v 12.2% laparoscopic \(adjusted odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 1.21\), the complication rate was 33.1% for robotic v 31.7% for laparoscopic \(OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.58\); and resection margin positivity was 5.1% robotic v 6.3% laparoscopic \(OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.76\). Potential benefits were observed in technically difficult cases \(males, obese patients, and low rectal cancer\). 

 Robotic surgery was more expensive than laparoscopic surgery, with a mean difference in costs of £1,000 per case and little difference in quality adjusted life years, making system and operating costs the main blockers to wider adoption \[ **3**\]. However, costs were much lower than reported in non\-randomised studies and included modifiable factors – increased operating time and expensive robotic instruments – highlighting the scope for making robotic surgery more affordable within the context of an NHS tariff of £15,000. 

 Importantly, sensitivity analysis explored the effect of surgeon learning curve on outcomes and revealed that the treatment\-effect odds ratio decreases by a factor of 0.34 \(95% CI 0.12 to 0.96\) per unit increase in log\-number of previous robotic operations performed by the operating surgeon. The odds ratio for conversion to open surgery for a patient whose operating surgeon had the mean experience level in ROLARR \(152.5 previous laparoscopic, 67.9 previous robotic operations\) was 0.40 \(95% CI 0.17 to 0.95\) \[ **4**\]. This work defined the learning curve for robotic rectal cancer surgery as approximately 90 cases, much higher than previously reported. 

 Alongside the ROLARR RCT, funding was secured to explore the human factors associated with robotic and laparoscopic surgery using realist methods \(Randell in UoA3\). This defined the ideal conditions for system deployment and surgical team working to facilitate optimal implementation and utilisation \[ **5,6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ROLARR study was undertaken during a period of great uncertainty about the benefits of robotic surgery and whether it offered value for money and should be more widely adopted. The work was presented at the world’s foremost surgical congresses, including the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons \(ASCRS; USA, 2015\), the European Society of Coloproctology \(Hungary, 2015\), the Asian Robotic Camp for Colorectal Surgeons \(S Korea, 2018\), and the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland \(UK, 2016\), and is regarded as an exemplar study by the IDEAL \(Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long\-term Follow\-up, Improving the Quality of Research in Surgery\) Collaboration \(UK, 2018\). 

 ROLARR galvanised the robotic surgical community, clarified international opinion and put robotic surgery in the public spotlight through national media coverage. The JAMA manuscript \[ **2**\] was named “Paper of the month” by the European Society of Coloproctology in January 2018 \[ **A**\] and to date has been cited 324 times on Web of Science, indicating its importance to the surgical community. 

 *Patient and healthcare provider impact* 

 The most important beneficiaries of robotic surgery are patients. Demonstration that robotic rectal cancer surgery was safe, with good oncological and functional outcomes \[ **2**\], and evidence of factors enabling safe technology adoption \[ **5**, **6**\], provided reassurance to clinicians and patients. Although robotic surgery was more expensive than laparoscopic surgery, the differential costs were less than previously reported \[ **3**\], providing encouragement to healthcare providers to invest in the technology and widening access for patients to benefit from minimally invasive surgery \[ **B**\]. 

 The adoption and utilisation of robotic surgery for rectal cancer has increased markedly since the ROLARR presentations and publications \[ **2**\- **6**\]. In the National Bowel Cancer Audit 2020, 30 NHS Trusts were regularly performing robotic colorectal cancer surgery with the number of cases more than doubling over the previous 4 years \[ **B**\]. Importantly, almost two\-thirds of robotic surgery was performed in males and for low rectal cancer – the technically difficult sub\-groups identified in ROLARR \[ **2**\]. Similar patterns of robotic adoption have been seen in the US with rates of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery plateauing at 19%, whilst robotic surgery has increased from 1% to 13% \[ **C**\]. 

 Previous single institution studies have suggested that the learning curve for robotic rectal cancer surgery was \~30 patients. ROLARR showed this to be an underestimate, with the true learning curve, even in experienced laparoscopic surgeons, not plateauing until \~90 patients \[ **4**\]. This has had major implications for robotic training programmes, surgeon accreditation, patient safety, and the future design of surgical technology evaluations. It informed the design of further research exploring the subgroups \(males, obese patients, low rectal cancers\) identified within ROLARR where there was likely to be maximal benefit, including the European RESET trial aiming to recruit 1300 patients with low rectal cancers \[ **D**\]. 

 *Policy and implementation impact* 

 The importance of ROLARR in determining future healthcare policy is illustrated by its inclusion in an NIHR Signal Report \[ **E**\]. NICE guidance on the treatment of colorectal cancer published in 2014 failed to mention robotic surgery. Updated guidance published in 2020 supported the use of robotic rectal cancer surgery within established robotic programmes that have appropriate audited outcomes, affirming the learning curve \[ **4**\] and human factors findings \[ **5**, **6**\] of ROLARR \[ **F**\]. The potential benefits highlighted by ROLARR for increasing patient access to minimally invasive surgery were formalised within the Royal College of Surgeons \(RCS\) of England “Future Surgery” report \[ **G**\]. Building on the success of ROLARR, RCS England set up a national research initiative to undertake further research to demonstrate the benefits of robotic surgery. 

 *Commercial impact* 

 Presentation of the ROLARR results at the ASCRS meeting in 2015 had an immediate impact on the commercial robotics sector. US financial markets showed particular interest with investor speculation on Intuitive Surgical Inc., the manufacturer of the *da Vinci* system. The markets reacted favourably, reassured by the safety and high quality of robotic surgery \[ **H**\]. 

 Confidence in robotic surgery was reassured, paving the way for the development and commercialisation of other robotic systems. Manufacturers have taken on board the health economic lessons from ROLARR, in particular the need to reduce capital and instrument costs to make the technology more affordable. Companies, such as CMR Surgical \(UK\) and Distalmotion \(Switzerland\), have been consulting with the ROLARR team to better understand the implications of ROLARR and how to develop the next generation of more versatile, affordable systems \[ **I**, **J**\]. Specific influences of ROLARR cited by manufacturers include a focus on colorectal surgery as a strategic market, increased investor confidence, use of health economics data to guide market positioning, and the importance of independent clinical evaluation to facilitate EU and US regulatory approvals.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research conducted at Swansea University \(SU\) has been instrumental in the commercial success of Innoture Ltd, a microneedle \(MN\) company, focussing on their novel anti\-aging regime Radara® which utilise microneedle patches. Research conducted by Swansea researchers allowed the company to optimize their MN print manufacturing processes, increasing the number of products produced per day while reducing costs by 50%. This allowed Radara® products to be brought to market one year earlier than planned. As a direct result of SU research, they have generated sales of GBP50,000 in 2020. Swansea\-developed microstructure prototypes for transdermal delivery have also allowed Innoture to develop a new product pipeline around analgesics, with Swansea facilitating the first human trials for the company. Critically, Swansea University research has underpinned Innoture’s ability to secure private investment of GBP3,000,000 during the REF period, allowing the company to add 12 staff, an increase of 600% from 2014.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Microneedles \(MNs\) that penetrate the top layer of the skin have long promised pain\-free administration of drugs, but, despite a plethora of research publications, very few have ever approached commercial reality. Scalability of production, drug yield and molecular size/type \(solubility\) have severely limited MN application. Swansea’s research has effectively solved these issues by providing the underpinning knowledge needed to deliver small molecules and complex biologicals \(peptides and cells\) at high volume from mass\-manufacturable printed patches \(Fig. 1\). This work represents a step change in MN patch technology that has since seen commercial exploitation via a 7\-year collaboration with Innoture Ltd \- taking the technology from manufacture to successful human trials. 

 Since 2011, Guy has been developing a range of MN fabrication technologies for silicon and polymer MNs in collaboration with industry and Imperial College London. Innovations in microneedle design \(pitch, length, tip sharpness and material hardness\) have enabled facile transdermal injection, leading to a critical process patent for the manufacture of MNs **\[P1\]**. A key element was a novel “bevelled tip” hollow MN, which led to new collaborations with Prof. Birchall’s group at Cardiff University. Guy has led EPSRC **\[G1\-G2\]** and Innovate UK **\[G3\]** MN projects with Cardiff developing the MN technology for transdermal delivery of large fluid doses **\[R1\]**. 






 Fig.1. Radara® patches \(left\) and electron micrograph of microneedles \(right\) 


 Given Swansea’s leading expertise in MN manufacturing, characterisation and skin\-testing research, through Swansea’s Centre for Nanohealth \(CNH\), Guy initiated a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Innoture in 2013 **\[G4\]**. Key research outcomes arising from this KTP were the development of novel MN manufacturing processes for screen\-printed polymeric microneedle patches **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. SU’s critical input **\[R2, R3\]** included the development of screens, ink constitution and viscosity, ink curing and substrate selection which led to MN optimisation.  Reference **\[R2\]** detailed how a newly developed bend test was an excellent predictor of amount of ink deposited and was far better than traditional assumptions based on squeegee hardness. The printing of microneedles relies on a different philosophy from traditional printing, where excess ink deposition is regarded as wasteful.  Microneedle printing is pushing the screen\-printing process to the limits of its capabilities in terms of the amount of material deposited. 

 Reference **\[R3\]** visually showed for the first time the separation of the ink filament as the stencil is pulled away from the substrate.  This study is of great importance to the functional printing industry as it is the first time that frequently cited and historical models of the ink transfer process in screen printing have been tested and validated experimentally.  This allows a direct causal link to be drawn between ink characteristics \(elasticity, rheology\) and printer settings, and print topography, based on the simultaneous contact between the printing form, ink and substrate.  Understanding of printing mechanisms, and the effect of process parameters, is key to ensuring defect free and robust manufacture of printed microneedles as well as maximising ink deposit for faster throughput. 

 Prof Guy has led research into the testing and development of MNs in association with active pharmaceutical ingredients \(APIs\) **\[R4\]**. This involved skin testing research and new methods for assessing transdermal delivery of commercially relevant APIs \(ibuprofen, aspirin and hydrocortisone, galantamine, selegiline hydrochloride \(Sel\-HCl\), insulin and caffeine **\[R4\]**\). Key characterisation and performance data on Innoture’s MNs \(skin penetration and drug permeation efficacy\) were acquired, with the study providing critical data on the effect of a molecule’s physiochemical properties on its ability to be delivered transdermally, with and without microneedle application, leading to a critical process patent for the manufacture of MNs **\[P1\]**. Enhanced delivery of APIs has been demonstrated \(via extended KTP, **\[G5\]**\), with the avoidance of hypodermic needle stick pain during anaesthetic administration into the gums of dental patients. 

 Prof Guy’s group in CNH has conducted research into materials characterisation, microneedle sensing \(including the first mediated MN based biosensor for minimal invasive sensing of lactate in interstitial fluid **\[R5\]**\) and examined the possibility of developing a MN closed loop control system for delivery of precision drugs **\[R6\]**.  Most recently, this technology has been used in the development of a “vaccine smart patch” prototype – for COVID vaccination and diagnosis of COVID antibodies in response to the vaccine.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Improved manufacturing processes/cost efficiencies** 

 Swansea’s MN research underpinned Innoture’s development of the world’s first cosmetic MN patch product, Radara®, in late 2015 **\[C1, C2\]**. Our research on the MN printing process and skin testing of MNs has allowed Innoture to branch into an entirely new business sector \(non\-surgical cosmetic and therapeutics\) through their Radara® products, worth GBP50,000 in 2020. Additionally, advances in ink and polymer development, polymer curing, iterative printing process and tip sharpening allowed the company to develop a super\-fast, large volume, screen\-printed MN production process for Radara® – establishing a new production line in 2016.  Using Swansea’s processes has saved the company over GBP1,000,000 since 2014 compared to using other commercial facilities **\[C1\]**.  Head of Research at Innoture Ltd states, 

 “*Screen\-printing research at Swansea University was key to developing Innoture’s ability to print MNs in large volumes \(5,600 Radara patches per day\) and at low cost, allowing us to reduce manufacturing costs by 50%”* **\[C1\]**. 

 SU skin testing research has helped Innoture optimise their Radara® patches, contributing to the launch of the first and second versions of the micro\-channelling patches a year ahead of schedule “ *which allowed the company to double its turnover from 2018 to 2019”* Head of Research, Innoture Ltd, **\[C1\]**. 

 A new variation of Radara® for the total eye area is the latest high\-performance eye rejuvenation offering from Innoture and has been developed using SU research \(MN development and hyaluronic acid permeation characterisation\). 

 *“In just two years \(2014\-2016\), we've seen Radara®,* our novel anti\-ageing regimen using unique micro\-channelling patches, *go from a technological concept to an award\-winning skin care brand \(e.g. Best Home Use product of device category, My FaceMy body Awards 2016\), only with the input of Swansea University research*” Head of Research, Innoture Ltd, **\[C1\]**, also see **\[C3\]** for award example. 

 **New product development** 

 *“Prof Guy and his colleagues at Swansea University have led the way in developing MSt* \[Microstructure\] *fabrication processes, characterising our MSts, facilitating clinical trials for our products and allowing us to develop a product pipeline incorporating APIs \(Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\).”* Head of Research, Innoture Ltd **\[C1\]**. 

 Innoture’s proprietary platform has the capability to deliver small molecules, peptides and complex biologicals though a MN patch \(less than 1ml\). The ability to deliver large molecules \(above 1ml\) is a step change in transdermal patch technology. SU research has investigated delivery of some larger molecules, including hyaluronic acid and APIs \(ibuprofen, lidocaine\) with MNs, starting in 2016. 

 The foremost pipeline development products are MN pain\-relief patches containing ibuprofen and lidocaine. Transdermal drug delivery research performed by SU under the 2016 KTP was critical in developing MN coatings and drug encapsulation processes for delivery of pain relief APIs \(lidocaine and ibuprofen\) using a MN platform and in validating prototype pain\-relief patches. We were given approval by the MHRA to run a clinical investigation in 2018 to assess the performance of Lidocaine with a MN patch. The results showed a significantly enhanced delivery of APIs over current treatments. 

 SU developed all skin testing protocols and facilities, gaining full ethical approval for research on animal and human skin in 2016. This allowed Innoture’s first successful submission to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(UK\) for a clinical evaluation for a pharmaceutical application. The KTP research project with SU also successfully demonstrated a dental product via a clinical trial \(trials conducted at Bristol University in 2018, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03629041\). 

 Swansea’s research has enabled the design and delivery of a new prototype microstructure patch for drug and vaccine delivery, combining diagnostic sensors with vaccines **\[C5\]** for viral pathogens such as influenza and COVID\-19. This research has attracted GBP290,000 in grant funding **\[C5, C6\]**. This new patch will further enhance Innoture’s product pipeline and diversification into vaccine delivery. 

 **Company Impact** 

 SU’s research has directly impacted Innoture’s ability to attract investment, expand Innoture’s workforce and increase Innoture’s share price from GBP8 to GBP20 \(2016 to 2019\) **\[C1\]**. 

 Innoture secured private investment of GBP1,000,000 between 2014 and 2016 and GBP2,000,000 between 2017 and 2020 **\[C1\]**. SU data \(SEM, ethically approved skin testing, mechanical tests, clinical trials data and regulatory approvals\) and optimization of manufacturing processes undertaken by Prof Guy’s group, were critical in securing this investment and in the subsequent scale\-up and launch of Innoture’s commercial products. 

 The Radara® patches have been advertised to a global audience through publications such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan and Tatler \(see **\[C4\]** for example\) and is now available through selected retailers, skin care institutes and clinics such as national chain SK:N and Church Pharmacy. Revenues from current Radara® products have risen from GBP10,000 in 2016 to GBP50,000 in 2020 **\[C1\]**. 

 **Employment** 

 Since 2014, the number of employees at Innoture has increased from 2 to 14. 

 *“We have been able to grow our workforce by 12 since 2014 – an increase of 600% \- including employing Swansea University chemistry and engineering graduates, as a direct result of the development of our product pipeline which has grown with Swansea university research input”* Head of Research, Innoture Ltd **\[C1\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Addressing the European Parliament in January 2020 about Brexit, Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt noted: “Sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given us all so much … even its own blood in two world wars.” Yet the ‘British’ blood spilled in the two world wars is often used to promote a white triumphalist nationalist narrative. The First World War is remembered as an all\-white European combat on the Western Front, and the contribution of 4 million non\-white troops – Indians, Africans, West Indians – is so completely erased that, until recently, few British nationals of South Asian or Afro\-Caribbean origin knew that their ancestors fought in the First World War. The conventional all\-white Armistice commemoration of First World War heroes can be profoundly alienating for Britain’s multi\-racial populations. In the 1970s, the graves of Muslim First World War soldiers buried next to the Woking mosque were desecrated, while the Memorial to the Sikh and Hindu First World War veterans on the Sussex Downs was used as a rifle\-practice site in the 1990s. In the lead\-up to the centennial commemoration, the BNP chief Nick Griffin seized on the First World War to promote a far\-right white nationalist view of Britain. Against this politicised background, King’s research challenged and changed this white nationalist narrative, diversifying and decolonising First World War memory, revising the timeline of non\-white contribution to ‘British’ history from post\-Second World War immigration to 1914–1918 war service, and using their research to combat racism and Islamophobia. We succeeded in: 

-  changing the colour of war memory in the media and public sphere, especially through affecting BBC coverage; 

-  highlighting the Muslim contribution to the Allied side in order to bring together diverse sectors to combat Islamophobia and militarism; 

-  diversifying centennial commemoration by introducing ethnic groups to non\-white visual, cultural and musical First World War performances in London and regional hubs; and 

-  introducing Indians, British Indians and the Sikh community to their First World War heritage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to this project, memories of the First World War focused narrowly on European troops and writers on the Western Front: more has been written on the four British trench poets \(Owen, Sassoon, Graves and Blunden\) than on the 4 million non\-white men recruited into European and American armies. King’s researchers used extensive archival discoveries and comparative, interdisciplinary methodologies to challenge this narrative and focus instead on the role of colonial subjects \(particularly 1.5 million Indians\) in the First World War. We changed the colour of war memory and provided a more racially inclusive narrative, and we exposed the hierarchies of race and empire at the heart of the war as well as the brutality. At the same time, we found examples of inter\-European and inter\-racial cultural contact and romantic liaisons behind the lines created by the conditions of war. Our key interventions were as follows: 

#  Reconceptualising the First World War from European trench combat to global conflict through fresh material, cultural and literary artefacts 

 How do we remember and represent the wartime experiences of men and women who did not know how to read or write and yet formed the majority of the world’s population in 1914–1918? King’s research went beyond the written word into a more creative engagement with and recovery of objects, images, sound\-recordings and oral histories to examine non\-white experiences. Through many years of archival work across Europe, South Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Das recovered an extraordinary amount of hitherto unknown material – trench objects such as the blood\-stained glasses of an Indian soldier in Leeds Pals Battalion, a German helmet found with a Naga Battalion, an original recording of a song by a Gurkha soldier in a German POW camp in 1915 – along with censored letters, war diaries, journals, memoirs by Indian POWs held in Mesopotamia and a substantial but hitherto unknown body of verses, short stories, plays and fiction from South Asia. These materials were brought into dialogue through an interdisciplinary methodology to create a powerful alternative cultural and literary narrative of the First World War from below. These sources fed into *India, Empire, and First World War Culture*, which has been reviewed widely in popular press, nationally and internationally, and was awarded the Hindu non\-fiction prize in India, the Ananda Coomaraswamy Prize in the US and the European Society for the Study of English \(ESSE\) Book Prize \[1\]. Rare archival images of Indian sepoys, with introductions, are collected in the bi\-lingual visual history *Indian Troops in Europe, 1914–1918*, published in France and India \[2\]. 

#  Decolonising the archive and methodology of First World War Studies 

 King’s researchers diversified and decolonised the First World War story from its traditional Eurocentric historiography by: \(i\) recovering hitherto unknown and unheard voices of non\-white soldiers who had largely been erased from modern memory; \(ii\) establishing South Asian cultural figures such as Rabindranath Tagore and Mulk Raj Anand on a par with figures such as Owen and Sassoon; and \(iii\) recreating literary and sonic artefacts of the war era. This was made possible through two important methodological interventions: a redefinition of what constitutes the ‘colonial archive’ and the use of the ‘literary’ in historical recovery, as source\-material and mode of reading. Being non\-literate, we argued, does not mean being non\-literary: King’s research looked beyond the conventional written archive and recovered objects, images, songs and sound\-recordings to tell their stories. As the *TLS* reviewer noted, “Das brilliantly combines two approaches – ‘a redefinition of the archive’ and close, attentive reading ….Thrillingly, this close reading elevates some of Das’s protagonists to a form of equality with the traditional First World War canon, to a kind of parity with Owen and Sassoon.” Or, from India’s main literary journal *Biblio: A Review of Books*: “Das has written a book of immense significance.… It will encourage the next generation of scholars to abandon the crutches of disciplinary certainties … \[for\] the promise of a dazzling array of new scholarship that knits visual, textual and literary sources together.” 

#  Exposing the colonial past 

 From books such as *First World War: Literature, Culture, Modernity* to articles like ‘The Colors of the Past: Archive, Art and Amnesia’, Das has offered a powerful critique of sanitised and triumphant\-heroic narratives of the colonial contribution to the First World War, exposing instead contested and messy histories. ‘Diversity’, Das argues, does not necessarily mean decolonisation \[3\]. Through extensive comparative research in Europe and South Asia, the various hierarchies and ideologies of the empire, particularly around ‘martial race theory’, and different dietary regimes and accommodation for white and non\-white troops were revealed and investigated to examine the relation between empire, race and the First World War \[4\]. 

#  Reconceiving the First World War as unprecedented inter\-racial cultural encounter 

 The First World War is traditionally understood as a military clash of armies and nations. King’s researchers challenged this through extensive historical evidence. Four million non\-white men were recruited into the armies of Britain, France and Germany. Between 1914 and 1918, hundreds of thousands of South Asians, Africans and Pacific Islanders voyaged to the heart of whiteness – Europe – and beyond to take part in the war, resulting in unprecedented encounters. In wartime Ypres, there were people from 52 countries, including 200,000 Indians, 180,000 Chinese, 400,000 Vietnamese, 500,000 French colonial troops from different African nations, Maori Pioneer Battalions, African Native Labour contingents, Australians, Canadians and white South Africans. Scottish and Indian soldiers manned trenches together, Chinese coolies photographed themselves with Belgian boys and staged musical performances \[6\]. The range and degree of inter\-racial contact was showcased in the online digital sourcebook *Cultural Exchange in a Time of Global Conflict* and in the forthcoming volume *Cultural Encounters in the First World War* \(Routledge, 2020\) and *Photography in the Time of War* \(Bloomsbury, 2020\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prior to this project, the First World War was largely remembered as an all\-white European combat on the Western Front. King’s researchers changed this by including the contribution of 4 million non\-white troops in popular television and radio programmes, public lectures, large\-scale symposiums, exhibitions, concerts, dance\-theatre and newspaper articles. 

#  Changing the colour of war memory in the media and public sphere 

 Our project coincided with both the centenary of the First World War and a period of rising nationalism and xenophobia. We intervened to shape the commemorations of the war, challenging the all\-white narratives and bringing widescale attention to the role of non\-white combatants, particularly South Asians, in contributing to the much\-vaunted heroism of the British military. 

 We changed the practice of media professionals in the UK by moving the BBC’s dominant focus on British Tommies on the Western Front to the Middle East, Persia and East Africa.  In 2013, Das was appointed as historical adviser to the BBC for its centenary coverage, including the acclaimed BBC2 documentary *The World’s War* in August 2014, with sections based on Das’s research. Showcasing the experiences of Asian, West Indian and African soldiers, the programme – watched by 2,000,000 viewers and later shown across North America and South Asia –foregrounded a global understanding of the war. It also began the presenting career of the now\-celebrated Anglo\-Nigerian broadcaster David Olusoga. The enthusiasm with which the programme was received led the BBC to commission Das to write and present the Radio 4 series *Soldiers of the Empire*, which was selected as ‘Choice of the Week’. The Radio Producer and Programme Editor at the BBC remembers: “Das shared rare archival material about South Asian sepoys which revealed the truly global scope of the war and helped to correct the Eurocentric bias in our understanding of WW1 in the public sphere, including previous WW1 Programmes in the BBC.… Das’s research changed my view of the war and deepened my understanding. The programmes we made were a key contribution to the BBC’s coverage of WW1 and thanks to Das’s intervention the BBC is more aware of the importance of achieving a proper racial balance in the stories commissioned, especially on big occasions such as this 100th anniversary” \[A\]. Das was then asked to present *Essays* for Radio 3 on writers such as the Indian Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore and Indian feminist Sarojini Naidu. In 2015, he took part in a British Council public debate on ‘Race and Colonial War’ in Dar Es Salaam, which was aired on BBC World Service. The originator of the British Council\-BBC World Service partnership ‘The War that Changed the World’, reports: “\[Santanu\] shared rare archival material about South Asian sepoys which revealed the truly global scope of the war and helped to correct the Eurocentric bias in the public understanding of WW1. \[… M\]y work with Santanu \[…\] deepened my understanding and enhanced considerably the appreciation of our audiences” \[B\]. 

 We used our research to bring hitherto unknown and marginalised colonial voices to public attention. In all Das’s programmes and in interviews for the BBC’s *Today* programme, *In Tune* and *The Jeremy Vine Show*, and national radio programmes in Australia, Canada and India, Das used his archival findings to enable forgotten Indians to live again, reading from censored letters and playing original sound recordings. His finding of a pair of blood\-stained glasses of Bengali combatant Jogen Sen in Leeds Pals Battalion, reported from daily to vernacular newspapers in India, resulted in BBC Yorkshire commissioning an *Inside/Out* documentary. *The Yorkshire Post* noted: “Private Sen was the only known non\-white soldier to serve with the 15th West Yorkshire Regiment and was killed in action near the Somme in May 1916, aged 28. His story could easily have been forgotten had it not been for Dr Santanu Das” \[C\]. 

 Our research changed the perspectives of audience members at more than 80 public lectures. Head of Research and Academic Partnerships at the Imperial War Museum noted: “Attending Santanu Das’s lectures transformed my understanding of the First World War. \[…\] I have been able to highlight Das’s work to my colleagues, and this has been invaluable as the IWM – like so many other national museums – continues to confront the colonial aspects of its collections and to try to present a more rounded picture of the history we document” \[E\]. The influence of our research is ongoing. In a volume on teaching the First World War in schools, teacher and academic Dr Claire Buck claimed that “no one has done more to change the colour of memory than Santanu Das” \[D\]. 

#  Bringing together diverse sectors to combat Islamophobia and militarism 

 In the aftermath of the Brussels bombing and the associated wave of Islamophobia, Das brought together for the first time a wide range of sectors – members of the British Army and Navy, community leaders, curators from the National Army Museum, National Archives and Imperial War Museum, funders such as the HLF, academics, artists and activists – to combat Islamophobia with a discussion on commemoration. The conversation had two strands: 

-  how to instrumentalise the commemoration of colonial, particularly Muslim, soldiers who fought for the Allies to combat Islamophobia in wake of the terrorist attacks; 

-  interrogating Armistice commemorative practices and whether the sanitised, heroic and sacrificial narratives around soldiers, white or not\-white, perpetuate a militarist culture. 

 The event was filmed and facilitated dialogue for the first time among sectors that do not usually come together for political, social or ideological reasons. The Regional Partnerships Community Manager at The National Archives noted: “It was conducted just after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, and it provided a space for people of different backgrounds to address questions of Islamophobia and bias, and gave us a chance not only to challenge views on racial stereotypes but also understand their points of views and thus have a more reflective discussion. It also provided a space to heal.” \[I\] For Muslims feeling alienated, the seminar sent a clear message to various sectors to use Muslim service in the two world wars to counter Islamophobic abuse. One result of the diverse conversations at this seminal meeting at KCL was the installation of a blue plaque for the South Asian Muslim Victoria Cross winner Mir Dast. 

#  Diversifying centennial commemoration by introducing ethnic groups to non\-white visual, cultural and musical First World War performances in London and regional hubs 

 Instead of telling heroic or martial tales of non\-white participation, King’s researchers diversified First World War commemoration by placing recovered visual, literary and musical material at its centre through a series of creative collaborations with musicians, dancers and artists in diverse places and venues in India, Europe and the UK. 

 In 2014, Das organised an evening of war writings, songs and music from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East in the KCL chapel in collaboration with the British Academy. It was the first example of European and non\-European literature and music of the First World War being showcased together. Censored letters by Indian soldiers and African labourers were read alongside the war poems of Rabindranath Tagore and Katherine Mansfield. It was also the first time that a substantive South Asian and West Indian audience attended a First World War commemorative programme which, even in London, conventionally drew uniformly white audiences. The event was booked out, and feedback included: “What it did was broaden my view of how many different ordinary people from around the world were deeply affected by Europe’s war. Absolutely stunning — has made me want to explore and find out more”. At public request, the concert was performed again: in 2015 in collaboration with the German Historical Institute, thus bringing an additional German presence to the audience, and finally in 2018 at the palace in Prague, where the mix of literary and musical pieces was particularly fêted at a time of Brexit nationalism. At the Royal Albert Hall in 2018, letters by Indian soldiers were projected on a screen, and Sarojini Naidu’s poem was read out by Muslim actress Nina Wahida, both items found by Das. 

 King’s researchers exhibited their findings in the Maughan Library \(24 October – 17 December 2016\). Attendees at these public events summed up broader audience responses: “Like many people, my grandfather was called up in WWI and I know very little about his life in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. I had very little knowledge of the ‘cultural’ aspects of WWI and therefore I have been very enlightened”; “I had no idea how international – the richness and range of feeling and suffering from so many people, peoples, countries… So diverse and yet so united in feeling” \[F\]. 

#  Introducing Indians, British Indians & the Sikh community to their First World War heritage 

 In 2018, Das acted as historical advisor and shared his archival material and expertise with the renowned choreographer Gary Clark to produce the dance\-theatre *By My Troth*, based on an Indian First World War short story. It was produced by the South Asian theatre company Akademi and used British Asian actors and dancers, premiering first at the opening evening of the Jaipur Literary Festival in India and then at the Curve, Leicester. Das’s writings also directly inspired musical performances of *Sacred Sound: Sikh Music and the First World War*, conducted by the arts group Alchemy, at the Royal Armoury in Leeds in 2017, which was attended by a huge local Sikh audience in and around Leeds. The director of Alchemy wrote: “His research directly inspired two spoken word pieces and accompanying music performed by young British Asian musicians in front of large audience\[s across venues\].… Santanu transformed our views about the colour of war memory in Britain and opened the eyes of British Asian youths of today \(as well as the older generation\) to the role their ancestors played in the war and how they in turn can now make First World War Memory their own too. His publications and presentations had made a tangible difference to our understanding of the global and non\-white dimensions of the conflict, as well as its literary and musical practices, which in turn will influence the present generation of British Asian youths to carry them forward and contribute towards the making of a more diverse society” \[G\]. 

 King’s researchers enabled the Sikh community in the UK to claim the war as part of their very particular shared history with Britain. Over four years, Das collaborated with UK Punjab Heritage and gave lectures at local sites including the Brighton Pavilion and Dome \(2017\), Sri Guru Ravidass Sabha & Community Centre in Bedford \(18 May 2019\) and Wealdstone Library in Harrow \(29 June 2019\). Head of Projects at UK Punjab Heritage Association noted: “As a contributor and specialist advisor to our three\-year project ‘Empire, Faith & War: The Sikhs & World War One’, Professor Das has helped diversify war memory so that the Sikh community in the UK can now claim it as part of their shared heritage with Britain.… During the exhibition run, Professor Das gave a very well\-attended lecture at the Brunei Gallery on the Sikh contribution to the conflict. By drawing on rare archival imagery, literature and songs, he substantially enriched and changed our understanding of the war – particularly the important role played by the Sikhs. With the help of Professor Das, the Sikh community has experienced a profound shift in its sense of ownership of the story of the Sikhs’ contribution in the First World War. This will, we believe, help inter\-community dialogue, strengthen Anglo\-Sikh relations, give people a greater sense of identity, and undoubtedly help in combating racism in today’s and future generations” \[H\]. 

 Das complemented his work on national media with personalised engagements at regional hubs, interacting with a diverse range of ethnic minorities and telling them not just about the South Asian war contribution but its selective appropriation by particular religious groups, the dangers of ‘heroic’ narratives and the traditions of anti\-war dissent within India. His repeated caveats about the dangers of sanitising history impacted the museum and creative sectors too. The Regional Partnerships Community Manager at The National Archives noted: “by stressing \[history’s\] contested nature, he made it more possible for us to both celebrate the fact that Indians served in the war whilst also offering a chance to open up a space to critique the imperial relationship. As a direct result of working with Santanu we commissioned five short plays and published an online education bundle that used our records, both of which have been very warmly received” \[I\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Digital Education contributed to enhancing digital literacy, particularly within the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence \(CfE\), informing curricular change and research\-informed development of professional learning for teachers. This work now reaches 51,000 teachers and over 600,000 pupils in all 2,514 state primary and secondary schools across Scotland. To successfully embed digital literacy within the education system, the researchers: 

-  advanced national curricular change by informing the revised CfE Technologies curriculum; and 

-  enhanced teachers’ capacity to support pupils’ computer science learning by developing research\-informed curriculum resources and professional learning opportunities to embed the curricular changes. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 In collaborative research across the University of Edinburgh’s Moray House School of Education and Sport and the School of Informatics, Robertson, Manches and Pain have argued that children have a right to understand the strengths, limitations and potential risks of the technology which permeates their lives \(3.1\). This empirical research, led by Robertson, found that children often lack basic factual knowledge about how computer hardware and software work. The researchers also found that younger children tended to believe that computers have agency by wanting to help them carry out tasks, but overall the children participating in the study were divided and unsure when asked whether computers can think. These findings have important implications since children require basic knowledge of computer architecture to support them to reason realistically about possibilities and pitfalls of future technologies, including artificial intelligence. 

 In a subsequent paper \(3.2\), Robertson and colleagues from other institutions documented the theoretical perspective behind the curricular change which they influenced in computer science \(CS\), showing the importance of helping children understand how machines and languages are used to create artefacts \(3.1\), in addition to developing computational thinking skills. They described why efforts to make CS entirely focused on “computational thinking”, in the absence of knowledge of “computers”, are mistaken. They noted the importance of teaching young learners about computational thinking in everyday life, machine architecture, the semantics of programming languages, and building new software. The paper argued that learners require an understanding of three key aspects of CS education: 

1.  domains in which computers operate, 

1.  the computational mechanisms that make computers work, and 

1.  how to use the computational mechanisms to model aspects of the domains. 

 It is notable that computing curricula at school level in other countries typically focus only on aspect 3, often in the form of writing computer programs. Exploration of common computational processes such as searching or sorting which have many real world applications, or understanding how computers execute instructions in programming languages is often left until university\-level courses. The research argues that, for computer science to take its intellectual place beside other sciences at school level, all three foundational concepts should be taught from an early age. 

 Because topics such as CS are typically new to teachers, it is important to support them through resource development and professional learning. CS, in common with other scientific disciplines, requires the understanding of deep concepts and subject\-specific pedagogy as well as practical skills with the various technologies used to develop that understanding. Using a realist evaluation methodology, Robertson led the analysis of evidence gathered on the PLAN C project, a professional development programme designed to support secondary CS teachers at a time of substantial curricular change \(3.3\). The paper’s particular focus is on the formation of a professional development network of several hundred teachers across Scotland. The researchers analysed evidence from a series of observations and teacher surveys over a two\-year period with respect to the PLAN C programme theory in order to illustrate not only whether it worked as intended but why. Results indicated that the PLAN C design has been successful in increasing teachers’ professional confidence and it appears to have catalysed a powerful change in attitudes to learning. The researchers’ recommendations for teacher professional learning were to: 

-  encourage teachers to engage with pedagogical theories and emerging evidence from the current research literature; 

-  enable teachers to address gaps in their conceptual CS understanding; 

-  provide contexts where teachers are regularly able to engage in high\-quality professional dialogue with peers in their subject \(during which teachers should reflect on their classroom practice, question how their students’ learning could be improved and share ideas with each other\); and 

-  create an expectation that teachers will try out new teaching techniques regularly and reflect on these with their peers.

 Based on her research and practice in supporting CS education, starting in August 2014 Robertson contributed to a group convened by the British Computer Society and Nesta to consider what skills and concepts primary children should learn within the field of computing and information and communications technology \(ICT\), and at what stage in the curriculum \[5.1\]. The group was convened by Kate Farrell, who is now Director of Curriculum on the Data Education in Schools project at the University of Edinburgh, with Robertson as a member. During these meetings, Robertson worked with Farrell, Cutts \(University of Glasgow\) and Connor \(Strathclyde University\) with input from Education Scotland staff to develop the ideas underpinning the three significant aspects of learning, which are reflected in the researchers’ work \(3.2\). 

 In autumn 2016, Education Scotland invited Robertson and Farrell to join a working group revising the Technologies curriculum within the Curriculum for Excellence \(CfE\) \[5.1\], which supports over 51,000 teachers who work with over 600,000 learners in Scotland throughout their broad general education. Robertson, Farrell, Cutts and Connor collaborated to enhance the curriculum draft so that it aligned with the academic recommendations and research findings. These contributions have enhanced the curriculum in two important ways: 

 A\) Drawing on the research \(3.1, 3.2\), the Technologies curriculum now includes CS as a distinct area of learning, supporting learners to develop CS knowledge and skills in a coherent line of progression \[5.2\]. 

 B\) This curriculum supports curriculum organisers to implement the research findings by including the three key aspects of CS education identified by the researchers \(3.2\) within a broader framework of “key concepts” \[5.2\]: 

-  The concept “Understanding the world through computational thinking” \(TCH 0\-13a to TCH 4\-13b\) corresponds to what the research refers to as “1\) domains that can be modelled by computational mechanisms”. 

-  The concept “Understanding and analysing computing technology” \(TCH 0\-14a to TCH 4\-14c\) corresponds to “2\) computational mechanisms themselves”. 

-  The concept “Designing building and testing computing solutions” \(TCH 0\-15a to TCH 4\-15a\) maps to “3\) how to use the computational mechanisms to model aspects of the domains”. 

 Describing the curricular change, one teacher said: *“The change in curriculum has been transformational in terms of Es and Os \[curricular expectations and outcomes\]. …This is very different from other curriculums. Many are very content led. This was future proofed*” \[5.3\]. 

 Furthermore, a Policy Executive from the Scottish Government’s Learning Directorate described Robertson’s contributions to the curriculum change: *“The valuable work you undertook was significant in the wider aim of updating the curriculum to reflect the rapid and on\-going changes in digital technology within our society”* \[5.1\]. He highlighted: *“We particularly valued the academic expertise you brought to the discussions and the collaboration with Computing at Schools Scotland and the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance to ensure that learners have the opportunity to use computational thinking as a means of developing capabilities in problem solving and computing science”*. 

###  Developed research\-informed curriculum resources and professional learning opportunities to embed the curricular changes 

 The Education Scotland Technologies working group acknowledged that the introduction of a specialist curricular area such as CS within broad general education was ambitious since it would require a steep learning curve for non\-specialist teachers. Therefore, to support teachers in updating their practice, a group of academics led by Robertson and Farrell ran a series of professional learning events which were designed based on the research findings \(3.3\) including a successful conference to accompany the launch of the new curriculum and a series of “Coding and Cake” workshops on programming and data literacy. Robertson and University of Edinburgh colleague Linklater, in collaboration with Edinburgh City Council and sponsored by the technology company CGI, ran a year\-long professional learning course in Computational Thinking for 14 Edinburgh\-based primary teachers, piloting activities that met gaps in teachers’ knowledge about CS. Participants commented that the workshops and course increased their confidence in CS skills and knowledge and provided them with effective CS teaching approaches that build on pupils’ existing knowledge \[5.3\]. 

 The University of Edinburgh team developed the Teach CS Primary Guide that explains the three key concepts of the revised curriculum informed by the research, providing various example activities for each curricular level and outcome. For example, to support children in the early years who are exploring computational thinking processes involved in everyday tasks and identifying patterns \(organiser 1, outcome TCH 0\-13a\), teachers may use simple activities to help children sort toys by colour or shape, or identify the steps in everyday activities such as hand\-washing. Sorting objects in the real world is conceptually similar to sorting information by attribute, which is fundamental to computer science. This Guide was distributed to all 2,019 primary schools in Scotland in 2017 and to 1,200 subscribers to the *Times Educational Supplement Scotland* in 2020. 

 The Guide and related professional learning workshops were independently evaluated in February 2020 \[5.3\]. The purpose of the evaluation was to gather evidence of the impact \(if any\) that \(A\) the Teach CS Guide has had on the confidence and competence \(particularly understanding of CS concepts\) of primary teachers who have engaged with it while teaching the new computing science strands of the Technologies section of the CfE and \(B\) gather views from teachers about how the change in curriculum has impacted their learners. 

 The independent evaluator stated: *“Without a doubt, use of the Teach CS Handbook* \[Guide\] *has increased the confidence of those teachers using it”*. For example, one teacher reflected on the benefits: “ *although Es and Os are giving schoolteachers an understanding of what every child should understand in the curriculum, the document takes that and makes it much more manageable for teachers in schools”*. Another participant stated: *“If I hadn’t been directed to the handbook, I wouldn’t have changed my teaching. It made me see it in a different light”*. A different teacher said she regularly uses the Guide in shaping her teaching practices: “ *I use it to select my activities when I’m teaching computing science. That is what I go to; it is my go\-to thing, when I think ‘what should I be teaching?’”.* A primary teacher reflected on the different ways in which the Guide has enhanced colleagues’ teaching practices, since it has proved beneficial in terms of making technical vocabulary accessible to teachers and illustrating how each curricular aspect can be taught. For example, “ *it definitely helps older generation teachers who are not confident and also new teachers on ‘how do I actually teach it’”.* 

  

 A specialist in learning technologies for a Local Authority attended a short course run by Robertson and Farrell and, with permission from the researchers, subsequently created an open\-source, interactive version of the Guide that facilitates connections across section areas. This online resource has been shared with over 500 primary teachers across their Local Authority. As a result, *“It has led to a change in the way we are producing resources”* because senior leaders have adopted the Guide’s style for other curricular areas \[5.3\]. 

 Teachers’ enhanced practice as a result of the CS Guide and related resources has had a positive impact on pupils’ learning. For example, the Guide supports teachers to explain CS concepts in more accessible ways for children, *“helping pupils understand the concepts”* and supporting teachers to *“know the children are making progress toward this outcome”* \[5.3\]. Furthermore, teachers reported that the resources and interactive activities in the Guide have sparked pupils’ engagement and enjoyment of learning CS. 

 The evaluation report \[5.3\] concluded that: 

 *“Use of the handbook led to increased confidence among teachers – interviewees and, often, their colleagues. The handbook led to clearer understanding of key concepts and thus to an increase in teachers’ competence when teaching pupils about those concepts – to the benefit of pupils. The handbook has had an impact on teaching practices of individuals and also, through various planning processes and documents, on practices of colleagues.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Heath and colleagues have defined the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the UK since 2000, including the risk factors for Group B Streptococcus \(GBS\), the most important cause. The work led directly to national guidelines for GBS prevention, major clinician and patient education, and also recognition of the need and potential for prevention through maternal vaccination. Heath and Le Doare have addressed the critical components in the pathway toward vaccine implementation on a global scale, including definition of serocorrelates of protection to enable licensure, optimal assessment of safety in pregnancy, cost effectiveness, and public acceptability. These have led to regulatory, WHO, and government endorsement, and major charitable and commercial investment.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

#  Defining the epidemiology and disease burden related to Group B Streptococcus 

 Group B streptococcus \(GBS\) causes 90,000 infant deaths per year. Heath and colleagues have defined the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the UK. They undertook the first national surveillance study between 2000 and 2001 that established the burden of GBS disease, demonstrating that 53% of cases and 73% of fatal early\-onset cases had identifiable risk factors, including prolonged rupture of membranes and known maternal carriage of GBS \[1\]. The work led to a new national risk\-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis prevention strategy for early onset GBS \(see impact below\), and the establishment of a unique national neonatal infection surveillance network \( [www.neonin.org.uk](http://www.neonin.org.uk/)\). The St George’s\-led national surveillance of neonatal meningitis between 2010 and 2011 confirmed GBS as the commonest cause accounting for 50% of cases \[2\]. Repeat surveillance of GBS between 2014 and 2015 \[3\] identified further risk factors and preterm birth was incorporated into guidelines. In addition, the need for an alternative maternal vaccine\-based approach that would address both early and late onset disease was clearly established and the serotypes needed for 95% coverage defined \[3\]. 

#  Driving the strategy for maternal vaccine implementation 

 The group have led internationally in developing maternal vaccination strategies against a range of serious infant infections. Having established the limitations of current GBS prevention, Heath and Le Doare, with collaborators across the world, developed a pathway to maternal vaccination \[4\], and elicited support and funding from the WHO and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The evidence for and guidance on maternal vaccination safety; cost\-effectiveness; maternal vaccine acceptability, and assay standardisation in order to facilitate vaccine licensure has been provided: 

# 1.  The safety of vaccination is paramount. Based on the largest UK experience of maternal vaccination \(St George’s has done more pregnancy vaccine trials than any other centre\), Heath has developed guidelines and standards for the assessment of safety of maternal vaccination through the international Brighton Collaboration GAIA project \(https://brightoncollaboration.us/gaia/\)\[5\]. 

1.  The group demonstrated the cost\-effectiveness of maternal vaccination in a UK\-based assessment, providing an impetus for ongoing vaccine development and facilitating decision making for vaccine manufacturers, and national and international policy makers \[6\]. Data from this analysis were considered at the Department of Health GBS expert advisory group in 2018. 

1.  The group has worked to establish parent and healthcare workers’ acceptability of maternal vaccination as a strategy for prevention of disease. They have done this through collaborations with relevant partners and public presentations \(i.e. SGUL Spotlight on Science events: vaccines for babies before birth, 28 June 2016\). Their patient partner initiative is consulted on all maternal and neonatal vaccine\-related studies nationally and they work closely with the national support charities: GBSS, Meningitis Now and Meningitis Research Foundation. 

#  Pathway to licensure of maternal GBS vaccines 

 The large sample sizes required for trials to assess maternal GBS vaccine efficacy constitute a significant obstacle on the pathway to vaccine licensure. Le Doare systematically reviewed evidence of protection based on immunologic data from vaccine and sero\-epidemiological studies, and was able to establish evidence for strong correlates of protection. Immune correlates are now considered to be pivotal for licensure, negating the need for very large sample size trials. Le Doare leads an international Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) \- funded consortium \(GASTON\) to derive new standards for assessing the immunological responses to GBS and to develop standardised assays to assess serocorrelates of protection \[7\]. They are conducting UK \(MRC\-funded\), European and Ugandan \(EDCTP and BMGF\-funded\) studies to define serocorrelates of protection in the field.

#  National guidelines, practice, and policy 

 Heath’s work in defining the national GBS\-disease burden and risk factors resulted in formulation and implementation of the first and then updated national guidelines for the prevention of early onset neonatal GBS disease based on intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics given to women with defined risk factors \[A \(RCOG Greentop guidelines 2017\), B\]. Prior to this, there were no agreed national policies to reduce GBS infection in infants. 

 The updated guidelines resulted in changes to the UK screening pathway, enabling more mothers to receive antibiotics during pregnancy and the likely prevention of many cases of GBS disease. Based on risk factors including mode of delivery, rupture of membranes and known carriage of GBS, 25% of live births were originally targeted for prophylaxis. In 2017, the addition of preterm infants as a risk group, resulted in an additional 7% of all live\-births being added to the screening pathway \[A\]. These numbers equate to approximately 160,000 mothers being eligible to receive antibiotics in labour in the UK per year, potentially preventing many cases of early onset GBS disease. 

 While the relative incidence of early vs. late onset disease, and the case fatality rate of early onset disease both decreased between 2014 and 2015 compared with surveillance between 2000 and 2001\(case fatality decreased from 10.6% to 5.2%\), the work also clearly established the need for a new strategy to address both early and late onset GBS disease. 

 This work culminated in Professors Heath and Le Doare’s membership of the UK Department of Health GBS research steering committee, which made recommendations for future research to prevent GBS in the UK \[C\]. These made clear the critical need for a new strategy focused on maternal vaccination, a body of work that the group is now leading. 

#  Impact on practitioners and patients: Educating clinicians and parents about neonatal meningitis 

 The group’s work to educate clinicians and parents about neonatal infection, meningitis and, specifically, GBS, has directly informed guidance nationally and internationally. The RCPCH, Meningitis Now and Meningitis Research Foundation have developed tools for the recognition and management of neonatal meningitis via online tools \[Da \(with over 1,000 hits\)\], clinical algorithms \[Db\] and patient information \[Dc\], which are all derived from this research \(please see testimonial letter from MRF\) \[E\]. 

#  Global Policy and Regulatory body endorsement of maternal vaccinations 

 Based on their contributions, both Professors Heath and Le Doare sit on the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) subcommittee addressing GBS vaccine development issues and have contributed to critical reports on the Preferred Product Characteristics and Vaccine Value Proposition, culminating in the WHO scientific advisory group of experts on immunisation \(SAGE\) agreement to prioritise GBS vaccine licensure for global use \[F, G\]. 

 Furthermore, they instigated a pivotal meeting between the GASTON consortium \(led by Le Doare, and funded by BMGF\) and the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) and the Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) in 2018. This resulted in acceptance of the principle of a pathway based on correlates of protection toward licensure of GBS vaccines, providing the support needed for policy makers to recommend its implementation \[H\]. 

 As a result, the US FDA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\)/ EMA and WHO have endorsed the group’s proposed route to facilitate GBS vaccine licensure, representing a step change in the way that vaccines are licenced and facilitating potential accelerated licensure for other maternal vaccines. 

#  Impact on maternal vaccine safety 

 Professor Heath’s work with the Brighton Collaboration GAIA project resulted in the development of standards for assessing vaccine safety in pregnancy \[6 \(in research above\)\]. Professor Heath presented guidelines to the WHO Global advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety in June 2016.  The committee then recommended their widespread use \[I\]. These guidelines have been implemented as the gold standard for assessing maternal vaccine safety in clinical trials, facilitating maternal vaccine development for other important indications \(e.g. respiratory syncytial virus \(RSV\), pertussis \[I\]\), as well as GBS. 

#  Commercial impact 

 The group’s work to develop a pathway to a maternal GBS vaccine, endorsed by regulatory and global policy bodies, and backed by cost effectiveness data, has led to significant charitable and commercial investment. Funding for studies in the UK \(MRC\), Europe \(EDCTP\), South Africa \(BMGF\) and Uganda \(BMGF\) has been secured. Pfizer and Minervax, the two leading vaccine candidate manufacturers, are also undertaking phase 2b trials of their products, within the St George’s led EDCTP\-funded PREPARE consortium with results available by 2024 \[J\]. It is anticipated that these vaccine trials with immunological endpoints, known from the serocorrelate work to be protective, can lead to a vaccine being licenced by 2025.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Physicists at Queen’s University Belfast use their research programmes for a range of outreach and educational activities in Northern Ireland, as an integral part of the annual Northern Ireland Science Festival \(NISF\). By explaining the nature of light, its applications in modern technology and how we use it in scientific research, we target, and demonstrably impact, a wide audience.  Our interactive ‘Lasers Live’ exhibit is engaged by tens of thousands in normal years. Random sample surveying reveals new learning in over 70% of participants \(with >90% confidence\). Another key outcome of these surveys is that over 80% of all age groups would see more events like Lasers Live. This has had direct impact on decision making by National Museums NI for current and future science installations. Physics teachers and schoolchildren report appreciation of educational support through this programme. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Outreach and promotion of physics to school pupils and the general public is performed by staff in all our Research Centres. The bulk of public outreach in the REF assessment period involved researchers and results from the Centre for Plasma Physics \(CPP\) and the Astrophysics Research Centre \(ARC\). Together, these research centres use the nature of light and its applications in technology and science to encourage appreciation, interest and engagement in STEM. 

 An engaged team of people focus on delivering this programme to a wide range of audiences. This includes local schools, to the general population in Northern Ireland and even worldwide viewers. In CPP, Prof. B. Dromey developed our Lasers Live programme in 2015 and continues to oversee its management under the auspices of his EPSRC grants \(EP/L02327X/1 \(2014\), EP/P016960/1 \(2017\), EP/P010059/1 \(2017\)\). Dr. M. Yeung runs and organises this event and collects the key indicators of impact given in Fig 1. This has had a direct impact in how National Museums NI plan and conduct events. Members of the ARC \(Prof. Fitzsimmons \(NI Science Festival, Irish Astronomical Association, BBC Documentaries, School Teacher Curriculum Support\), Dr. M. Schwamb \(Planet 4 Citizen Science, BBC Documentaries\) and Prof. S. Smartt \(SmarttScience, Irish Astronomical Association\)\) all engage in activities focused on growing public awareness of our place in the universe. 

 Since 2015, CPP has operated the “Lasers Live” outreach event to showcase its research in high power lasers and promote the public’s knowledge of light\-based technologies.  At the core of this underpinning research is the world\-class TARANIS laser facility based in the School of Mathematics and Physics **\[R1\]**.  The majority of CPP researchers work in fields based around using such lasers to generate secondary radiation sources with unique properties such as ultrashort pulse ion beams and coherent X\-rays.  For example, **\[R2\]** use proton sources generated by the TARANIS laser to perform time\-resolved measurements of ion\-induced damage in matter on timescales that cannot be reached with other sources. The “Lasers Live” event arose as an opportunity to raise awareness of this facility and our research and to inspire an interest in light\-based science and technology beyond just high\-power lasers, driven by CPP\-led expertise. 

 At the same time, ARC has engaged in a programme of outreach activities based around their core research areas of Solar Physics, Solar\-System studies, Exoplanet research and Transient science \(supernovae and gravitational wave sources\), all of which received significant STFC/Royal Society/ERC funding during the REF assessment period. High\-visibility research featuring in our outreach activities include the first kilonova identified as a source of gravitational waves **\[R3\]**. As the first \(and currently only\) gravitational wave source with a detected electromagnetic signature, GW170817 gave the first direct evidence of the origin of heavy elements via neutron star collisions \( [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science\-environment\-41640256](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41640256)\). Another highlight was the study of the first interstellar object discovered passing through our Solar system, 1I/’Oumuamua **\[R4\]**. Rapid investigation revealed a surface similar to inert comets and the possibility of ice being maintained under a crust, possibly developed in interstellar space \( [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science\-environment\-42397398](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42397398)\). 

 A recent broadening of research effort into citizen science by the appointment of new staff is continuing *via* an established Zooniverse project on Martian weather systems **\[R5\]**. This project uses imaging of polar geyser deposits by the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to measure wind patterns and climate variations near the South Pole of Mars. This is currently leading to an upcoming project on exoplanets using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \(TESS\)/ Next Generation Transit Survey \(NGTS\) data. The recent first light images from the world’s largest Solar telescope used cameras led by ARC \( [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk\-northern\-ireland\-51308335](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-51308335)\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 LIGHT\! OUTREACH\! ACTION\! is a multifaceted outreach programme focused on light\-based science and technology developed in QUB to grow awareness of how we make the brightest sources of light on Earth to how we study the brightest sources of light in the Universe. 

 **Informing decision making in National Museums NI and NISF** 

 The centrepiece of the annual LIGHT\! OUTREACH\! ACTION\! agenda is the interactive Lasers Live exhibit. This was created and is managed by CPP physicists and its overarching aim is to entice all ages groups \(Fig 1\) to engage with Physics\-based knowledge transfer *via* an interactive display, staffed by enthusiastic PhD students. Additionally, it raises awareness in NI of the cutting\-edge light\-based research taking place within their local universities. Drawing inspiration from UNESCO’s International Year of Light, in its first year \(2015\) Lasers Live became a focal point of the Ulster Museum’s involvement with the NISF, reaching over 12,000 members of the public, including many school groups. Yearly events have seen an explosive growth in visitor numbers during the annual NISF, reaching >30,000 in 2019. For 2020, numbers were lower due to growing concerns about Covid19 in late February. Our presence has been central to this growth, as outlined by the National Museums NI Head of Curatorial: *“Lasers Live has become a roaring success in its own right contributing to a remarkable year\-on\-year increase in visitor numbers to the museum as shown below.”* **\[S1\]**. 

 The interest generated by Lasers Live influenced the Museum to install additional science exhibits \(Fig 1, question d\),  *“The clear appetite among the public for more science exhibits as demonstrated by Lasers Live was part of the case for making the Elements exhibit a permanent feature in the museum”* **\[S1\]**, It has also played a central role in the success of the NISF, directly assisting the establishment of one of largest science festivals in the UK as highlighted by the Festival’s Director: *“This is an annual highlight of our programme, with the interactive displays and public participation giving us our largest footfall of any single event.”  \[S2\]** The previous experience of QUB Physics staff led to an invitation to join the founding Board of NISF in 2014 *“…due to his experience in public engagement and outreach. He was instrumental in obtaining funding from the local University sector for the NISF, and continues to assist us in guiding the festival each year.”* **\[S2\]**. Combined, this evidence demonstrates how the physics light\-based outreach agenda has successfully provided direct input into the decision\-making process for Museums NI and NISF. 

 **Evidence of enhanced learning opportunities through engagement** 

 
 Figure 1 Survey responses and demographic breakdown compiled across three Lasers Live events.  Questions are listed on the right. 

1.  Today I learnt why objects have colour \(Basic Physics knowledge\) 

1.  Today I learnt the difference between the light from a laser and the light from a light bulb \(Principle of coherence\) 

1.  Today I learnt how a computer screen uses the polarisation of light to work. \(How these influence real life\) 

1.  Would you like to see more events like Lasers Live? \(yes/no response only, gauging appetite for future activities\) 

As part of Lasers Live, large scale random sample surveys to determine the before and after impact of our events were conducted throughout 2017, 2018 and 2019. These data are summarised in Fig 1 as taken from a random sample of 1229 participants \(demographics, evidencing reach and scope of our events, are shown in the pie charts\). Random samples were taken in writing, on iPads \(Survey Monkey\) and by direct presenter\-participant engagement. The samples show increased engagement amongst the 12\-17 year old age group and the over 65s. Otherwise, we record near uniform engagement across the 18\-64 year age bracket. This indicates that the results of our survey \(columns\) are an accurate % representation of the general impact of Lasers Live and not skewed by any one demographic. In the 3 questions relating to learning outcomes \(a\-c\), we record a consistent >70% confirmation of increasing knowledge. Furthermore, d\) reveals >80% desired for more events of this nature. This granularity in our data has directly impacted how National Museums NI decide on installations i.e. ‘Elements’ exhibit in quote from **\[S1\]** above.  When it is considered that these random samples are taken from > 80,000 visitors over 3 years we can have high confidence that these results are an accurate representation of the overall interaction for Lasers Live. 

 Breaking down these data along the lines of associated comments reveals that the core impacts of Lasers Live achieved through this engagement were: 

-  **Challenging understanding**: “How does a plasma ball actually work?” \( **\[S3\]**, pg7\); “It was brilliant because was learned \[SIC\] how electrons go through your hand and lights up the stick” \( **\[S3\]**, pg5\). 

-  **Changing perceptions:** “I was apprehensive about physics because it never kept my attention. The presenters explained the material in a relatable way and with experiments so it was fun. Thank you” \( **\[S3\]**, pg14\); “I learnt something new. Kind of cool” \( **\[S3\]**, pg26\). 

-  **Inspiring novel thinking** “you could explain how colour reflects from one wall to another?” \( **\[S3\]**, pg8\). 

-  **Engaging the next generation**: “…the children of Queens childcare services loved it” \( **\[S3\]**, pg9\); “Excellent at catching children’s attention\! And keeping it we had to drag them away\!” \( **\[S3\]**, pg12\). 

 In a mark of its success, this activity has branched out to other events around Belfast, with both Lasers Live and astrophysics exhibitions being very popular at events such as Late Lab \(2016, 2017, 2019\), Science Uncovered \(2016, 2017\) and W5 Late \(2018\), designed to attract the difficult\-to\-reach demographic of 18\-35 year olds **\[S1, Fig 1\]**. Members of ARC accelerated this expansion by hosting public lectures, Sun/Moon watches, and Astronomy Question Time panels.  Indeed, the reach of Lasers Live has been extended outside Northern Ireland, with appearances at the Cavan\-Monaghan Science Festival \(2017, 2018\) and Dublin Maker \(2018, 2019\). 

 A recent development has been the operation of citizen science projects on Martian geology and weather using the Zooniverse platform. Version 1 of “Planet Four” reached over 30,000 members of the general public \(Aye et al. 2019\). Version 2.0 launched in March 2020, with the two separate projects engaging approximately 24,000 and 12,000 people respectively in 65 countries. This is one of our activities to engage with a wide age group; *“You gave an old lady hope and that I was still capable of using my brain and doing something worthwhile.”* **\[S4\]**. 

 Staff are highly visible in promoting scientific understanding and their research in the media. Invitations occur due to the staff being valued as clear communicators of their science. “The Conversation” articles on Laser Physics and Planetary Science have been read 863,000 times and 460,000 times respectively. ARC staff featured in BBC Horizon programmes and other documentaries and have been interviewed in the BBC series “The Sky At Night” at least once per year **\[S5\]**. ARC research has influenced the subjects chosen for those programmes. Indeed, the February 2018 episode of this BBC2/4 show was entirely based at QUB, due to their work on ‘Oumuamua \(i.e. Fitzsimmons et al. 2018\), *“You’ll see from the viewing figures below that this programme reached an especially large audience and generated some particularly positive feedback.”* **\[S5\]**. 

 <ins> **Educational impact**</ins> 

 Since 2013, there has been a 28% decrease in the number of NI students taking Physics \`A’\-levels, a reflection of the more general decline in NI students taking STEM A\-Levels over the 2004\-2014 period \(NI Assembly Research and Information Service Research Paper NIAS 620\-15\) **\[S6\]**. Through our outreach efforts we have counteracted this trend and maintained the number of students entering undergraduate Physics degrees, by promoting physics to school pupils and supporting local teachers on new syllabus content in astrophysics. *“Your workshop plus the materials you gave us made a clear difference in delivering this to our students”* **\[S7\]**. 

 In May 2014, ARC staff hosted the STFC “Seeing the Universe Exhibition” and 3 associated public lectures, visited by hundreds of members of the general public plus 9 school parties of 160 pupils during the week. ARC also host the bi\-monthly meetings of the largest amateur astronomy society in Northern Ireland **\[S8\]**. 

 During the Covid\-19 lockdown in Spring 2020, ARC staff hosted an online learning platform for teachers and parents called ‘SmarttScience’, providing space science resources and a series of 6 linked lessons aimed at students 8 \- 12 years old with associated teaching material \(  [https://www.smarttscience.com/](https://www.smarttscience.com/) \). One teacher reported *“This was a really fun lesson that the pupils very much enjoyed. The material aligns with the Key* *Stage 2 curriculum and the topic of 'Our place in the universe', which is very helpful.”* **\[S9\]**. An online ‘Experience Physics from Home’ event organised by CPP staff was attended by 140 16–17 year\-olds, with feedback including *“Before school and work experience were cancelled, I struggled to find any work experience opportunities pertaining to aspiring physics students. So, this opportunity coming up is like a God send.”* **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Nottingham research has transformed knowledge of the timing, circumstances, and cultural impact of the human\-instigated, global distribution of fallow deer populations. It shows that many contemporary issues in fallow deer management and conservation directly reflect historical changes to geographical and biocultural circumstances. Impact has been achieved by using this understanding to: 

1.  Change deer management guidance and conservation policies of specialist interest groups, deer managers and conservation organisations in the UK, Barbuda and in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) Red List. 

1.  Create, and stimulate the creation of, interdisciplinary educational resources for the public in the UK and Barbuda. 

1.  Transform awareness of the significance of fallow deer for heritage and environment sector practitioners in the UK and Barbuda and, in turn, the communities they engage.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 At the University of Nottingham, **Sykes** \(UoN 2006 – 2018\) led a transdisciplinary team, including **Miller** \(UoN 2012 – present\), **Daujat** \(UoN 2014 – present\) and Karis Baker \(based at Durham University\), of archaeologists, geneticists, geochemists, art historians and anthropologists in research that transformed understanding of fallow deer. The AHRC\-funded ‘Dama International: Fallow deer \( *Dama dama dama*\) and European Society 6000 BC \- AD 1600’ project \(2012\-2015\) delivered the first transdisciplinary programme of research into the most widely distributed deer species on the planet. In 2014, the reach of this work was extended to include the Mesopotamian fallow deer subspecies \( *D.d mesopotamica*\) through research by **Daujat**. The results have radically changed understanding of the timing, circumstances, and bio\-cultural impact of fallow deer species across the world, from prehistory to the present. 

 This research shows that fallow deer are an excellent proxy for human diasporas, both physical and ideological. The timing and location of fallow deer introductions beyond their native range are the result of successive human actions. The research has shown that this was motivated by human attitudes towards the dominance of nature: that wild animals, a living representation of the wilderness, could be managed, bringing order to the natural world. These attitudes were discussed by Columella and Varro, writing at the time fallow deer were first being introduced to Western Europe. The team have demonstrated that similar worldviews drove subsequent translocations of the species in Medieval Europe and across the globe as part of colonial expansion to the ‘New World’. UoN\-led transdisciplinary investigations of the physical and cultural circumstances of fallow deer through time has provided interpretation that is impactful for a range of disciplines and audiences. Three key results of this research served to underpin the subsequent programme of impact: 

 \(1\) Understanding when historical fallow deer populations were translocated, and the associated cultural reasons for doing so. Received wisdom suggested that fallow deer were native to Anatolia \(modern\-day Turkey\), but the research identified previously unknown glacial refugia for the species **\(1\)**. Fallow deer became culturally important within these native distributions in ways that later influenced Greek and Roman culture **\(2\)**. From the 1<sup>st</sup> century AD, fallow deer were translocated through Europe and into Britain, where they were imparked at high status sites, such as Fishbourne Roman Palace, as symbols of identity and status. Fallow deer are a proxy for the movement of the accompanying people, but also for the movement of cultural ideas and attitudes to the natural world **\(2\)**. 

 \(2\) Identification of an extirpation of Roman fallow deer populations in Britain, with a later re\-introduction **,** spurring the fashion for Medieval deer parks **\(3\)**. Practices associated with hunting fallow deer became central to society as highly ritualised markers of status **\(4\)**. Medieval and post\-Medieval groups that delighted in fallow deer, took populations with them as they navigated a growing empire. This continued the spread of fallow deer, their cultural significance and associated worldviews **\(4\-5\)**. 

 \(3\) Contextualising the present\-day problem of overstocking of fallow deer in Britain as a legacy of the introduction of Medieval hunting stock. Associated legacy solutions, like hunting or \(in the modern vernacular\) culling, are unpopular with the public but management is necessary for deer and environmental health **\(5\)**. In other parts of the world, modern fallow deer populations have become culturally iconic but have problematic conservation status. In Barbuda, this legacy can be traced to 18<sup>th</sup>\-century colonial movement of fallow deer populations from Britain **\(6\)**.

1.  **Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 Globally, fallow deer populations are simultaneously considered to be domestic and translocated, feral and invasive, wild and endangered, locally extinct and subject to rewilding campaigns. This patchwork of understanding and research oversight of the biocultural significance of this species, meant there was little comprehension of how this species came to occupy a wide range of environmental and cultural niches. UoN\-led research has addressed this, with outcomes that have shaped conservation policies, changed deer management practices and built sustainable capacity for a wider understanding of the cultural significance of this species around the world. 

1.  **Shape deer management and conservation policies** 

 The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) Red List is globally recognised as the most authoritative guide on the status of biological diversity, compiling threats to species, their ecological distribution and requirements, and information on conservation actions that should be taken to reduce risk of extinction. It is consulted by governments, organisations, and individuals to understand and mitigate conservation issues. When updating the Red List entry for Persian fallow deer in 2015, the IUCN executive approached researchers on UoN\-led fallow deer projects \( **Daujat** and Baker\) to contribute to the international guidance on extant but endangered populations in Israel and Iran. 20% of the current \(2015\) Red List entry has changed from the preceding \(2013\) entry in areas such as Geographic Range, Threats and Population, directly reflecting input drawn from our research **\[A\]**. 

 In Barbuda, where fallow deer are a source of pride and national identity, the effects of Hurricane Irma significantly threatened translocated populations of the species. UoN research **\(6\)** was used by the director of NGO Barbuda Research Complex, to inform the deer preservation and conservation work on the island **\[B\]**. As the Director noted: “ *The research is the only existing scientific information on the Barbuda fallow deer and in this regard it presents an invaluable resource for the conservation effort, given that the deer is facing extinction… we are now working towards embedding these findings into policy recommendations for Barbuda’s government…* *the findings are providing valuable input to influence governmental priorities regarding the preservation of deer*” **\[B\]**. 

 In Britain, the team used findings from our research to change the decision\-making practices of organisations and individuals who manage deer. These engagements occurred through 25 talks to special interest groups, such as the British Deer Society, the Deer Initiative, the Ministry of Defence, the Small Woods Association and the National Trust and independent deer managers. Individual events regularly attracted up to 50 people. Leading Deer Welfare Specialist, who consults with all of these groups, and provides veterinary services to c.5000 deer on deer parks and farms in the UK, explained how the research affected this change in practice in three important ways **\[C\]**: 

 1\) Refined the culling strategies of deer managers and deer park keepers through the application of the new method for ageing fallow deer developed by the Dama International team **\(7\)**, ensuring that herd size is managed through informed decision making. 

 2\) Informed new clinical understandings of bovine tuberculosis in fallow deer for deer managers, park keepers and vets, through this more accurate ageing of infected individuals **\(7\)**, which “will help to protect and care for the herds better but also contribute to minimising the negative financial impact of TB in deer populations”. 

 3\) Enabled veterinary professionals to persuade deer managers and park keepers to recognise the importance of out\-breeding **\[C, Dii\]**, by challenging pre\-conceived notions that fallow deer across the UK are genetically identical **\(1\)**; in turn this minimises the health risks associated with closed herds including “reduced fertility and/or increased neonatal mortality…. reduced immunocompetence and … \[increased\] susceptibility to parasitism and disease”. 

 In 2018, **Miller** provided evidence to the City of London’s *Epping Forest and Buffer Lands Deer Management Review* **\[Di\].** The results have informed 20\-year policy and guidance for the management of c.700 fallow deer inhabiting the 7942\-acre site **\[Dii\],** visited by 4.2 million annually. Head Keeper and Constable, notes that the City of London Corporation *“turned to Dr **Miller** of the Dama International Project for up\-to\-date research in overhauling…policies. The tender specified that the research outcomes of the Dama International Project were to be considered in the review”* **\[Diii\]**. Our research highlighted the cultural significance **\(3, 4\)** of the forest deer, underpinning all resulting policy to maintain the presence of fallow deer at the site \(in contrast to Muntjac populations\) **\[Dii\]**. An important finding of the research was to confirm that the Birch Hall Sanctuary population is not genetically unique **\(1\)**, thereby changing the relative status of these deer and the policies by which they are managed by their keepers **\[Dii\]**. 

1.  **Create, and stimulate others in the creation of, interdisciplinary educational resources** 

 In 2014, UoN Dama International researchers were invited to partner with Fishbourne Roman Palace **\(2\)** and Dudley Castle Museum **\(3\)** to create major new exhibitions for the independent heritage venues. Both exhibitions had significant reach: the Curator of Fishbourne Roman Palace noted that 30,000 attended the exhibition between September 2014 and March 2015. Feedback from the Palace noted the interdisciplinary nature of the exhibition, including archaeological science and natural history, which enabled them to reach new audiences by departing from their usual stories of Roman architecture **\[E\]**. Directly inspired by her visit to the Fishbourne exhibition, author Caroline Lawrence set elements of her children’s book *The* *Romans Quest: Escape From Rome* \(2016\) at the site, with reference to fallow deer in the text and explanatory notes **\[F\]**. *“Your exhibition convincingly argued that fallow deer were introduced by the Romans to the UK for the first time right there at Fishbourne. This was something I was not aware of before… and actually inspired aspects of my novel.”* *Escape from Rome* has \[text redacted\] and c.27 schools are using it as a class reader for Key Stage 2 **\[Fii\]**. 

 Another independent volume that draws heavily on UoN fallow deer research is Dan Eatherley’s *Invasive Aliens* \(2019\), which has sold 3115 copies internationally and was a Sunday Times, Telegraph and Waterstones Book of the Year. The author notes **\[G\]: “** *In the Dama International Project research I found a species that was particularly emblematic, serving to highlight many of the crucial themes that characterise human relationships with transported species… The research thus helped me appreciate and convey to my readers the complexity of the history of human animal relationships and the circumstances and consequences of introducing new species, not just the fallow deer, but also other species discussed in my book.”* 

 Between 2013 and 2016, the National Trust invited UoN researchers to develop a series of ‘deer unmaking’ events, accompanied by a resource booklet created by the team, centred on the history of ritualised Medieval hunting. These events have been characterised as *“provocative, perception challenging and engaging”* by National Trust’s Consultancy Manager **\[H\]**. They raised wider public awareness of the cultural role of fallow deer at historic houses and changed public perception of the role of hunting: Hall notes that this is *“now part of the Trust’s narrative at sites with a historical connection to fallow deer,*” **\[H\]**, examples include Studley Royal \(Yorks\), Charlecote \(War\), Calke Abbey \(Derbs\), Lyme Park \(Ches\), Holnicote Estate \(Som\), Dyrham Park \(Glos\), Knole \(Kent\), Dunwick Heath \(Suff\), Hatfield Forest \(Essex\) and Powis Castle in Wales. 

 Rollout of educational resources at Epping Forest \(June 2020, **\[Diii\]**\) and Barbuda \(July 2020, **\[B\]**\) have been postponed due to COVID\-19 restrictions **\(COVID statement\).** 

1.  **Transform awareness of the significance of fallow deer for heritage and environment sector practitioners** 

 As a result of UoN\-led research, the team built capacity amongst heritage and environment sector workers to raise wider public awareness of the fallow deer they managed in provocative and engaging ways, changing the outlook of the practitioners to this species, and therefore the information and interpretation that is presented to the public across a number of sites important to environmental and cultural heritage across the UK **\[D, E, H\]**: 

 The impact at Fishbourne Roman Palace included changing the way that curators, staff, and volunteers view the site, engage the public, and approach research with other Higher Education Institutions. Head Curator noted: *“the story \[of the Fishbourne fallow deer\]* **\(2\)** *has been embraced by all of our staff here and is now as central to our visitor interpretation as the story of the building and our mosaics. It has also changed staff attitudes towards research at the Palace – the overwhelming feeling now being that research is interesting, relevant and worthwhile – this has led to a desire within the organisation to engage with other projects in the future”* **\[E\]**. 

 At the National Trust, our research has been embedded in the training of the staff delivering property tours. For example, at Belton House \(Lincs\) which receives c.400,000 visitors annually, 60 staff and 300 volunteers now include information on the patching of the knuckle bone floor with fallow deer remains from the herd at the site **\(4\)** into their engagements with the public, along with wider research findings **\(7\)**. Deer managers at the site have also used the research to inform their walks, which take place four times a year with c.20 members of the public, meaning that some 480 people have been exposed to a perception of fallow deer that has been changed by the research **\[H\]**. Across the National Trust properties with deer management teams, the team trained stalkers in Medieval ‘unmaking’ techniques **\(U3\)**, which they have gone on to use as part of their deer management and educational programme. The National Trust notes: *“Medieval\-style ‘Deer Unmakings’ at the properties has helped to promote a ‘plot to plate’ approach to the annual cull and venison sales. Since the work of the Dama International Project, the estate has embraced the product as firmly marketed ‘Belton Venison’ where previously there was more circumspection in terms of the origins of our menu offering,”* **\[H\]**. Similar planned work at Epping Forest with environment sector professionals by **Miller** in 2020 was postponed due to COVID\-19 restrictions **\(COVID statement\).** 

 As a result of these changes, the Dama International project was identified by the AHRC as an outstanding example of impact and showcased it in their 10th Anniversary publication **\[I\]** where it is highlighted that “ *An AHRC project has overturned earlier theories about the origins of a much\-loved species…* *the project team have been working with the British Deer Society, the National Trust and inner\-city schools to highlight the cultural significance of the fallow deer herds as well as the need to manage the populations — several National Trust properties are now selling fallow deer venison in their gift shops and cafes.”*

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Dementia research and public engagement by Edinburgh researchers has challenged societal views of people with dementia, and brought to light the value of peer support and social networks by: 

-  Influencing ministerial views and UK Government recommendations to support new 'dementia\-friendly' community policies in England. 

-  Leading to 91% of Commissioners of Social Services in England implementing the recommended dementia services, benefitting an estimated 1 million people. 

-  Informing policies, strategies and practices in Wales and Scotland to improve dementia support services in devolved administrations. 

-  Increasing awareness among the public, and health and social care practitioners, of the challenges and opportunities of living with dementia through a series of influential performing art outputs.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Edinburgh researchers have examined the experiences and lives of people with dementia. Their research findings emphasise the importance of creating an environment in which people with dementia can live more inclusive lives. Three projects have led to changes in policy, practice, and public awareness based on these findings. 

1.  Funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme, the **Healthbridge** research project \(2010\-2012\) analysed the impact and sustainability of services recommended by the National Dementia Strategy for England \(2009\). Clarke, Wilkinson, Keyes, and Alexjuk undertook a major analysis of 40 pilot services across England, which claimed to offer an innovative approach, designed to empower the people they sought to serve. They used a large mixed\-methods design of surveys, workshops and 155 interviews. 47 people with a diagnosis of dementia and 54 carers were interviewed on up to three occasions. The research provided strong evidence of the value of peer support and ‘Dementia Advisors’ \(professionals who are experts in living with dementia and accessing local support\). Specifically, the research identified how the creation of Dementia Advisor positions and support services provided substantial benefits for people with dementia \(and their families\). These benefits were achieved through building social networks and sharing information, supporting the re\-narration of people’s lives, and enhancing people’s control of their lives and their dementia. The research advocated for such approaches being located in a broader public health policy framework \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\). 

1.  Building directly on this research, Clarke, Wilkinson, and Keyes were awarded an ESRC grant \(2014\-2016\) to conduct a secondary data analysis of the Healthbridge interview dataset. The project **Inciting Dialogue and Disruption in Dementia \(IDDD\)** analyzed the data with input from 34 people with dementia at eight workshops. Partnered with Alzheimer Scotland and the Mental Health Foundation, the project highlighted and articulated the subtle and often hidden shifts that can occur in relationships, which can lead to people with dementia experiencing social exclusion \(3.5\). Key findings included: 

-  Dementia can compromise the ability to adhere to presumed but unspoken social expectations, leading to a gradual withdrawal of friends and withdrawal of oneself culminating in social exclusion \(3.5\). 

-  Peer support, which is underpinned by a set of social expectations of peer identity and mutual self\-support, can restore a sense of social inclusion \(3.5, 3.6\). 

-  In order to better support social inclusion, more attention should be given to the collective nature of care, including peer support, families, communities and professionals, with people with dementia recognised as playing an active role within this network \(3.5, 3.6\). 

-  New social expectations based on co\-operative listening, co\-operative action, and co\-operative caring lead to enhanced solidarity with people with dementia and a society where they can be included in community, social and public life \(3.5, 3.6\). 

1.  Clarke led the **Risk & Resilience in Dementia** **\(RRD\)** project, funded by North of Tyne Primary Care Trust \(2011\-12\). The project examined dementia in everyday life and involved interviewing people with a diagnosis of dementia, their family carers and professional staff in rural and urban areas, and asked about their understanding of risk in everyday life. The research team found that people’s familiarity with people and place helps to nurture a “narrative citizenship” in which they can tell a story of being included in society. However, they note that this familiarity with place may also create a social barrier and a sense of estrangement leading to social and psychological detriment. Clarke and Wilkinson coined the term “silent harms” to describe how risk perception and efforts to safeguard people with dementia can limit or remove choices and activities, reduce well\-being, and disenfranchise people with dementia \(3.6, 3.7\). They proposed a range of factors that impact on the development of dementia friendly communities. \(PI Clarke Northumbria University 1/7/11\-31/7/11, Edinburgh University 1/8/11\-31/12/12\).

 4. Details of the impact 

 The NHS estimate that one in 14 people over the age of 65 in the UK have dementia, and the condition affects one in six people over 80. By 2025, the number of people with dementia in the UK will be more than one million. Edinburgh researchers have raised awareness of living with dementia and associated service needs, and improved the design and availability of dementia services for people in the UK and beyond. 

  

 Reforming policy and service delivery in England 

 Dementia Advisors help people to come to terms with a diagnosis, and to navigate the care and support that is available. The Healthbridge research project evaluated and identified the effectiveness of the Dementia Advisor role \(3.1\), and the findings substantially influenced government policy and action. In Oct 2013, Norman Lamb MP, then the Minister of State for Care and Support, wrote to all social service commissioners of dementia services in England to recommended implementation of the research findings: “ *In my view, the report provides strong evidence of the value of both measures as part of a program of post diagnostic support for people with dementia and their carers”* and stated, “ *These evaluation findings provide important evidence in pursuing the improvement needs. The information will I believe be of considerable value to local commissioners in taking decisions on local dementia service”*’ \(5.1\). 

 As a result of Lamb’s recommendation to service commissioners, by 2016, 91% of commissioners \(81 of 89 commissioners who responded to an IPSOS MORI survey\) across England provided Dementia Advisor services \(5.2, p.5\). There are no formal records of the number of Dementia Advisors across England. However, based on the IPSOS MORI survey, Clarke and Wilkinson estimate that 207 services have been commissioned over five years, each with an average of two Dementia Advisors \(who worked with between 100 and more than 2000 people living with dementia per year\). As such, the large\-scale implementation and expansion of Dementia Advisor services \(based on the Healthbridge evaluation\) could provide support for approximately 200,000 people with dementia each year in England \(over one million people since 2014\) \(5.2\). 

 The Healthbridge research evaluation provides evidence of the value of peer support and social networks and has contributed to shifting policy ideas towards expanding models of social support. In November 2013, the National Clinical Director for Dementia and Older People Mental Health, NHS England and NHS Improvement wrote a blog for the NHS identifying the need to increase diagnosis and post\-diagnosis support. He promoted the Healthbridge research stating: “ *The evaluation provides positive evidence on the value of these services. It shows that dementia advisers and peer support networks have benefits to the wellbeing and quality of life of people with dementia and their carers*” \(5.3, p.2\). 

 The Healthbridge evaluation also directly influenced local commissioning and service decisions in regards to peer support networks and interventions. For example through: 

-  Informing the Kingston Upon Thames’ dementia strategy 2015\-2020 by underpinning the commitment to sustain local peer support and training networks \(5.4, p.9\), and increasing support in the community. 

-  Commissioning peer support and befriending services in Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster \(5.5, p.70\) and in East Sussex County Council \(5.6, p.91\). 

-  Effecting the prioritisation of the need for people with dementia to play an integral part in commissioning, training and providing support to other people with dementia in Camden \(5.7, p.5\). Camden Council put plans in place to address the need for face to face, word of mouth communication with people with dementia and their care partners, as well as regular e\-bulletins to be disseminated through groups or Dementia champions \(5.7, p.31\). 

 Advancing Policy and Practice in Wales and Scotland 

 Research findings on risk and place from the RRD project \(3.6, 3.7\) contributed to shifting policy and service debates at the sub\-national devolved level in two influential ways. First, through adoption in the Care Council for Wales’ “Dementia Learning and Development Framework for Wales” \(2016\), a framework which guides learning and development across all health and social care services to improve professional practice in Wales \(5.8\). The framework drew directly on the research into “silent harms” \(3.7\), and adopted Clarke and Wilkinson’s terminology to state that it is “ *unacceptable*” for services who support people with dementia to be risk\-averse and preoccupied with physical safety, rather than the achievement of meaningful quality of life \(p.33\). It also states that care professionals must understand the concept of “silent harms” and the implications for practice \(p.32\). 

 Second, RRD research \(3.6, 3.7\) influenced the views of the Care Inspectorate in Scotland regarding risk and subsequently how it trains inspectors. According to the Dementia Lead, Care Inspectorate: 

 *“The predominant mind set among service providers has been risk averse with a worry about getting into trouble. The Care Inspectorate have tried to open up the discussion about sharing risk \- so that risk taking doesn’t just fall on individual services but is shared with families and the wider health and social care team. Thinking about ‘silent harms’ has been a very important aspect of this and shifting thinking away from focussing on stopping physical risk to other harms that might be caused e.g. due to a lack of activity, or the risks for people who are very withdrawn which are not necessarily obvious \- this is new thinking for service providers and the Care Inspectorate. Thinking about risk, influenced by Charlotte’s work, is also now part of the Short Observational Framework for Inspection \(SOFI\) training for inspectors” \(5.9\).* 

 Shaping public and practitioner perception through performing arts 

 Shaping public perception is critical to creating an environment in which people with dementia can live more inclusive lives. Clarke and Wilkinson partnered with Skimstone Arts to create films and plays based on the RDD and IDDD research findings \(3.5, 3.6\). Based on RDD, the play J *ack and Jill & The Red Postbox* \(and linked film titled *Jack & Jill*\) addressed risk in everyday life and the importance of place and familiarity for people living with dementia. Based on IDDD, the film *Michael’s Map* \(and linked play titled *The Ties That Bind*\) addressed the importance of social relationships and risk theory for the care by, for and about people experiencing dementia. 

 The play **Jack and Jill & the Red Post Box** was performed 34 times \(including in the August 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Festival\) to 896 audience members: *“This was a moving and educational experience, encouraging empathy and an understanding of the experience of dementia that just wouldn’t be possible with more traditional\-style lectures or publications.  It is easy to see how this performance can work in a variety of settings, from theatres and art spaces to care homes and hospitals”* \(CEO from Partnership for Palliative Care\) \(5.10, p.3\). “ *A sensitive performance about a sensitive subject. The cast managed to bring a sense of realism about what it's like to live with someone who has dementia… I manage a nursing home and feel all my staff would benefit from watching it”* \(Edinburgh Festival website comments\) \(5.10, p.3\). The play was the focus of an ESRC Festival of Social Science event in Nov 2013 and was subsequently selected as a case study in the 2015 independent review of the impact of the Festival for the ESRC \(5.11, pp.28\-30\). The associated/subsequent film **Jack & Jill \(2015\)** has been viewed 994 times on Vimeo \(5.10, p.6\). 

 Through the collaboration with Skimstone Arts, Clarke and Wilkinson shared key messages from the IDDD project \(3.5, 3.6\) about the subtle ways in which the early stages of dementia begin to insidiously affect close relationships, contributing to gradual social exclusion, but also how a meaningful and hopeful life with dementia can be re\-narrated within co\-operative caring relationships. The film **Michael’s Map** \(launched October 2016\) was viewed 756 times on Vimeo in addition to five screenings to a total of 279 audience members \(5.10, pp.8 \- 9\). This included a dementia conference in Sweden \(approximately 100 delegates\), two screenings to 90 student nurses and 20 members of staff respectively at Peking University, and a screening at the Scottish Dementia Congress \(approximately 40 delegates\). The play **The Ties that Bind** was performed 15 times to audiences in Keswick, Thirsk, Northallerton, Hexham and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2017 \(5.10, p.13\). 

 As a result of connecting with the public through films and live performances, the research has generated awareness and increased capacity building and skills to understand and respond to dementia in local communities \(5.10\). Through this collaboration, Skimstone Arts has also been able to develop as a small business. They were awarded a grant of GBP33,350 by the Arts Council of England for further business development, mentoring, and to develop a national tour of **Jack and Jill & the Red Postbox** \(5.12, p.3\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Findings from the AHRC\-funded project ‘Re\-presenting para\-sport bodies: Disability and the cultural legacy of the Paralympics’ have been utilised by Channel 4, Paralympics GB, and UK Sport to shape future broadcasting, policy, practice and promotion of para\-sport.  Specifically, drawing on the project’s extensive evidence base, these organisations have given greater emphasis to more representative and broader coverage of disabled people, types of disability, athlete voices and types of para\-sport in their strategic planning, marketing and promotions, and media coverage for Tokyo 2020 and beyond. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the rapid commercialisation of the Paralympics and the entry of Channel 4 as rights holder in the UK, the Paralympic Games \- elevated as a sporting mega event \- has become an increasingly important site of disability representation. Silk, Jackson and Pullen undertook the largest ever academic project to examine the implications of the rapid commercialisation of the Paralympic Games and the increasing visibility of \(selected types of\) disability in the media \[R1, R6\]. The project aimed to capture the intentions and practices of Channel 4’s broadcasting of the Rio 2016 Paralympics; the influence of this on the content of Paralympic coverage and mediated forms of disability representation; and the wider impact on public attitudes toward disability. Key research questions included: 

-  How is Paralympic sport produced and what are the dominant representations and meanings ascribed to Para\-athletes through televisual representations? 

-  How do audiences \(those that identify as non\-disabled and disabled\) interpret such meanings? 

-  And how do interpretations influence understandings of disability and disabled people in everyday life? 

 Based on an integrative methodological approach \(including audience focus groups, production interviews, textual analysis and data interpreted by artists in the form of an exhibition\), the evidence highlighted that despite claims that Channel 4’s Paralympic coverage has made disabled bodies more visible, there remain tensions and contradictions within the coverage, as well as discomfort amongst disabled viewers who were found to be much less likely to be engaged with Paralympic coverage than non\-disabled audiences \[R4\]. Specifically: 

-  The study of the practices of senior production staff at Channel 4 revealed that Channel 4’s promotional campaigns and para\-athlete backstories not only marked and rendered disability \(hyper\)visible, but they were narrated with the intention of popularising and making disability ‘sexy’. Questions thus remain over which types of disability are subject to media acclaim. For example, the back\-stories of athletes with cerebral palsy and severe impairments are deemed unsexy, less marketable and less media\-friendly \[R1, R3\]. 

-  The focus of the coverage was on the Paralympic events / athletes deemed to be most ‘accessible’ to audiences. Events where disabled bodies most approximate ableist sporting norms through mobility enhancing technology were ‘hyper\-visible’ in coverage \[R2\]. For example, 50% of coverage was given to swimming and track & field events, while 60% of coverage was given to wheelchair classified athletes; by contrast, some disability classifications gained almost no coverage \[R2\]. 

-  Our survey data helps understand who the Paralympic audience is \[R5\]. Findings suggest they are more likely to be younger, female and non\-disabled, and therefore different to typical sporting audiences. 

-  Our survey and focus group data found that disabled audiences are often critical of Paralympic broadcasting, stating that coverage often puts particular disabilities “on a pedestal” and makes a distinction between disabilities deemed superhuman and those deemed ordinary \[R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research findings outlined above have influenced the ways in which Paralympic sport is presented, in particular encouraging more representative coverage of disabled people in the build\-up to and during the Tokyo 2020 Games, which are now due to take place in 2021. 

 The findings of this project were disseminated through a\) a project report for non\-academic stakeholders \[R5\], b\) meetings with Channel 4, Para GB and UK Sport to discuss emergent findings, and c\) an exhibition featuring artistic interpretations of the research data held in London in July 2019 \[E1, E2\]. The exhibition was attended by representatives from Paralympics GB, UK Sport, Sport England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as executives from Channel 4. 

####  Shaping broadcast coverage within the UK 

 Channel 4, who will broadcast the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games in 2021, have made it clear that BU research will “underpin… future coverage of the Paralympics” \[E3\] and that the coverage will “embrace a wider spectrum of disabilities within para\-sport coverage”, implementing our recommendations \[R1, R2\]. 

 A film from the opening night of the exhibition \[E2\] was used by Channel 4 “as a provocation at the first meeting of the creative team”, resulting in, “a key change of emphasis in the marketing for Tokyo 2020 \- as a result of the research \- \[which\] was a shift in how we will focus on elements of the athletes lives as sports people and humans” \[E3\]. This move away from their portrayal of Paralympians as ‘superhuman’, draws directly on BU’s research which showed that this labelling was particularly problematic amongst disabled audiences \[R4\]. Based on the team’s recommendations \[R5\], Channel 4 have “engaged in dialogue with disability advocates, policy makers and disability rights groups with regard to how disabled people would like to be represented”, in order to shape coverage of Tokyo 2020 \[E3\]. 

####  Shaping Para\-sport policy, practice and marketing 

 Paralympics GB, the governing body for the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team at the Paralympics, states that the “insights provided from the data … have framed the decisions we have made for Tokyo in 2021 and beyond” \[E4\]. In particular, the research has: 

-  “informed the development of our new corporate strategy to focus more on athlete voice, which we identified as enabling the organisation to enhance its authenticity and credibility and allow Paralympics GB athletes to talk about wider social issues” \[E4\]. 

-  “supported our desire to incorporate a wider range of disabilities \(beyond those that are most visible\) in this marketing campaign and utilise athlete voice to drive social change” \[E4\]. 

-  Encouraged Paralympics GB to showcase “a wider range of sports, impairments and diversity – particularly with regards to BAME athletes” during Tokyo 2020 coverage \[E4\]. 

-  Directly informed Paralympics GB’s marketing strategy for the 2021 Paralympics, \[E4\], drawing on project data which highlights the young and female audience for the Games \[R5\]. 

-  Encouraged Paralympics GB to focus their Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) for Tokyo 2020 around “increased public awareness of Paralympics GB athletes” and an improvement in “positive attitudes to disabled people” \[E4\]. 

####  Providing an evidence **base** for sport policy in the UK 

 In February 2019 BU collaborated with UK Sport to develop the UK Sport Public Attitudes Survey, focusing on public attitudes towards para\-sport, the Paralympics, and media coverage of such events. The research team’s analysis of the initial results has helped shape UK Sport’s approach to parasport events, enabling them to “explore territory that we had never specifically entered into before and enhanced our knowledge accordingly” \[E5\]. 

 Silk, Jackson and Pullen later presented their broader research findings to a UK Sport all\-staff session in February 2020, which: 

-  “informed the way \[UK Sport\] communicate regarding issues of para\-sport … In particular, it is supporting our attempts to encourage the media to cover a broader spectrum of disabilities and parasport events” \[E5\]. This draws on our research highlighting a need for a broader representation of disabilities / events, as some disabled audiences feel current coverage does not represent them effectively \[R1, R2, R4\]. 

-  “help\[ed\] to shape our communications strategy for the Tokyo Paralympic Games, … particularly in the audience demographics that we will seek to engage” \[E5\]. Specifically, UK Sport will now target a younger, female audience, drawing on BU’s finding that para\-sport is more popular amongst these groups \[R5\]. 

-  Supported UK Sport to “make a stronger case for increased funding from government” for para\-sports \[E5\], drawing on the team’s evidence for both the popularity and progressive impact of watching para\-sport \[R5\]. 

-  Made “an invaluable contribution to a proposed new induction programme for those coming into Paralympic sport and to the enhanced support being developed for disabled athletes transitioning out of sport” \[E5\]. 

-  Influenced diversity and inclusion \(D&I\) policy, particularly from our finding that there was a lack of racial and ethnic diversity across featured para\-athletes during the Rio 2016 coverage \[R5\]. “The research has landed at a particularly opportune moment in UK Sport’s development in that, building on the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement, we have recently restated our commitment to the whole area of diversity and inclusion – i.e. to tackling racism in British sport; to implementing a far more ambitious internal D&I plan; and to driving forward D&I within our new strategy” \[E5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research team from Buckinghamshire New University \(BNU\) originally validated novel non\-invasive technologies for cardiac output and cardiac power output measurements and then applied it to a group of patients with end\-stage heart failure. The continuing benefits since 2014 have shown how the original information was adopted for clinical applications both in the UK and abroad. Cardiac power output continues to be an important measure for people using left ventricular assist devices. The benefits of cardiac function testing are now being recognised in primary care. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research into cardiac power output \(CPO\) was co\-ordinated by Professor Brodie of BNU during the period 2004 to 2012. The team included Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, \(Heart Science Centre, Harefield Hospital\), Professor Emma Birks, \(currently Director, Heart Failure, Transplant and Mechanical Support Programme, University of Kentucky\), Dr Richard Grocott\-Mason \(Consultant Cardiologist, Hillingdon Hospital\), Dr Djordje Jakovljevic \(currently Professor and Research Lead, Cardiovascular and Exercise Sciences, Coventry University\) and a small group of PhD students. 

 The initial focus of the research was to explore the reliability and validity of CPO as an integral measure of both flow\- and pressure\-generating capacities of the heart. This involved a comparison of different rebreathing methods and resulted in the conclusion that inert gas rebreathing measured cardiac output more precisely than the alternative carbon dioxide rebreathing methods \(1\). As the target patient group was those with chronic heart failure, it was essential to explore the reproducibility of CPO in such groups and this was established with a low coefficient of variation \(2\). The outcome was a clear demonstration that CPO was an excellent prognostic marker and was subsequently strongly advised in the assessment of patients with chronic heart failure undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The process of cardiac rehabilitation can include both aerobic and resistance training and it was important to determine which was the most effective in improving cardiac function using CPO as the main determinant. Our work \(3\) demonstrated that aerobic exercise training increased the maximal flow\-generating capacity of the heart and delayed anaerobic metabolism in patients with stable chronic heart failure. 

 Much of our work was in association with the Magdi Yacoub Institute involving patients on the ‘Bridge to Recovery’ programme at Harefield Hospital. These patients were initially in end\-stage heart failure, awaiting heart transplantation, but as a result of the programme, involving the use of a left ventricular assist device \(LVAD\) many recovered sufficiently to avoid transplantation. Our findings demonstrated that CPO differentiates well during cardiac restoration using LVADs and can be used as marker of cardiac recovery \(4\). Another important contribution to the programme was our investigation into the impact of acute reduction of continuous\-flow LVAD support on cardiac and exercise performance. We showed for the first time that the LVAD can confer both resting and peak cardiac functional benefits to patients with end\-stage heart failure \(5\). We also showed that exercise\-derived prognostic indicators demonstrated a limited capacity in reflecting cardiac pumping capability in patients treated with LVADs \(6\). Thus the interpretation of cardiac organ function would benefit substantially by the inclusion of CPO.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ideal non\-invasive measure of the heart’s pumping performance is cardiac power output \(CPO\). This continued case study demonstrates how other institutions, have adopted the validation of the use of CPO, nationally and internationally. Since 2014, there has been a recognition that it is necessary to measure both flow and pressure\-generating capacities of the heart to determine overall cardiac function meaningfully. One measure of the impact of a new procedure is the extent that it has been adopted outwith the original location of the research. 

 Cardiac power output has been adopted and its use sustained in a number of places since 2014. A good example of this is the adoption of CPO at the Translational and Clinical Research Institute at Newcastle University. A specialist laboratory has been established within this Institute and this laboratory now includes the measurement of CPO routinely. Professor Guy MacGowan’s work concentrates on heart failure and now uses CPO as part of his non\-invasive testing. His testimony states: 

  

 “*Cardiac power output \(CPO\), as a novel integrative measure of overall function and pumping capability of the heart, has been used at Freeman Hospital to assess eligibility of patients with advanced heart failure for heart transplantation and/or treatment with mechanical circulatory support. We also use CPO to follow\-up patients after the surgery, determine their prognosis and recovery*."" \(Professor MacGowan, Consultant Cardiologist, Newcastle Freeman Hospital, UK\) \[5.1\] 

 Non\-invasive cardiac output and CPO assessment is used to help clinicians identify the causes of exercise intolerance. The beneficiaries of the use of CPO include a number of clinical groups including those with cardiovascular \(n=421\), metabolic \(type 2 diabetes, liver disease, n=382\) and neurological disorders \(n=161\). Following our work, CPO is also now used by Dr Sandeep Hothi who states: 

 “*I recommend the use and wide adoption of cardiac power output measurement in clinical practice to evaluate patients with heart failure, improve risk stratification, assess the degree of cardiac dysfunction and guide decision making for pharmacological and non\-pharmacological interventions*."" \(Dr Hothi, Consultant Cardiologist, New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton\) \[5.2\]. 

 The numbers of patients involved in this work at New Cross Hospital is approximately 120 per annum. 

 The impact of our original work on CPO has seen the adoption of the procedure abroad. Its application follows the work we established at Harefield Hospital. It is part of the portfolio of procedures now available to patients following surgery at both the Aswan Heart Centre in Egypt and the Sidra Medical and Research Centre in Doha, Qatar. The Head of the Department of Cardiology in Aswan has stated: 

 ""*In the Aswan Heart Centre we use non\-invasive measures of cardiac output and cardiac power output in children and adults to help us define severity of cardiac dysfunction and inform decisions about the best treatment options for our heart failure patients*."" \(Dr ElGuindy, Head of Cardiology, Aswan Heart Centre, Egypt\) \[5.3\]. The numbers of patients involved in Aswan is approximately 160 per annum. 

 In the 2014 case study, we showed the importance of cardio\-respiratory fitness in people with chronic heart failure. A common precursor of heart failure is metabolic syndrome, yet little is known about the nature of its association with cardio\-respiratory fitness \(CRF\) across the age strata in the UK. The continuing impact of this work is predominantly in preventative health. 

 Public health messages are now advocating the need for an improvement in CRF alongside weight management for enhancing cardiometabolic health. This policy change is currently being driven by the private health sector such as Nuffield Health The NHS is progressively adopting a policy of including CRF assessments in UK health screening. It is now policy for all cardiac rehabilitation units, a decision made when Prof Brodie was Scientific Advisor to the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation. 

 Cardiac power output was one of the markers we used monitor the progress of patients with end\-stage heart failure. Alongside CPO, we used heart rate variability \(HRV\) to observe the patterns of cardiac autonomic nervous system \(ANS\) activity. The desired clinical endpoint for patients with a left ventricular assist device \(LVAD\) is to have it successfully explanted. Our 2014 study showed that implanted LVAD patients showed a partial normalisation of the HRV profile, with little difference between these patients and controls. The continuing impact of this work is that we now know that end\-stage heart failure patients, who are characterised by severe autonomic derangement, can show a high level of cardiac ANS normality following implantation of the LVAD. A more important impact is that this cardiac ANS normalisation appears to be maintained following explantation. The overall impact is that for the first time, we can be confident that such patients can return, with suitable pharmacological support, to live without their previous chronic end\-stage heart failure. 

 Since 2014, we are now able to show that in patients with advanced heart failure, awaiting transplantation, there was a significantly better cardiac performance and functional capacity among those in whom LVADs were explanted. A substantial proportion of these patients attained peak cardiac power output and peak oxygen consumption in the range of healthy individuals. A further impact is that we now know that prospective clinical trials are needed to define optimal pharmacological and physiological strategies to enhance myocardial recovery and allow for the use of LVADs as a bridge to recovery of cardiac function. One of our co\-workers at Harefield was Professor Emma Birks, who now works at the Gill Heart and Vascular Institute in Lexington, USA commented 

 ""*In our extensive heart transplant and mechanical circulatory support programme we use measurements of cardiac output and cardiac power output in evaluation and risk stratification of patients with advanced heart failure undergoing heart transplantation and ventricular assist device therapy*."" \(Professor Birks, Consultant Cardiologist and Director, Department of Cardiology, Gill Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA\) \[5.4\]. 

  

 The numbers of individuals worldwide, who have undertaken the LVAD procedure, is comparatively small. Yet individual case studies have shown that they exhibit improved cardiac function, the disease progression is slowed, further hospitalisation is decreased and the quality of their lives enriched. Our work on CPO has been a determining factor in measuring LVAD readiness and outcome. At the time of our original work in 2008, only one other centre \(Leeds Medical School\) used CPO. Since that time, and as a result of our publication profile, its adoption in the UK and worldwide has escalated.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Type\-2 Diabetes \(T2DM\) is one of the most prevalent long\-term conditions globally; it is non\-communicable, highly preventable and treatable. However, options for identifying, preventing and managing the condition are costly, have low uptake and underserve groups in greatest need. The Leicester Diabetes Research Centre \(LDRC\) runs the largest portfolio of translational research for the detection, prevention and management of T2DM nationally, redefining treatment paths and patient outcomes through the creation of the Leicester Diabetes Risk Score \(LDRS\) for early detection, the *Let’s Prevent* programme for preventing progression from prediabetes, and the DESMOND \(Diabetes Education and Self\-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed\) Structured Self\-Management Programme for those with T2DM. These tools have transformed standard practice worldwide providing substantial health and economic benefits and enabling tailored, effective treatment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Population\-based screening in Leicester and Leicestershire found that 20% of adults had either prediabetes or undiagnosed T2DM, which was significantly higher in ethnic minority groups **\[R1\]**. Prediabetes and early T2DM are asymptomatic and therefore difficult to detect; however, by identifying prediabetes, T2DM may be delayed or prevented through lifestyle changes. Structured Self\-Management Education programmes \(SSME\) provide both prediabetes and T2DM patients with the knowledge and tools necessary to make effective, long\-term changes to manage their condition. 

 **Identifying Prediabetes and T2DM** 

 The LDRC has developed a non\-invasive screening tool, the LDRS, to reduce barriers to screening in comparison to existing NHS measures, where just 40% of patients attended screening appointments **\[G1\]**. Completers are scored on seven risk factors \(age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, waist circumference, family diabetes history and blood pressure\). The total score provides an accurate indication of prediabetes/T2DM risk, with high scorers advised to visit their GP for confirmatory tests. LDRS is the first and only tool developed and validated for use in a multi\-ethnic UK population **\[R1\]**. 

 When tested using national data, LDRS performed excellently; correctly identifying 82% of prediabetes/undiagnosed T2DM cases **\[R1\].** As the presence of healthcare professionals is not required, LDRS provides \~GBP70 cost\-per\-case saving compared to existing screening methods **\[R2\].** High\-risk groups, such as people from South Asian ethnicities, have previously been difficult to reach. Not only was LDRS shown to reliably identify cases within such communities **\[R1\]**, it has since been translated into five South Asian languages and rolled out in community venues nationwide to increase engagement and provide equitable healthcare access **\[R3\]**. 

 **Preventing Progression from Prediabetes to T2DM** 

 In 2009, LDRC researchers began development of a lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing progression from prediabetes to T2DM by promoting increased physical activity, healthy diet and weight loss. The *Let’s Prevent* **\[G2\]** intervention consisted of a core six\-hour group\-based behavioural educational intervention for individuals with prediabetes, led by trained educators, with follow\-on maintenance support sessions offered annually. The programme followed a written, theory\-driven curriculum, which, alongside improving diet, increasing physical activity, was a core aim, supported by the provision of pedometers and personalised step\-per\-day goals. 44 GP practices and 880 participants took part in the large cluster RCT to evaluate *Let’s Prevent* \[R5\]. Results demonstrated that the programme effectively increased physical activity, improved glucose and cholesterol levels and psychosocial wellbeing after 3 years **\[R5\]**. Importantly, *Let’s Prevent* proved to be both highly effective at reducing diabetes risk in session attendees \(88% reduced risk in those attending all sessions\) and was cost\-effective: incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio of GBP3643/QALY and 86% probability of being cost\-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of GBP20,000/QALY **\[R6\]**. 

 *Let’s Prevent* was one of four original programmes approved and offered by the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme \(NHSDPP\), branded *Healthier You* and, following LDRC cultural adaptation, can be delivered in South Asian languages. 

 **Managing T2DM** 

 Since 2005, LDRC has successfully developed, evaluated and implemented evidence based SSME programmes including the flagship group based SSME, DESMOND. DESMOND was tested in the largest ever trial of its kind evaluating the effectiveness of SSME for T2DM management. The cluster RCT recruited 207 GP practices and 824 participants. Over a 12\-month period, DESMOND promoted health improvement behaviours, reducing depression and risk of cardiovascular disease. DESMOND was the first intervention to meet all NHS Quality Criteria that could be generalised and replicated nationwide, reliably and cost\-effectively **\[R4\]**. 

 LDRC SSME research has progressed rapidly, now extending programme availability to low\-middle income countries as part of the MRC Global Health Challenge Directive. In collaboration with colleagues in Mozambique and Malawi, LDRC researchers have developed a full implementation pathway and toolkit to enable DESMOND to become embedded long\-term **\[G3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 LDRC run the largest portfolio of translational research for T2DM identification, prevention and management nationally, ensuring that prediabetes and T2DM can be identified early, progression halted and patients \(including hard\-to\-reach, high\-risk communities\) have the tools to effectively manage their condition. 

 **Changing Clinical Practice** 

 Independent evaluation of LDRS demonstrated its superiority, cost\-effectiveness and savings in difficult to reach communities. Further independent modelling showed that its increased use could result in an additional \~17,500 prediabetes and 4,500 T2DM diagnoses annually, providing NHS savings of >GBP850,000,000 over a 20\-year period **\[E5\]**. LDRS is now recommended for prediabetes and T2DM detection by NICE and NHSDPP **\[E2, E3\]**. 

 Since 2015, LDRS has been incorporated into VISION GP electronic record systems covering 636 practices and >4,300,000 patients **\[E4\]** and the PRIMIS GRASP\-DM quality improvement tool which enables GP identification and monitoring of high\-risk patients. 

 Internationally, LDRS is recommended for T2DM detection by the Norwegian Diabetes Association and has been both directly adapted and used as a basis for population specific risk scores worldwide including in Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Peru and Portugal **\[E6\]**. 

 In 2003, UK T2DM patients had no SSME access due to the lack of a NICE recommendation.  LDRC research ensured that by 2016 >77% could access programmes at a real\-world cost of just GBP89p/p, leading to updated NICE guidelines to include SSME in 2017 **\[E2\].** The 2016 Berlin Declaration \(global call for T2DM prevention and management\) highlighted the importance of SSME, citing DESMOND as a best\-practice example **\[E7\]** and was endorsed by Primary Care Diabetes Europe, International Diabetes Federation and World Heart Foundation **\[E7\]**. The 2018 International Consensus Recommendations by the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommended SSME, citing demonstrable 26% all\-cause mortality reduction, HbA1c reduction and additional biomedical/psychosocial benefits **\[E8\]**. 

 DESMOND is now embedded as routine clinical practice in >66% of UK CCGs, providing substantial treatment quality and health outcome improvements to >300,000 patients. The programme is delivered by >1,185 UK and 293 international LDRC trained Health Care Professionals/lay educators enabling access nationwide and to \~4,250 patient beneficiaries in New Zealand, Gibraltar and Australia. DESMOND has been adopted as the national programme under the Australian National Diabetes Service Scheme **\[E9\]**. 

 **Improving Patient Health Outcomes** 

 Since 2011, >2,800,000 people completed LDRS via Diabetes UK channels \(online, ‘Know Your Risk’ roadshows and through industrial partnerships\) **\[E10\]**. Of the \~1.4million completions since September 2014, \~25% would have received a high score and visited their GP resulting in \~77,194 T2DM and 192,299 prediabetes diagnoses. In addition to local LDRC deployment, Diabetes UK used LDRS in national pharmacy collaborations with Tesco, Boots, Lloyds, Northern Ireland Health Alliance and the Network of Welsh Pharmacies **\[E11\]**. 

 In July 2020, the UK Government unveiled the Tackling Obesity national strategy which greatly expanded LDRS utility by enabling completers receiving moderate or high LDRS risk scores to self\-refer to *NHS Healthier You* and, by extension, *Let’s Prevent* for the first time **\[E16\]**. Following the establishment of *Healthier You*, LDRC collaborated with leading service design and delivery company Ingeus UK to tailor *Let’s Prevent* to meet the programme’s service specification. The application was successful and *Let’s Prevent* became the only joint NHS\-Industry provider among the original four approved suppliers. Initially offered in 27 areas \(\~26,000,000 people\), *Let’s Prevent* is now one of the most widely delivered programmes nationally, at its height holding >42% market share. Since 2016, 140,000 patients have been referred to *Let’s Prevent* achieving substantial health benefits including clinically meaningful weight loss \(averaging 4kgs each\), significant diabetes risk reduction and improved glycaemic control **\[E14\]**. Published case studies showcase the positive impact on individuals, with attendees successfully implementing fundamental lifestyle changes as a result of the programme **\[E4\]**. NHS England predict 390,000 *Healthier You* attendees by 2021, thereby delaying or preventing 4,500 T2DM cases. Long term, *Healthier You* will provide the NHS net economic benefits of GBP1,200,000,000 through diabetes prevention and reduced healthcare resource demand with *Let’s Prevent* integral in achieving these successes **\[E15\]**. 

 In 2016, LDRC developed MyDESMOND; a unique digital SSME created through collaboration with patients, medical professionals and web designers to address changing expectations from commissioners and patients concerning choice and access. MyDESMOND is now approved by the NHS app store and incorporated in all UK sites to support long\-term maintenance of self\-care behaviour as an alternative to group\-based delivery. Over 12,500 patients have utilised MyDESMOND, engaging for an average of 55 days. 80% of users continue use after completion, in many cases for over two years **\[E12\]**. During the COVID\-19 pandemic, LDRC took the unprecedented decision to make MyDESMOND free to all **\[E17\]** resulting in over 10,000 new users since March 2020 **\[E12\]**. 

 **Engaging Hard to Reach Communities** 

 Though ethnic minority groups have higher T2DM risk, their screening uptake is significantly lower. LDRC translation of LDRS into 5 South Asian languages has broadened access and resultant health benefits to >700,000 people nationwide. These translated versions have been used >1,200 times in local schools, faith/community centres and workplaces with >40% completers referred to their GP. The translations also form the basis for Diabetes UK’s training of local ‘Community Champions’ to perform LDRS in previously hard to reach communities **\[E13\]**. 

 Since 2015, LDRC have released tailored versions of DESMOND to meet the specific needs of fasting Muslim patients. By 2019, they had trained 50 Health Care Professionals, 20 community leaders and 6 lay educators to promote and deliver this ‘Safer Ramadan’ intervention, thereby enabling T2DM to observe the holy month safely **\[E12\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Davis’ research has resulted in comprehensive pension reforms in 5 Caribbean countries \(Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname\) and thus increased retirement income security for vulnerable people in old age. The research has improved pension fund regulators’ ability to calculate risks and take appropriate action when detecting difficulties in individual funds or the entire sector. Accordingly, these reforms have increased the scope for prospective retirees to be financially independent and cared for in old age, not least given favourable related developments such as rises in pension fund assets in Jamaica \(which has seen a 6% increase of pension fund assets\) and in the registration of funds with the supervisory authorities in Barbados \(which now has 96% fully registered pension plans\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Davis is an expert on pension funds and the economic impact of population ageing. He has published extensively on pension regulation, pension fund finance, and retirement income provision in the last 20 years \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 7\) and presented on the topic in the UK and the Caribbean \(Ref. 1; Ref. 4; Ref. 5\). 

 Pension funds are key financial institutions in many countries, which contribute to the economy and enable individuals to save sufficiently for retirement. However, pension provision is in crisis globally, which jeopardises financial sustainability, care and dignity in old age \(Ref. 7\). Failure of pension funds can lead to major losses for both current and prospective retirees and widespread poverty in old age. It can also disrupt the financial market, affect the reputation of the country concerned, and reduce the financial and economic development of that country. 

 Prof. Davis’ research found that the ongoing shift from defined benefits \(DB\) pension schemes \(which guarantee a retirement income\) to defined contribution \(DC\) pension schemes \(where the retirement income depends on market returns\), is a key aspect of the crisis \(Ref. 3\). Other contributors are turbulence in financial markets and variable accounting standards. Most of these are risks which are generally beyond the scope of regulation. 

 In 2015, the Association of British Insurers commissioned Prof. Davis to challenge a pension reform proposed by the UK Government \(Ref. 4\). Prof. Davis found that the proposal, which raised the possibility to move from the EET system \(where pension savings and returns are exempt from income tax, but pension income is taxed\) to a TEE system \(where pension savings would be from taxed income but with no taxation thereafter\), would actually be detrimental to the UK financial market. The suggested change would lead to a reduction in personal savings, adverse effects on the macroeconomy and a long\-term fiscal imbalance. 

 In 2017, the IMF commissioned Prof. Davis to conduct research on macroprudential indicators \(which show authorities system\-wide risk\) and the development of financial soundness indicators for 36 countries \(Ref. 6\). Prof. Davis’ research showed that it is possible to use Concentration and Distribution Measures \(CDMs\) \(which can capture financial risks within the banking sector\) to predict system\-wide vulnerabilities, with appropriate control variables. These can also be used in the pension sector: by generating health and stability indicators for individual pension funds, authorities can calculate CDMs and detect risks. 

 A key aspect of Prof. Davis’ research on pension funds has focused on pension regulation and international investment of pension funds in the Caribbean. From 2015 to 2017, the IMF’s Caribbean Technical Assistance Centre \(CARTAC\) commissioned Prof. Davis to research and advise on the calculation of financial health and stability indicators for pension policy in 5 Caribbean countries: Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname. 

 The Caribbean is not exempt from the global issues for pensions and faces regulatory challenges regarding pension management. Only a low percentage of the population participates in pension funds and especially some of the most vulnerable people \(those who are self\-employed, unemployed or emigrants\) often do not have a pension scheme. This, a lack of personnel satisfactorily trained in finance, and insufficient consumer and regulator knowledge, weakens the pension systems in the Caribbean. 

 Prof. Davis demonstrated that pension fund authorities in the Caribbean could undertake the creation of health and stability indicators for individual pension funds \(Ref. 5\), using in that context aspects of the work he had undertaken for the IMF \(Ref. 6\). In the presentations given in the Caribbean, he showed a set of indicators, which enable regulators to assess the vulnerability of pension funds to standard financial risks \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 4; Ref. 5; Ref. 7\). He highlighted that these indicators provide a benchmark to supervisors for intervention in case pension funds—or the entire pension sector—are facing difficulties. They can consequently enable supervisors to reflect on the overall health of the sector and intervene appropriately. Prof. Davis further used his research on pension taxation in the UK to illustrate the political risks to which pension funds can be subject.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof. Davis’ research on pension fund management and regulation has led to crucial policy changes at CARTAC and the 5 Caribbean countries concerned which CARTAC advises, and thereby protected retirement income security for vulnerable people in old age. 

 On the basis of Prof. Davis’ research, CARTAC recommended reforms of pension fund regulation in the Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname to improve both operational issues \(such as improvement of data collection from pension funds\) and strategic level approaches \(such as the implementation and analysis of health and stability indicators that highlight pension fund risks\). The reform included a new statistical reporting template that increased the level of information among supervisors; the introduction of a suite of health and stability indicators \(which highlight the risks to which pension funds are subject\); and development of reporting and regulatory approaches. 

 CARTAC confirms that the Caribbean nations fully accepted the recommendations and adopted the framework for improved pension regulation, as proposed by Prof. Davis. \[REDACTED\] 

 \[REDACTED\] This has a fundamental human welfare factor given the fact that pension assets in these countries account for a significant proportion of the GDP and cover a sizeable proportion of the workforce. For example, the Jamaican pension fund has 115,000 members \(10% of the employed labour force\) with assets equivalent to 26% of GDP. In Barbados, there are 30,000 members of registered plans \(20% of the workforce\) and assets equivalent to around 42% of GDP. 

 The Financial Services Commission Barbados \[REDACTED\] the Commission was able to increase the number of pension plans registered under the country’s Occupational Pension Benefits Act \(OPBA\) and went from 145 pension plans in 2014 to 268 in 2017 \(Source 3\). This means there are now 96% fully registered active pension plans in Barbados whose risks can thus be supervised appropriately. 

 The Central Bank of the Bahamas \[REDACTED\] Annual Report & Statement of Accounts 2016 confirms that the Pension Division revamped their statistics survey and improved staff training regarding the development and maintenance of key financial health and stability indicators for the pension sector \(\[REDACTED\], Source 5\). The Bank can now flag up risks within the pension sector more strategically and has greatly improved their surveillance over the pension fund sector in the Bahamas. 

 The Bank of Guyana also changed their pension fund\-reporting template, which gave way to more effective monitoring of financial trends. \[REDACTED\] In 2018, a year after the CARTAC mission, the private pension sector in Guyana “continued to experience consistent growth…with a relatively low…impact to systemic risk” \(Source 7\). \[REDACTED\] 

 The Bank of Jamaica Financial Stability Report 2017 indicates the sectoral development in Pensions since the CARTAC mission: while in 2012, pension fund assets made up 22.4% of the GDP, in 2017 that number stood at 28.2% \(Source 8\). 

 The Central Bank of Suriname also adopted the new pension reporting forms and indicators and deployed “the expanded list of indicators in their supervisory and risk management frameworks” \(Source 9\). Prof. Davis led these changes in regulation and supervisors were able to gain additional knowledge in several key areas of pension, such as challenges facing the pension sector in the region and risks in pension funds \(\[REDACTED\], Source 9\). This has enabled them to take regulatory action when detecting potential difficulties in individual funds or the sector as a whole. 

 Prof. Davis’ research serves as an outstanding example of how effective pension reforms can have a fundamental impact on regulators and thus benefit at\-risk people in several countries. His contribution has \[REDACTED\] benefited some of the most vulnerable people in the Caribbean. The changes in pension data management and supervision have improved retirement income security for both current and prospective pension plan members and thus safeguarded their wellbeing in old age.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our game\-changing research, led by Professor Peng, is significantly influencing the design of engines for vehicles, boats and ships internationally, optimising their performance and reducing CO2 emissions. Studies into diesel engine fuel injection optimisation have helped shape the design of new Ford and Jaguar cars, cutting CO2 emissions by 15% and other harmful emissions by 20%. 

 We have developed solar boats and also pioneered the use of carbon capture and storage \(CCS\) for boats powered by internal combustion engines. This has paved the way for thousands of boats to be retrofitted with new technology, with a potential reduction of 21000t of CO2 emissions every year **\[Refs 5.1,5.2\].** Our ground\-breaking research around optimising engine intake systems has also influenced new engine designs in both the UK and in China. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research described has been led by Professor Peng. The studies aimed to explore and develop new technologies that both enhance performance and reduce harmful emissions from vehicles and inland ships and boats. This is helping to develop boats of zero carbon emissions and will contribute to a non\-carbon water transport. 

 Research focused on three key areas \- low temperature combustion for internal combustion engines; internal combustion engines and carbon capture and storage; and fuel cell electric powertrain technology. 

  

1.  Low Temperature Combustion for Internal Combustion Engines 

 Working alongside industry partner AVL Powertrain UK, the largest privately owned company for the development of powertrain systems, Professor Peng and his colleagues carried out investigations and numerical simulations to deliver more precise air\-fuel mixing for diesel engine combustion, optimising the fuel delivery process and injection strategies **\[Refs 3.1, 3.2\]** and leading to a reduction of CO2 and other harmful emissions. 

 Direct contributions to performance optimisation and emission reduction are evident in investigation results on HCCI, combustion or low temperature combustion for which fuel delivery process and injection strategies have been optimised. 

 Several research projects have been conducted with the  [State Key Laboratory of Engines of China](http://202.113.8.82/english/list.jsp?classid=201804241917354542) and  [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) into optimising engine intake systems with VVT/VVA technology and applying biofuel to reduce emissions **\[Ref3.3\]**, and relevant outputs from this research have been applied to new engine designs in both China and the UK. 

1.  Internal combustion engines and carbon capture and storage 

 Professor Peng’s research with Dr Tahmina Ajmal into internal combustion \(IC\) engines has made significant progress towards applying CCS to water vessels that are powered by internal combustion engines with conventional liquid fossil or biofuel fuels **\[Ref3.4\]**. 

 By developing oxyfuel combustion \(burning fuel with pure oxygen\) combined with HCCI \(homogeneous charge compression ignition\) combustion in IC engines, CO<sub>2</sub> can be filtered out and stored, so that the powertrain can achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. Working with a consortium from five European countries \- France, Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK \- promising results have been achieved on inland boats, indicating that the technology has massive potential to reduce emissions if retrofitted to vessels. 

1.  Fuel cell electric powertrain technology 

 Professor Peng and Dr Vladimir Dyo conducted research on fuel cell electric powertrain technology for achieving zero emissions, including zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The research includes the optimisation of fuel cell internal flows of PEMFC \(proton exchange membrane fuel cell\) by optimising gas flow channel geometry and configurations and the development of a PEMFC dynamic model which is suitable for designing fuel cell powertrains for heavy duty vehicles **\[Ref3.5\]**. Both Research areas are aiming to improve the power density and energy efficiency of fuel cell stacks. 

1.  Solar boats without carbon emissions 

 Professor Peng has previously participated an InnovateUK granted research project, investigating a high efficiency solar PV system **\[Ref3.6\]**. Relevant outputs have underpinned the design and funding of a demonstrator boat in a recent collaboration with Mothership Marine Ltd for developing zero\-emission, solar\-powered inland boats.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our research reduces greenhouse gas emissions in roadgoing and marine transport sectors. Leading automotive companies are already reaping the benefits of improved designs to enhance vehicle performance whilst substantially reducing carbon emissions. Similarly, our work in China alongside Beihang University has far\-reaching implications, with recent results from industry showing our new engine designs save up to 20% in fuel. In the water transport sector, our developed solutions place us at the forefront of an initiative to reduce carbon emissions from narrowboats by 100,000 tonnes a year. Full details follow: 

 **4.1 Internal Combustion Engines: Impacts on Technology Development and Emissions Reduction** 

 Our numerical simulations and experimental investigations have delivered fuel injection optimisation strategies. As a close industry partner of the University of Bedfordshire, AVL Powertrain UK Ltd has applied these findings to its work on developing, calibrating and integrating combustion engine powertrains for its prestigious clients, including Ford Motor Company and Jaguar Land Rover. The research has also helped AVL expand its own business **\[Ref5.6\].** 

 An international collaboration with the State Key Laboratory of Engines of China and Beihang University has led to findings being applied to new engine designs in China and the UK.   For instance, a new design of RTO \(Regeneration Thermal Oxidizer\) combustor has been used by Yunhui Technology Ltd for their new system for processing VOC \(Volatile Organic Compound\) emissions. “Their test results show the new design can save fuel \(natural gas\)… \(by\)… more than 20%. This is really a great achievement from our collaboration,” Prof Yuzhen Lin, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Beihang University in a letter to Prof Peng **\[Ref5.3\].** 

 The results of our work enhancing in\-cylinder air flows and improving air\-fuel interaction in diesel and gasoline engines have been applied by the State Key Laboratory of Engines to diesel engines for the Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Company; and in gasoline engines for the Changan Automobile Company. Alternative fuels, including biofuel, have also been explored with the aim of directly improving the combustion processes and reducing fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions **\[Ref5.3\]**. 

 Our research on engine combustion \(including low\-temperature combustion\) has been carried out with financial support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\), the Royal Academy of Engineering and AVL Powertrain UK Ltd, and has involved substantial international and industrial collaborations.  Research outputs have also been adopted by AVL for commercial application. **\[Refs 5.3, 5.6\].** 

 **4.2 Impacts on Non\-carbon Internal Combustion \(IC\) Engine Combustion Technology Development with CCS** 

 The research on non\-emission water vessels powered by oxyfuel combustion IC engines and fuelled with conventional fossil or biofuel hydrocarbon fuels is financially supported by the European Interreg funding. Our research outputs are being applied by industry partners and were also disseminated at the SAE \(Society of Automotive Engineers\) \( [https://www.sae.org/](https://www.sae.org/)\) international annual congress in April 2020, where researchers and developers across the world joined to exhibit the latest technologies **\[Refs 5.1,5.2\]**. 

 By developing oxyfuel combustion \(burning fuel with pure oxygen\) combined with HCCI combustion in IC engines, CO<sub>2</sub> can be filtered out and stored, enabling the powertrain to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions, even though the engines are still fuelled with liquid hydrocarbon fuels \(fossil fuels or biofuels\). 

 A consortium from five Northwest European countries is working with the Canal and River Trust \( [https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/)\) to improve emissions from boats. The results from a single boat already demonstrated it is possible to reduce or eliminate the pollutants from the polluting vessel engines.  At the end of the project, results on the demonstration vessel showed that Nitrogen Oxide \(NO<sub>x\)</sub> emissions can be reduced by 194 kg per year and 24 tonnes/year on each narrowboat, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be avoided altogether. In the next 20 years, a European campaign through the network linked to this technology, involving inland water operators, national authorities and engine manufacturers, can potentially ensure that thousands of boats of various sizes are retrofitted with the technology, leading to a total reduction of up to 100,000 tons per year of CO2 emissions **\[Refs 5.1,5.2\]**. “We believe that the collaboration will not only benefit…...our business development, and the university’s research output, but also will make \(a\) remarkable impact on saving carbon emissions from water transport,” Chris Barnett, Enterprise Manager \(EU Projects\), Canal & River Trust, canalriverttrust.co.uk **\[Ref 5.4\]**.  As a result of this narrowboat experience, Professor Peng went on to work with Mothership Marine \(see \(4.4\) on a commercially available combustion\-free narrowboat. 

 **4.3 Impacts on Non\-carbon Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Powertrain Technology Development** 

 Future forecasts of CO2 emissions from the commercial sector are alarming **.** The sector’s share is predicted to increase from 27% in 2015 to around 40% in 2030. Professor Peng, Dr Dyo and Dr Gao’s research is significantly contributing to reducing CO2 emissions in the sector and is providing industry partner AVL Powertrain UK with opportunities to grow its business in the rapidly expanding electrified and fuel cell vehicle market, in particular in the electrified commercial vehicle sector. 

 We have been researching how to optimise fuel cell internal flows of PEMFC \(proton exchange membrane fuel cell\) by improving gas flow channel geometry and configurations and developing a PEMFC dynamic model that is suitable for designing the fuel cell powertrain of heavy\-duty vehicles. The research aims to improve the power density and energy efficiency of fuel cell stacks. With a collaborative project supported by Innovate UK, industry partner AVL is applying the results and designing improved fuel cell powertrains for heavy duty commercial vehicles. 

 AVL is also seeking to expand its business, engaging with commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers \(OEMs\), supporting them to develop fuel cell hybrid commercial vehicles from concept definition and fuel economy assessment to implementation. AVL expects to secure a project with an OEM within two to three years based on the outcome of our research, which will have a commercial value of several million pounds **\[Ref5.6\]**. 

 **4.4 Impacts on Non\-carbon Boats Powered by Solar Energy** 

 30,000 UK narrowboats are powered by diesel combustion motors, with resulting greenhouse gases. Prof Peng has partnered with  Mothership Marine \( [http://mothershipmarine.com/motor/](http://mothershipmarine.com/motor/)\), providing direct technical support for replacing these – designing, optimising and integrating a linked power ecosystem of E\-motor, gearbox and propeller and building this into a pilot boat.  Tim Knox of Mothership Marine reports “Initial results have led to increases in confidence with our customers. As a result, we have a full orderbook for the final product even before it has been demonstrated, and now need to take on more permanent staff to keep up with the demand” **\[Ref5.5\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Oxford researchers have developed world\-leading approaches for exploiting whole\-genome sequencing \(WGS\) combined with epidemiological data to monitor and control infection. They gained new understanding of the spread of the lethal pathogens *Clostridioides difficile*, *Candida auris*, *Mycobacterium chimera* and multidrug\-resistant *Neisseria gonorrhoeae.* University of Oxford methods are now applied nationally for rapid tracking of transmission, stopping outbreak spread through evidence\-based infection prevention measures. Internationally, the research has changed clinical practice, reducing infection rates to save lives and reduce healthcare burdens. Examples of stopping healthcare acquired infections include: reducing *C. difficile* infection, morbidity, and mortality through reduced antibiotic use; eradicating environmental persistence of the super\-fungus *C. auris;* and elimination of fatal *M. chimera* infection in cardiac bypass surgery. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Eyre, Walker, Peto, Crook and colleagues at the University of Oxford pioneered combining microbial WGS with clinical and epidemiological data, to track and trace life\-threatening infections, particularly in healthcare settings. These powerful strategies have uncovered the sources and routes of transmission in major outbreaks. 

 In 2012, the University of Oxford team was among the first to demonstrate the power of WGS to enable early outbreak detection and transmission tracing of healthcare\-associated infections \[1\]. They sequenced 26 methicillin\-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* \(MRSA\) and *Clostridioides difficile* \(formerly *Clostridium difficile*\) isolates and measured the genetic relatedness, enabling outbreak identification and finding a previously undetected source of transmission. This proof\-of\-principle study of rapid WGS showed the potential of this approach to transform identification of transmission of healthcare\-associated infections. The group subsequently developed and applied this approach to other settings and pathogens. 

####  C. difficile has diverse routes of transmission 

 Prior to the University of Oxford research, it was believed that most *C. difficile* infections are acquired from other cases within a hospital environment \(nosocomial transmission\), so transmission from symptomatic patients has been the focus of prevention guidelines. However, their study performing WGS on over 1,200 consecutive *C. difficile* isolates from cases in Oxfordshire linked to their ward movement data over 3.6 years demonstrated that only a minority of cases are acquired from other unwell cases in hospital \[2\]. Another study led by Eyre showed both local transmission of healthcare\-adapted lineages and European\-wide transmission via other routes. 

####  Antibiotic restriction reduces C. difficile incidence 

 *C. difficile* infections have fallen markedly in England, but remained high elsewhere in Europe and North America; understanding the reasons for the decline in England can inform control of infection worldwide. To identify the reasons, the University of Oxford researchers combined WGS and antimicrobial prescribing data, and found that the decrease in *C. difficile* in England can be explained exclusively by falls in strains resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, while the incidence of fluoroquinolone\-susceptible strains remained unchanged \[3\]. This suggested that restrictions in fluoroquinolone use were key in reducing rates of *C. difficile* infection \[3\]. 

####  Candida auris can be transmitted via re\-usable equipment 

 *Candida auris* is an emerging multi\-drug resistant yeast, first reported in 2009, that can cause life\-threatening infection in critical care settings. By combining environmental and patient sampling with WGS and routinely collected healthcare data, Eyre and colleagues were able to link one of the largest *C. auris* outbreaks to date worldwide \(70 patients colonized or infected with *C. auris* between February 2015 and August 2017, in Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\) to re\-useable patient equipment \(skin\-surface temperature probes\) for the first time \[4\]. This study also demonstrated the utility of software developed by Eyre and colleagues for analysing and interpreting pathogen WGS data. 

####  Outbreak of Mycobacterium chimera\-linked infection from heater\-cooler units 

 In 2015, an alert was issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \(ECDC\) that heater\-cooler units \(HCUs\) used during cardiac bypass surgery were a likely source of disseminated infection caused by *M. chimera*. As part of the UK national incident investigation led by Public Health England \(PHE\), the University of Oxford researchers led the design of a case\-control genome sequence analysis that pinpointed the infection source as HCUs in the UK and Europe \[5\]. Genomic data was processed by Crook, Peto and colleagues, and high\-resolution phylogenetic typing by the University of Oxford team defined cases, providing precision for quantifying the risk for and outcome of infection. Crook also contributed to collaborative molecular epidemiological investigation of this outbreak in Europe and the US. 

####  Tracking multi\-drug resistant gonorrhoea 

 The University of Oxford researchers developed methods and metrics \(including software\) to track the spread of *Neissiera gonorrhoeae* and to identify antimicrobial resistance directly from sequencing data \[6\]. They demonstrated that these WGS\-based tools can trace local, national, or international transmission, and be used to track antimicrobial resistance.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Pathogen sequencing\-based approaches widely adopted in public health 

 The University of Oxford research showed the utility and validity of generating, analysing and interpreting data from pathogen WGS to uncover the underlying drivers of outbreaks, enabling effective interventions \[e.g. 1, 2, 4, 6\]. Their methods now underpin routine pathogen WGS in healthcare organisations and public health agencies. Since their original demonstration of the power of WGS to address healthcare\-associated infections \[1\], pathogen WGS has expanded rapidly, with more than 20,000 *C. difficile* and 78,000 *S. aureus* genomes sequenced \(deposited in NCBI short\-read archive, Nov 2020\). 

 Crook was PHE Director of the National Infection Service 2015\-2019 and the University of Oxford team worked closely with PHE to address specific outbreaks \[e.g. 5, 6\], and to develop national strategies, bioinformatic tools and methods \[building on 4 and 6\] for routine analysis of pathogen sequence data to reduce outbreaks, particularly in healthcare settings \(for example, for *C.difficile*, \[A\]\). Embedding WGS in PHE labs and optimizing the use of WGS\-based information is now Strategic Priority 7 of the PHE Infectious Diseases Strategy 2020\-25 \(published Sep 2019, \[B\]\). 

 This research has also contributed to implementation of WGS for outbreak control by public health bodies internationally. For example, an Associate Director for Science at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) stated that the University of Oxford research informed CDC policy and procedures, guided the field in how to establish and implement WGS bioinformatics, and *“their greatest impact is in leading the application of advanced genomics for HAIs \[healthcare acquired infections\]”* \[Ci\]. Further, the Associate Director of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Virginia, US, stated: “ *research and researchers at University of Oxford…have been integral to our ability to assist the entire United States with \[nosocomial\] outbreak investigation”* \[Cii\]. An example from Virginia is that a WGS investigation based on University of Oxford methods informed redesign of hospital plumbing, dramatically reducing spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria, reducing new patient infections with carbapenem resistant isolates from 70 to 15 per year, since 2016 \[Cii\].  In Australia, research by Crook and colleagues “ *strongly influenced the implementation of genomics into routine diagnostic testing and public health laboratory surveillance in NSW \[New South Wales\],…reflected in the development and implementation of the NSW Health Genomics Strategy \(June 2017\) and the Australian National Microbial Genomics Framework 2019\-2022*”, according to a lead for public health microbiology in NSW \[D\]. 

####  Reducing healthcare associated C. difficile infections 

 *C. difficile* is the biggest cause of infectious diarrhoea in hospitalised patients and can lead to serious infections, with mortality of up to 25% in frail patients. It presents a worldwide problem, causing an estimated 500,000 infections and 29,000 deaths in the US in 2012, and more than 170,000 cases in Europe. The estimated annual attributable cost in the US is USD6,300,000,000. 

 **Redesign of national surveillance for **C. difficile**:  Following the University of Oxford discovery \[2\] that sources other than symptomatic patients are the source of most *C. difficile* infections in endemic settings with routine infection control, PHE designed a new WGS\-based national surveillance system for *C. difficile,* substantially based on University of Oxford research \[A\]. This is the world’s first structured national surveillance programme for *C. difficile* based on WGS. Sentinel hospitals were chosen based on University of Oxford analysis of national patient admission and transfer data. The system was approved and scheduled for implementation in 2020, but delayed until 2021 due to the COVID\-19 pandemic \[A\]. The system is in the business plan of PHE for Healthcare Associated Infections \(current, Dec 2020\) \[A\], to provide all acute NHS trusts in England \(approximately 150\) with access to WGS and process approximately 12,000 *C. difficile* samples per year. According to the PHE lead on *C. difficile* the new system is “ *a more cost\-effective and future\-resilient surveillance system to track known and provide an early warning of emergent C. difficile clones and types”* \[A\], as well as extending global knowledge of how to diagnose, report and characterise a key infection that is a health service quality performance indicator in many countries, including the UK and US \[A\]. 

 **Widespread adoption of antimicrobial restriction to control **C. difficile** infection: The** demonstration that fluoroquinolone restriction was associated with marked falls in incidence of *C. difficile* infection \[3\] has led to widespread adoption of polices to restrict fluoroquinolone use internationally. This research \[3\] influenced US public health and clinical leaders to focus on fluoroquinolones \[Ci\], and the 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for *Clostridium difficile* Infection in Adults and Children cites several studies by Crook and colleagues and recommends restriction of fluoroquinolones \[E\]. The 2018 guidelines of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease recommend “ *Restriction of antibiotic agents/classes is effective in reducing CDI rates*” \[F\], and cites University of Oxford research \(including \[2, 3\]\). *C.difficile* infections in the US reduced by approximately 22% from 2017 to 2019, which is likely due to a combination of infection control measures and altered antibiotic prescribing \[Ci\]. 

 An illustrative example of benefits to healthcare providers is Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in Wales, which had one of the highest rates of *C. difficile* infection in the UK. A 2016 WGS investigation by Public Health Wales \[G\], collaborating with Eyre and colleagues \[based on 3\], found evidence of antibiotic use being a key driver in patterns of *C. difficile* infection. The report recommended prioritisation of antimicrobial stewardship across primary and secondary care \[G\]. A spokesperson from the health board was quoted by *The Pharmaceutical Journal* in 2019 \[H\] as stating that the Board had achieved a 38.7% decrease in *C. difficile* infections comparing 2017/18 to 2018/19, which they partly attributed to a decrease in the antibiotic prescription rate \(12.6% decrease in primary care, April 2016\-March 2019\). The median cost of treating a patient with *C. difficile* infection is GBP7,500, compared to GBP2,800 for patients with other medical conditions, so a decrease in cases provides immediate cost\-savings to the healthcare provider, as well as decreasing the high risk of mortality in frail patients. 

####  Improved clinical practice to remove sources of infection 

 **Better infection control measures for **C. auris**:** *C. auris* is an emerging multidrug resistant fungus, with healthcare\-associated outbreaks detected in at least 30 countries. *C. auris* infection occurs predominantly in patients in high\-dependency settings, with high mortality rates – up to 50% – and presenting major treatment challenges due to antifungal resistance and transmission within healthcare units. The University of Oxford discovery that re\-useable equipment, including temperature probes, can be a major route for spread and persistence of this pathogen \[4\] had the immediate impact of stopping the Oxford hospital outbreak in August 2017. Previous infection control measures had no significant effects until removal of the temperature probes from the affected neurosciences intensive care unit. This was the first time an outbreak of *C. auris* had been ended with a clear understanding of the cause, and resulted in the immediate benefit of no further cases from an outbreak that had infected 70 highly vulnerable patients. 

 This discovery of the infection risk associated with multi\-use equipment led to changes in healthcare guidelines. PHE updated *C. auris* guidelines in August 2017 \(Ii\), specifically referring to reusable equipment such as temperature probes, and there have been no major outbreaks since these changes in practice \(Iii\). The cost of controlling one previous outbreak was reported as more than GBP1,000,000 \(Iii\), so preventing outbreaks provides major cost\-savings for healthcare and public health bodies. In the US, the University of Oxford research \[4\] informed CDC guidance on environmental cleaning for *C. auris* prevention \[Ci\]. CDC guidelines were updated in 2018 to specifically mention disinfection to avoid the risk of transmission via mobile equipment including temperature probes \[Ji\]. In South Africa, *C. auris* has been detected in approximately 100 hospitals and has caused large outbreaks. To address this, the Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa issued new guidelines in 2019 \[Jii\], extensively recommending single\-use equipment and disinfection of reusable equipment, citing \[4\]. 

 **Safer cardiac bypass surgery:** From 2013 to 2017 in Europe, Australia and the US, more than 100 cases of severe *M.chimaera*\-linked infections were reported, associated with cardiac surgery using HCUs, with high morbidity and mortality \(9 of 18 patients \(50%\) in the UK died\). Infection was estimated to occur in 1 in 100\-1000 patients undergoing surgery with HCUs. Research \[including 5\] provided certainty about the source, which empowered the case for redesign of the equipment. Robust interventions led to the termination of the outbreak, through withdrawal of the implicated HCU and major improvements in HCU design by the company \[Ki\]. The International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases issued guidelines \(Nov 2019\) on prevention of *M. chimera* infection following cardiac surgery \[Kii\], citing this research \[5\]. No cases of *M. chimera* infection have been found in patients who had open heart surgery in the UK since 2016, showing that accurate identification of the outbreak source led to elimination of this dangerous infection. 

####  Enabling effective public health responses to multidrug resistant gonorrhoea 

 The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) reports there were approximately 87,000,000 new cases of gonorrhoea in 2016, and it results in substantial morbidity and economic cost worldwide. Spread of drug\-resistant gonorrhoea strains is a major problem and can occur quickly in high\-risk populations. Since there are few treatment options, rapid investigation and prevention of outbreaks is essential. In 2018, the WGS methods developed by Eyre and colleagues \[6\] were adopted by PHE and public health bodies in Australia to conduct rapid investigations into extensively drug\-resistant gonorrhoea, enabling tracing of sources and transmission and targeted public health intervention \[Li, ii\]. For example, two UK cases were traced to Ibiza, Spain, prompting a rapid local and international response to prevent spread \[Lii, iii\]. According to the WHO \[Liv\], the rapid contact tracing and public health messaging undertaken by PHE based on this work, resulted in low risk of further transmission in the UK, thus preventing further near\-untreatable infections. Also, based on this research, in 2019 the ECDC called on EU/EEA member states to strengthen surveillance, testing and tracing \(Liii\), and the University of Oxford research \(e.g. \[6\]\) has contributed to the implementation of WGS for gonorrhoea surveillance by the WHO \[M\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A ground\-breaking programme of research into children and young people with harmful sexual behaviour \(HSB\) has transformed policy and practice in the UK and shaped international responses to this issue. Through the generation and translation of research evidence and insights into a range of unique policy tools and practice\-facing resources, the research has: \(1\) underpinned the development of the first ever national\-level public health guidelines on the topic of HSB, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\); \(2\) co\-produced an innovative operational framework with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children \(NSPCC\) on this issue, leading to more consistent inter\-agency structures and policy and practice responses across child protection and health agencies in the UK and beyond; and \(3\) led to the establishment of a screening tool and assessment framework that have been adopted as recommended models throughout the UK and internationally by a wide range of professionals working with this issue. Through the extensive uptake of core concepts and evidence, this work has led to a paradigm shift in professional responses towards this group of children, as well as significant developments in policy and service delivery frameworks throughout the UK, Europe and Australia.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Sexual abuse affects significant numbers of children globally. Although the dominant image of those who commit acts of sexual violence is of adult men, indicators show that up to half of all sexual abuse is perpetrated by children under the age of 18 years \(Radford et al., 2011\). Durham University’s \(DU\) Centre for Research into Violence and Abuse has undertaken a long\-term programme of research, led by Simon Hackett, into the issue of children with HSB \[R1, R6\]. The research identified significant gaps in policy and services for this group of children and has provided evidence about the needs of children and families affected \[R2, R3, R6\]. The research developed across three phases \(outlined below\) has comprised one of the most sustained programmes of research undertaken to date on this topic, contributing significantly to the international evidence base upon which the impact case study is based. 

 The initial phase of research \(to 2006\) produced the first comprehensive study into the policy and practice landscape with regard to sexually abusive behaviour in childhood across the UK and the Republic of Ireland and set the benchmark for policy makers and practitioners to understand the field. In particular, the research \[R1\] highlighted the inadequacy of official guidance and policy responses to the issue and revealed worrying gaps in service and inconsistencies in how young people with HSB were managed across localities and regions. Of specific concern was the variability of assessment practices. Many areas lacked assessment services and the absence of a standardised model led to unassessed and unmanaged situations of significant risk to children \[R1\]. Having highlighted gaps in policy and practice, this research provided evidence on the development of principles and best practice approaches, emphasising the need for a shift away from ‘abuse specific’ approaches to developmentally sensitive and holistic models of practice. Given the absence of a national strategy on this issue, the research provided the basis and impetus for a number of key drivers of impact as discussed in Section 4 below, with Hackett engaging systematically and deliberately with strategic partners to address the gaps in policy and practice identified. 

 ESRC funded research \(2010\-2014\) complemented the first phase of Hackett’s research’s focus on policy and practice responses through incorporating enhanced understandings of the experiences and needs of children and young people with HSB, the experiences of their families, and the effectiveness of interventions offered to families. The study comprised an innovative long\-term outcome study of children with HSB, carried out between 10 and 20 years after the end of professional interventions in childhood, which identified risk and protective factors associated with developmental and lifecourse outcomes \[R2\]. The study provided the first international empirical data on desistance in this group into adulthood, with findings highlighting the importance of long\-term professional support, stable partner relationships, educational success and employment as factors most positively influencing the lifecourse of this group. This work included the largest published British demographic study of the individual, family and abuse characteristics of 700 young sexual abusers which found particularly high rates of sexual and non\-sexual victimisation in the backgrounds of the children and young people referred \[R2 and R3\], as well showing the disrupted nature of young people’s personal histories of trauma and abuse \[R6\]. The research outputs, therefore, underscored the need for a shift in the field towards more trauma\-focused and lifecourse models of intervention. 

 Hackett’s \(2014\) book \[R4\] drew together this empirical work to provide a concise overview of the evidence base designed specifically for those working in the field. Distributed widely by Research In Practice \(a leading provider of training and resources in the sector that bridges academic and practitioner knowledge\) to 1625 teams and member organisations across the UK, the book provided the basis for the development of a further research partnership \(in 2016\) between Durham University, Research in Practice and NSPCC to use the key elements of the book to develop a structured operational framework to guide and support a step\-change in inter\-agency practice nationally and, increasingly, internationally. At the same time, Hackett was commissioned by NICE to produce two systematic reviews of the qualitative and quantitative evidence on assessment and interventions for children presenting with HSB \[R5\], and alongside expert testimony, these then underpinned the development of NICE guidelines on this topic.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Hackett’s body of research on children and young people with HSB has impacted on policy, practice and services from 2013 onwards \(to present\) and enhanced awareness in three main areas. This has been achieved as a result of the research: 

 1\) Leading to the UK’s first public health guidance on HSB in childhood; 2\) Producing evidence\-based tools and products that have enhanced child protection professionals’ screening and assessment practices in the UK and internationally; and 3\) Strengthening the integration of inter\-agency practices through the provision of an operational framework adopted widely by child protection agencies across the UK and NHS England to audit and improve services. 

####  Improved public policy and official guidance into HSB 

 NICE \(2016\) published the UK’s first national public health guidelines on HSB in childhood and described these as being ‘based on the best available evidence’. Hackett’s \(2016\) definition of HSB has been foundational to these guidelines \[E1a\], which are further underpinned by two funded systematic reviews \[E1b, E1c\] undertaken for NICE by Hackett and Campbell. These reviews represented the first appraisal of the quality of existing quantitative and qualitative evidence on HSB, leading to challenges to orthodox thinking in the field. Hackett gave evidence \[E1d, E1e\] to the NICE Public Health Advisory Committee on the nature and epidemiology of HSB in childhood drawing on research findings on the long\-term outcomes for this group of children. The NICE guidelines have had significant impact in the UK, helping to reframe and move practice in health and social care settings towards assessment and early intervention approaches for both children with problematic sexual behaviours and adolescents who have sexually offended. The impact Hackett had over NICE has, in turn, had broader influence in informing policy development in the UK with the NSPCC \[E2b\] and internationally where, for example, Dale Tolliday, Advisor Sexual and Violent Behaviour, New South Wales Health \(Australia\), \[E3a\] describes the systematic reviews \[E1b, E1c\] as vital for the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse’s understanding of the best international evidence\-base. Hackett’s research was cited 140 times by this Commission. Hackett has also given expert testimony on HSB \(in 2018 and 2019\) to the ongoing Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse \(IICSA\) in England and Wales and to the Council of Europe’s high\-level conference on the Strategy for the Rights of the Child \(2016\-2021\). 

 DU research is now used as the key reference point across the major UK national organisations and stakeholders working in this field \(all of whom shape and influence grassroots practice in, for example youth justice, youth work and social work\) including NSPCC \[E2a\], Barnardo’s \[E4a\] and the Home Office. For example, the Home Office funded Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse \(2018\) \[E4b\] cites Hackett’s publications 29 times and an NSPCC \[E2b\] briefing does so 10 times. Hackett’s research \(cited 8 times\) is built into the 2018 ‘T *oolkit for professionals working with children and young people presenting with HSB*’ published jointly by the Children’s Society, Victim Support and the National Police Chief’s Council. This research now underpins most existing local authority guidance on this issue \(e.g. policies of the safeguarding partnerships in Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Calderdale, Merton, Birmingham, Devon, Brighton\) \[E2a and E5\], ensuring a consistent approach to young people displaying HSB. This step change in consistency and practical understanding materially addresses the policy gaps identified in R1. 

####  Evidence based tools that have enhanced assessment practices 

 R1 identified a postcode lottery in relation to the availability of services and significant inconsistencies in assessment approaches which led to concern about fairness, justice and effective risk management of cases across different geographical areas and sectors. DU research has therefore produced a number of evidence\-based specific resources in order to enhance professional responses and improve consistency of approach. Hackett’s 2010 *Continuum of Sexual Behaviour* model and his subsequent 2014 research review \[R4\] were written to support professionals to differentiate between normal, problematic and harmful sexual behaviours at different stages of children’s and young people’s development. The continuum model has been widely adopted as a core theoretical model in the field throughout the UK, Europe and internationally. For example, the Durham research \[R2\] is embedded into ‘ *Part five: Child on Child Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment*’ of the Department for Education’s statutory guidance \(September 2020\) *Keeping children safe in education,* contributing to a more consistent approach and reframing of attitudes and support towards young people \[E6\]. The NICE guidelines and Australian Royal Commission also recommended the continuum model for use as a screening tool to support professionals in determining responses to children. Tolliday \[E3\] describes the relationship between the Australian Royal Commission, the uptake of Hackett’s continuum model and the NICE systematic reviews as a “brilliant alignment” that allowed Australian researchers to advocate for a common approach across different cultural contexts. This has led directly, according to Tolliday, to recommendation 10.3 in the Australian Royal Commission final report for proportionate and supportive interventions for all children affected by HSB, leading to a complete overhaul and restructuring of services across Australia \[E3\]. 

 For children and young people who require a professional response as a result of their sexual behaviour, an in\-depth holistic assessment is recognised as a key element. The AIM project provides sector\-leading training in the field of HSB, and has developed an original suite of assessment tools rooted in DU research. R4 provided the underpinning evidence\-base for the development of the latest \(2019\) version of an assessment tool \(AIM3\) relating to young people with HSB. Developed by Hackett \(with Leonard\) AIM3 \[E7a\] provides a new approach to assessment and a comprehensive tool and manual that is one of the most used globally, in the field \[E7b\]. AIM3 represents more than simply ‘AIM2 plus’. Commenting in the foreword to the new assessment tool, Pat Branigan describes it as a “powerful and intuitive way to develop bespoke safety plans and targeted interventions…this clear link between assessment, analysis and intervention is a huge and welcome step forward…this excellent tool will play a key role in ushering in the holistic, integrated and more timely HSB risk assessment response that is so much needed” \(E7a, page 3\). The Director of AIM, states \[E7b\], “the people we’re training,…they love the model, they love its simplicity…that it’s holistic and…that they are taking into account different aspects of the young person, so therefore, Simon’s work is having a massive impact on practice.” The Director of AIM, further describes how the implementation of the new AIM3 assessment tool across the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Norway, USA, Canada and Spain is a step change in international understandings of assessment on HSB, providing a more dynamic, strengths\-based and developmentally\-sensitive model of assessment that sees the child and their behaviour in context. \[E7c\]. This widespread use of AIM3 across all parts of the UK and beyond has, in large part, reversed the inconsistencies in assessment practices and approaches first highlighted in R1. 

####  Strengthening of interagency structures and practices 

 DU \[R1 and R3\] identified significant problems in the co\-ordination between agencies at national and local levels with resultant inconsistencies and weaknesses in interagency responses to HSB. In the absence of a national government strategy on this topic, Hackett worked in partnership with NSPCC to develop an evidence\-based national operational framework to act as a platform for changing interagency practice and for supporting local areas to improve their services \[E2a\]. The framework and audit tool was piloted in 2016 across 8 local areas and was extended in 2017 to a further 10 local areas. The framework is now used by agencies Agencies throughout the UK including all five health trusts in Northern Ireland \(backed by a judicial review which recommended its use\), all 30 child protection committees in Scotland, all 22 North Wales local authority areas and approximately 50 local child protection partnership areas throughout England \[E2a\]. The framework \[E2c\], first authored by Hackett, is substantially underpinned by R4, citing DU research 34 times. The freely accessible resource provides a multi\-agency continuum of responses, tools, practical examples, key principles and an audit checklist that draw on the latest evidence to support practice and decision making in the field. Central to the model is the repeated use of the audit tool so that each local area can measure impact and progress over time. The first edition of the framework was published in 2016 with a second, updated edition published in 2019 as a collaborative project between DU, NSPCC, NHS England, and Research in Practice. Hackett has presented on the framework at key international conferences in the UK, Australia, USA and at the Council of Europe. In 2018, the framework was shortlisted for a *Children and Young People Now* award in recognition of its impact on partnership working across the sector. 

 More generally, interest in the \(2019\) second edition of the framework shows an exponential spread of the resource, totalling 3,226 agency downloads from 11 Feb 2019 to 11 Nov 2020 and audit launch events undertaken in over 50 areas \[E2a\]. As a set of conceptual and practical tools, the framework has now saturated the UK child protection landscape with broad and profound impact upon local area systems and practices. For example, in testimony for NSPCC, Sarah O’Brien, Strategic Director for St Helen’s Council comments \[E5\]: “I would absolutely say to any other local authority area that the framework…has been a really, really powerful tool for St Helens. It was a framework that we could galvanise all the partners on and it wasn’t just that the framework and filling in the audit, all the supporting materials that came with it and some of the videos….has been really, really useful in St Helens”. The impact of the framework has been widespread. It has, for example, been central to Nottinghamshire Council’s response to its historical failure to protect children in care from sexual abuse, as investigated by IICSA, through the commissioning of an independent audit of its service by NSPCC using the framework \[E2a\]. The framework has been recommended as a model of best practice for Australia by the Australian Royal Commission and Hackett has worked with the state government in New South Wales to support their own development of a version of the framework as a central plank in their response to the Australian Royal Commission recommendations \[E3\]. 

 Finally, the framework has considerably enhanced both the scope and scale of NSPCC’s work on HSB. In 2019, NHS England officially adopted the framework and Hackett worked with NSPCC to produce additional guidance and resources for NHS staff which integrate his own continuum model with the well\-known Brook traffic light tool. These NHS resources have been disseminated widely in the health sector, with 18,701 downloads between 19 February 2019 and 30 September 2019. Pat Branigan, the NSPCC’s HSB Lead \[E2a\] explains how transformative the framework has been for the NSPCC itself, as a model of how the organisation can contribute to systemic change across other agencies. He says that the framework has been “A game changer. If you have a local area talking and using the same language, all of a sudden they are recognising and responding in the same way. It just makes sense…. So, it’s a cultural change mechanism as well. And it’s certainly helped us as an organisation have a much more consistent and coherent response.” He concludes that “the framework and the success of it has given the organisation confidence to be more upfront and open about how we work with HSB” \[E2a\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Adolescent\-to\-parent violence \(APV\) is a complex, multifaceted and under\-researched form of family violence, but has only been identified in the UK in the past decade. The University of Oxford’s APV project, led by Condry, was the first large\-scale study of APV in the UK. By articulating the scale and nature of the problem and raising awareness of the issue, the    study led to the development of the UK government’s only guidance on the problem of APV, which was provided to professionals working in health, education, social care, housing, policing, and youth justice. At practitioner level, the research has informed training, policy and on\-the\-ground support via organisations such as the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, the charity Against Violence and Abuse, and the Peabody Housing Association. The development of national guidelines, increase in awareness and better reporting, and improvement in approaches to supporting the issue on the ground means these organisations are now better equipped to support thousands of families across the UK.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 When the University of Oxford’s Adolescent to Parent Violence \(APV\) study, funded by the ESRC, began in 2010, APV had not been articulated or quantified within the fields of youth justice, domestic violence, policing, and criminology, particularly in the UK. APV was not recognised as a problem or named in any government publications, no official data on APV had been collated or analysed, and there was a virtual silence on the topic in the policy realm. Condry’s three\-year ESRC funded study, ‘Investigating Adolescent Violence towards Parents’ mapped the contours of the problem of APV, exploring how it was defined, experienced and negotiated by parents and adolescents and how violent assaults committed by adolescents within the home were processed and managed within the criminal justice system. This study was the first large\-scale study of APV in the UK, providing the first analysis of police recorded cases in the country **\[R1\]**. Condry and research officer Miles found almost 1900 cases in a single year recorded as offences by police in London alone, and therefore some of the first systematic evidence and conceptualization of the problem. Further methods used to investigate the different dimensions included interviews with parents and young people, youth offending workers, police officers, and other practitioners providing support to families experiencing APV. These interviews provided in\-depth data highlighting the severity of the impact upon families and the lack of available support services, the need for greater awareness and training, and the need for policy guidance specific to the problem of APV. 

 “*He hits me, kicks me, throws me down, and he’s six feet tall now, he’s a strong lad. I’ve had some awful injuries*.” \(Mother of son aged 16. From the ESRC\-funded Oxford APV study\). “ *I trawled the internet looking for places and who to phone. And there just wasn't anything … there wasn't a clear idea of where to go and who to contact*.” \(Mother of son aged 14. From the ESRC\-funded Oxford APV study\). 

 Other key findings from the University of Oxford APV study included: 

-  APV is a gendered problem, with most offences in police recorded cases committed by sons against mothers **\[R1\].** It is poorly understood, and police officers find it difficult to navigate responding to the problem within a framework largely designed for adult domestic violence **\[R2\].** 

-  APV often involves a pattern of aggressive and violent acts across a prolonged period of time. As well as physically assaulting their parents, those interviewed said their teenage children had smashed up property, thrown things at their parents and made threats. Parents said this had resulted in living in fear of their own children. Families and practitioners describe a range of reasons, including substance abuse, mental health problems, learning difficulties, or a family history of domestic violence or self\-harm. Some families are at a loss to explain why their child was so aggressive towards them, having raised others who did not display such behaviour. This type of violence affects all levels of society but can be harder to navigate for families who are experiencing other forms of social disadvantage. **\[R1, R3\].** 

-  There is a dearth of practical support for families dealing with this problem, with only a handful of localised programmes across the country working specifically on APV and a lack of funding and investment. Youth Justice services particularly struggle to respond and there is a lack of a coordinated national response. **\[R4\]** 

-  The study mapped some of the challenges in responding to APV in light of family dynamics and responsibilities. It identified the importance of recognising the dual role of parents responsible for their child at the same time as being a victim of their violence: the need to hold in balance the seriousness of the violence and the impact on the parent victims, with the age of the child and the importance of diversionary approaches **\[R5, R3\]** 

-  The Oxford study identified a very pressing need for clear guidance on APV for practitioners both nationally and locally and a greater coordination between all services that work with children and families **\[R3\]** 

 In 2020 Condry and Miles \(now University of Manchester\) designed a ‘fast’ research study to investigate experiences of APV in the Covid\-19 pandemic lockdown. This utilised online survey and interview methods with 104 parents who had experienced APV and 47 practitioners and FOI requests to all 43 police forces in England and Wales. It found that most of the parents in the study had experienced an increase in violence during the lockdown and there had been an increase in referrals to services, but that services were struggling to support parents remotely **\[R6\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Condry’s APV study has raised awareness of the nature and scale of APV, underpinned the first ever government policy on APV published by the Home Office, and has informed training and reporting procedures for practitioners and professionals across a wide range of services that work with children and families. 

###  Raising awareness of APV 

 The APV study was the first research to articulate and quantify adolescent to parent violence in the UK and highlighted the dearth of support available to families due to a lack of understanding of adolescent violence directed at parents. Media coverage following the publication of **R1** online in November 2013, including print articles in *The Times*, *The Independent* and *The Guardian* and coverage on the radio on *PM* on BBC Radio 4, *Newsbeat* on BBC Radio 1 **\[C1\]**, gave significant national profile to an issue that hadn’t hitherto been spoken about publicly. In London, where the study was carried out, the lead article of BBC London Evening News included an interview with Condry and referenced the report alongside interviews with victims and calls from charities for more support for families affected by APV, which could potentially have provided a lifeline to other families listening experiencing similar issues. 

###  Developing policy guidance on supporting APV 

 Condry organised a conference at the end of the study in September 2013 to disseminate the research findings to practitioners, policy makers and academics. During the conference, Condry secured a commitment from attendees including the Youth Justice Board \(YJB\), the National Policing Lead and other key practitioners and policymakers, to develop a central policy guide for practitioners. This multi\-agency working group included the Home Office, who committed in parallel in March 2014 to *'develop and disseminate information for practitioners working with children and families on how to identify and address the risks posed by adolescent to parent violence'* as part of its *Violence Against Women and Girls Action Plan* **\[C2\]**. This was the first formal recognition of APV in UK government policy. The Home Office subsequently assumed the lead of the multi\-agency working group that was developing the policy guide for practitioners and the resultant guide was published by the Home Office in March 2015 **\[C3\].** The guide is publicly available and contains general information about APV \(renamed APVA by the Home Office to fit with their terminology for domestic violence and abuse\) and specific advice for professionals working in health, education, social care, housing, policing, and youth justice, as well as advice about further support. The APV study \[including **R1**, **R3**, **R4**\] is referenced extensively throughout. 

 In 2018, the Ministry of Justice asked Condry to contribute to their consultation on *Transforming the Response to Domestic Abuse* due to her research in this area and invited her to chair a roundtable event as part of this process in May 2018. This explored how youth perpetrated domestic abuse should be addressed and included lengthy discussions about the specific response to APV. The government published their response to the consultation in January 2019 **\[C4\]** which included a page on APV and committed to *‘draw together best practice and develop training and resources to improve the response to victims of adolescent to parent violence. We will also promote and embed existing Home Office guidance* **\[C3\]** *and general principles in addition to working with experts to develop service\-specific guidance’* **\[C4, p.44\]**. 

###  Improving understanding of APV within the justice system and development of appropriate services to support APV 

 The Covid\-19 pandemic has placed additional pressures on families, and **R6** showed that most families in the study who had previously experienced APV experienced an increase in violence during the first national lockdown and a significant lack of support. These findings were echoed by the HM Inspectorate of Probation in their review of youth offending services during the pandemic in November 2020 **\[C5\]**. The review directly references **R6** and quotes some of the difficulties parents faced as highlighted in **R6**, identifying some practical responses “ *YOTs* \[Youth Offending Teams\] *were acutely aware of the specific issues for parents and siblings and undertook doorstep or garden visits to check on the safety of actual and potential victims.*” 

 As the issue of APV becomes more visible, other agencies are also looking at how they can better respond. The Mayor of London’s Office for Policing and Crime launched a tender in October 2020 to undertake a comprehensive needs assessment of Child and Adolescent to Parent Violence \(CAPV\) in London and to deliver a community\-based parent/carer mental health support pilot. *“Domestic abuse is a strategic priority for the Mayor of London, and as such, the VRU* \[Violence Reduction Unit\] *seeks to take the opportunity to understand the picture of CAPV in London and shape how services and strategy are delivered* **\[C6** page 9 **\].** *Little is known about the families in London affected by CAPV; where they live, their protected characteristics or what support would help them. A key opportunity to improve outcomes for young people, and ensure they are safe within their homes, and therefore beyond, would be to fully understand a form of harm which is hugely under\-reported; CAPV...”* **\[C6** page 11 **\]**. The invitation to tender specifically requests that the work “ *further explore\[s\] experiences captured within Rachel Condry et al C/APV during covid\-19 report*” **\[R6\] \[C6** page 13 **\]**. 

###  Informing the training and practice of practitioners and professionals in relation to APV across a range of services 

 The findings of Condry’s work on APV **\[R1, R2, R3, R4\]** have been used by a range of agencies to evidence and inform their policies on APV, and to train staff to respond to APV. 

 The Operations Manager of Leeds Youth Offending Service has stated that *“The Oxford research* **\[R1\]** *\[…\] conceptualised the problem, it’s actually providing evidence of the prevalence of this as a problem, it comes up with figures around who tends to be experiencing this, what are the issues, and it gets people to understand that actually this is everybody’s issue, and I think it’s really helped us move forward with the work in our city – much quicker than would have been if the research hadn’t happened”* **\[C7\]**. 

 According to the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales *“The exploratory research into child to parent violence led by Rachel Condry and Caroline Miles* **\[R1, R3, R4\]** *was instrumental to the development of effective policy responses. Prior to the conclusion of their work, this area of social policy suffered from a limited evidence based which made it more difficult to develop effective policy responses. The APV study has been a crucial catalyst in developing both central policy responses”* **\[C8\]** *.* 

 Condry’s work has had a very practical impact on agencies at the forefront of dealing with APV via the Home Office Information Guide **\[C3\]**. Condry organised two launch events for the Information Guide in London and Manchester in 2015 where project partners and over 200 service leads and practitioners from local authorities across England and Wales met to discuss the guidance and how they might best implement it in their areas. The following changes in practice have subsequently been recorded: 

 The Head of Policy and Development at the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales confirms the guidance was sent to *‘all Youth Offending Teams in England and Wales’* and *‘as a result, a number of youth justice services have shaped their practice according to the principles outlined in the guidance’.* They went on to add *‘the work with Rachel’s team is a concrete example of the impact social research can have on the development of effective policy and practice responses. Specifically, it enabled the YJB to support front\-line youth justice services who were calling for central guidance to manage this complex issue’* **\[C8\]**. 

 The charity Against Violence and Abuse also confirms: “ *The findings of the project* **\[R1\]** *have been incredibly useful at providing a national picture of APV. As this is an issue we frequently get asked about when training practitioners it has been really helpful to have robust evidence and statistics which provide a better picture of this form of abuse…. This guidance* **\[C4\]** *… is being used nationally to inform best practice. We use this document frequently when training and provided copies to delegates at our recent seminar on the Care Act and APV.”* **\[C9\]**. 

 A Senior Business Partner for Domestic Abuse at Peabody, one of London’s largest housing providers, notes: *‘The Home Office guidance, which drew upon the findings of the Oxford study, has been circulated to all my links at Peabody and the Community Safety Officers use this as a vital reference to their work on cases of APVA* \[Adolescent to parent violence and abuse\] *. We have also updated our IT systems to create a separate categorisation of APVA so we are in a better position to collect data around this and then feed this back on a national level to partners and to the Home Office as I sit on the National Violence and Women and Girls’ panel. I also share this best practice resource with other housing providers in the sector at national and international conferences regularly \[…\] The guidance is now part of our everyday work at Peabody and I use it as a resource in all the training I deliver which is now up to 41 housing providers nationally. This guidance not only gives practitioners a clear understanding of what APVA is but is also one of the most comprehensive resources I have seen on how to tackle this issue’* **\[C10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Attachment Narrative Therapy \(ANT\) programme of research incorporating Systemic Autism\-related Family Enabling \(SAFE\) has improved the lives of families with complex problems. These innovative therapies have led to improved wellbeing, training and service provision in the UK nationally, and in several European countries and Asia. More than 2,000 professionals trained in these therapies have worked therapeutically with over 120,000 families in the last seven years. As well as impacting on professional practice and wellbeing of families, the research has enhanced existing health\-related services and training programmes since 2013, resulting in economic impacts with revenue of over £500,000 for the two main family\-therapy training organisations alone. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impacts described result from unique research into novel attachment\-based systemic interventions led by Professor Dallos and the research team \(including McKenzie, since 2009, together with Doctoral student, parent representative, and latterly Research Assistant, Vassallo from 2013\) since 2004, with significant academic outputs including 8 books and more than 90 journal papers. 

###  Attachment can be described as a supportive bond between a child and caregiver creating a sense of safety through meeting the physical and emotional needs of the child. Ideally, a secure attachment is formed, giving a child a safe base from which to explore the world and return to for comfort. Through working with families with complex problems, the research has identified intergenerational, severe and multi\-faceted attachment problems resulting in high levels of emotional arousal and distress. In these families, talking and cognitive therapies have limited success where family members are too aroused to engage in reflective thinking and problem\-solving. 

###  As a therapeutic approach for working with families with complex problems, Professor Dallos and his team developed a conceptual framework for the interventions \- *Attachment Narrative Therapy* \(ANT\) \[3.1\]. This novel approach works on the principle that therapists provide a secure base and empower families to explore understandings and effect change \[3.2\]. The methodology employs activities rather than predominantly reliant on ‘talking’, facilitating families to explore problems and solutions for themselves using mapping, sculpting, drawing and role\-play. 

###  Initially, ANT research involved trialling techniques with families in collaboration with local services throughout the South West. Formulating family problems with an attachment lens and using systemic ANT principles in therapy were found to be helpful for families including those where a child had a diagnosis of autism \[3.3\]. In 2012, McKenzie, Dallos and Vassallo began a research project exploring the use of ANT principles in supporting families of children with autism \[5.4\], resulting in the development of SAFE \(Systemic Autism\-related Family Enabling\). 

###  In 2016 a pilot study for SAFE indicated reduced family distress and led to the development of a SAFE practice manual by Dallos and McKenzie. The impact of SAFE was supported by funding from NIHR \(2017\-2019\) for a Randomised Controlled Feasibility Trial \(N = 146 family members\) and an extended parallel qualitative study of family experience of the intervention funded by Autistica. The research team were invited to be a centre for Autistica’s  [Discover Research Network](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/autism-research-team-invited-on-to-national-network) in 2017. The SAFE research studies included collaboration with three NHS hospital trusts, charitable bodies and national family therapy organisations. The findings of the NIHR trial revealed positive changes for families receiving SAFE, compared to those receiving standard care, in mental health and problem\-solving strategies, including coping with challenging behaviour. Similarly the Autistica study showed that families found SAFE helpful in alleviating family distress and building on strengths \[3.5\]. 

###  In 2017, SAFE research was extended to provide an intervention that could support families and teachers of children with autism to work in partnership \[3.6\]. Promising initial results with 32 family and teacher pairs led to a whole\-school pilot study in a primary school serving 425 children. Findings of the pilot study indicated that SAFE\-for\-Schools had enhanced school practice, and led to better home\-school communication and improved learning engagement by the children. The approach was subsequently shared across the associated Multi\-Academy Trust.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 ANT, incorporating SAFE, has enhanced training and service provision nationally and internationally leading to improved wellbeing of families with complex problems. 

 <ins>Impacts on practitioners</ins> 

 During the last decade, training based on the research has improved the skills of practitioners in delivering therapeutic intervention through services using ANT and SAFE approaches, leading to improved mental health and problem\-solving skills among families \[S5, S6, S8, S9, S10\]. 

 Between August 2013 and 2020, more than 300 professionals have received training on these interventions annually which are cascaded through services \(>2000 professionals over the 7 year period from August 2013\) \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 *“This is ground breaking work which is leading the field and much needed to help practitioners who are dealing with these highly stressed families and is becoming a key part of our training at IFT. Feedback from students at all levels is that this is highly relevant to their work, accessible in its articulation of theory and helpful for them to make significant changes to their practice and increase their therapeutic connection with families facing tremendous challenges”.* \(Director of CPD and Innovation \- Institute of Family Therapy, 5.2\) 

 The impact of research\-informed training is far\-reaching, with ANT and SAFE workshops providing training for more than 50 international professionals annually through, for example, The Family Therapy Association, Romania \(2015\); Counselling Centre, University of Warsaw \(2016\), the Society of Family Therapy, Czech Republic \(2017\) \[5.3\] and the Williams Road Family Therapy Centre, Australia \(2020\). 

 Training examples in the UK include courses for clinicians at the Maudsley Hospital in London and for the All Wales Neurodevelopmental Clinical Excellence Network, and annual courses for the Bowlby Centre, which promotes attachment orientated expertise for professionals in the UK and abroad \[S1\]. Dallos also provides annual courses for systemic practitioners at the Institute of Family Therapy \(IFT\) \[5.2\]. The training courses are well attended in the context of scarce funds for clinical training, which is testament to the reputation of ANT and SAFE approaches as delivering real benefits to clinicians and their clients. Since 2013, more than 150 attendees have gone on to receive further in\-depth supervision from Dallos, for over two months at a time, in developing services based on ANT and SAFE principles. The research has had an impact on these training providers by extending their knowledge, contributing to training portfolios and bringing in substantial revenue. For IFT and the Bowlby Centre combined, this annual revenue is in the region of £80,000 \(> £500,000 over the 7 year period from August 2013\). The Bowlby Centre and IFT evaluate all training sessions based on feedback from participants. This is overwhelmingly positive in terms of professional development and the ultimate impact on services and families \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 *“The feedback from participants regarding the training has been extremely positive and demand for the training continues to be high. It has led to significant impact on the work of the participants and a significant number have continued to receive clinical supervision from Prof Dallos that shapes their delivery of services”* \(Chair of Executive Committee – Bowlby Centre, 5.1\) 

 <ins>Impacts on the health and wellbeing</ins> <ins>of families</ins> 

 A conservative estimate would be that the training and supervision described above results in improved service provision and healthcare outcomes for 18,000 families in the UK with complex problems each year \(> 120,000 families over the 7 year period from August 2013\). Service providers report that these innovative interventions improve mental health and coping among family members by facilitating understanding of need and providing strategies to deal with problems including wider support networks. In addition, these approaches have provided an innovative tool \[5.4\] to distinguish autism from attachment\-related difficulties in the diagnostic process, an ongoing area of difficulty for clinicians which can result in distress for families due to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment for children as documented in 3.4. 

 *“It \[ANT\] has also informed differential diagnosis in cases where it has been challenging to separate autism spectrum difficulties, from developmental problems arising from trauma/attachment\-related issues. One of the greatest impacts however, has been in supporting parents to attune to their child’s developmental needs, and considering the impact of the child’s disability on parents’ lives. The systemic nature of the approach foregrounds parents’ need to support one another, and it provides tools not only for working with parents, but also for enhancing the support system around the family”* \(Dr Mark Hudson, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, 5.4\) 

 
The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines identify a gap in the care recommended for families of children with autism with complex problems. The multi\-site randomised controlled feasibility trial \(RCT\) of the SAFE intervention funded by the  [National Institute of Health Research](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/PB-PG-0815-20058) \[5.5\] and the parallel qualitative study funded by  [Autistica](https://www.autistica.org.uk/our-research/research-projects/family-toolkit-autism) \[5.6\], led by McKenzie, shed light on how the intervention benefits families and can address this gap in care. The NIHR research findings indicate that families receiving SAFE show marked differences, on the primary outcome measure, after 24 weeks compared to a control group in three areas associated with improved mental wellbeing: 1. Building on family strengths. 2. Coping with difficulties such as challenging behaviour. 3. Enhancing communication between family members. 

 Figure 1. Change in building strengths, coping with difficulties and family communication over 24 weeks: Differences between families receiving SAFE and control group. 

 A reduction in scores indicates positive change. 

 \(McKenzie et al., 2020 \[3.5\]\) 

 The research showed that the intervention can be confidently delivered by existing NHS therapists \[5.5\]. The trial also led to ongoing relationships with local NHS services leading to positive changes in care for families of children with autism. For example, Dallos, McKenzie and co\-applicant Julian Archer MD initiated enhanced provision for families at the main recruitment centre \(Plymouth NHS Child Development Centre\). This involved cessation of unsuccessful behavioural strategies and recruitment of three Clinical Psychologists trained in ANT and systemic practice by Dallos \[5.7\]. 

 The Autistica study showed that the intervention was helpful for all participating family members and SAFE elicited positive change in mental health of family members including increased understanding and closeness, improved communication, problem solving, and confidence, and less sense of isolation: 

 *“I have already found these sessions so helpful they have helped me understand what I can do differently to help J* \(child with autism\), *myself and the family and given me confidence to make decisions and changes for the better”* \(Primary Caregiver in Autistica study, 5.6\) 

 <ins>Impacts on education and</ins> <ins>child and family services</ins> 

 Families in the RCT highlighted difficult relationships between themselves and school, including informal exclusions and the need for further training for school staff. Such experiences are well documented nationally by organisations such as the National Autistic Society and the Autism Education Trust. This finding led to the development of SAFE for Schools \(SfS\), an adapted version of SAFE, which was subject to a whole school pilot study, in 2019\-2020. The research included design and delivery of training materials in SfS principles for staff and parents. SfS focuses on building partnership, understanding and collaborative problem\-solving among the key individuals around the child, in order to facilitate wellbeing and positive educational outcomes. Findings indicate substantial impact on educational planning, practice and methods beyond the pilot school via the associated Discovery Multi Academy Trust which provides for 1260 children. SfS has improved home/school relationships, facilitated better educational engagement, leading to enhanced coping strategies and calmer home lives for the children \[5.8\]. 

 *“Safe for Schools has been a revelation and the impact it has had on the pupils and staff at our school is immeasurable”* \(SENCo, Beechwood Primary Academy, 5.8\) 

 <ins>Impact</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>on the delivery of professional services</ins> 

 Training and supervision have facilitated the development of improved policy, practice and health care in a range of services. For example, Dallos trained more than 100 key staff across all children’s services in Cornwall from 2013\-2015 as part of the ‘Reclaiming Social Work’ initiative stemming from the Monroe Report in 2011. This training impacted on social work policy, practice and client wellbeing across the whole county. Dallos provided a systemic ANT\-informed model for statutory child and family social work supporting the development of a network of new roles across Cornwall Child & Family Social Work Services. For example, policy was changed to establish Principal Social Workers in every team. These are advanced practitioners with responsibility for improving provision and care through supervision, mentoring and support to other social workers with heavy case\-loads. This training also contributed to Cornwall being the first authority to invest in applying a systemic model to an adult social care context, as a creative response to ensure the best care despite the pressures facing these services. 

 Dallos has collaborated with Professor Vetere \(University of Surrey\) to develop ANT\-informed community projects including ‘Safer Families’ serving families with highly complex problems including violence, in Reading, Oxford and London 5.10\] and has consulted with community services which grew from Safer Families in Ireland, Finland, Malta and Norway \[S10\]. Dallos also collaborated with senior clinicians to improve patient outcomes by establishing new clinics focusing on working systemically with complex problems, based on evidence–based ANT and SAFE techniques. Since August 2013, new clinics and enhanced services based on ANT and SAFE were established within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services \(CAMHS\) in Nottingham, Torbay, Sheffield and Liverpool \[S4, S9\]. In these NHS and community clinics, evidence on outcomes is routinely collected from multiple sources including family feedback, medical records and therapists practice logs. Service providers report substantial benefits for child, adolescent, adult and family care in these innovative clinics, including addressing an absence of targeted support for families with complex problems \[5.4, 5.9, 5.10\]. 

 *“ANT principles with their understanding of arousal and arousal regulation, relational dangers, unprocessed trauma responding, the need for safety and comforting, and the ability to self\-reflect and to heal and repair relationships is central to good practice….Feedback from multiple sources leaves me in no doubt that the ANT model addresses the relationship between content and process in systemic psychotherapy, and benefits individuals, families, couples and team working.”* \(Director of Safer Families, 5.10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Communities living near active volcanoes, and the agencies protecting them, require evidence\-based advice on how to best reduce exposure to volcanic emissions, in order to prevent respiratory symptoms and diseases. This case study documents how research, led by Horwell, has generated critical evidence and protocols which have enabled both global and community\-specific advice to be produced. The evidence has been incorporated into World Health Organization \(in the Americas; Pan American Health Organization, PAHO\) guidelines and has directly led to changes in policy and practice in several volcanic eruptions since 2017, with agencies providing communities with effective respiratory protection in Indonesia, Hawaii and Guatemala. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Over the past decade a variety of research projects, led by Horwell, have been conducted at Durham University with the aim of enabling community protection from potentially harmful volcanic emissions. When volcanic ash falls on a community, the questions that are immediately asked by both the public and disaster management and health agencies are ‘Is it harmful to breathe this air?’ and ‘How can I protect myself?’. Medical studies \(e.g., epidemiology or clinical studies\) may take months or even decades, to assess if the emissions are harmful so Horwell developed rapid techniques and protocols for physicochemical analysis of ash, enabling swift health hazard assessment. Laboratory experiments and social surveys have also been conducted to build the first evidence base on the effectiveness of various forms of respiratory protection for community protection. 

####  <ins>i\) Ash characterisation research</ins> 

 Since 2007, Horwell and her group have developed a range of physicochemical techniques for rapidly assessing the respiratory\-health\-pertinent characteristics of volcanic ash, to enable decision making on the need for exposure reduction during volcanic crises. Following testing and publication of the underpinning techniques \[e.g. R1\], a rapid analysis protocol was developed and published on the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network \(IVHHN\)\* website. The protocol was then applied in three eruptions \[e.g. R2\] and tested in other non\-crisis situations. The protocol has four stages: I\) sample collection; II\) particle size analysis \(a critical step, because if ash is too coarse to enter the lung then it cannot be a respiratory hazard\); III\) full characterisation of health\-pertinent physicochemical properties; IV\) reporting. Agencies can decide on whether to enact the full or partial protocol, depending on the scale of the eruption and how fine\-grained the ash is. 

####  <ins>ii\) Effectiveness of respiratory protection used for ash exposure reduction</ins> 

 The Health Interventions in Volcanic Eruptions \(HIVE; Horwell was PI\) consortium project built the first evidence base on effective respiratory protection for community use, for exposure reduction against volcanic ash. Laboratory studies were conducted, at the Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh, on 17 different forms of respiratory protection \(RP\) used by communities during eruptions around the world. The RP ranged from handkerchiefs, shawls and hijab to facemasks including surgical masks and industry\-certified devices \(e.g. N95 masks\). The RP were tested for their filtration efficiency \(FE\) and their ‘leakage’ – a combined measure of both fit and filtration, tested on human volunteers \[R3\]. The results showed that the best type of RP, in terms of both FE and fit, was the N95 mask. Around the world, surgical masks are commonly distributed by agencies but, whilst the results showed that these had excellent filtration, they did not fit well, unless an extra layer of cloth was added to hold the mask better to the face \[R3\], which the lab volunteers, and community testers in Indonesia, found uncomfortable. All of the tested cloth materials performed poorly against volcanic ash. Folding cloth into multiple layers improved its FE, but multi\-layered facemasks, such as surgical masks, were more effective. Many agencies recommend wetting cloth materials or surgical masks, but the experiments did not find any additional protective benefits to wetting. An ethical framework was also developed to aid agency decision making on which types of RP to recommend \[R4\]. The social research showed that different cultures have different perceptions of the health risk from volcanic ash, and the need to protect themselves, so advice must be tailored to fit the needs of individual communities \[e.g. R5\]. 

####  <ins>iii\) Community perceptions of</ins> <ins>vog</ins> <ins>exposure, protection and advice on Hawaii Island</ins> 

 In 2015, Horwell worked with communities \(by conducting focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys\) to understand how they protect themselves from the impacts of the constant gaseous emissions \(known as ‘vog’\) from Kīlauea volcano, Hawaii and how this relates to official guidance given by federal and state agencies. The research found that, whilst it was difficult for many people to reduce exposure to vog, given their outdoor lifestyles, the tropical climate and, hence, lack of robustness of housing design, the communities had developed a range of strategies for coping with the symptoms which they attribute to the vog \[R6\]. The work resulted in the formation of an interagency \(GO\) partnership to revise the existing public health advice, based on the study.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  **Changes to volcanic health response policy** 

 Horwell’s research, to build an evidence base on the respiratory health hazards of volcanic emissions and effective methods of community protection, has resulted in incorporation of methodological protocols into country\-level emergency management plans, co\-development of informational products with communities and agencies, and their uptake and use during volcanic crises. This has resulted in raised awareness of effective actions in communities and changes in policy and practice related to mask distribution by agencies. 

  

####  **Improved community protection** 

 When a volcano erupts, agencies \(usually GOs and NGOs with public health, civil protection, disaster management and humanitarian remits\) will often distribute facemasks to reduce individual exposures to volcanic emissions, hence reducing the risk of harm from ash inhalation. Until recently, distributed facemasks have usually been those that have already been stockpiled for public health emergencies \(e.g., surgical masks stored for influenza pandemics\). Until the HIVE project, there was little\-to\-no evidence of the effectiveness of these masks in community settings for volcanic crises. 

  

 The Pan American Health Organization \(PAHO\) which is the World Health Organization’s \(WHO\) Regional Office for the Americas, has rewritten its guidelines on the health impacts of volcanic eruptions. Within those guidelines, information related to respiratory protection is based on the evidence provided by the HIVE research \[E1\]. These guidelines replace the current information available across the WHO, globally. The HIVE findings and impact were also summarised in a special supplement of PAHO’s Disasters Newsletter \(October 2020\), which reaches approximately 27,000 experts worldwide \[E1\], enabling awareness raising at a local level and, hence, faster implementation of the guidance during volcanic emergencies. A new IVHHN/HIVE standardised epidemiological protocol, for use in eruption crises, was also incorporated as part of PAHO’s Regional Response Team assessment tools. Dr Ciro Ugarte, Director of Health Emergencies at PAHO, has said: “The contribution of the HIVE project has been instrumental in building and sharing scientific evidence on respiratory protection from volcanic ash within the Americas. I would like to specially recognise Durham University for this essential collaboration towards a more resilient health sector in the Americas.” \[E1\] 

  

 In late 2017, the Mt Agung, Bali volcanic crisis triggered a critical shift in the approach to community protection in volcanic emergencies in low\-to\-middle income countries \(LMICs\). The fundamental difference between the preparedness for the Agung eruption, and that of previous volcanic crises in LMICs, came from a combination of changes in humanitarian practice, such as the advent of crowdfunding platforms, greater coordination of grassroots response, and a sudden move away from the precautionary principle \(any intervention is better than no intervention\) towards the principles of effectiveness \(only providing proven interventions\) and social justice \(equality in public health provision\). This ethical decision\-making was based on the results of the HIVE project \[R3\-5\], which showed that industry\-certified \(N95\) masks were the most effective at protecting against ash inhalation \[E2\]. This resulted in the donation, stockpiling and distribution of 75,000 N95 masks in Bali by a consortium of NGOs known as Mt Agung Relief \(led by Kopernik\), a situation which has not previously been observed in a volcanic crisis in a LMIC \(see \[E1\] for case study\). Mt Agung Relief also produced a series of public informational products on ash protection based on the findings of the HIVE project \[E2\-3\]. Horwell also shared the findings of the HIVE project through social media and engaged in discussions with communities in Bali through local Facebook groups such as Community Ubud, resulting in evidence\-based community\-level decision making \[E3\]. 

  

 The results of the HIVE research \[R3\-5\] have subsequently been incorporated into new public information products \(printable and audio\-visual\), downloadable from the IVHHN website. They were co\-developed with Indonesian NGOs, GOs and community representatives and are now available in English, Spanish, Indonesian, Filipino, Japanese and Turkish. The English and Spanish printable products \(booklet, poster and leaflet\) are endorsed by PAHO/WHO and carry their logos \[E1\]. These products provide information on how to protect from inhaling ash \(2,443 video views 09/20\) and how to fit a facemask \(9,946 video views 09/20\). Another video documents people’s experiences of protection during the 2010 Merapi \(Indonesia eruption\), to help people prepare for future eruption crises \(9,618 video views 09/20\). During the 2018 ash eruptions of Kīlauea volcano, Hawaii, a major PPE manufacturer donated over 100,000 N95 particulate respirators, in collaboration with local NGOs and GOs, a decision informed by the HIVE evidence \[E4\]. Local guidance was also developed by the Hawaii Department of Health \(HDOH\), based on the IVHHN products \[E4\]. Additionally, several NGOs in Indonesia have used the information to make their own products, for example, the Yakkum Emergency Unit has produced a series of posters \[E5\]. The Indonesian Red Cross \(PMI\) and Direct Relief \(a US based humanitarian relief organization\) have said that they will be printing and distributing the products in future eruption crises \[E6; E7\]. 

  

 In January 2019, the HIVE project team returned to Indonesia to conduct four train\-the\-trainer workshops, on how to fit a facemask, for more than 70 representatives of local agencies and health centres, with the International Society for Respiratory Protection and the Indonesian Red Cross. Those representatives are now engaged in further training and, so far, at least 800 people have received this training \[E6\]. 

  

 In Hawaii, the research finding \[R6\] that communities were coping with vog \(gas\) exposure in different ways from the official advice, and that the advice was viewed by some as inappropriate given their lifestyles, triggered a complete rewrite of that advice by the HDOH, US Geological Survey \(USGS\) and IVHHN \(Horwell\) \[E4\]. The research also showed how existing advice offered by different agencies varied on different websites. Through workshops held as part of the research, a new Interagency \(GO\) Partnership was formed \(HDOH, Civil Defense, USGS, US National Park Service, County of Hawaii etc.\) and an agreement was made that all future advice on vog protection would be consistent across the different agencies. The new guidelines have been published as a booklet, rack brochure and poster, and are available online on a new, comprehensive ‘web dashboard’ which Horwell co\-designed with the interagency partnership. The Vog Dashboard \( [<ins>https://vog.ivhhn.org/</ins>](https://vog.ivhhn.org/)\), is hosted by IVHHN so that no particular Hawaii/ US agency appears to lead the Partnership and all vog information and data can be accessed from one portal. The guidelines were written to be more reflective of Hawaiian lifestyles and to incorporate the communities’ strategies for coping, where these were evidence based. The agencies then removed their old advice from their own websites so that there was a single point of information \[E8\]. In May 2018, an unprecedented volcanic crisis emerged as the Kīlauea eruption changed location and style, resulting in multiple volcanic hazards and impacts within the community. The Vog Dashboard became a key source of official information, receiving approximately 50,000 visits per week during this crisis and was also highly recommended by various international media outlets \[E9\]. Fenix Grange, HDOH, said: “We are indebted to Dr. Horwell and IVHHN for the extraordinary, accessible technical resources and the expertise provided. Their contributions to the massive, multi\-disciplinary response to the volcanic eruption crisis of 2018 \(and prior events\) were very important to the mission of HDOH to protect the people of Hawaii” \[E4\]. 

  

####  **Rapid health hazard assessment** 

 The ash analysis protocols, adopted by IVHHN, have been incorporated into New Zealand governmental policy to be enacted in any future eruptions \[E10\]. This coordinated framework for public health response to eruptions involves governmental ministries, the national geological survey \(GNS Science\), Regional Councils, the Met Service and universities. When an eruption occurs, the framework of responses will be enacted and ash collection and characterisation, in accordance with the IVHHN protocols, is part of that crisis management plan. Therefore, official guidelines and practice have been established which purposefully incorporate Horwell’s protocols. Horwell was invited to New Zealand, in Nov. 2013, to present her research to the governmental ministries and at a forum of regional public health representatives, which kicked off the process of writing and establishing the framework. 

  

 In 2017, key organisers of the framework \(at GNS Science and Massey University\) advised on crisis response for an eruption in Vanuatu. They enacted the IVHHN protocol, as part of that response \[E10\]. Parts of the IVHHN protocol have also been applied in other volcanic crises by local agencies around the world. “Claire’s work has led to improved capacity for rapid eruption response in both NZ and Vanuatu, including the activities of Civil Defence and Emergency Management Groups throughout the North Island.” Graham Leonard, GNS \[E10\]. 

  

 To conclude, Horwell’s research on how to protect communities from exposure to volcanic emissions has influenced policy and practice in numerous health\-facing organisations, around the globe, resulting in better preparedness, improved public health advice and protection, and enhanced understanding of the hazards of volcanic ash.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Dr Joyce \(Zhe\) Jiang, a specialist in employment relations at the University of York, increased understanding of the plight of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\) as a form of modern slavery. It also demonstrated how ‘participatory art’ can help groups such as MDWs mobilize themselves and acquire collective identity and purpose. MDWs in London worked with Jiang to develop a video documentary highlighting their experiences, which was exhibited at galleries and museums across the UK. Through participatory art, Jiang has helped MDWs: raise public awareness of their plight; empower themselves and their associations towards improving terms and conditions; and advance the campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Jiang at the University of York \(UoY\) has significantly contributed to understanding the experiences of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\), and how they might use participatory art to collectively organize themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions and influence policy. In the UK, there is growing concern that the decline in traditional labour organizing and collective bargaining has left large numbers of workers vulnerable to intensified forms of exploitation. This is especially the case with MDWs, such as, nannies, cooks and cleaners who live in accommodation provided by their employer. Typically, MDWs are not members of unions and do not benefit from the protection of domestic employment laws. 

 Drawing on insights from employment relations and the sociology of work, Jiang’s research has helped to understand the experiences of these workers as a form of modern slavery. A survey of MDWs conducted in early 2019, by Jiang at UoY, revealed that 59% suffered from physical, verbal or sexual abuse at work, and also that a majority of employers did not comply with the National Minimum Wage **\[A\]**. In the employment relations literature, it is often assumed that groups such as MDWs, isolated in the homes of their employers, lack a collective identity and are hard to organize in conventional ways that could improve working conditions, for example, through membership of unions. However, in earlier work \(prior to joining York in 2016\), Jiang \(with Korczynski, University of Nottingham\) had challenged the assumption that MDWs were ‘un\-organizable’ and highlighted ways in which these workers can mobilize themselves to articulate their shared experiences and pursue collective interests. 

 Research conducted at York by Jiang built on these ideas to explore how ‘participatory art’ can be a powerful tool in collective organizing. Key ideas were developed in *‘The art of labour organizing’*, published in the leading journal *Human Relations* **\[B\]**. Jiang explores the role that ‘participatory art’ can play in supporting and enhancing *‘flat organizing,’* which she defines as a process that emerges from social relationships between workers interacting with each other in the wider community. Examples include social movements or grassroots protest groups that \(initially at least\) have no formal leadership or structure. In the employment context, flat organizing might occur when groups of workers come together informally and develop a sense of community, initially without the help of trades unions. Jiang’s interest in participatory art was partly inspired by the critical mass of researchers at York, led by Professor Stephen Linstead, interested in the role of aesthetics for understanding organizations and the relationships between art and research. Using an in depth case study, Jiang uncovered how ‘art practices’ \(e.g. workshops on singing, drawing, painting, writing, acting and constructing and presenting satirical sketches\) can have a significant impact on the ability of groups such as MDWs to associate and develop a collective sense of purpose. Based on these observations she developed an ideal type model for understanding the ‘ *art of flat organizing’* consisting of six elements: participatory art practices; tutor activist roles; distributed leadership; safe spaces; knowing and questioning through art; and empowerment through art. 

 In 2019, Jiang applied and further refined her ideas about the art of flat organizing through a co\-produced project with The Voice of Domestic Workers \(VoDW\), for whom she acts as a trustee. This project involved a participatory video in collaboration with Tassia Kobylinska \- a filmmaker from Goldsmiths \- and a group of MDWs associated with VoDW **\[C\]\[D\]**. Funded by an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant awarded by UoY, twelve MDWs were trained in video production. Organised by Jiang and Kobylinska, this group co\-produced a short documentary video, *Our Journey* **\[D\]**, and curated exhibitions *\(My Home is Not My Home\)* that presented a combination of video installation, photography, artworks and documents in different museums and galleries across the UK \(including: in London, L’etrangere, Stephen Lawrence Gallery, Cubitt Gallery Goldsmiths and Unite the Union; in York, Norman Rea Gallery; and in Manchester, People’s History Museum\). As a form of ‘participatory art’ in action, the co\-produced film, *Our Journey* **\[D\]** and the associated exhibitions helped MDWs organize themselves and to articulate their interests to politicians and public audiences. 

 In research terms, observations and insights from the VoDW project enabled refinement and increased understanding of the process and outcomes of ‘participatory art’ in supporting flat organizing and the working lives of MDWs **\[E\]\[F\]**. Most recently, this work has continued with additional funding awarded in 2020 by Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women \(GAATW\) to further research the plight of MDWs, their experiences of modern slavery and the ways they are organizing themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 To date Jiang’s research has had an impact in three key areas: **\(a\)** raising public awareness of the plight of MDWs; **\(b\)** using participatory art practices to empower MDWs and help them organize to improve their terms and conditions; and **\(c\)** informing the ongoing campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system. 

 <ins>Enhanced public awareness</ins> – Following exhibitions in multiple galleries and museums between 2019 and 2020, Jiang’s research has helped to raise public and media awareness of the plight of MDWs. By December 2020 Jiang’s exhibitions had attracted 1,300 visitors nationally, despite the cancellation of events after March 2020, due to the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[1\]**. Evidence from feedback interviews and surveys reveals that the exhibitions have improved public understanding of the plight of MDWs and the need for reforming the system **\[1\]**. In exhibition questionnaires, a majority of visitors \(in some cases 100%\) responded positively to questions such as: *‘I felt moved or inspired’, ‘I was exposed to new ways of thinking about things’, ’It made me want to know more about what I was seeing’ and ‘I will use/share things learnt today*’ **\[1\]**. Words that recur in visitor’s comments’ books and interviews are *‘moving’, ‘important’, ‘enlightening’, ‘insightful’, ‘powerful’, ‘shocking’ and ‘informative’*. Some visitors expressed astonishment that ‘modern slavery’ still existed in the UK. One visitor, for example, stated: *‘I think it’s so surprising and disgraceful in this age that people are treated in a way that these workers have been treated. They are not considered as workers really. They are considered as slaves in modern society.’* A different visitor remarked on how it was: *‘a really shocking exhibition. I had an idea of what has been happening…\[the\] abuses, but not to this extent’*, while, according to another, it was: ‘ *A very inspiring and mind\-blowing exhibition that reveals an aspect of modern life that has always been overlooked’*. Others were able to connect the exhibition to their own immediate family experiences and recognised the importance of collective organizing: *‘my mum left the Philippines as a domestic worker – I don’t think she has had the opportunity to share her story and her pain with people who have been through the same – I can only imagine how much it helps to join in solidarity through organisations like VoDW’* **\[1\]**. An article published in the *Guardian* on the L’Etrangere exhibition and a feature on Resonance FM radio both assisted in raising public awareness of the exhibition and the issue **\[2\]**. 

 <ins>Empowering MDWs through participatory art</ins><ins>:</ins> In line with her foundational research **\[B\]**, the participatory art project directed by Jiang to produce the documentary video and exhibitions has supported ‘flat organizing’ by giving the MDWs a voice \- as individuals, through unionization and by connecting them to non\-traditional actors, such as museum curators. 

 First, it helped to empower the 12 individual MDWs who were directly involved in the art project, raising their willingness and ability to campaign on behalf of other co\-workers. Feedback suggested that for many it was a transformative experience which significantly improved their skills and confidence. A typical comment from participants was: *‘We learnt a lot. It's priceless, knowledge and bonding every week.*', while another remarked: *‘to be part of this project…I was so grateful because at last, we can express ourselves. We let other people hear our voices, our struggles.*' **\[3\]**. Five participants subsequently became active campaigners, representing their community by volunteering and speaking at public events. As the chair of VoDW stated: *‘Some women have developed important media skills from the participatory video series. They have become very active in representing the community in various media platforms. The skills learnt in the workshops have been spilled over to other progressive activities.*' **\[4\]**. 

 Second, the video and exhibitions helped to raise the awareness of a wider constituency of MDWs, mobilising support for the VoDW which campaigns for equal employment rights and reform of the visa system \(see below\). Jiang’s research helped boost membership of VoDW to 1500 by December 2020. This is confirmed by the VoDW Chairperson, who noted: *‘The video training has attracted…new members for us. We have also received enquiries from domestic workers who wanted to join our organization after visiting Joyce’s exhibition.’* **\[4\]**. Amongst these new members are the 12 MDWs involved in the video, one of whom is now leading the media and communication working group within VoDW. 

 A further way in which Jiang’s research has helped to empower MDWs is by facilitating union membership and changing the way that unions engage with this group: As the VoDW Chairperson explained: *‘Joyce’s research has informed our discussion with Unite the Union to establish a domestic worker branch within the union...Without her research, this will not happen so quickly’* **\[4\]**. These discussions led to a week\-long event \(starting Monday 9 March 2020\), just prior to the first Covid\-19 lockdown, hosted by Unite the Union at Unite House in Holborn \(London\). This event, attended by Unite Executive Council members, included a screening of the film followed by presentations by Jiang and MDWs themselves. Feedback from it noted how the exhibition had raised awareness and also advanced Unite’s own campaign to organize MDWs and achieve equal employment rights. According to the National Officer for the Hospitality Service Sector within Unite the Union: *‘This video will increase awareness and elicit wider support for their campaign to be afforded the same fundamental rights as any other worker’* **\[5\]**. The Unite Assistant General Secretary also writes: *‘This event raised awareness and strengthened union organisation, demonstrating to migrant domestic workers that they are not alone, and that they are supported by the union alongside a wide alliance of organisations and individuals.*’ Furthermore, she notes how: *‘The film has played, and is playing, a vital role in union campaigning with migrant domestic workers...supporting union organising...and bringing together all those who want to make change’* **\[5\]**. The impact of Jiang’s work in helping to empower and mobilize MDWs is further acknowledged by a spokesperson for the Trades Union Congress, who states: *'Allowing domestic workers to tell their stories themselves in her \[Jiang’s\] video starts to give these workers the power to challenge the injustices they have suffered and shows how workers organising in unions has helped to overcome their exploitation’  \[10\]**. Overall, Jiang’s work is significant in helping to broaden the focus of unions which, traditionally, had not sought to recruit and organize marginalized groups such as MDWs. 

 Third, the research directly supported flat organizing by helping to forge new links with non\-traditional actors such as gallery and museum curators who are now supporting the work of VoDW. As the curator from Cubitt Gallery stated: *‘The film brought new audiences and conversations to Cubitt and is a great example of how art can work across and with different communities.’* **\[6\]**. Cubitt gallery and Raven Row gallery have also agreed to provide free venues for VoDW’s meetings and workshop activities in the future. Curator of the Cubitt gallery stated, *“studio spaces have been made available to support the group’s \[VoDW\] ongoing work”* and this *“sharing space at Cubitt is key to developing forms of solidarity and knowledge exchange in relation to work, education, precarity and collective organizing”* **\[6\]**. 

 <ins>Campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system:</ins> Jiang’s research and work on the video has informed and energized a wider campaign led by VoDW, Unite the Union, Kalayaan and Anti\-slavery to reinstate the pre\-2012 Overseas Domestic Worker Visa \(ODW visa\). Before 2012, MDWs were allowed to renew their visa provided that they would be continuously hired as full\-time domestic workers and, after five years, apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventually UK citizenship. However, in 2012, the UK Government removed these rights to renew, greatly increasing the insecurity and vulnerability of MDWs. The campaign to reverse this decision has achieved national media attention, partly as a result of the film and exhibitions that have raised awareness **\[2\]**. Jiang’s survey report, commissioned by VoDW **\[A\]**, provided robust evidence of modern slavery which also directly informed this campaign. Specifically, the exhibitions and film increased politicians’ awareness of the plight of MDWs in the UK. As the EU & Europe manager of Anti\-Slavery International noted, ‘ *The film gives space to individuals to tell their story in their words, with dignity...it is also a homage to all that domestic workers themselves have achieved and continue to fight for’* **\[7\]**. Similarly, the former Labour MP Fiona MacTaggart noted: *‘the wonderful thing about this exhibition and the video…is a very intimate description of the horrible exploitations which so many migrant domestic workers are subjected to. They are forced to a form of slavery which is not acceptable in the UK today. All of us should do more to help them.’* **\[8\]**. 

 As a result of increasing publicity arising from Jiang’s report **\[A\]**, the participatory art project and growing media attention, in late 2019 Jiang was asked to help draft a Parliamentary Briefing to inform MPs and policy makers of the vulnerability and marginality of MDWs in the UK and the problems associated with the current ODW Visa **\[9\]**. This led to Jiang being invited to speak at the campaign launch event hosted and chaired by Labour Party MP Jess Phillips. Originally planned for April 2020 in the House of Commons, this event was postponed due to Covid and finally held, virtually, on 17 November. It was attended by 115 people including MPs and the Prevention Policy lead of the Modern Slavery Unit within the Home Office. Feedback from the meeting further highlighted the impact of Jiang’s work in raising awareness and how this was helping to boost the campaign to reinstate the ODW visa. Jess Phillips \(MP\), for example, remarked: *'It has been incredibly insightful ... we will certainly try to improve the situation which I don't know how anyone who hears this could think it's not wrong.'* **\[10\]** The Policy Officer \(Rights, International, Social and Economics department\) for the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) further commented on how *‘Joyce Jiang's video and research’* not only represented *‘an important resource’* to raise awareness, but also ‘ *supports the TUC's advocacy to change UK law to end the tied overseas domestic workers' visa and end the criminalisation of undocumented workers.'* **\[10\]**. Although this campaign to reinstate the visa was interrupted by the pandemic, it is regaining momentum and political support following the parliamentary event in November. This is due in large part to Jiang’s research and wider public engagement. As the Director of VoDW stated: *''Joyce presented her research findings and video on migrant domestic workers in our online parliamentary event chaired by labour MP Jess Phillips on Nov 17 2020. We have also used Joyce's policy report in our call to action in writing letters to MPs to support the reinstatement of rights of domestic workers. **Joyce's study has significantly improved parliamentarian awareness of the plight of migrant domestic workers in the UK, mobilised wide support and advanced our campaign on the Overseas Domestic Worker visa''** **\[10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Simon Hayhoe’s research at the University of Bath on sensory impairment \(SI\) and informal learning since 2016 has benefitted individuals with sensory impairments and led to impact in the following ways: 

-  **Changes in organisational inclusive practice:** Informing strategic decisions, service developments and improving accessibility at the National Council for the Blind Ireland \(NCBI\); Generating new ways of thinking about and responding to sensory impairment among cultural practitioners; and informing the development of training and specialist guides used by museum professionals across Europe; 

-  **Creating new technologies which enhance cultural experience, understanding and engagement for people with sensory impairment in** cultural and heritage sites across Europe including Museo Thyssen\-Bornemisza, Museo Lázaro Galdiano and Museo de Bellas Artes de Asturias, Spain; Victoria & Albert Museum, UK and KHM\-Museumsverband, Austria. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Museums, art galleries and public art venues offer embodied learning opportunities integral to shaping the experience and consciousness of their participants and visitors. They are crucial, if often unrecognised, informal learning environments. This is particularly the case for people with Sensory Impairment \(e.g. deafness, vision loss, learning disability, mobility or invisible disabilities\) for whom physical access is often curtailed because of building design and display practices, and whose informal learning in such sites is under\-researched. 

 Dr Hayhoe’s body of research since 2000 has focused on developing *philosophical/ theoretical explanations* of the exclusion of people with sensory impairment from sites of informal learning and, from this, how these explanations can be *applied in practice* in interventions which improve access and experience for people with SI. 

 **1. Philosophical, Theoretical and Methodological Contribution** 

 Dr Hayhoe’s research at the University of Bath \(2016 – 2020\) has continued to challenge the dominant philosophical and theoretical conceptualisations of sensory impairment. His research synthesises psychological, social, cultural and medical aspects of disability into an integrated model of informal learning. His research at Bath: 

1.  proposes the need to recognise visual impairment as a spectrum with different intellectual and cultural needs and preferences \(1, 3\); 

1.  demonstrates that visual art is understandable to people born blind, due to a combination of alternative perceptual cues, multi\-sensory development, language, and creative thinking \(4, 5\); and 

1.  challenges the dominant philosophical theory that colour is only understood through direct visual experience \(5\). 

 These philosophical/theoretical insights underpin Dr Hayhoe’s model of inclusive capital, which has informed inclusive practice to improve museum access \(3\). Inclusive capital encompasses dimensions of knowing \(knowledge, ethics\), being \(beliefs, emotions\) and doing \(skills, practices, habits\) and considers how these are shaped via interaction with cultural environments. Practices underpinned by inclusive capital aim to build more inclusive ways of knowing, being and doing to ameliorate the exclusionary conditions people with SI suffer in mainstream society. 

 Dr Hayhoe’s model of inclusive capital, and the inclusive practice it aims to foster, led to the development of a novel methodology – Grounded Methodology – which was embedded into the participatory research approaches and practices of the EU Horizon 2020 project Accessible Resources for Cultural Heritage EcoSystems \(ARCHES\), 2016–2020, EUR3,838,158 \(Hayhoe: PI Bath\). ARCHES was one of the largest EU funded projects to focus on disability and access; its aim was to make art and culture accessible for all across Europe. It involved five national and one local museum \(see Section 4\), four technology companies specialising in inclusion \(VRVis, SignTime, Coprix, Tree Logic\), two universities \(the University of Bath and Open University\) and over 200 people with sensory impairments who worked as participatory co\-creators with the researchers to develop inclusionary practices. 

 Dr Hayhoe’s ‘Grounded Methodology’ \(GM\) \(6\) approach, elaborated during ARCHES, advances and adapts Grounded Theory \(GT\) \(Glaser & Strauss, 1967\), widely used in education. GT relies on inductive testable theories. Grounded Methodology, in contrast, provides a more expansive and flexible research approach which generates interpretive deductive theories that evolve through discourse between research partners and collaborators. Allied with Dr Hayhoe’s model of inclusive capital, GM is particularly appropriate for participatory workshops and co\-created research designs which evolve as researchers, practitioners and participants work together on objectives and goals. After ARCHES, Dr Hayhoe has applied GM in the participatory arts\-based project, River is the Venue \(6\). 

 **2. Practice** 

 Dr Hayhoe’s research has been applied in educational inclusion and diversity practice in two ways. First, through changes to the ways in which informal learning spaces, such as museums and public arts venues, enable access and inclusion for people with SI. Dr Hayhoe’s broader conceptualisation of disability inclusion has enhanced practitioners’ understanding regarding how artworks can be appreciated by people with SI and shaped practice on how informal learning spaces can better accommodate their diverse needs \(1, 2, 6\). Second, Dr Hayhoe’s research has broadened practitioners’ understanding of how people with SI experience informal learning opportunities. This has prompted greater awareness amongst practitioners of the diversity of learning experiences by taking into account relations between bodily experience, movement, technology and sensory perception, as a complement to language, for people with SI \(1, 2, 4, 6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1 Changes in organisational inclusive practice** 

 The National Council for the Blind Ireland \(NCBI\), Ireland’s national sight loss agency, provides support to over 8,000 people every year. Dr Hayhoe’s inclusive capital model and grounded methodology approach underpinned recommendations to the NCBI which led to changes in their service provision and training \(A\). Their National Services Manager comments: 

 *“As a result of the research we have established and developed our Older Adults Team whose role is to consider physical and mental health, multiple impairments, older adults’ social needs and end\-of\-life care. The research allowed us to look at our plans for this group as well as benchmark them against similar sized jurisdictions in Europe and North America. This in turn has led to a confidence in setting our priorities for 2019 and going forward into 2020. The research will also underpin our strategic priorities for 2021\-2024. Service gaps and training needs in the staff group have been established and are being addressed*” \(B\). 

 In 2019 NCBI worked with 12% more older adults than in 2018. In 2020 that number has increased further. Their National Services Manager believes that this growth “ *is a direct result of the establishment of the Older Adults Team*” \(B\). 

 The Inclusive Capital model has also led to generating new ways of thinking about, and responding to, sensory impairment among cultural practitioners through the ARCHES project.  The Former Head of Education at the Wallace Collection \(which between April 2018 and March 2019 had 421,700 visits\) notes that Dr Hayhoe’s research has led to a change in practice among museum staff. The design of the ARCHES participatory group workshops, utilising Dr Hayhoe’s “ *participatory methodology and model of inclusive capital \(habits that lead to inclusion\)*” developed participants’ confidence via improved ‘bonding’ \(a key component of the inclusive capital model\), leading to increased participation in the project’s user groups. The participatory \[user\] groups led to “ *significant attitude shifts”* amongst museum practitioners in the Wallace Collection, regarding how they “ *engage people with disabilities”*. This shift entailed “ *focus\[ing\] on what people’s access preferences are rather than their disability”* \(C\). 

 These participatory \[user\] groups also led to further changes within the museums including: 

-  Changes to the Wallace Collection’s website to improve accessibility leading to changes in colours, contrast levels, fonts sizing and speech recognition \(D\); 

-  Improvements “ *at the V&A Dundee and the Museum of Childhood, as part of the redesign of galleries*” \(H\); 

-  Development of new guidelines on “ *exhibition access guidelines*” and discussions on ethics led to creation of “ *new Disability Terminology Guidelines*” at the V&A \(H\); 

-  Informed development of a sensorially\-inclusive tour on KHM\-Museumsverband’s website \(D\) and videos on “ *access at the Wallace and V&A*” \(H\). 

 The Former Head of the Wallace Collection states that Dr Hayhoe’s model of inclusive capital also “fed directly into the ARCHES museum guide, *Towards a Participatory Museum: A How\-to\-Guide on Inclusive Activities”* \(2019\), and that “ *museum practitioners find it very useful*” \(C\). The guide \(I\) was published in English, German and Spanish and by February 2021 it had been downloaded from the ARCHES website nearly 1,000 times \(G\). 

 Between 2017 and 2019 ARCHES workshops using aspects of inclusive capital approaches to participatory practice were rolled out across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Slovenia and Croatia, providing training to more than 200 museum professionals. 600 printed copies of the Museum guide were distributed at these events \(G\). 

 **4.2 Creating new technologies which enhance cultural experience, understanding and engagement for people with sensory impairment** 

 The technological outputs of the ARCHES project were developed using a novel participatory research approach informed by Dr Hayhoe’s grounded methodology. The project developed several technological solutions including an interactive computer station using tactile reliefs as well as multisensory and fully accessibility features. This computer station is called “Please Touch\!” and was developed as an on\-site installation for the 6 participating museums: Museo Thyssen\-Bornemisza, Museo Lázaro Galdiano, Museo de Bellas Artes de Asturias, Victoria & Albert Museum, The Wallace Collection and KHM\-Museumsverband. A further 9 reliefs have been ordered for other museums. *Please Touch\!* won the Heritage in Motion award for apps and interactivity in 2020, commended by judges as “ *empowering, creative and exemplary*” \(E\). 

 The project also led to the development of apps that guide visitors, through ARCHES partner museums, that are available in English, German and Spanish on Google Play and the Apple Store \(F\). 

 These changes in organisational practices and novel technological applications have produced clear and demonstrable benefits **for individuals with sensory impairment.** They have led to profound changes in the informal learning of individuals with SI and they attest to the importance of being listened to. A member of the ARCHES participatory groups asserted that “ *It’s important to allow us, the disabled people, to explain what we need because … people \[who are not disabled\] cannot imagine that*”; another fed back that the project was “ *absolutely fantastic*” because “ *everybody needs to be able to go to other museums and not worry about being able to understand what’s going on there*” \(G\). 

 The former Head of Education at the Wallace collection affirmed that "" *the practices of participatory methodology and model of inclusive capital \(habits that lead to inclusion\) that you \[Hayhoe\] developed as part of the ARCHES, and in co\-creation with the members of the participatory Group, underpinned the growing confidence of participants with disabilities*” \(C\). The Equality and Access Advisor at the Victoria and Albert \(V&A\) Museum also noted how Dr Hayhoe enabled participants to “ *try something new*” and "" *creating artworks and even help\[ing\] in other museums*” \(H\). 16 ARCHES participants went on to gain awards, training and jobs in the field of cultural heritage \(G\). 

 Since then, the ARCHES project has been nominated as 1 of 10 finalists for the Horizon 2020 impact award \(J\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Leeds researchers have identified 109 genes which, when mutated, cause a range of clinical disorders including: developmental brain disorders, ciliopathies, renal and liver disease, immunodeficiency, cancer, and blindness. Linking the encoded proteins to inherited diseases has been key to genetics laboratories around the world developing new diagnostic technologies, and national and international screening programmes being implemented. In turn, this has resulted in thousands of diagnostic, carrier, and prenatal tests \- enabling early diagnosis, better clinical management, and improved outcomes for patients. The understanding gained has underpinned successful clinical trials of novel therapies. Importantly, the work has led directly to better counselling and prenatal screening for families.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Seven per cent of the UK population, roughly 3.5 million people, live with a ‘rare disease’. Over 6,000 rare diseases have been documented, of which around 80% have a genetic component. Twenty years ago genetic testing was only possible in a handful of cases, but a revolution in human genetics technology has led to a huge increase in our understanding of the genetic basis of these conditions, with researchers from Leeds playing a world\-leading role. 

 To address the huge clinical need to diagnose rare inherited disease for effective counselling and, in particular, tackle the specific local healthcare burden of rare recessive disease, researchers from the University of Leeds harnessed the power of genomics to accelerate the diagnostic process. In collaboration with families and clinical staff, researchers in Leeds identified more than 100 genes mutated in different inherited diseases. 

 Exemplars of our research include discovering the role of nucleic acid intermediates in causing the inherited encephalopathy Aicardi\-Goutiere syndrome \(AGS\) **\[1\]**; finding that mutations in the *PMS2* gene \(which are difficult to detect due to sequence overlap with many pseudogenes\) underlie a range of cancer syndromes, and identifying a number of other genes mutated in cancer **\[2\]**; determining the importance of primary cilia in health and disease **\[3\]**; identifying a series of genes involved in determining human brain size, neuronal development, and neuronal homeostasis **\[4,5\];** identifying 10% of all the genes known to be mutated in inherited retinal dystrophy \(IRD\), as well as genes involved in glaucoma and corneal dystrophies **\[6\]**. 

 Autosomal dominant and X\-linked conditions can often be solved through family studies, while the trio sequencing approach has proved a powerful technique for identifying *de novo* dominant variants, which account for approximately 40% of children with developmental delay. Leeds has used all of these approaches, but a particular focus for our research has been on autosomal recessive conditions. Our epidemiological investigations in the local Pakistani heritage community demonstrated conclusively, <ins>for the first time</ins><ins>,</ins> a doubling of the risk of congenital disorders, due to the practice of consanguinity. This heightened risk results in an increase in autosomal recessive disorders. These risks were most recently highlighted in the 2016 Chief Medical Officer’s report,  [*Generation Genome*](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chief-medical-officer-annual-report-2016-generation-genome). 

 The many earlier diagnoses made possible by these discoveries have meant earlier intervention \- which saves lives \- as well as enabling informed counselling for patients and their families. These discoveries have provided novel insights into disease pathogenesis, and resulted in the description of novel clinical syndromes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Worldwide, rare diseases affect 3.5–5.9% of the population, equivalent to around 300 million people. In the UK this figure is higher, with around 3.5 million people \(7% of the population\) affected. Babies and children are most likely to be affected, with as many as 30% of those who have a rare disease dying before their fifth birthday **.** Our research has identified 109 genes which, when mutated, cause diverse rare human conditions. This has resulted in laboratories across Europe screening for these genes, the identification of these genes on the UK national test directory, and the successful completion of clinical trials involving these genes **\[A\]**. 

 **Influencing new diagnostic technologies and screening programmes worldwide** 

 Our research has had a profound impact on the development of new diagnostic technologies, and on national and international screening programmes globally. The Orphanet website **\[B\]** lists the European Medical Laboratories that provide diagnostic tests for specified genes or diseases. If we take the representative genes that were highlighted in section 3, Orphanet shows that *SAMHD1* was tested in 54 laboratories, *PMS2* was tested in 183 laboratories, *HEATR2* in 7 laboratories, *MICU1* in 15 laboratories, *CCND2* in 11 laboratories, and *DRAM2* in 11 laboratories. Other notable genes implicated in disease by our researchers and widely screened by European laboratories include *CEP290* \(142 laboratories\), *TMEM67* \(93 laboratories\), and *LRP5* \(86 laboratories\). 

 Commercial sensitivities mean that the precise number of tests cannot be calculated, but we surveyed 134 European genetic testing laboratories, which allowed us to estimate that <ins>over 50,000 tests were carried out in 2019 in Europe alone for genes implicated through our research</ins> **\[C\]**. 

 The worldwide figure is likely to be much higher, and major genetic sequencing companies globally are testing for genes associated with disease through our research. For example, the Illumina sequencing company \(revenue USD3,543 million in 2019\) included the genes *TET2* and *PMS2* in their widely used Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 NGS assay launched in 2018 **\[D\]**. The world\-renowned geneticist and President of US company ‘PreventionGenetics’, said: 

 *“Tests for all of the genes listed \[SAMHD1*, *PMS2*, *ASPM*, *TMEM67*, *NMNAT1\] are on our test menu…. We have identified many patients who carry pathogenic variants in these genes”* **\[E\_i\]**. 

 The Director of Spanish biotechnology company, Sistemas Genómicos, said: 

 *“These genes are crucial in genetic diagnosis, and in our experience, fundamental in this field due to the relatively high number of patients suffering from these genetic conditions. Specifically, in the oncogenetics area, the study of PMS2 is very important….During the year 2019, we carried out 568 genetic analyses, which included this gene. Some of these studies confirmed the suspected clinical diagnosis, which allowed offering \[sic\] an adequate genetic counselling and appropriate medical management to the patient and their families”* **\[E\_ii\]**. 

 The extent of the impact can also be seen within government documentation on commissioning of genetic tests. For example, the UK National Genomic Test Directory specifies which genomic tests are commissioned by the NHS in England, and lists a core set of genes that must be tested in NHS laboratories. Ninety eight of the genes associated with rare diseases by our researchers since 2000 are on the UK list **\[F\]**, which features a total of 5851 genes \(i.e. we have contributed 1.67% of identified genes\). The President of the UK Clinical Genetics Society, confirmed that: 

 *“The over one hundred genes linked to human inherited diseases by researchers in Leeds are screened regularly in laboratories across the UK to support clinical diagnosis for patients”* **\[E\_iii\]**. 

 The Clinical Lead for the DECIPHER and the Deciphering Developmental Disorders project based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, acknowledged that: 

 *“tests for dozens of genes linked to human inherited diseases by researchers in Leeds…. account for a significant and important contribution to our diagnostic yield”* **\[E\_iv\]**. 

 The impact of our research is further evidenced by its influence within major genomics projects. For example, the 100,000 Genomes Project, completed in 2018, sequenced 100,000 whole human genomes from patients with rare diseases and their families, and patients with common cancers. The Clinical Director of Genomics England, confirmed that the genes we identified: 

 *“accounted for a significant proportion* *of activity across the 100,000 Genomes Project*” **\[E\_v\]**. 

 The co\-lead investigator of the Scottish Genomes partnership said that: 

 “*The many rare disease genes discovered by researchers in Leeds played a key role in helping to understand causes, diagnosis and potential treatments for such inherited diseases”* **\[E\_vi\]**. 

 **New understanding underpins clinical trials of novel therapies** 

 The genetic research findings from Leeds have allowed clinicians to compare patients from different centres who have variants in a single gene. This has guided clinical decision\-making, as well as the novel research insights informing clinical trial design. Examples include drug trials in patients with *TREX1* and *PLA2G6* mutations; personalised medicine approaches and drug trials for specific cancer subgroups \(including *PMS2* and *TET2* mutation carriers\); *CEP290* variants targeted by antisense oligo therapy; a vaccine targeting cells over\-expressing TBXT to treat certain tumour types; drug, dietary and physiotherapy approaches being tested in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia \(PCD\) patients; and the use of anti\-ADAM9 antibodies as a tumour therapy **\[G\]**. For example, a clinical trial of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD, caused by mutations in six of the genes implicated through Leeds research, showed this halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations **\[H\]**. In addition, our research on AGS, caused by mutations in *SAMHD1* and four other genes \(all identified by Leeds researchers\) led directly to a clinical trial of the drug baricitinib, which proved effective in improving neurologic outcomes in patients **\[I\]**. 

 **Improved health and wellbeing through diagnosis, counselling and better treatment** 

 Discovery of the 109 genes through research at the University of Leeds has enabled early diagnosis, better management, and improved outcomes for patients, and better counselling and prenatal screening for families. The importance of this impact was highlighted by inherited retinal dystrophy \(IRD\) patients \(19 genes implicated through Leeds research\) who reported that they strongly supported the provision of publicly funded genetic testing. The IRD patients valued the greater understanding and knowledge about the genetic basis of their condition, and valued the resulting early access to emerging therapies. The patients also reported benefits to family members and future generations, as well as to society in general **\[J\]**. 

 Our research has also allowed charities to support families living with rare conditions. According to the CEO of Unique \(a charity supporting people with rare chromosome and gene disorders\): 

 *“The \[Leeds\] research has provided important insights that directly benefit those affected by genetic mutations. In particular, the discovery that blindness is due to mutations in splicing factors PRPF8 and 3, the identified relationship between retinal vascular disease and TSPAN12 variants, and the finding of diverse immunological phenotypes due to CARD11 mutations has allowed a genetic diagnosis to be made – diagnoses which directly improve the quality of life for affected individuals within the UK and throughout the world”* **\[E\_vii\]**. 

 The CEO of Cerebra, a charity that helps children with genetic brain conditions, said: 

 *“….the fundamental genetics research at the University of Leeds has led to improvements in genetic identification that have significantly improved the lives of our members and have given them and us new hope for the future….. This new understanding allows our members to obtain a genetic diagnosis, which gives them a much better idea of what the future holds for them, something in which we and they place great value. It also gives information about risk for other family members and future generations, is the first step towards better treatments and new therapies and is an essential prerequisite for recruitment to clinical trials”* **\[E\_viii\]**. 

 The CEO of Retina UK, a patient\-led charity supporting people with retinal diseases, confirmed: 

 *“the Leeds Vision Research Group has played a world\-leading role in the drive towards a genetic diagnosis for everybody with inherited retinal disease. Knowledge of their genotype is something our members value very highly indeed, since it is the essential first step in the journey towards understanding their condition and accessing the best possible treatment”* **\[E\_ix\]**. 

 The Board of the Ciliopathy Alliance have recognised the vital importance of the Leeds research and the impact it has had on families affected by ciliopathies: 

 *“Leeds geneticists have excelled over the past 10 years, identifying over 100 genes linked to inherited diseases. These include 29 genes that, when mutated, cause ciliopathies. This is a huge contribution to the worldwide human genetics revolution from a single centre. Linking genes with inherited diseases means patients and their families can plan their lives knowing how their condition is likely to progress and what risk it poses to relatives”* **\[E\_x\]**. 

 The impact of this research is best expressed by the patients who benefit from the findings. For example, a patient with VEXAS syndrome \(due to a somatic mutation in *UBA1*\) wrote that: 

 *“For four years I have battled with a progressive illness… Last year I was told that I was unlikely to survive more than another 6\-12 months, and to complete a DNR Form, write my will, etc. It therefore came as a massive relief to discover at the end of last year that your team had described a syndrome that exactly matched my own illness…. I feel that my symptoms are benefiting from a combination of steroids and a monoclonal antibody”* **\[K\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by the University of Oxford has changed the way that men with prostate cancer are diagnosed are treated. Two large, linked, multi\-centre randomised clinical trials assessed the effectiveness of screening and treatment for prostate cancer. These studies demonstrated that a prostate cancer screening programme using a single PSA \(prostate\-specific antigen\) blood test offers no survival benefits, but causes over\-detection of indolent cancers and potential harm due to over\-treatment. 

 The combined outcomes of the ProtecT \(<ins> **Pro**</ins>state <ins> **te**</ins>sting for **c**ancer and <ins> **T**</ins>reatment\) and CAP \(<ins> **C**</ins>lustered r<ins> **A**</ins>ndomised trial of PSA testing for <ins> **P**</ins>rostate Cancer\) trials have led to major changes in policy and guidelines globally, including NICE, US and European guidelines all recommending more active monitoring to reduce harmful non\-beneficial interventions. As a result of these studies, and changes to the guidelines, men are able to make informed choices about whether to undertake PSA testing in the first place, to understand the potential significant harms and assess the risk/benefit of treatment. This has, for example, resulted in over\-treatment falling from 12% in 2016 to 4% in 2018 in the UK. 

 The research has also provided evidence necessary to prevent the implementation of a non\-beneficial PSA screening programme, which in the UK has avoided 10,000,000 more PSA tests and 1,400,000 biopsies, delivered an estimated cost saving to the NHS of GBP1,000,000,000 per year and prevented the resulting physical and mental harms to men.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The ProtecT trial is a large\-scale, collaborative RCT, spanning twenty years, beginning in 1999 as a feasibility study; the main trial started in 2002 and will end March 2022, to enable extended 15\-year follow\-up. The trial was designed to test the treatment effectiveness and cost effectiveness of active monitoring, surgery or radiotherapy in clinically localised prostate cancer detected through screening, with a primary endpoint of prostate cancer specific mortality at 10 years. Hamdy led the trial as Chief Principal Investigator \(University of Sheffield until 2008, then University of Oxford from 2008 \- present\), together with Co\-Principal Investigators J Donovan \(University of Bristol\) and D Neal \(University of Cambridge, then University of Oxford from 2015 \- 2019\). 

 Hamdy moved to the University of Oxford in October 2008, bringing the role of Chief Principal Investigator with him to Oxford; the underpinning research for the impact claimed began at this point and focuses on the follow\-up phase of the study. The full RCT completed recruitment in January 2009, with 111,000 men recruited, and 82,429 tested. The 10\-year median follow\-up milestone was reached in November 2015, when the data were unblinded. During the subsequent 6 month period the statistical analysis was conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Bristol, and interpretation of the results and determination of findings was led by Hamdy at Oxford. This research led to two papers describing primary and secondary endpoints \[1, 2\]. The research showed that cancer deaths occurred at very low rates \(approximately 1%\), irrespective of the treatment allocated; all\-cause mortality was also low at approximately 10% with no differences between the arms; radical treatments reduced disease progression and metastases by approximately 50% compared with active monitoring; and surgery and radiotherapy were equivalent in oncological outcomes, but had different side\-effect profiles \[1, 2\]. 

 Further statistical analysis demonstrated that although surgery and radical treatment reduced metastasis and progression compared with active monitoring \(AM\), there were negative impacts on sexual, urinary, and bowel functioning. In addition, radical treatments may be associated with lower prostate cancer mortality than AM, although the numbers of such deaths were low irrespective of treatment. More than 95 out of every 100 men with low or intermediate risk localised prostate cancer do not die of prostate cancer within 10 years, irrespective of whether treatment is by means of monitoring, surgery, or radiotherapy. The research showed that there was a trade\-off between the side effects on sexual function and urinary continence, which are better after active monitoring, against the risks of spreading of prostate cancer \[3\]. 

 The cohort study of men undergoing prostate biopsy in the ProtecT study showed that 1.3% required hospital admission and 10.4% consultation with a doctor because of post\-biopsy symptoms including pain, fever, and blood in urine, faeces and ejaculate \[4\]. 

 In the ProtecT study, GP practices from 9 UK centres were randomised to either the ProtecT intervention \(which consisted of an invitation to PSA testing in men aged 50 \- 69 years\) or routine NHS practice \(where PSA testing is very low in the UK\). This created a natural control arm with the practices which were not randomised to ProtecT. This allowed ProtecT to become the intervention arm of the CAP study of prostate cancer screening, with Hamdy as a joint PI, the largest randomised controlled trial of screening for prostate cancer worldwide, using a single PSA test, with 415,357 participants. After a median follow up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the group of men invited to screening and the control group, but an increase in the number of low\-risk prostate cancers detected. The research also showed that in addition to the 2,965 men diagnosed through ProtecT, the diagnostic pathway missed the diagnosis of 1,433 cases, of whom 188 men died of prostate cancer. This confirmed that the worldwide conventional diagnostic pathway of PSA testing followed by biopsies was inadequate and missed too many lethal cancers \[5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Screening and management of PSA\-detected prostate cancer has been a controversial healthcare topic globally.  Cancer Research UK estimates that there are approximately 48,500 new cases of prostate cancer each year in the UK, and the American Cancer Society estimates that there are approximately 191,930 new cases each year in the US. 

 Opportunistic PSA testing in asymptomatic men has led to early detection and drives subsequent radical treatments that were intended to improve quantity and quality of life of these men, but are associated with a risk of significant adverse side\-effects. Prior to the initiation of the ProtecT trial, studies in the UK \(British Association of Urological Surgeons\) and US \(Department of Veterans Affairs\) showed that over 90% of men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer received radical treatment, mostly in the form of radical prostatectomy. 

 The Oxford research \[1 – 5\] provided a powerful evidence base for the effectiveness of screening and treatments, highlighting how the harms of screening and treatment can outweigh the benefits. This has informed practice changes globally, reflected in global NICE, US and European guidelines recommending more active monitoring to reduce harmful non\-beneficial interventions allowing clinicians and individuals to benefit by making better decisions about care. 

####  Changes to global clinical guidance and policy 

 The NICE guideline on Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management published in May 2019 \[Ai\] describes and references the ProtecT trial in detail and appends a presentation given by Hamdy and Donovan \(Oct 2018\), which cites \[1, 2 and 5\] to the evidence considered by NICE \[Aii\]. The research informed the NICE guidelines as follows: 

-  Citing \[2\], NICE recommends active surveillance be offered as an option to people with low\-risk localised prostate cancer: “ *Based on the evidence from the ProtecT trial \(Donovan et al., 2016\), the choice of active surveillance, prostatectomy or radiotherapy appears to be a trade\-off between the benefits offered by prostatectomy and radiotherapy against their potential risk of side effects…….. Based on this evidence, the committee decided that all three treatment options may be suitable for different people and therefore agreed to keep the existing recommendation to offer active surveillance as an option to people with low\-risk localised prostate cancer*” \[Aii\] 

-  Based on \[2\], NICE kept the recommendation that the progression to radical treatment should be based on the man’s personal preferences. Side\-effect profiles extracted from and referring to ProtecT analysis are listed in the guidance \[Ai\]. 

 The US Preventive Services Task Force changed its policy for prostate cancer screening from a D \(“Discourage the use of this service”\) recommendation in 2011, to a C recommendation \(“Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual Circumstances”\) in 2018 for men aged 55 \- 69 years, largely based on outcomes from the ProtecT and CAP trials. The cited Oxford research that showed no significant improvement in all\-cause or prostate cancer mortality in any of the treatment groups \[1, 5\] and the analysis of surgery and radical treatment vs. active monitoring \[3\] is cited in the policy. The “ *change in recommendation grade further reflects new evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low\-risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk  of subsequent harms from screening*.”  The guidelines go on to elaborate that “ *the decision to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one*” and “ *before deciding whether to be screened, men aged 55 to 69 years should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision*”. \[B\] 

 The European Association of Urology prostate cancer guidelines published in 2019, refer to the ProtecT Study research \[1\] on describing Active Surveillance \(AS\) / Active Monitoring \(AM\)  thus:  “ *…, the ProtecT study has reinforced the role of deferred active treatment \(i.e. either AS or some form of initial AM\) as a feasible alternative to active curative interventions for patients with low\-grade and low\-stage disease*” and that *“AS should be the default management strategy in patients with low\-risk disease and a life expectancy > 10 years”* \[C\]. 

####  Financial savings to healthcare providers 

 The NHS and other healthcare providers have benefitted from costs and resources avoided by not implementing a regular PSA test\-based screening platform. A UK options appraisal \[D\] found that annual screening would result in almost 10,000,000 more PSA tests per year and 1,400,000 biopsies and, therefore, a large increase in many resources would be required \(e.g. GP nurse sessions, PSA tests, radical treatments, hormone treatment, outpatient appointments\). Total additional lifetime costs for a cohort of men aged 50 of a screen\-once policy at 50 were estimated as GBP50,000,000, rising to almost GBP1,000,000,000 for an annual screening policy in the UK \[D\]. The clinical costs of screening in the UK, without administrative costs, were estimated to be GBP600,000,000 to GBP1,700,000,000 per year \[E\]. 

 In November 2020, the UK National Screening Committee \(UK NSC\) completed its first periodic review since 2016 and concluded that a screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK was not recommended, for reasons including the harms caused and no single better treatment for early\-stage disease \[H\].  The evidence document included numerical data from the ProtecT trial and cited \[1\] and \[2\] as part of the 2019 NICE review for NG131 \[A\]. 

####  Health benefits to patients 

 The high\-quality evidence from ProtecT enables men to make properly\-informed choices about testing and, for those with clinically localised prostate cancer, to decide on the balance between the benefits and side\-effect profiles of radical treatments. 

 The cohort study of men undergoing prostate biopsy in the ProtecT study showed that 1.3% required hospital admission and 10.4% consultation with a doctor because of post\-biopsy adverse symptoms including pain, fever, and blood in urine, faeces and ejaculate \[4\]. Among the two\-thirds of men who received a negative or inconclusive biopsy result as part of ProtecT, around 20% reported high distress persisting up to 12 weeks \[F\]. By contributing to the evidence base used by policy makers to decide not to put screening in place, the Oxford research has helped avoid 1,400,000 biopsies per year \[D\] and subsequent harms avoided e.g. an estimated 18,200 men requiring hospital admission, 145,600 men suffering post\-biopsy adverse symptoms and 184,800 men suffering high distress, per year. 

 The National Prostate Cancer Audit \(NPCA\) assesses the quality of services in England and Wales, and aimed to reduce over\-treatment of men with low\-risk prostate cancer, by auditing the percentage of men with low\-risk prostate cancer receiving radical treatment. In 2016, the rate of over\-treatment was 12%, and NPCA authors cited \[1\] and commented: *“the proportion of men with low\-risk disease being potentially ‘over\-treated’ is an area of concern, especially given the recent publication of the ProtecT study”* \[Gi\]. In the 2 years after the publication of the main ProtecT study clinical outcomes, over\-treatment reduced by two\-thirds \(from 12% to 8% in 2017 \[Gii\], and to 4% in 2018 \[Giii\]\). In 2017, the NPCA noted that *“the trend seen towards a reduction in men with low\-risk disease being “potentially over\-treated” is encouraging”* and suggested that the results of studies such as \[1\] were being disseminated into national practice \[Gii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Richard Schoch’s archival and practice\-based research on Restoration Shakespeare—the radical adaptations of Shakespeare written between 1660 and 1710—has generated significant cultural impact by collaborating and engaging with three communities of non\-academic beneficiaries: theatre companies, theatre artists, and audiences. In partnership with the Folger Shakespeare Library/Theatre \(USA\) and Shakespeare’s Globe \(UK\), Schoch’s research has influenced artistic programming at major classical theatres, pioneered a successful new model for scholar\-artist collaboration, created unique audience experiences, inspired a ‘critics debate’ in a major USA newspaper, and generated substantial revenue. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Schoch is a scholar\-artist with expertise in theatre historiography and Shakespeare in performance. His monograph *Writing the History of the British Stage* \[1\]—the first on British theatre historiography—traces the practice of theatre history from its origins in the Restoration to its emergence as an academic discipline in the 20th century. The Restoration figures centrally in the monograph’s primary sources, research questions, and findings because the Restoration was a unique moment: theatrical activity resumed after 18 years of state oppression, a pattern of trauma and healing that inspired the theatre to reflect on its own history. 

 Schoch’s analysis is anchored in readings of theatre histories written during the Restoration: Flecknoe, ‘Short Discourse’; Langbaine, *English Dramatick Poets*; Wright, *Historia Histrionica*; and Downes, *Roscius Anglicanus*. Close readings led to research questions on the Restoration’s historiographical importance: \(i\) Why did British theatre history begin in the Restoration? \(ii\) How did Restoration theatre understand itself as part of a historical process encompassing rupture and restitution? \(iii\) How did Restoration theatre use Shakespeare to negotiate its relationship to its own past? 

 Schoch’s findings emphasize the Restoration theatre’s insistent historical consciousness: \(i\) British theatre history began in the Restoration because that was when the theatre needed to interpret its own experience of suppression and resurrection; \(ii\) Restoration theatre practice, for all its innovation, was deeply committed to historical continuity; and \(iii\) rewriting Shakespeare provided Restoration theatre with the perfect balance of continuity and change. 

 Extending his archival findings through practice\-based investigations, Schoch subsequently led research teams to analyse how Restoration theatre’s commitment to both continuity and innovation was quintessentially expressed in its multimedia adaptations of Shakespeare. The teams comprised scholars \(theatre historians, Shakespeareans, musicologists\) and artists \(actors, singers, instrumentalists\) who undertook archival study, ran workshops and created public performances, all designed to explore Restoration Shakespeare as a performance genre and to test its appeal for audiences today. 

 The first of these projects took place in 2014 when Schoch co\-led \(with Amanda Winkler, Syracuse University\) a team which rehearsed scenes from Davenant’s *Macbeth* and Gildon’s *Measure for Measure* in a Folger Shakespeare Library/Theatre workshop. For this workshop, Schoch contributed as stage director and theatre historian, and Winkler as musical director and historical musicologist. In January 2017, a team led by Schoch embarked on a larger project, ‘Performing Restoration Theatre’, which was funded by the AHRC. This project also involved Amanda Winkler \(Syracuse University\) as International Co\-Investigator and Claude Fretz \(Queen’s University Belfast\) as a Research Assistant.  Scholars and artists from the UK, USA, Ireland, Canada and Belgium were also involved in the research process. 

 In both 2017 and 2019, the team rehearsed and publicly performed scenes from the Shadwell\-Dryden\-Davenant *The Tempest* in the Wanamaker Playhouse in collaboration with the Globe. In 2018, the same team partnered with the Folger on a full production of Davenant’s *Macbeth*, a research process captured in documentary videos \[3\]. The team rebalanced current scholarship by interrogating Restoration Shakespeare as complex theatrical experiences possessing their own artistic integrity. Through iterative creative practice, they developed a unique model of intensive scholar\-artist collaboration that used contemporary rehearsal and performance to better understand the demands that Restoration Shakespeare makes on artists today. In so doing, they challenged dominant ‘Original Practices’ methods that reinstate ‘period’ style \[2\]. 

 By demonstrating the appeal of Restoration Shakespeare to artists and audiences today, Schoch’s research led organically to impact described herein: Folger Theatre’s production of Restoration *Macbeth* \(2018\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Schoch’s research has achieved significant impact in the United States and in the UK: influencing programming at three US theatre companies, implementing a new model of scholar\-artist collaboration, providing unique audience experiences, inspiring national media coverage, and generating substantial revenue. 

 **Impact on repertoire and theatre revenue** 

 Schoch’s research inspired and enabled a major international theatre company *—*the Folger Theatre, Washington, DC *—*to perform Restoration Shakespeare for the first time in its fifty\-year history. Folger Theatre is the arts division of the Folger Shakespeare Library, the world’s preeminent Shakespeare collection. As a Folger Institute Committee member, Schoch persuaded the Folger to produce Restoration Shakespeare and to use scholar\-artist collaboration in the 2014 workshop \(Folger\-funded\) and 2018 *Macbeth* production \(Folger/AHRC\-funded\) \[a\]. *Macbeth* generated $300K in box\-office income. This was higher than usual for the Folger because the production achieved a capacity of 120% as opposed to Folger’s average capacity of 95% \[f\]. In addition, in 2016, the Kennedy Center in Washington DC and the Napa Shakespeare company in California jointly produced Restoration *Measure for Measure*, starring Derek Jacobi. Program notes reference Schoch’s 2014 workshop as the inspiration \[b\]. 

 **Impact on the creative process, staging and artists** 

 *Macbeth* successfully pioneered a new collaborative model by having a scholarly team embedded in the full rehearsal process, a new practice for the Folger. In an interview with the *Broadway World* theatre website *,* the production’s director, Robert Richmond, summed up the experience of working with the research team and with the Folger Consort musical ensemble which was also involved in the production: 

 The international team of scholars collaborating with us throughout the production process offers a unique and historic opportunity for the Folger Shakespeare Library,  [Folger Theatre](https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Folger-Theatre/), and Folger Consort to come together on a scale that has never been done before … I, along with our extraordinary creative team, have been working to uncover the dynamics of the unique structure of the original Restoration performance and to make the play as exciting for a modern American audience as it was for Londoners in the 1660's.\[g\] 

 Robert Richmond further reflected on the creative process with the research team in an interview with the DCTheatreScene.com website: 

 I think the collaboration has created something that no sort of auteur could ever come up with; we spark off of each other. It’s great. It’s really exciting. \[i\] 

 Schoch’s research influenced how Richmond—who had no experience with Restoration Shakespeare—staged *Macbeth*. Using primary sources, Schoch articulated Restoration aesthetics that integrated music and drama. This understanding led to staging that blended singing, music and acting. Schoch’s dramaturgical analysis revealed that the adaptation’s new scenes created character conflicts not in Shakespeare’s version. This led to extra rehearsal time for those scenes, ensuring the adaptation’s distinctiveness was preserved. Using period iconography, Schoch explained scenic effects in Restoration playhouses. This knowledge resulted in designs that deconstructed Restoration changeable scenery \[a, d, e\]. Reflecting on the ‘unique’ \[23:36\] and ‘rewarding’ \[21:55\] experience of directing Restoration Shakespeare, Richmond observed that although he began by ‘knowing nothing about \[it\]’ \[0:36\], scholarly ‘expertise, historical knowledge and detailed thinking’ \[30:55\] enabled him to ‘creat\[e\]’ a work of ‘total theatre’ \[24:58\] \[c\]. 

 Across practice\-based events at the Globe and Folger, 72 artists benefited from scholar\-artist collaboration. None of the 35 *Macbeth* artists had performed Restoration Shakespeare previously or worked on a production that embedded scholars in all rehearsals \[e\]. Artists deepened their knowledge of Restoration Shakespeare. In a further interview about the production on the DCTheatreScene.com website, the actor, Ian Merrill Peakes, reflected on his experience of acting Macbeth in the production and of working with the research team: 

 … we’re trying to honor the Restoration period, and we have the scholars in the room, and we are all sort of discovering it together, which is fun. \[j\] 

 **Impact on public awareness and understanding** 

 The sold\-out *Macbeth* production was seen by more than 6,300 people, who furthered their learning through a program essay \(Schoch, co\-author\) which was issued to audience members free of charge \[f\]. Because Restoration Shakespeare is now rarely performed, the production gave audiences a unique experience, affirmed in *The Washington Post*'s review of the production which hailed it as a ‘world premiere of sorts’ and said it offered a ‘rare glimpse of a nearly forgotten performance style’ \[g\]. On the TheatreBloom.com website, the reviewer, Claudia Bach stated: 

 This production is unmissable. There is no more efficient way to state it than that. Never before, to Folger’s knowledge, has Davenant’s *Macbeth* been staged, and it is unlikely to be a popular choice in the future given that precedent. The opportunity to experience not only a stunning production, but a once\-in\-a\-lifetime chance to experience Restoration English theater as it might have been, cannot be passed up. \[k\] 

 Audience survey evidence testifies to the extent to which the production created a new audience for Restoration Shakespeare, expanded the knowledge of audience members, and changed their perceptions. 198 individuals \(8% response rate of total audience\) completed the survey which was designed by the research team but administered by the Folger Theatre \[h\]. Three\-quarters \(75%\) of the respondents said they had had little \(32%\) or no \(43%\) knowledge of Restoration Shakespeare prior to seeing the production. More than four\-fifths \(83%\) said they had gained a better understanding of Restoration Shakespeare. One Shakespeare afficionado commented: 

 I found it singularly enjoyable to get ""more"" from characters I'd seen so often before. I was worried that it might be jarring to hear new words in their mouths, but it really just felt like an extension or opening\-up of what I'd already seen and loved about Shakespeare. \[h\] 

 The production also prompted a desire to find out more about Restoration Shakespeare and to see further, similar productions. Nearly half \(46%\) of the respondents said they wanted to learn more about Restoration theatre, while a similar proportion \(48%\) said they would like to see more Restoration productions if they had the opportunity. Comments included the following: 

 I wish I could see it again. It took me a little while to get into it, but then at the end, it took me a little while to get out of it. Stepping onto the streets of Washington made me realize, once again, how the political intrigues are alive and not so well, so Macbethian. I am glad I saw it. Thank you. 

 I'm keen to go learn more about Davenant and the thought that went into adapting Shakespeare for the Restoration. I wonder how much of the effort going into adapting Macbeth was about re\-educating the public to remind them that murdering a king was big no\-no\! \[h\] 

 A much wider public gained opportunities to learn about Restoration Shakespeare through national media coverage, Folger engagement, and documentary videos. *The Washington Post* ran a feature article on the production \(for which Schoch was interviewed\) and reviewed it through a first\-ever ‘critics debate’ \[g\]. The fact that a major USA newspaper commissioned a feature article and assigned its theatre and classical music critics to ‘debate’ the production testifies to the unusual significance it accorded to the production. Moreover, through its print and digital version, *The Washington Post* reaches a monthly audience of 143.6 million \[g\]. 

 Much coverage explained how Shakespeare was performed in the Restoration, thus maximizing public learning opportunities. Examples of this include both the aforementioned feature article and a separate review of the production on the *Broadway World* theatre news website which, in February 2021, was reaching an audience of more than 4.5 million \[g\]. *Folger Magazine* \(Summer 2019\), disseminated to 20,000 stakeholders, featured an article on the production \[a\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Acute myeloid leukaemia \(AML\) is a common, aggressive and frequently fatal blood cancer. King’s College London has led a programme to develop and implement highly sensitive molecular tests in patients. These allow precise measurement of treatment response and thus allow therapy to be more appropriately tailored to individual patients \(“molecularly guided therapy”\). Our work has \(a\) led to changes in national clinical practice and international treatment guidelines \(b\) reduced the number of patients requiring bone marrow transplant \(a highly toxic and expensive procedure\) \(c\) allowed earlier detection and treatment of relapse, resulting in improved survival and quality of life for patients with this blood cancer and \(d\) paved the way for innovative clinical trials which are likely to further improve survival and quality of life in the future. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 AML is an aggressive form of blood cancer diagnosed in \~3000 individuals each year in the UK and \~18,000 across Europe. Currently, fewer than half of AML patients survive for more than two years after diagnosis: the leading causes of death are disease relapse and side effects of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. King’s ground\-breaking programme of research is focussed on harnessing advanced molecular technologies to develop new diagnostic tools which can provide powerful prognostic information and permit a more personalised treatment approach. Treatment can be intensified in patients identified as being at high risk of relapse, whereas those patients who are likely to be cured can be spared from the risks of undergoing unnecessary treatment **\(1\)**. These tests can also rapidly evaluate responses to experimental or novel drugs both on an individual and clinical trial population level. 

 **King’s research accurately identifies patients at risk of relapse and shows that fewer patients require risky bone marrow transplant procedures.** In a large clinical trial performed between 2009\-2014, King’s analysed 2569 samples obtained from 346 patients with AML who had undergone intensive treatment in the UK National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) AML17 trial **\(2\)**. King’s research showed that molecular assessment provided extremely powerful prognostic information: molecular measurable residual disease \(MRD\) status could split patients into two groups with dramatic differences in survival rates. Survival at 3 years was 24% for patients with, and 75% without MRD.  The MRD test also significantly outperformed traditional ways of assessing relapse risk and therefore provided a much more accurate way of deciding which patients should undergo bone marrow transplantation \(BMT\), a procedure carrying significant risks of long\-term morbidity and a 10\-20% chance of treatment\-related death.  Importantly, the findings showed that significantly fewer patients require BMT when the MRD tests are incorporated into treatment decision making. 

 **King’s identifies a group of patients at high risk of relapse after bone marrow transplantation.** Following on from this study, King’s focussed on patients with a positive MRD test and therefore a high risk of relapse and studied whether having extra treatment or changes in the transplant procedure could help overcome the risk of disease relapse. This analysis defined a threshold MRD level associated with very poor outcome, identifying patients that may benefit from further treatment prior to transplantation. Moreover, King’s researchers showed that a particular type of transplant \(called T\-replete\) was associated with improved survival in this group **\(3\)**. 

 **King’s demonstrates that sequential molecular testing accurately identifies patients destined to relapse, allowing pre\-emptive interventions to be deployed.** King’s showed that regularly repeating MRD tests after completion of treatment can reliably detect relapse in a subset of AML patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia \(APL, accounting for 10% of AML\). By incorporating molecular monitoring coupled with pre\-emptive molecularly guided salvage treatment, the rate of disease relapse was reduced from 12% to 5%. Further data generated by King’s in the NCRI AML17 study revealed that sequential monitoring also reliably predicts relapse in patients with non\-APL AML **\(2\)**. In this study, all patients with either rising MRD levels or conversion from negative to positive MRD status, went on to experience clinical disease relapse. Molecular indicators of relapse occurred in patients at a median of 3 months in advance of clinical manifestations, providing a window of time that can be exploited for the delivery of pre\-emptive interventions to prevent relapse. 

 **King’s develops a novel treatment that can eliminate molecular evidence of disease and prevent relapse.** To exploit the window for pre\-emptive intervention provided by sequential molecular testing, King’s went on to test the effectiveness of a novel, non\-intensive treatment \(venetoclax \+ cytarabine\) as molecularly guided salvage treatment. The data revealed a complete clearance of disease at the molecular level in 92% of patients treated with this combination, and 83% of these patients had prolonged disease\-free survival **\(4\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 King’s work has led to the development and widespread implementation of highly accurate prognostic tools for AML patients, allowing them to receive personalised molecularly guided treatment. This has translated into changes in clinical practice, improvement in quality of life and survival and NHS cost savings. It has also paved the way for new clinical trial designs that will evaluate the effectiveness of new treatments more quickly and more accurately. 

 **King’s research changed national clinical practice and incorporated molecular MRD assessment into international AML treatment guidelines.** Following publication of King’s landmark study in 2016 **\(2\)**, molecular assessment of MRD status has now been adopted as standard of care for therapeutic decision making in patients with AML including those treated outside clinical trials. In collaboration with Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust, these tests have been made available for routine use in the NHS and in the past year, 5799 samples have been analysed from 1440 patients **\(A\)**. This represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of AML away from a single treatment pathway towards a personalised approach in which therapy is tailored based on each individual’s response to initial therapy. 

 Beyond the UK this change in practice has been reflected in international guidelines, for example those produced by the European Leukaemia Network **\(B\)** and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network **\(C\)**. These guidelines are used by the majority of physicians treating leukaemia worldwide and NICE takes them into account as part of their decision\-making process. 

 **King’s molecularly guided therapy advances patient survival, quality of life and long\-term side effects of treatment.** Improvement in patient outcome stems from \(a\) the ability to rationally select patients for bone marrow transplantation \(BMT\) and therefore to reduce the number of patients exposed to the toxicity of this procedure and \(b\) the ability to pre\-emptively diagnose and treat relapse. 

 BMT has powerful anti\-leukaemia activity but is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Transplant\-related mortality occurs in >10% of patients and many survivors experience serious long\-term health issues particularly as a result of graft\-versus\-host disease \(GvHD\) which affects \~30% of transplant recipients. Whether to perform BMT as part of primary treatment has been controversial for many years and the decision has been based principally on risk\-factors present at the time of diagnosis and clinician preference. The molecular MRD tests developed at King’s have substantially refined outcome prediction and therefore allowed much more rational selection of patients for upfront BMT. Precise numbers on uptake have not yet been obtained since they are only published a few years after the treatment is finalised. However, the Chair of the National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) Acute Myeloid Leukaemia \(AML\) working group estimated that \~100 patients per year can safely avoid upfront BMT in the UK alone based on King’s approach **\(D.1\)**. Additionally, at least 5 patients per year would avoid transplant\-related death and \~20 avoid the long\-term morbidity associated with GvHD **\(D.1\)**. 

 Using King’s serial MRD assessment approach  after completion of treatment, patients destined to relapse can be reliably identified. Treating patients at “molecular relapse” rather than full\-blown haematological relapse has major advantages **\(D.1\)**: 

-  Rather than requiring salvage therapy, which is conducted after the patient does not respond to standard therapy, in molecular relapse this can be timed carefully or in some cases avoided altogether. An increasing proportion of patients can receive treatment for molecular relapse as an outpatient using novel therapies such as venetoclax \+ cytarabine or gilteritinib, resulting in major improvements in patient experience and quality of life. 

-  For those patients who are treated with salvage chemotherapy in hospital, those treated at molecular relapse require fewer cycles of treatment than those treated in frank haematological relapse. It is estimated that \~25 patients per year can avoid at least one cycle of salvage chemotherapy. 

-  The early detection of relapse provides extra time for the identification of optimal donors for BMT and allows patients to enter salvage treatment and BMT in much better physical condition. 

 **King’s approach presents ongoing cost savings for the NHS.** As well as being highly toxic, BMT is also a highly expensive procedure with NHS costs of approximately GBP100,000 per patient **\(D.1\)**. A reduction of 100 procedures per year therefore results in cost savings to the NHS of \~GBP10,000,000 annually. Treatment at the time of molecular relapse also results in a substantial reduction in healthcare resource use compared to treatment at frank haematological relapse. It has been estimated that 25 cycles of salvage chemotherapy are avoided each year by exploiting molecular monitoring which results in a saving of 800 bed\-days as well as the associated antibiotic and blood product usage **\(D.1\)**. 

 **King’s led the development of emergency national guidelines and temporary new drug commissioning during the COVID\-19 pandemic.** During the peak of the COVID\-19 pandemic it was unsafe to treat AML patients with intensive chemotherapy due to the high rates of fatality following infection, and it was desirable to reduce pressure on NHS bed occupancy. Based on their knowledge of molecular responses to novel therapies in different patient subgroups, King’s researchers led the rapid development of national treatment guidelines based on the use of new drugs. This guideline was first published in late March 2020 and was updated every few weeks **\(E\)**. 

 Some of the recommended new treatments relied on the use of drugs which had not yet been approved for use in the NHS. Therefore in parallel to developing the treatment guideline, King’s played a pivotal role in urgent discussions with both pharmaceutical industry partners and NHS England which led to a rapid and major change in policy to supply two novel agents \(gilteritinib and venetoclax\) across the NHS from April 2020 for defined patient groups for the duration of the pandemic **\(D\)**. 

 **National guidelines and drug availability developed by King’s were highly valued by clinicians and patients throughout the UK.** An example of this is confirmed by a Consultant Haematologist at Blackpool Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in charge of a patient with AML who had an early relapse three months after the end of treatment **\(F\)**: “As we identified that he had low level disease, we did not feel the need to step in with intensive chemotherapy like Flag\-Ida. He therefore was able to be started on molecularly targeted treatment in the form of gilteritinib, a novel FLT3 inhibitor that has recently been approved for use. \(…\) This is worlds apart from Flag\-Ida chemotherapy which would have required intensive inpatient treatment, with significant immunosuppression and significant risk of developing COVID. This all occurred during the height of the pandemic. I am delighted to say that he went into a second molecular remission following treatment with gilteritinib. He therefore was entirely well going into an allogeneic transplant as result of this targeted therapy. All of this could not have been achieved without the help and dedication from yourself, your laboratory and your colleges. I feel this represents truly cutting\-edge treatment for acute leukaemia that is unrivalled anywhere else in Europe or indeed the world. I feel myself very fortunate to have your support and expertise on the laboratory side to help and inform my clinical decision making *.”* 

 Another example of this is verified by a Consultant Haematologist at Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust Foundation St James’s Institute of Oncology **\(G\)** who expressed how the guidelines during the COVID\-19 pandemic have been extremely helpful to him and his colleagues: “Just writing to thank you for your help recently with the management of AML and MDS patients, specifically regarding the advised changes to management during the COVID\-19 pandemic to try reduce the amount of time patients are both in hospital and neutropenic but at the same time balancing that with therapies that still provide excellent responses. \(...\) This has been very helpful in terms of treating patients who have molecular relapses before they get full blown relapses and for those with molecular persistence of disease markers and has also impacted in an extremely positive way the treatment pathways we are now able to offer patients.” 

 As of October 2020, over 350 patients have been treated using these drugs and King’s is leading the collection of real\-world outcome data which will inform practice in the future, including in the event of further COVID\-19 waves **\(H\)**. 

 **King’s research paved the way for the development of novel trial designs which evaluate new drugs more quickly and accurately.** Incorporation of molecular MRD measurement has provided substantial added value to the UK national AML clinical trials, allowing better understanding of effects of new treatments **\(I\)**. Molecular MRD status is now increasingly used as an endpoint for clinical trials because it provides a rapid read\-out of treatment efficacy, while being highly correlated with traditional outcome measures such as relapse and death. King’s research on MRD assessments during and following therapy have become a key element of risk stratification in many other types of AML and have been integrated into the trials to guide therapy, predict outcome and monitor for relapse. The Chief Investigator of the NCRI AML17, AML18 and AML19 trials confirms that King’s “has been pivotal in pioneering this programme, its integration into the clinical trials and establishing MRD monitoring as a national standard of care. It is the only lab performing this work for the trials and provides a national clinical advisory service on the interpretation of the results **\(I\)**.” 

 This has led to the development of new trial designs where patients with molecular evidence of treatment failure are pre\-emptively switched to alternative therapy but still counted as a failure event for the trial endpoint.  An example of this design is the VICTOR trial \(Venetoclax or Intensive Chemotherapy for the Treatment Of favourable Risk AML, EudraCT 2020\-000273\-24\) **\(D.1\)**. This trial, which is being led by King’s, is testing an original outpatient\-based non\-intensive treatment against standard intensive chemotherapy. Molecular MRD status is used as the primary endpoint to assess efficacy of the new combination but is also used to switch patients failing this less intensive treatment back onto standard therapy thus allowing treatment de\-escalation to be safely tested without putting patients at risk of relapse. This has substantial potential benefits to patients and the NHS in terms of quality of life and resource use. 

 A participant from the AML17 clinical trial and patient ambassador for Blood Cancer UK said: “I am particularly excited to be involved in the VICTOR trial which I think could offer real hope for older, less fit AML patients who might otherwise be only eligible for palliative care. Venetoclax really does seem to be offering hope for kinder, less damaging treatment. Although I remain in remission almost five years on from my transplant, I am still living with the side effects of my treatment. New drugs like Venetoclax offer real hope for successful treatment without resulting in long lasting side effects. I am very proud to be involved and support the work of Dr Dillon and his team and the AML working group **\(J\).** *”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Successful application of Laminar Flow Control \(LFC\) is a strategic pillar in the aerospace industry aimed at improving fuel and noise efficiency of next generation aircraft \(military, civilian and unmanned\), irrespective of future propulsion systems. Imperial Mathematics research has produced state\-of\-the\-art modelling tools for geometrical shape optimisation of laminar wings to accurately predict transition to turbulence and open the way for significant economic and environmental impacts. These tools are being used by Airbus, for example, to analyse and interpret data from their €200 million project,  [Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe \(BLADE\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtBPKrwYuGc). In September 2017, BLADE flew as part of the €4 billion EU Clean Skies II initiative and showed that the laminar\-flow transonic wing could reduce drag by 10% and reduce fuel burn by 5%. Imperial’s software has provided Airbus with key LFC design analysis tools for their product development. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Researchers at Imperial Mathematics developed key breakthroughs in computational flow physics models that enable harnessing LFC technologies for the design of aircraft wings. These addressed crucial uncertainties of how to model and incorporate: \(1\) flow receptivity; \(2\) surface imperfections; and \(3\) fully three\-dimensional \(3D\) wing geometry variations. Engagement with Airbus engineers and access to proprietary Airbus data created internationally unrivalled LFC modelling capability. 

 **1. Flow Receptivity:** Air flow disturbances are generated through resonance mechanisms arising from free\-stream fluctuations coupling to wing roughness elements within a thin \(<2mm\) air boundary layer. This process, known as receptivity, plays a key role in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. LFC wings are designed to push this transition front across the wingspan, as far downstream as possible. However, the stochastic nature of the freestream environment, coupled with small disturbances arising from gaps, fasteners, surface deformations and imperfections, as well as undesirable residues of dirt, de\-icing fluid or rain droplets, make it immensely difficult to incorporate all such effects in laminar wing transition predictive tools. The Imperial team made theoretical breakthroughs in receptivity theory. Specifically, Ref **\[1\]** included the effect of wing vibrations; Ref **\[2\]** incorporates the random nature of the surface roughness field and Refs. **\[3,4\]** extend these approaches to the transonic regime in which commercial aeroplanes fly, adapt it to the wing geometry and sweep, and make the methods computationally efficient and feasible for the industrial design process. 

 **2. Surface Imperfections \- flow destabilisation due to steps, gaps and impact damage:** Critical concerns for operational and LFC robustness are micron\-scaled imperfections and misalignments of surfaces arising during wing manufacture, distortions due to aerodynamic pressure loads on longer and slimmer light carbon\-fibre wings, and existence of small laminar separation bubbles \(LSBs\). The abrupt nature of these features means that local stability analyses are invalid or of little use in accurate design. The theory developed in **\[5\]** circumvents these limitations by characterising the transition via a transmission coefficient of disturbance amplitude across abrupt changes in surface topography. Such analytical findings underpinned novel computational tools that are fully capable of ascertaining flow destabilisation effects due to discontinuous changes in local geometry and presence of LSBs **\[6\]**. Publications **\[5, 6\]** enable, for the first time, quantitative predictions rather than empirical practices previously used in industry. 

 The above developments and computational advances based on the linear harmonic Navier\-Stokes \(LHNS\) direct and adjoint models developed during **\[i,ii\]** lead to Dr Mughal’s  development of the **MiPSecR** suite of high\-fidelity computational tools. 

 **3. Fully 3D modelling:** Long\-haul flight requires swept wings that produce 3D flows and must crucially accommodate Hybrid\-LFC technology for active control. Hybrid\-LFC involves suction through thousands of micron\-sized laser\-drilled holes on the surface, but current design tools use simplistic and unrealistic assumptions for Hybrid\-LFC surface placement and 3D modelling. 

 Imperial research developed **PPM\-PSE3D**, an efficient 3D surface\-marching parabolised stability equations algorithm for the quantification of laminar flow instabilities over complete aircraft wings **\[7, 8\]**. These tools make no pseudo\-3D assumptions and can model aerodynamic problems of practical importance and relevance to industry **\[ii\]**. 

 The work was supported by a variety of funding sources, including direct support from Airbus, EPSRC **\[i\]**, Innovate\-UK through the ALFET project **\[ii\]**, and Bombardier via the SANTANA project **\[iii\]**. DSTL and BAe Systems supported the initial development of *PPM\-PSE3D* **\[7\]** *.*

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Demand for air travel \(despite the current pandemic\) will continue to increase **\[A, B\]**, with low drag airframes forming a cornerstone of design philosophy.  Airbus continues to invest in LFC for the next generation of narrow body, hydrogen fuelled and battery–powered aircraft **\[C\]**. LFC technology offers up to 5% lower CO2 emissions corresponding to 3,000 tons of CO2 saved per aircraft annually \[D\].  Airbus states that: 

 *“Wing design and production is a key capability for the UK. The supply chain impact of Airbus to the UK economy is worth £5 billion annually.”* **\[E\]** 

 Imperial research contributed to key new technologies for the optimal design of laminar\-flow wings for Airbus’s next generation aircraft programmes. This is a long\-standing collaboration which resulted in co\-authored publications, both in the underpinning research **\[2,3,4,6\]** and applied studies **\[F\]**. Airbus is using these advanced theoretical and computational tools in the industrial process of laminar wing design optimisation: 

 *“Our collaborations with Imperial College have been ongoing for some time, but the period from 2015\-onwards has been the most significant for us regarding its impact on our research direction in the field of Laminar flow wing design. This is due to the **progression of the Imperial research from crucial fundamental aspects into an enhanced suite of theoretical tools that we are using in an industrial wing design setting**.”* **\[E\]** 

 The quality of methods is rated highly by Airbus 

 *“The measure and scope of the work has been truly impressive due to \(i\) the robustness of Imperial software models enabling investigations of practical engineering problems, and \(ii\) the advanced physics fidelity of the Imperial software.”* **\[E\]** 

 These tools allow Airbus to conduct investigations that have been previously impossible. 

 *The Imperial state\-of\-the\-art modern transition prediction methods for industrial design, **have enhanced Airbus’s laminar flow analysis capability enabling the solution of previously intractable problems**. **”** \[E\]** 

 The new tools also aid LFC tests in industrial transonic wind\-tunnel testing **\[G\]** led by the Aircraft Research Association \(ARA\). 

 Airbus invested €200 million towards the LFC BLADE project where the outer sections of an A340 aircraft had specially designed laminar flow wings **\[H\]**.  This was part of the €4 billion EU Clean\-Skies II initiative to reduce noise and emissions between 65\-90% by 2050. Methods developed at Imperial were used in the analysis of the test flights: 

 *“The computational suite comprising the 3D surface marching PSE algorithm \(PPM\-PSE3D\) developed at Imperial and delivered to Airbus, was used by Airbus to analyse and interpret the data of its laminar flow wing demonstrator project using a A340\-300 MSN001 “flight lab” aircraft. The flight tests \(in 2017\) were part of the Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe \(BLADE\) project sponsored by the EU Clean\-Skies II initiative.”* **\[E\]** 

 The impact of the analysis is the furnishing of a high\-fidelity design tool for Airbus: 

 *“The position of the laminar\-turbulent front on the wing was predicted exceptionally well by PPM\-PSE3D, making the software a high fidelity design tool that can be used alongside traditional empirical methods.”* **\[E\]** 

 A major industry\-wide barrier in predictive laminar wing performance has been the inability of modelling small\-scale manufacturing and environmental uncertainties.  Viability of LFC technology requires extremely tight control of manufacturing finishing standards and maintenance of tolerances during lifetime operation of aerodynamic surfaces. Imperial delivered to Airbus the *MiPSecR receptivity software suite*. The development has allowed several key areas \(stochastic receptivity, steps–gaps, surface\-roughness\) to be investigated **\[2,3,4,6\]** and incorporated into advanced transition prediction software. Airbus state: 

 *“Imperial’s receptivity software suite MiPSecR allows us to utilise its adjoint framework to simulate thousands of stochastic realisations and use uncertainty quantification to predict transition due to tolerances and imperfections.’'* **\[E\]** 

 Capabilities facilitated by Imperial’s research offers Airbus significant time and cost savings in the development of optimised LFC aircraft \(for both Hybrid LFC and natural LFC\). This is achieved by facilitating faster design cycles using the developed advanced tools, and reducing the need for unnecessary and costly wind\-tunnel tests, as corroborated by the supporting evidence: 

 *“It is vital for Airbus to simulate such features in a controlled manner, so that the tolerances for building a laminar wing can be understood. The BLADE demonstrator flew over a hundred hours and collected such data. Imperial’s receptivity software suite MiPSecR allows us to utilise its adjoint framework to simulate thousands of stochastic realisations and use uncertainty quantification to predict transition due to tolerances and imperfections. Such state\-of\-the\-art theoretical capabilities offer the potential to incorporate knowledge of manufacturing tolerances and real world limitations into future wing shape optimisation processes prior to expensive experiments and flight tests, again saving time and money.’'* **\[E\]** 

 The Imperial research has contributed to the competitiveness of Airbus and its UK operations, as well as the broader position of the UK in advanced technologies and manufacturing: 

 *“Each contribution to the excellence of the product enables Airbus to compete on the global stage and as such the Imperial College research is vital for the continued success of Airbus in the UK.”* **\[E\]** 

 The process of developing and building a new aircraft is long, complex and costly. For example, the Airbus A380 “superjumbo”, announced in 1990, was delivered in 2005 with a cost of €25 billion. The design and manufacturing pipeline relies on fundamental knowledge and new technologies to provide a crucial competitive edge, and that is exactly what the research from Imperial has delivered and will continue to do as part of Airbus' plan to include LFC as a defining technology of a potential next\-generation aircraft from the late 2020s.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The CEREBRA Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at the University of Birmingham translates latest research findings into effective, practical assessments and interventions for people with severe intellectual disability. Their approaches **have been added to national clinical guidelines**, resulting in the widespread application of **new clinical assessment tools** in 83 NHS trusts and in 24 other countries. CEREBRA has improved awareness of rare disorders and has demonstrably **changed management practices** across the world, providing information for families and healthcare professionals in over 200 countries. In the UK alone, over 2,000 families have received advice and support through assessments, support groups, workshops and nationally commended lay guides. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The goal of Oliver’s programme of research is to improve the understanding, clinical assessment and effective treatment of psychological disorders in children and adults with severe intellectual disability associated with a diverse set of neurodevelopmental disorders and genetic syndromes. These collectively cause severe psychological and behavioural problems in about 21,000 children and up to 47,000 adults in the UK. 

 Professor Oliver’s **research team has delineated many unique behavioural, cognitive and neuropsychological profiles in children and adults with severe intellectual disability** \[R1, R2, R3, R4\]. They have identified relationships between cognitive impairments, physical health conditions, environmental influences and specific genetic disorders. This has led to improved understanding and assessment of the causes of clinically significant behaviours, as well as recommendations for treatment. These behaviours include severe self\-injurious behaviour and temper outbursts, as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety \[R5\]. Additionally, the research has established the risk of development of psychological disorder, based on an individual’s characteristics such as genetic disorder or specific behavioural markers \[R1, R3, R4 R5\]. 

 **Many standard clinical assessments of behaviour and emotional states cannot be used in practice with people who have severe intellectual disability**: the tests are imprecise with regard to assessing their behaviour, may require self\-reporting that such participants cannot provide or may refer to situations that are unlikely to be experienced by people with severe intellectual disability. To fill this gap, measures of behaviour disorders \(self\-injury, aggression\), mood, dimensions of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, and repetitive and social behaviours with robust psychometric properties have been developed for use in clinical practice \[R6\]. The team then develop and apply behavioural and cognitive assessments for these groups of individuals \[R6\]. 

 The study of genetic disorders has enhanced understanding of the atypical presentation of clinical disorders in people with severe intellectual disability. For example, autism is common in individuals with rare genetic syndromes but the variable profile of their symptoms can impede efficient diagnosis. Through their application of standardised autism assessments in samples with homogenous genetic cause of intellectual disability, **Oliver’s team has contributed to both causal theoretical models of idiopathic autism and contributed knowledge about the differing profiles associated with specific genetic disorders** \[R4\]. Similarly, longitudinal studies of the natural course of clinically significant behaviours like self\-injury have identified behavioural markers, such as repetitive behaviour and impulsivity, that predict both the onset and chronicity of self\-injury \[R3, R5\]. 

 In summary, the key research findings \[KF\] from Oliver’s team are: 

 **KF1**: Provision of precise descriptions of the psychological characteristics and disorders experienced by people with genetic disorders and severe intellectual disability \[R2, R5\]; 

 **KF2**: Identification of the person characteristics that elevate the risk of developing rare disorders \[R1, R3, R4, R5\]; 

 **KF3**: The development of assessments of affect and behaviour that can be used in clinical settings \[R2, R6\]; 

 **KF4**: The development of causal models of the disorders to inform targeted intervention \[R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 CEREBRA is a charity that helps children with brain conditions and their families discover a better life together. The charity co\-funds *The CEREBRA Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders* at the University of Birmingham to generate impact by translating the latest research findings into effective and practical assessments and interventions. This then enables the Centre to provide information, advice and direct support to parents, carers and practitioners for the ongoing treatment of rare neurodevelopmental disorders. Oliver and his team have impacted on **clinical guidelines** as well as **care and educational practice**. They **have improved outcomes for those who suffer from neurodevelopmental disorders and severe intellectual disability**. 

 <ins>Informing clinical guidelines and practice for rare neurodevelopmental disorders</ins> 

 **National** **clinical guidelines have been informed by research** with the 2015 NICE Guidance for Challenging Behaviour \[S1\] citing 14 research papers published by Oliver and his team between 2001–2013, including R1, R3 and R5. The guidelines are further underpinned by a briefing paper co\-authored by Oliver and Richards for the Challenging Behaviour Foundation on risk markers \[S2; KF1, KF2\]. Specifically, the recommendations on assessment of challenging behaviour provide guidance on the co\-occurrence and persistence of characteristics associated with these behaviours. **New clinical assessment tools have also been developed** based on 11 measures developed from KF3 to assess behaviour and effect in children and adults with severe intellectual disability. The tools are freely available online \[R6\], along with psychometric and normative data for comparison. The measures have now been downloaded by practitioners in 83 NHS Trusts and by approximately 100 intellectual disability services, such as schools and care providers \[S3\]. 

 Further **national guidelines were also changed** on the assessment and diagnosis of dementia in people with intellectual disabilities, co\-produced by the British Psychological Society and Royal College of Psychiatrists. Oliver’s evidence \[KF2, KF3\] of the behavioural indicators of dementia and of the utility of modified neuropsychological assessment of dementia in individuals with Down syndrome is cited \[S4\]. 

 Guideline changes and the provision of bespoke assessment tools have led **to changes in management practices** for patients with rare neurological disorders across the world. Following the success in the UK, the tools developed by Oliver’s team \[KF3\] have been translated into 11 languages and are used in 23 countries outside the UK. To provide an additional, more detailed, example, a consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome published in *Nature Reviews Genetics* \(2018\) contained 68 detailed recommendations heavily influenced by Oliver’s work \[KF2, KF4\]. The President of the World Federation of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Support Groups writes: 

 It is a testament to the work of Professor Oliver that so much of his research is included and referenced in this prestigious paper. This has become a defining document for management of the syndrome for the 4,242 \[Cornelia de Lange Syndrome\] people registered with us globally. \[S5\] 

 The CEREBRA Centre has also attracted global engagement via their Further Inform Neurogenetic Disorders \(FIND\) website \( [www.findresources.co.uk](http://www.findresources.co.uk/)<ins>\)</ins> whose focus is to better disseminate information on rare neurodevelopmental disorders. Google analytics \[S3\] show it receives an average of 966 visits and 3,666 page\-views per month, from 200 visiting countries: 728,000 so far in total and growing rapidly. In house evaluation has also indicated that the website is visited by both clinicians and families. In its first year, 79% of respondents felt that the website had improved their knowledge whereas 95% found the information easy to understand. An NHS Consultant Paediatric Neuropsychiatrist writes: 

 The FIND website \[…\] is remarkable in that it includes evidence\-based information that is accessible to parents/carers, whilst also including rich information and resources that clinicians \(like paediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and occupational therapists\) can consult and use in their clinical practice. \[S6\] 

 <ins>Improved outcomes for patients and their families</ins> 

 The CEREBRA Centre works directly with families and has **provided over 2,000 UK families with personalised feedback reports** using the research\-led clinical assessment tools, to detail and aid interpretation of the assessment of their child’s performance. These reports, which are based on the findings of KF1–KF4, are highly valued by families to **improve their understanding and to help them educate and advocate with local services and professionals**. The impact of these reports is best evidenced by testimony from the many charities and organisations supported by Oliver and his team \[S4, S6, S7, S8\]. These include UNIQUE \(a charity which focuses on very rare syndromes\), the Fragile X Society, the Down’s, Cornelia de Lange, Prader\-Willi, Angelman, Williams, Lowe, Tuberous Sclerosis, Cri du Chat, Rubinstein\-Taybi, Smith\-Magenis, Kleefstra, Child Growth Foundations. For these charities, Oliver’s team provide assessments and online advice, serve as chairs and members of scientific and clinical advisory committees, run support groups, present national and international workshops, and produce nationally commended lay guides and online materials. Through these charities **CEREBRA often reach a significant proportion of the UK families affected by a particular syndrome** \(e.g.\~15% for the most common, Fragile X, up to 93% for the very rare Kleefstra syndrome \[S10\]\). The Smith\-Magenis Syndrome charity CEO and Chair testifies: 

 10 years ago most families affected by Smith\-Magenis syndrome were struggling with unmanageable challenging behaviours, sleep exhaustion and the prospect of their child likely to be sectioned \[…\] The research provided by Chris’s team has enabled our SMS population to manage the challenges more aptly with identified practical solutions, bringing about greater optimism and hope for the future. \[S6\] 

 As well as using FIND as an information source, families of patients also use co\-authored guides with the Cerebra charity for self\-injury, pain, autism, sleep and anxiety \[S9\]. These guides are primarily designed to translate research findings to **improve wellbeing** for parents and carers, but are also being used by clinicians. The anxiety guide was “highly commended” \[S8\] and the Sleep tips \[S9\] was “commended” in the BMA Patient Information Awards \[S10\] which recognise excellence in accessible, well\-designed and clinically balanced patient information. Overall, the Head of Research and Information at the Cerebra Charity reports: 

 Through his research, \[Oliver\] and his team have had a significant impact on the lives of many \[…\] children, and their families. In particular, the University of Birmingham researcher team have written a number of guides that we have produced for parents covering topics that are important to these families. \[S10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cardiac electrophysiology simulation software developed by Nottingham researchers is used by two of the top 10 largest \(by revenue\) pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline Plc \(GSK\) and F. Hoffman\-LaRoche \(Roche\), for routine compound profiling and pro\-arrhythmic side effect safety testing. The simulator is available via a public portal \( [https://cardiac.nottingham.ac.uk](https://cardiac.nottingham.ac.uk/)\) where it has been used by over 140 other companies. The simulator applies mathematical models of the electrophysiology of cardiac muscle cells to predict side effects of pharmaceutical compounds and assign them a clinical pro\-arrhythmic risk class. 

 The system allows the global pharmaceutical industry to focus development on compounds with a lower cardiac risk, reducing the likelihood of failing safety tests during later stages of drug discovery. The ability for the industry to select low risk compounds using these computer models has enhanced productivity, generated financial savings and decreased reliance on animal\-based testing – at GSK reducing use of a rabbit heart experiment by over 90%.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Gary Mirams has been a core developer of ‘Chaste’: Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment, a C\+\+ library for computational physiology throughout its development, since 2005 during his PhD study at Nottingham. At that time Chaste developers within the School of Mathematical Sciences included PhD students Mirams \(supported by **\[6\]** and supervised by Professors Helen Byrne and John King\) and Alex Walter together with Dr Ingeborg van Leeuwen and Professor Byrne who, with collaborators, authored the first Chaste research paper published in 2009 **\[1\]**. 

 Chaste is the open source electrophysiology solver underpinning all the subsequent cardiac electrophysiology simulations running in industrial settings; it is written to industrial software standards in terms of unit, memory and coverage testing. Chaste is still in active development and the latest 2019.1 version **\[5, 9\]** features improved CellML conversion by Dr Maurice Hendrix \(Research Software Engineer based at Nottingham\) to provide a consistent unit conversion for calcium concentrations in all cardiac models. 

 Mirams continued Chaste development whilst in Oxford \(2008\-2016\) and used it to show that information on how compounds block multiple ion channels could be used within mathematical cardiac electrophysiology models to predict the overall effect on a cardiac cell and hence clinical risk. These models use complex mechanistic \(ordinary\-differential\-equation\) formulations to model the voltage\- and concentration\-dependent opening and closing of many types of ion channels, pumps and exchangers within a cardiac cell, as well as the subsequent evolution of membrane voltage over time, along with ion concentrations in the cytoplasm and other compartments. Using outputs of these models to predict risk was shown to be more accurate than measuring the degree of drug block of a single potassium\-channel encoded by the gene *hERG,* which was the standard approach at the time. Uptake of this simulation approach in industry has been widespread and led to the first versions of the Chaste\-based drug effect prediction simulation engine \(ApPredict **\[2, 7\]**\) being deployed within GSK by 2014 and subsequently at Roche in 2017. 

 After returning to Nottingham in 2016, Mirams has developed ApPredict further to provide predictions for new species \(including guinea pig myocytes in Aug 2017 alongside rabbit, dog and human models\), new risk indicators \(the FDA’s risk marker based on change in net charge ‘qNet’ in May 2018\), and to handle uncertainty characterisation and propagation. In total, Mirams has made over 230 “repository commits” \(code changes\) since his return to Nottingham in November 2016 **\[2, 8, 9\]**. There is a public interface to this simulation engine called ApPortal, with the latest version developed and hosted by Nottingham \( [https://cardiac.nottingham.ac.uk](https://cardiac.nottingham.ac.uk/)\) which runs simulations and presents qNet predictions. 

 In a 2017 paper **\[3, 8\]**, Mirams worked with Bioprojet \(Paris, France\) to perform and interpret electrophysiology simulations as part of the assessment of their new drug *pitolisant*. The study took information from early screening experiments for particular ion channels, and predicted effects at the whole cell and whole organ levels in rabbit and human, before comparing them with experimental and clinical measurements. 

 In another 2017 paper **\[4, 8\]** Mirams worked with Roche to tailor mathematical action potential models to individual batches of stem\-cell derived myocytes \(which can exhibit high variation\) with the aim of making batch\-specific predictions. The outcome was a new method for tailoring models to particular cells which was shown to provide increased predictive power of drug activity \(based on ion channel screening experiments\) relative to an untailored model from the literature.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 All new pharmaceutical compounds must be carefully screened for unwanted side effects on the heart which can cause fatal arrhythmias. Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market worldwide because of fatalities due to these arrhythmias at a cost of billions of dollars. Even drugs for ailments as mild as hay fever have been withdrawn due to fatalities and an unacceptable increase in arrhythmic risk \(e.g. terfenadine\), so there is now a huge industrial effort in avoiding this situation occurring for new drug compounds. The root cause has been identified as drug molecules binding to and blocking ion channels in the heart. 

 Ion channel block can now be screened in immortal cell lines in a dish \( *in vitro* testing\) at an early stage of drug development without using cardiac muscle tissue from animals. This is the standard screening approach for a number of ion channels in many large pharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the degree of block of many cardiac ion channels which is difficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently. 

 Innovatively, the mathematical modelling approach developed by Mirams offers a way to integrate information from different ion channel *in vitro* screens, to predict the effect on whole cardiac muscle cells. The resulting simulations can provide a more accurate summary of the risk of a new potential drug compound earlier in drug development and hence more cheaply than the pre\-existing approaches. In short, the computational modelling tool, ApPredict, uses the data produced by *in vitro* tests to identify lower\-risk compounds to be progressed into translational *in vivo* studies on animals \(with a concomitant reduction in the need for animal studies\) and ultimately into clinical trials on humans. 

 **Industrial Use of Electrophysiology Simulations** 

 **Impact on ApPortal users:** 

 Mirams has been developing the Chaste\-based cardiac simulation software known as ‘ApPredict’ **\[1, 2, 6\-9\]** in partnership with a web developer to embed it in a web interface \(ApPortal\) since 2011. The ApPredict software takes information on the extent to which drugs block particular ion channels, then provides a prediction for the integrated effect on the whole cardiac muscle cell. 

 Improvements by Mirams to ApPredict whilst at Nottingham \(2016\-onwards\) led to the  [2019.1 version of ApPortal](https://cardiac.nottingham.ac.uk/ActionPotential/login) being made available via a public website where anyone can register for an account and run cardiac safety simulations after manually entering data on the degree to which compounds block specific ion channels. The portal is very widely used and has performed a total of over 7000 simulations for over 350 users. Based on email domain usernames, there are users from 147 companies including Contract Research Organisations, small pharmaceutical companies and 14 of the top 20 largest global pharmaceutical companies \(by 2019 revenue\); and over 70 educational or research establishments **\[A\]**. 

 **Impact on the SME Bioprojet\-BIOTECH:** 

 In 2017, Mirams worked with Bioprojet\-BIOTECH to assess the pro\-arrhythmic risk of their new compound ‘pitolisant’ **\[3\].** The drug is now marketed as ‘Wakix’ for treatment of narcolepsy, a condition estimated to affect 1 in 2500 people.  Bioprojet states that Mirams’ simulation tool led to enhanced confidence in their understanding of the compound action and hence in their assessment of its pro\-arrhythmic risk potential **\[D\]**. They also acknowledge the contribution of the research **\[3\]** in obtaining FDA approval **\[E\]** for ‘pitolisant’ **\[D\]**. 

 **Impact on GlaxoSmithKline and Roche:** 

 Since Mirams’ return to Nottingham in 2016, he has carried out development on the underlying simulation software, funded on a consultancy basis by GlaxoSmithKline **\[B\]** and Hoffman\-LaRoche **\[C\]**. During the same period, the ApPortal has been extended to provide uncertainty quantification features \(uncertainty in model predictions due to the variability associated with the input data\), and these are now in use within the companies and public portal **\[A, B, C\]**. The portal has been deployed inside company firewalls at GSK and Roche where it accesses their safety screening databases directly to acquire input data for the simulations, with the user simply typing in an internal compound ID rather than individual screening results. This system is in regular use by Safety Pharmacology teams at both companies in routine safety testing and compound profiling **\[B, C\]**. 

 The Vice President, Non\-Clinical Safety at GlaxoSmithKline reports: 

 “*ApPredict v2019.1 developed at the University of Nottingham \(based on Chaste v2019.1 discussed in Cooper et al.* **\[5\]** *\) is now in use at GSK to predict the effects of multiple ion channel block on various cell types: stem\-cell derived myocytes, rabbit ventricular myocytes and adult human myocytes.*” **\[B\]** 

 Similarly, a Principal Scientist of Pharma Research and Early Development at Roche reports: 

 “*The simulator is installed within Roche to predict the effects of multiple ion channel block on stem\-cell derived myocytes, guinea pig myocytes and adult human myocytes. We* *are using the July 2020 version of ApPredict, based on Chaste v2019.1 \(Cooper et al.* **\[5\]** *\).*” **\[C\]** 

 Both pharmaceutical companies use the portal to \(i\) screen their compounds and prioritise which to take forward \(to advance compounds that are less likely to fail later safety tests\), leading to enhanced productivity and cost\-saving benefits; \(ii\) to assist in design of later safety tests \(to select drug concentrations of most interest and relevance\); and \(iii\) to compare predictions with later safety test results to check whether all findings are consistent and that the drug’s action is well understood **\[B, C\]**. Finally, the worldwide population will be less likely to be given drugs that can cause arrhythmia, and there are significant animal reduction, refinement, replacement \(3Rs\) benefits **\[B, C\].** 

 For example, GSK reports benefits to their business: 

 “*Having implemented ApPredict \[…\] allowed GSK to enhance our internal cardiovascular safety strategy and to comply with the shifting landscape in pharmaceutical drug development.*” **\[B\]** 

 and also the 3Rs benefits to the approach: 

 “*Since its implementation in 2017 as part of the established early cardiovascular screening strategy, all small molecules \[…\] progressing to clinical candidates have been evaluated by the ApPredict model, leading to a >90% reduction in animal use*” **\[B\]**. 

 Meanwhile, Roche reports: 

 “*\[ApPredict\] has been successfully applied in multiple \(>10\) projects across different therapeutic areas and developmental stages to optimize safety profile of clinical candidates. The main impact included the reduction in the number of animal studies with tens of animals per compound, optimization of the clinical study design by lowering the amount of ECG monitoring and potential waiving of the phase III thorough QT study*” **\[C\]**. 

 **Provision of Training in Simulation Approaches to Pharma** To encourage knowledge exchange between mathematicians and the pharmaceutical industry Mirams has run workshops for non\-mathematician safety pharmacologists to learn how to run cardiac electrophysiology simulations, for example as part of a Continuing Education course for the Safety Pharmacology Society for approximately 30 industrial safety pharmacologists **\[F\]**. Mirams was an Academic Mentor for Dr Ken Wang based in Roche, Basel, Switzerland on a Roche Postdoctoral Fellowship 2015\-2017 \(she now has a permanent post there\), and has also jointly supervised PhD students \(2013\-present\) with Roche **\[C\]**. Mirams has a blog featuring accessible articles on Safety Pharmacology topics \( [Mathematical Matters of the Heart](https://mirams.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/risk-regression-or-biophysics/), over 15,000 page views in 2017\-2020 as accessed 13 January 2020\); the majority of its readers are from the USA \(where many large pharma companies are based\), followed by UK, Germany, India, France, South Korea, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands **\[G\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Melhuish is a world\-leading expert in early childhood education, who was awarded an OBE for services to social sciences \(2016\). His large\-scale longitudinal research \(1997\-2014\) on the critical role of early experiences for educational outcomes underpinned the Childcare Act \(2016\), which massively extended free entitlement to preschool education in the UK. It directly influenced an investment of GBP13.5 million by the Department for Education \(DfE\) aimed at improving home learning environments to support children’s educational development \(2018\). Melhuish’s work for the European Commission \(EC\) and OECD also influenced international policy on preschool provision, particularly in Canada and Australia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Melhuish’s research into the effectiveness of early years’ educational provision started in 1997 when he was Principal Investigator of the longitudinal Effective Provision of Pre\-school Education \(EPPE\) project. It was run continuously until 2014 through the Effective Pre\-school, Primary & Secondary Education \(EPPSE\) project, which followed the same cohort of more than 3,000 children from the age of 3 through preschool, primary and secondary education. EPPE and EPPSE were funded by the Department for Education, and were conducted by Birkbeck, the Institute of Education \(IOE\) and the University of Oxford. In this case study, both are referred to as ‘the project’. 

 The project used retrospective data for the cohort going back to birth, and monitored social and educational development until the children entered school \(age 5\) and then again at key points at ages 6,7,10,11,14 and 16. It focused on the enduring influence of preschool education on educational, developmental and social outcomes for children. Findings demonstrated that the quality of *preschool education* and of the *home learning environment* \(HLE\) both strongly affected children’s long\-term attainment, bringing particular benefits for disadvantaged children across the UK. **These findings led to major changes in UK and international policy on preschool education and the HLE since August 2013.** This case study focuses on impacts that were underpinned by findings from the project that were published between 2004 and 2015. 

 Melhuish’s research revealed strong and systematic effects of high\-quality preschool education: 

-  Preschool has a positive long\-term impact on children’s attainment, progress and social\-behavioural development \[1,2,3\]. 

-  At the age of school entry, attending preschool improves children’s outcomes, with specific benefits resulting from an early start before age 3 \[1,2\]. 

-  Attending preschool specifically benefitted the later attainment of children from lower socioeconomic groups, and this effect was stronger when the preschool was of high quality \[1,4\] 

-  While pre\-school cannot eliminate the adverse effects of disadvantage it can ameliorate these, acting as a ‘protective’ factor for disadvantaged children \[1,2\]. 

 In addition, Melhuish’s research into long term effects of the HLE demonstrated its importance for children’s development and attainments \(summarised in \[6\]\): 

-  The HLE experienced by children during pre\-school and early years shapes attainment at age 16 \[5\]. 

-  A positive parenting experience and HLE for young children helps promote better long\-term social and educational outcomes at age 11 \[6\]. 

-  The HLE is more strongly associated with children’s intellectual and social development than parental education or occupation: HLE is a more important factor for educational outcomes than parental socio\-economic status \[2,6\]. 

 The key finding from Melhuish’s research on the HLE is that socially disadvantaged parents with few qualifications can improve their child’s progress and enhance the benefits of subsequent school education, by engaging in simple daily activities to stretch the child’s mind. As described below, this result has been especially influential in shaping new policy approaches towards increasing social mobility. 

 Melhuish’s standing as world\-leading expert in early years’ education experience and outcomes have led him to lead further research projects for the UK Department for Education and the EU

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Facilitating social mobility has been a central aspiration of UK governments for many years. In 2017, the Social Mobility Commission produced a report about the state of social mobility in the UK for parliament \[A\]. Citing Melhuish’s research on effective pre\-school, primary and secondary education, this report identified two key areas for policy intervention and investment to improve the life chances of disadvantaged children: \(i\) The provision of high\-quality care for preschool children; \(ii\) Improving the home learning environment to boost literacy and social development. In both areas, large\-scale policy initiatives were launched during the assessment period, which were directly informed by Melhuish’s research findings from the project. 

 **Preschool Education** 

 Melhuish’s research demonstrating sustained long\-term impacts of pre\-school education on attainment \[1\-4\] played a central role in motivating the UK Childcare Bill. This bill provided the legal basis to implement the ‘Extended Entitlement’ to an additional 15 hours of free childcare for three\- and four\-year olds from working families, and for some two\-year olds. This effectively doubled prior legal provisions from 15 to 30 hours per week of free childcare. During the passage of this bill in 2015, Melhuish’s findings from the project were cited as supportive evidence in the Select Committee Report on Affordable Childcare, the reading of the Childcare Bill in the House of Lords, the Childcare Bill policy statement, and in the written evidence submitted to the Public Bill Committee \[B\]. 

 The Extended Entitlement had an immediate impact on UK childcare provision. For example, Government analyses for 2018 show that 339,974 three\- and four\-year olds were in a 30\-hours pre\-school education place, as compared to 202,783 in 2017 \[C\], representing an increase of 68% within the first year of the bill’s implementation. For 2019, a further substantial increase was reported \(378,774 children, an increase of 11% on the previous year \[C\]\). 

 **Home Learning Environment \(HLE\)** 

 Melhuish’s EPPSE research demonstrated the critical role of the HLE for improving outcomes for all children, and especially those from a disadvantaged background, showing that the HLE was more important for social and intellectual development than social class \[2,5,6\]. Responding to the 2017 Social Mobility Commission report \[A\], the Department of Education \(DfE\) developed a National Plan for improving social mobility through education \[D\] that was guided by Melhuish’s findings on the importance of the HLE. This National Plan was published in December 2017, and directly led in April 2018 to new DfE funding to support the HLE \[E\]. GBP5million was awarded to the Education Endowment Foundation to fund projects supporting parents in developing their children’s literacy and language skills at home. An additional GBP8.5million was awarded to the Local Government Association for supporting disadvantaged families to improve early language and literacy development \[E\]. These projects include partnerships in the North and North East of England with schools, nurseries and parents. In March 2018, the DfE funded The National Children’s Bureau, The National Literacy Trust, Peebles and the Foundation Years Trust to deliver projects to support the HLE, particularly in disadvantaged areas. This consortium published a report ‘Home Matters’ \[F\] to share the approaches taken in areas of relative disadvantage in Bradford, Leicester, Hastings, the Wirral, Oxfordshire, Bognor Regis and Knowsley. Based on Melhuish’s work, this report also provides evidence\-based guidance for parents, teachers, and practitioners to improve the HLE. In 2018, new HLE review and a guidance document was published by the DfE and National Literacy Trust \(which directly cites Melhuish and names him as a consultant\) and by the Scottish Government \(responsibility for education is devolved\), again strongly drawing on Melhuish’s research \[G\]. One key recommendation was for Education Scotland to take further steps to improve practical applications of the HLE framework, which led to the development of a new toolkit for educational practitioners to facilitate engagement with parents and families \[G\]. 

 **International impact** 

 Melhuish’s research on preschool education has also shaped international guidelines and strategies, influencing policy around early childhood education and care globally. His research findings are cited in policy documents on early childhood education and care published by the European Commission and the OECD \[H\], which provide information and guidance for funding and reform of early education provision policies in member countries. In Canada, the Ontario government published a strategy paper on transforming early years education in 2016, citing Melhuish’s findings, and pledged to provide 100,000 new child care spaces over the next five years from 2017 onwards \[I\]. By March 2019, Ontario had increased its licensed places by 40,000 and was therefore on target to meet its pledge. \[I\] In Australia, Melhuish’s work directly contributed to policy initiatives, being cited prominently in major Australian campaigns and think tank reports \[J\] which promoted increased public investment in early childhood education. In Victoria, Melhuish’s findings from EPPSE were heavily cited in a 2017 independent review of early childcare provision, which prompted a major investment in early years education \(AUD202.1million\) by the Victorian government \[K\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Mitochondria are powerhouses of the cell, sources of oxidative stress, and are key to healthy cell functioning. They play a critical role in metabolism and signalling. Over a decade of chemistry research at UofG has resulted in the design and synthesis of a suite of molecular probes targeted to mitochondria, including the first and currently best probe for quantifying hydrogen peroxide in the mitochondria of living organisms. These probes are marketed by specialist chemical suppliers including Cayman Chemical and Abcam across Europe, Asia and North America. They have reduced animal use in numerous laboratories world\-wide, by an average of 25%. \[Text removed for publication.\] 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** 

 Mitochondria are vital to the healthy functioning of the cell. Mitochondria are powerhouses of the cell, sources of oxidative stress, and are central to metabolism and signalling. A symbiotic research programme between Prof. Hartley’s Chemical Biology laboratory and Prof. Michael Murphy \(MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit\) over the past decade has developed a portfolio of molecular probes which enable researchers across the globe to gain knowledge on the function of mitochondria in health and disease both at the cellular and whole animal level. 

 **Functional Molecular Probes** 

 Hartley’s UofG laboratory designed and synthesised a suite of mitochondria\-targeted molecular probes. These have been used by Prof. Murphy *et al.* to elucidate the mitochondrial metabolic and redox signalling processes involved in oxidative stress and a wide range of diseases including reperfusion injury in the heart, stroke, neurodegeneration, cancer, ageing and inflammation. Recently this has been expanded to include cell permeable forms of mitochondrial metabolites. 


 Figure1:  The UofG Mito series of molecular probes accumulate several\-hundred\-fold in the mitochondrial matrix. MitoNeoD, MitoB and MitoA detect specific reactive species and report through their exomarkers MitoNeoOH, MitoP and MitoN. MitoPQ generates superoxide, while MitoCDNB removes the thiol antioxidant defence. 

 4\-<sup>n</sup>Octyl itaconate is a cell permeable version of the mitochondrial metabolite, itaconate, which is produced as an antioxidant negative feedback signal in inflammatory macrophages. 


 
**MitoB/MitoP:** Hydrogen peroxide is a key mediator in redox signalling, and is central to mitochondrial oxidative damage. The probe MitoB \(CAS Registry No. 1247025\-84\-8\) was developed by Hartley *et. al* in UofG from 2007 to 2011. This is comprised of a tetraphenylphosphonium \(TPP\) cation attached to an arylboronic acid. The TPP cation results in several\-hundred\-fold accumulation of the Mito molecular probes within the mitochondrial matrix, where the arylboronic acid moiety reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form a phenol, MitoP \(CAS 74597\-01\-6\). Quantifying the MitoP/MitoB ratio by liquid chromatography\-tandem mass spectrometry \(LC\-MS/MS\), against known amounts of deuterated standards added at extraction, enabled measurement of a weighted average of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within mitochondria of whole living organisms for the first time and this was reported by Hartley and Murphy in 2011 \[3.1\]. MitoB/P and the d15\-deuterated standards developed by Hartley *et. al.* provided the paradigm  for the exomarker approach for quantification of reactive species in cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms. 

 Building on this successful collaboration, Prof Hartley has designed and synthesised a suite of other molecular probes to specifically target key areas of mitochondrial biochemistry. Evidence of their efficacy and their applicability to a diverse range of applications was demonstrated by Prof. Murphy and a wider network of collaborators which includes medics and biomedical scientists. 

 **MitoPhotoDNP**: In 2012, Hartley designed and synthesised the photo\-activated protonophore, MitoPhotoDNP, which was demonstrated to depolarize mitochondria with complete spatio\- and temporal control \[3.2\]. 

 **MitoParaquat \(MitoPQ\)** was developed in 2015 and generates superoxide, specifically in the mitochondrial matrix without interfering with the biological machinery and so can be used in any cell, tissue or organism to study the effect of elevating mitochondrial ROS. \[3.3\]. 

 **MitoA/MitoN:** In 2017, UofG research developed MitoA and its accompanying deuterated internal standards for use with LC\-MS/MS in an exomarker approach \[3.1\]. These compounds address the lack of suitable probes to examine the role of hydrogen sulfide \(H<sub>2</sub>S\) on signalling pathways and cell function *in vivo* \[3.4\]. 

 **4\-<sup>n</sup>Octyl itaconate:** In 2018, Hartley designed 4\-<sup>n</sup>octyl itaconate \(CAS 3133\-16\-2\), a cell permeable version of the anti\-inflammatory mitochondrial metabolite, itaconic acid \[3.5\]. 4\-<sup>n</sup>Octyl itaconate \(marketed commercially as 4\-Octyl itaconate\) has been key to understanding the role of itaconate, the endogenous activator of the transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid\-2\-related factor 2 \(Nrf2\). Itaconate is produced as an antioxidant negative feedback signal in inflammatory macrophages. 

 **MitoCDNB:** The maintenance of mitochondrial thiol redox state is thought vital for cell survival. In 2019, MitoCDNB was developed to specifically remove the thiol antioxidant defence in mitochondria \[3.6\], enabling researchers, for the first time, to manipulate the organelle's thiol systems independently of those in other cell compartments. 

 More recent additions to the UofG suite of mitochondrial probes are **MitoNeoD**, a versatile and robust probe to assess changes in mitochondrial superoxide from isolated mitochondria to animal models, and **MitoGamide**, a potential therapeutic for oxidative damage during diabetes. 

 Together, this suite of mitochondrial molecular probes has provided a step\-change in understanding the role of mitochondrial metabolites in a variety of preparations from isolated mitochondria and cell culture, through to whole organs and organisms, and are used by laboratories across the globe.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Mitochondria are present in almost all animal, plant and fungal cell types, generating adenosine triphosphate \(ATP\), the energy currency of cells. Their role in cellular signalling is increasingly being understood and they are also key to cell death. Mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA can cause life\-threatening and currently incurable mitochondrial diseases which affect 1 in 4,300 adults. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a much wider phenomenon, and contributes to many common disorders in the general population, including heart disease, neurodegeneration and inflammation. Therefore, understanding the role of mitochondria in health and disease is critical to the treatment of any dysfunction but requires reliable and high fidelity tools such as the suite of molecular probes developed by Prof. Hartley. This has delivered commercial impacts in a specialised market, and contributed to a reduction in the number of animals required in research to develop therapies for common diseases. 

 **Commercial adoption of UofG probes:** 

 Cayman Chemical is a specialist manufacturer and supplier of biochemical reagents used primarily by pharmaceutical companies and universities life sciences research. Cayman Chemical has grown its customer base through the provision of a comprehensive portfolios of related products; they currently hold the largest portfolio of UofG mitochondria\-targeted molecular probes. 

 “*Starting in 2015, Cayman Chemical added MitoP and MitoB to our catalogue and quickly invested resources by building application notes and other web content to help promote these unique reagents. In addition, reagents were packaged both as a standalone reagent as well as value\-added kit formats*.”  \[5.1\] 

 Cayman Chemical also provides mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide measurements as a contracted service using MitoP/MitoB. Since the company’s introduction of MitoB in March 2015, the Hartley portfolio of products has had sales in over 15 countries \[text removed for publication.\] Within the United States alone, customers include biopharmaceutical companies, governmental laboratories, hospitals, private institutions, clinical research organisations, research laboratories and universities. 

 *“The portfolio of Hartley compounds available from Cayman recently expanded in 2018 with the inclusion of MitoPQ and octyl itaconate, further expanding the catalog of these reagents to researchers worldwide.”* \[5.1\] 

 AbCam, a leading international supplier of life science research tools, reports that, since its inclusion in the Abcam catalogue in 2016, MitoParaquat sales have grown year\-on\-year, \[text removed for publication\] with sales across Europe, Asia and North America enabling investigations into the role of mitochondria in areas including cancer biology, parasitology and inflammation. 

 **Non\-commercial distribution**: 

 UofG has also supplied its molecular probes to non\-direct collaborators, consistent with its commitment to promote widespread use of the compound. Since August 2013, they have been supplied to 43 institutions in 17 countries through Material Transfer Agreements. 

 The open\-access publication of synthesis protocols has enabled high\-volume users to synthesise probes themselves. The Director of the USA’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute noted that the ability to manufacture MitoPhotoDNP in\-house has saved them USD50,000\-100,000 in synthesis and development costs since 2013: 

 “*This probe opened up a whole new area of research into the structure of the mitochondria in health and disease. Frankly, without the demonstrations that this probe provided this area of research would still be struggling to provide direct evidence of a mitochondria conductive network in striated muscle. This is likely one of the major insights into the metabolic design of muscle in the last 50 years”* \[5.5a\]. 

 **Reducing the use of animals in research** 

 The breeding of transgenic animals for research purposes is highly cost\- and labour\-intensive, requiring the breeding of many animals over and beyond those used in the experiments. The Hartley suite of mitochondrial molecular probes reduces the need for animals in research \[5.5b\] by avoiding the need for knock\-out/knock\-in of key enzymes and in the case of MitoPhotoDNP allowing for the use of autologous controls \(where animals serve as their own control\). 

 We identified 31 institutions internationally which have published research articles using Hartley’s molecular probes since 2013, including in the study of disease aetiologies such as cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, neurology, metabolic disorders and aging. Of these,  19 laboratories were contacted whose research outputs used either wild\-type or transgenic mammals *in vivo/ex vivo;* 14 responded to a survey request \(74% return rate\). All revealed that the UofG molecular probes had reduced the number of animals used for research by \~25% on average by changing their experimental design. This was accomplished by reducing the requirement for breeding of transgenic animals, reducing the crossbreeding of transgenic animals and facilitating the use of more robust wild\-type animals. 

 *“The use of these compounds allowed us to decipher the mechanisms in vitro and carefully plan focused in vivo studies with limited mic*e.” Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University \[5.5c\] 

 *“The use of these compounds has… offered a more streamlined approach towards the effective assessment of the oxidative state of a cell in vivo. The ability to do this without a need for the crossing to complex reporter mice has been a major step forward”.* The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center \[5.5d\].

-  <ins>3 new collaborations between external partners,</ins> which empowered Field Studies Council staff, saved time in the field for students, led to better technical solutions for EDINA and the Environmental Systems Research Institute \(ESRI\), and shared best practice within the Joint Information Systems Centre \(JISC\) 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Funding from the Higher Education Academy resulted in the creation of a multi\-disciplinary team from the Universities of Chester \(lead institution\), Reading and Sheffield, which conducted research focused on the application of mobile technologies to solve pedagogic issues faced by practitioners and students during fieldwork. Known as the ‘Enhancing Fieldwork Learning’ \(EFL\) Team, the University of Chester staff involved were: 

-  Derek France \(1993\-present, Professor of Pedagogy in Geographical Sciences, Principal Investigator\) 

-  Katharine Welsh \(2010\-present, Postdoctoral Researcher \(2010\-2013\), Visiting Lecturer and Researcher \(2013\-2016\), Senior Lecturer \(2016\-present\) 

-  Victoria Powell \(2012\-2013, Postdoctoral Researcher to cover maternity leave\) 

 The partner staff and institutions involved with the research were: 

-  Julian Park \(1994\-present, Pro\-Vice Chancellor \(Education\), University of Reading\) 

-  Alice Mauchline \(2003\-present, Senior Research Fellow, University of Reading\) 

-  Brian Whalley \(2010\-present, Emeritus Professor, University of Sheffield\) 

-  Katherine Clark \(2015\-present, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Reading\) 

 The estimated Research Contribution from the University of Chester is as follows: 

-  Conception of the research idea: 50% 

-  Data Collection: 70% 

-  Journal publications: 65% 

-  Books and Book Chapters: 50% 

-  Workshops and conference outputs: 60% 

 Early research **\[R1\]** identified that 50% \(n=89\) practitioners wanted to integrate technology into fieldwork in order to develop student digital literacy, and 66% \(n=89\) also wanted to use technology to speed up data processing and analysis whilst out in the field. Furthermore, as a result of the increase to student tuition fees in 2012/13, and consequent university budgetary constraints and existing financial burdens for students, we **\[R2\]** identified that 23% \(n=27\) of Geography, Earth and Environmental Science departments in the UK planned to replace residential fieldwork with individual day trips, thereby demonstrating a clear need to increase time efficiency, whilst students were out in the field, in order to achieve the learning outcomes. 

 To remedy the issues identified, our subsequent research **\[R1,R3,R5\]** presented the first substantial investigation into the application of tablets, smart devices and the concept of Bring Your Own Device \(BYOD i.e. where students use their personal devices in the classroom/field\) for fieldwork. We were able to demonstrate that by deploying cost\-effective, portable devices e.g. tablets, time spent collecting and analysing data in the field was more efficient. We **\[R1\]** identified that 20% \(n=89\) of practitioners felt that staff reluctance or incompetence was a barrier to introducing technology into fieldwork, and subsequent research **\[R5\]** further supported this finding with practitioners perceiving a lack of support both for those using and who want to use BYOD within their fieldwork. 

 Our findings outlined that the upskilling of staff, to ensure they were sufficiently digitally literate, was a vital part of enhancing student digital literacy, employability and experience. Further research **\[R3, R5\]** demonstrated that students were comfortable with using mobile and app\-driven technologies for academic purposes, as they required signiﬁcantly less “set\-up” time due to student familiarity with the devices, thereby saving further time when out in the field. The findings suggested that providing students with the opportunity to personalise their own learning by using their own devices, further enhanced time efficiency during field work, which resulted in enhanced student engagement. Finally, our work on graduate attributes **\[R4\]** demonstrated an encouraging insight in that students recognise the relationship between mobile app use from fieldwork learning and how this influences their wider skill set for employability purposes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 We have achieved the impacts described below through national and international dissemination events \(01/08/13\-31/07/20\), including 7 participatory events, 15 conferences, and 18 workshops across 4 continents, where, for the first time, a range of interdisciplinary educators were exposed to the concept of using mobile technologies to enhance their fieldwork practice. This has resulted in impact for the following beneficiary groups: 

###  National and international impact on teaching staff in HE/FE 

-  Our research findings outlined the need to support educators to effectively embed technology into fieldwork. The team therefore ran 7 participatory events, where 222 educators from 66 UK and 18 international HE/FE providers, 14 non\-academic organisations, and 3 schools were able to gain practical experience of applying mobile technology in a fieldwork environment. This has led to <ins>222 upskilled and more digitally literate educators</ins><ins>,</ins> many of whom have embedded skills learned at the events into their own fieldwork practice: “The video compilation exercises \[from the event\] have given me the confidence to produce my own videos to explain troublesome concepts.” **\[S1a\],** “I gained confidence in the use of technology and have no fears about using iPads and mobile phones in fieldwork.” **\[S1b\].** 

-  Where practitioners have embedded mobile devices, <ins>fieldwork has been more efficient, saving students time and reducing departmental costs</ins> “The iPads have been embedded into the Conservation Biology activities to help address staff\-student ratios, so the \~60 students feel adequately supported and have confidence to complete the task in a timely fashion.” **\[S2a\]**; “The EFL project has had a significant impact on MSc teaching in SBS…at the end of the field practical session the results from individual student groups were then realised on screen as an annotated campus map and a discussion of strengths, weaknesses and lessons\-learned” **\[S2b\]**. 

  

-  <ins>Educator attitudes towards technology have been transformed</ins>. The EFL team won an Advance HE Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence \(CATE\) in 2018 with an *additional* ‘spotlight’ recognition received at the awards ceremony for “multi\-institutional and multi\-disciplinary collaboration which demonstrated a transformational impact on attitudes towards the use of technology to enhance fieldwork learning” **\[S3a\]**. 

###  Impact on national and international students in HE/FE 

 Our research and events have led to educator upskilling, therefore students nationally and internationally have: 

-  Benefitted from enhanced learning as they are <ins>more engaged</ins> during their time in the field “Bringing digital stories into my fieldwork teaching practice has actively engaged my students” **\[S4a\]**; “\[it\] enhanced the way in which students engage with qualitative data in the field…this developed both student and tutor confidence in their applicability to everyday teaching” **\[S4b\]**;” \[it has\]… made group work more engaging” **\[S4c\].** Students also recognised how the technology had engaged them “it helped me think and expand upon ideas and problems” **\[S4d\]**. 

-  <ins>Improved their digital literacy and enhanced inclusion</ins> “Having made a video \[at the EFL event\] ... my 1st year students now produce a 4 min video on a research topic.” **\[S5a\]**; “I've been told that the ways in which I've been able to help people use technology to support fieldwork has been transformational…The EFL community really champion education and are open to adopting inclusive approaches to education, the work I'm able to do has been inspired and informed by the collaborations and conversations I've had with EFL attendees” **\[S5b\].** 

-  <ins>Enhanced their employability skills</ins> “I attended the workshop ... we learned how to use technology in the field ... I took iPads/minis on an ERASMUS\-funded trip to Iceland in 2014… Students make videos from their photos and videos and these are uploaded onto a WordPress site …I use the blog/video when writing student references. My fieldtrip partners with UMass Dartmouth \(USA\), EAFIT and Universidad de Antioquia \(Colombia\) and University of Akureyri \(Iceland\). The UMass colleague also now incorporates a blog and video website within their teaching.  The pan\-European nature of the trip ensured a wide dissemination of good practice...” **\[S6a**\]; “Students are able to learn new skills as well as the traditional learning from a field course... We have uploaded all their films to the department’s YouTube channel, providing them each with a web presence which is useful for their employability” **\[S6b\].** 

-  <ins>Transformed their perceptions of using mobile devices for fieldwork</ins>. Our research **\[R3\]** showed that 72% of students \(n= 173\) stated that their perceptions of using devices had improved during the course of the fieldwork. Some students described a complete change in their perceptions of using the device “from feeling sceptical to feeling dependent on its use.” **\[S3b\]** 

 **Impact on teaching staff and students in secondary schools and further education** 

-  <ins>Digital literacy has also improved in 3 schools</ins> as a result of engagement with our research and events, “I've taught hundreds of students in the time since \[the event\], and they have been exposed to new ideas, technology, Google Forms, VR and other exciting opportunities” **\[S7\]**. 

###  Impact on non\-academic organisations 

 As a result of attending an EFL, new collaborations between organisations occurred and further impact within those organisations took place. 

-  <ins>Collaboration between the Field Studies Council and The Open University</ins> to develop the Field Network System which “enables the FSC to extend the time students spend in the field and facilitates student discussion of their results by enabling them to contextualise their findings at the fieldwork site,” thereby engaging the students and enabling deeper learning **\[S8a\].** 

-  Collaboration between EFL, EDINA and ESRI led to <ins>better technological solutions to field\-based problems being developed</ins><ins>:</ins> “\[Event\] participants gave invaluable feedback on our Fieldwork GB app… through our involvement with the project we feel more confident that we are building useful tools and understand the needs of potential users” **\[S8b\].** 

-  Through attending the EFL event, further <ins>good practice has been applied and shared by colleagues at the Joint Information Systems Committee \(JISC\) both nationally and internationally</ins><ins>:</ins> “The events that Katharine \[EFL\] facilitated were designed to foster and share innovation and I took away numerous ideas…I was able to take this new knowledge skillset back into my practice and it influenced workshops that I ran for the HE and FE sectors on technology enhanced learning, particularly digital storytelling that I was also able to incorporate into presentations at an international and UK conference” **\[S8c\].** 

###  Impact on learned societies 

 As a result of our research, events and collaboration, there has been an <ins>expansion of the British Ecological Society</ins> with the formation of a Teaching and Learning Special Interest Group: “Our relationship with the EFL has helped the BES demonstrate and build support for.... teaching\-focussed members ... a special interest group.... supporting early career researchers and lecturers in developing their teaching practice” **\[S9\].** 

###  Commercial Impact 

-  There have been 4,657 chapter downloads of the book written by the project team, which totals a <ins>commercial impact for Springer</ins> \(publisher\) of £93,093.43 in sales **\[S10a\]**. 

-  As a result of direct engagement with our research and dissemination events, 6 UK institutions **\[S2a, S4c, S10d, S10e, S10f, S10g, S10h\]** are known to have purchased their own field\-based mobile technologies, leading to <ins>commercial impacts for 8 companies</ins> **\[S10\]**: Apple, Samsung, Panasonic, Griffin, GoPro, Oculus, Raspberry Pi and Proscope. The Field Studies Council **\[S10b\]** has also estimated that they have purchased at least 250 tablet devices \(Apple and Android\). The total commercial impact for technology companies is estimated to be £199,978.74 **\[S10c\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Current Rwandan government figures state that over a million people died during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. The country’s infrastructure was destroyed, family memory ruptured, Rwandan society left severely wounded. Given the sensitive political context, KCL research shows artistic testimony plays a key role in opening up new ways to remember genocide victims and explore post\-conflict identities. However, in the first decade after genocide, too often stories were told by outsiders with little understanding of Rwanda’s cultural and historical complexity. 

 Zoe Norridge’s work addresses this bias, building on eight years of research into Rwandan agency and artistic practice, to foreground Rwandan voices and assist Rwandan photographers, writers and survivors in reaching new audiences. Her projects focus on photography \(the most underdeveloped post\-genocide art\) and survivor testimonies \(where there were significant gaps in circulation\). All are grounded in collaborations with institutions in Rwanda \(Kigali Center for Photography, Huza Press\) and the UK \(Autograph ABP, Ishami Foundation\). As a result: 

-  Rwandan artists developed new skills and networks and accessed new global audiences. 

-  Survivor voices reached wider publics through translation and inclusion in educational fora. 

-  Exhibition visitors, radio listeners and schools increased their understanding of Rwanda. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda is too often remembered through the eyes of outsiders in sensationalist terms with a focus on the infliction of extreme violence. Peer\-reviewed KCL research shows that foregrounding Rwandan voices through the arts can enrich understandings of life during and after genocide, change reductive assumptions about violence in the region and reveal areas of resistance and resilience. This is substantiated by four key findings. 

###  International media focus on violence may miss nuance of ongoing suffering. 

 KCL research, drawing on close readings of key imagery, shows how visiting journalists have instrumentalised survivor experiences to retrospectively witness violence not covered in 1994 by Western media \[1\]. Photographers have shown wounded survivors amongst the dead so as to render visible the brutal killings not captured on film. Such images have a testimonial role. But asking survivors to stand in for the dead denies their agency and difficulties in the present \[1\]. For Rwanda to rebuild, attention must be drawn not only to past violence but to its legacies today. 

###  Artists can communicate the particularity of painful experiences. 

 Literary theorists writing about previous genocides have often stressed the ways in which the enormity of such violence renders survivors’ experiences ‘unrepresentable’. KCL research identifies the innovative ways in which African writers can and do represent pain and generate empathy and/or activism in their readers \[2\]. This is achieved through formal and poetic innovation, exploration of chronic as well as acute pain, unpicking the range of meanings attached to pain and explorations of strategies for living with pain. Such aesthetic work, across a range of genres, complements and extends legal transitional justice processes and more factual witnessing \[3,4\]. 

###  Rwandan accounts convey humanity, complicate timescales and add new perspectives. 

 Accounts of genocide by Rwandans and visitors present in the country in 1994 and immediately after are united in writing against genocide. However, the most compelling explorations of the antecedents to genocide, cultural understandings of the violence and personal human cost of genocide come from Rwandans themselves: from encounters with survivors related by visitors or directly through Rwandan storytelling \[3\]. Rwandan accounts tend to stress violence from 1959 onwards, intergenerational memory and the variety of responses from ordinary people, including areas of moral ambivalence \[4\]. Aesthetically complex, these representations show the quirks and particularities of experience that foreground humanity in resistance to genocidal ideology \[1,2,4,5\]. 

###  Understandings of the past are extended through ethical international collaboration. 

 KCL’s collaborative, practice\-based research with Rwandan artists reveals how international collaboration can support the aesthetic development of testimonial art forms. Dialogical translation with Yolande Mukagasana uncovered ways in which her writing was shaped by outside forces and could be reworked with greater agency and cultural particularity for new audiences through, for example, inclusion of more Kinyarwanda phrases and replacement of French with Rwandan metaphors \[5\]. Similarly, collaborative work between Rwandan and Argentine photographers demonstrated that cross\-cultural conversations can potentially enrich creative practice \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Drawing on research findings about gaps in representations of Rwanda and the need for more Rwandan\-authored narratives to deepen understandings of the country’s difficult past and complex present, KCL\-initiated collaborative projects have supported Rwandan voices and changed local and international perceptions of Rwanda’s past through the Arts. 

###  Photography: capacity building with photographers, enriching audience perceptions. 

 KCL research shows there is a lack of internationally circulating Rwandan\-authored photography and that this curtails understanding of the genocide and its legacies today \[1,6\]. To address this, between 2014 and 2019 KCL engaged in a range of collaborations with photographers and cultural institutions to identify the reasons why this is the case and design interventions to address these underlying needs. These interventions facilitated photographers acquiring technical knowledge and new conceptual frameworks alongside access to international networks and new audiences. As a result, audiences have engaged with more complex representations of Rwanda and their perceptions of previously dehumanised groups became ‘more human’. These projects supported the professionalisation of the Arts in Rwanda, leading to the longer\-term viability and visibility of Rwandan\-authored images. There have been 10 projects in this area, the following are highlights. 

####  A full cycle of change: Kigali workshop and London exhibition \(2013–14\) 

 In November 2013, in response to the identification of limited technical skills and networks as key needs driving the lack of internationally\-circulating Rwandan photography, Norridge convened a workshop in Kigali in collaboration with UK\-based human rights and photography organisation Autograph ABP. The 10 participants reported increased technical proficiency and a newfound sense of artistic community: “I spent over seven years struggling with aperture, shutter speed and ISO. Now I understand how they work together to give me what I want”; “This was a rare opportunity \[for photographers\] to meet, share experiences and learn”. The photographers maintain this network, sharing knowledge, contacts and feedback. One, Jean Bizimana, decided to become a professional photographer as a result of the workshop: “Dr Zoe’s work made me who I am: from being an orphan who doesn’t matter to being a well\-respected photographer” \[A\]. 

 Images from this workshop and two further KCL initiatives were shown at an AHRC\-funded exhibition in the Inigo Rooms, Somerset House, curated by Zoe Norridge \(KCL\) and Mark Sealy MBE \(Autograph ABP\). This exhibition addressed perceptions of Rwandans as less than human, generated by reductive press coverage during the genocide and enduringly problematic representational tropes afterwards, offering little understanding of Rwandan culture and agency \[1\]. Rwanda in Photographs: Death Then, Life Now challenged these prejudices by showcasing Rwandan creativity. Seen by 5,000 visitors and gaining international media coverage, it was the only group show of Rwandan\-authored photography for the 20th anniversary of the genocide. Press comments included: “Too often the country is reduced to images of violence and death, as seen through the eyes of outsiders. For this exhibition, Rwandans have challenged this gaze and now show us their country through their own eyes” \( *The British Blacklist*\); “Three cheers for an exhibition that is ordinary. Applause is deserved because it’s about an African country but it’s not about starvation, malnutrition, refugees, conflict, famine or environmental catastrophe” \( *Oneworld*\); “Each photographer offers their own unique insight into Rwanda” \( *Londonist*\) \[B\]. Quantitative data was collected from exhibition visitors in collaboration with social psychologist Keon West \(Goldsmiths\). Drawing on infrahumanisation measures developed by Leyens et al \(2001\), researchers measured the extent to which visitors perceived Rwandans as less than human before and after viewing the photographs. The results showed that after visiting the exhibition, participants saw Rwandans as statistically significantly ‘more human’ \[C\]. 

 The accompanying event series extended this impact. KCL engaged with the Rwandan diaspora and High Commission through a commemoration ceremony and reception that brought the community into King’s. Speaker events in the exhibition space connected artists across disciplines and provided a means for participants, who included three Rwanda\-based photographers, to extend their networks. In addition, a workshop with photo editors from international NGOs, photo agencies and media outlets addressed the question of why international organisations consistently commissioned foreign photographers to work in Rwanda. Mark Sealy MBE explains: “This workshop brought together key cultural gatekeepers who went on to shape a significant shift in working practices for NGOs and media outlets who now increasingly commission local photographers from African countries. The workshop provided a space for conversations that contributed to NGOs making policy changes to support this transformation in the sector” \[D\]. 

 This set of interventions demonstrated how research insights combined with needs identification led to collaborative interventions \(workshop and exhibition\) that generated change for specific groups \(Rwandan photographers, UK exhibition visitors, commissioning editors\), addressing the original research insight \(lack of Rwandan imagery\). Subsequent interventions have focused on early phases of this cycle, using research to address artistic needs. 

####  Extending impact through specific training programmes and supportive partnerships \(2015–19\) 

 Two workshops in 2015 and 2019 addressed Rwandan photographers’ collaboratively\-identified need to expand their aesthetic languages to explore loss \[2,6\] and human rights, in order to extend their artistic practice and access fields where they had previously been absent \[1, 6\]. 

 Material produced for the Rwanda in Photographs exhibition focused on changing perceptions of the present rather than on revisiting history, but King’s research also shows that creative explorations of the past help with processing and humanising the ongoing cost of genocide \[2,3\]. In interviews, artists explained they were still seeking new visual languages to explore their personal stories, a finding confirmed in King’s research on use of symbolism in Rwandan photography \[1\]. To address this, King’s participated in the AHRC network Children of Political Violence, connecting artists in Rwanda and Argentina, a country with an internationally\-recognised arts scene. In 2015, Norridge convened a workshop in Gisenyi \(Rwanda\) with mentoring from Lucila Quieto \(Argentina\) for four Rwandan photographers who lost their parents as children. South\-South dialogue about symbolic languages of loss enabled photographers to explore their personal stories for the first time. All participants reported a paradigm shift in their conception of photography’s potential. Gadi Habumugisha commented: “I used to take pictures that other people and NGOs wanted me to take. But this time it was different. I had to create things in my mind and then take the photographs. When I saw Lucila’s images I learnt that I can create something in me and then show it. I took pictures about absence, what I felt growing up in the orphanage, what the orphanage was like and the community there” \[E\]. These impacts endure in their practice today. 

 With increasing numbers of Rwandan photographers working professionally, KCL’s later collaborative workshop in Kigali in 2019 addressed a specific need for more literacy in human rights cultures, the focus of many international funding calls in the region. Facilitated by Billy Kahora \(Kenya\), Sarah Waiswa \(Uganda\) and Liz Hingley \(UK\), this brought together 8 photographers and 6 writers. Participants reported: increased understanding of international conceptions of human rights, greater confidence when conceptualising projects and applying for funding and realisation of the potential for the arts to open up new conversations in Rwanda’s relatively restricted political sphere. One commented: “I had paid little attention to how pictures can convey powerful messages in terms of human rights cultures. This workshop opened my eyes and made me look at pictures differently” \[F\]. Since the workshop, 4 photographers obtained human rights related grants. One writer, Alain\-Jules Hirwa, published two related pieces, finished a poetry collection on human rights and founded *Tea House*, a new literary magazine, saying: “I realized that, if we want to tell our own stories, we should have platforms that understand us” \[F\]. 

 The 2014 exhibition professional stakeholder workshop underlined that for photography to develop as a sustainable sector in Rwanda \(ensuring wider circulation of Rwandan\-authored images\) regional and international appreciation for Rwandan photography needed building. Since 2018, King’s has collaborated with Jacques Nkinzingabo’s Kigali Center for Photography. Norridge programmed 7 multi\-partner events and designed the website for the Center’s first Kigali Photo Fest in 2019 \[G\], which connected local and international audiences with photography from Rwanda and the rest of Africa. Artists and public attendees deepened their understanding of photography in the region. *FOCUS* magazine commented: “After the controversy over the absence of African artists at the 50th anniversary of the Rencontres d’Arles \[the world’s most prestigious photography festival\], the Kigali Photo Fest throws down the gauntlet to those curators and European experts who claimed last June that they ‘were unable to identify new networks and seemed to always be talking to the same esoteric set of people on the continent’” \[G\]. 

###  Testimony: extending circulation of Rwandan survivor voices through translation. 

 In 2019, KCL, in collaboration with Rwandan publisher Huza Press, brought a key Rwandan survivor testimony to new audiences for the first time through translation – increasing Rwandan and international understandings of the personal cost of genocide. King’s research established the importance of survivor voices for conveying compelling and nuanced narratives about Rwanda’s complex past \[1,3,4\]. However, many early survivor testimonies were published in French and Rwanda has changed languages to favour English. Rwandans who grew up in exile in Anglophone countries, and the new generation of young people educated in English, are unable to access key texts about their past. Lack of testimonies in translation also meant that students in Anglophone countries were encountering Rwanda through accounts by visiting outsiders. 

 Norridge changed this by translating Mukagasana’s *La mort ne veut pas de moi* \(1997\), the first survivor testimony to be published after the genocide, as *Not My Time to Die* \(2019\). This translation project had a significant impact on Mukagasana herself who clarified how and why she wrote the French edition two decades earlier and collaborated on updates including a new Afterword \[H\]. Publisher Huza Press commented: “\[This\] translation has been our most successful publication to date in terms of distribution reach, publicity and sales \(with close to 2000 copies sold so far world\-wide\). The new networks that publishing this book has built for us are important not just for reaching audiences with this particular title, but in enabling us to build a wider platform for Rwandan voices more broadly” \[H\]. Artists who participated in the production \(Burundian photographer Chris Schwagga, Ugandan writer Doreen Baingana and Kenyan copyeditor Otieno Owino\) and dissemination \(Ishyo Arts Director Carole Karemera\), also benefited from strengthening regional artistic networks. As a result, Anglophone Rwandans were able to read a key literary testimony for the first time and audiences were able to encounter Mukagasana and her testimony through events and media coverage in Rwanda, the UK, Nigeria \(Aké Festival\), Kenya and South Africa \[H\]. Anglophone educators are also now able to teach this foundational Rwandan\-authored testimony \[H\]. 

###  Education: extending reach of Rwandan survivor testimony into schools. 

 KCL’s ongoing collaboration with the Ishami Foundation has facilitated the use of survivor testimony in materials and events, providing new ways for educators to share Rwanda’s history through local perspectives and enriching teacher and student understandings of the past and its relevance. In 2017 Norridge was elected Chair of the majority\-Rwandan trustee board and works closely with Rwandan survivor\-founder and CEO Eric Murangwa Eugene MBE. Intertwined with her research into the importance of Rwandan survivor accounts, the organisation’s mission is to “draw on genocide survivor experience to connect us all to our common humanity”. KCL and Ishami Foundation have: 

-  Written, designed and circulated educational materials about the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi for teachers and students across the UK, foregrounding Rwandan survivor testimony collected as part of Ishami trustee Jo Ingabire’s 100 Stories project \[I\]. 

-  Increased personal engagement with genocide for teachers and students from 25 London schools participating in Ishami’s 25 Schools for Kwibuka 25 campaign, which included a workshop and commemoration with survivors and the Mayor of London at City Hall in 2019 \[I\]. 

 Mayor of London Sadiq Khan wrote to commend the organisation on this “vital and moving event”, asserting that: “Remembering the lives lost by genocide and standing in solidarity with survivors is hugely important, not only in honouring the memory of those who died and acknowledging the experience of their surviving relatives, but also teaching future generations about the past and inspiring them to pursue unity in the present day” \[I\]. Evaluation forms and pupil pledges show this work helped schools understand the contemporary relevance of genocide and motivated students and teachers to commit to taking action to tackle prejudice \[I\] **.** 

###  Radio: building international understanding between Rwandans and BBC Radio listeners. 

 Public perceptions of Rwanda are beset by forgetting and obfuscation. 53% of the UK population cannot name a genocide since the Holocaust and there is a long history of Western attitudes towards Rwanda being shaped by media simplifications, mis\-information, prejudice and genocide denial \(Thompson, 2007\). By contrast King’s research has explored the complexity of memory practices and of the multiple groups involved in rebuilding Rwanda after genocide \[3,4\]. Named a BBC AHRC New Generation Thinker in 2012, Norridge has bridged gaps between public and academic knowledge, fostering intercultural understanding between the UK and Rwanda \[J\]. Highlights include a discussion about the Tate exhibition Conflict, Time, Photography \(2014\) where she stressed the need for local photography, and a debate with Phil Clark about the strengths and shortcomings of the BBC’s *Black Earth Rising* \(2018\) \(both Radio 3 *Free Thinking*\). In 2013–14, Norridge wrote and presented a 45\-minute Radio 3 Sunday feature *Living with Memory in Rwanda*. This research\-based documentary addressed the contribution of survivor testimonies, commemoration practices, memorials, legal processes and artistic interventions to the creation of collective memory in Rwanda. Named *The Spectator*’s “most heart\-stopping moment on air” for 2014, it won a Gold Award at the New York Radio Festival. In 2019, Norridge presented *Rwanda’s Returnees*, a 30\-minute, AiB Award Shortlisted, Radio 4 documentary based on her research about the significant contributions made by artists returning from the diaspora to shape contemporary Rwandan culture \[4\]. These programmes enabled a rebuilding of trust between the BBC and Rwanda after the broadcast of *Rwanda: The Untold Story*, widely criticised for genocide denial \(Melvern, 2020\), as shown by the granting of a media permit to Norridge in 2019 when the BBC Kinyarwanda service had been shut down and reporters refused access. The Rwandan High Commission commented: “Such a programme, drawing on careful long\-term research and Rwandan experiences, resonated with both Rwandans in the diaspora and at home, and went some way towards restoring trust between Rwandans and the BBC” \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Royal British Legion \(TRBL\) provides recreational opportunities for the whole Armed Forces Community \(AFC\). Established in 1948, the Legion’s Breaks Service, a cornerstone for ex\-military recreation and a provider of support and well\-being for the whole services community, reached an average of 11,800 beneficiaries per year at an average annual cost of GBP6.7 million. Beneficiaries ranged in age from new\-borns to centenarians. 

 The Centre for the Study of Crime, Criminalisation and Social Exclusion \(CCSE\) led a major national, transformative, outcome\-based evaluation of the Service \(2017\-18\). The evidence\-base from this wide spectrum analysis contributed to a TRBL organisational review of provision in the area of well\-being, recovery and veteran support with rising incidences of post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) becoming a key concern. 

 The Break Service evaluation contributed to a major strategic realignment that saw an end to free wellbeing holidays and the closure of the four Breaks Centres in England in January 2020 and an accelerated closure in Portrush, Northern Ireland in March 2020 due to the COVID\-19 pandemic \(original closure date was set for June 2020\). In so doing, this represented a saving of nearly GBP7 million pounds per year. The saved revenue has been channelled directly into schemes that support beneficiaries with the greatest need. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the inception of the Service in 1948, this investigation was the first robust national evaluation conducted on the TRBL Breaks Service. It specifically examined the Service’s impact on mental and physical wellbeing, social inclusion and sense of community, personal relationships and confidence of adult beneficiaries, as well as on the confidence and self\-esteem of military children \[Sec.3, Ref.1\]. AFC organisations nationally are facing unprecedented levels of mental health issues among veterans. PTSD takes approximately seven years to manifest itself so a spike in PTSD cases is a significant concern following the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. There has also been an alarming rise in the number of suicides among serving and ex\-serving personnel \(seventy\-one people in 2018 alone\). The MoD spends GBP22 million per year on mental health care for veterans with a further GBP6 million in support channelled via the NHS. However, AFC charities argue this global figure is insufficient in the current climate given the levels of poor mental health care and military\-related suicides. To underscore the severity of the issues, Combat Stress \(CS\), an AFC\-related mental health charity, reported in 2020 that it would be unable to take on any new referrals in England and Wales. CS is facing up to a catastrophic reduction in its funding partly due to a cut in its NHS funding \(overall funding of GBP16 million reduced to GBP10 million\). The crisis\-hit social care system in England, an ageing population and greater life expectancy are also leading to unprecedented demands on AFC charities. Decades of squeezed government funding have left older veterans and older people more generally with inadequate care and crippling costs in the face of strict qualification rules for NHS continuing health care. The AFC is changing, and the types of support needed are growing increasingly complex in the current era. Those charged with delivering that support need better training and staff development \[Sec.3, Ref.2\]. Since 2016, TRBL has seen a 20% increase in people needing basic support with housing, financial issues, mental health and well\-being, and mobility. In this time, it has also seen the average expenditure per household through its immediate needs funding rise 45% from GBP900 to GBP1330. In recent years, the regulatory framework in which charities operate has rightly become more robust to ensure organisations operate to the highest standards. However regulatory changes including the introduction of the Fundraising Regulator and General Data Protection Regulation have increased pressure on the charity’s existing resources. The evaluation was innovative in 3 key ways: 

1.  **A multifaceted methodological and data collection procedure collected intelligence from a variety of stakeholder groups** \[Sec.3, Ref.1\] including a wide\-range of beneficiary groups and Break Service staff via thirteen different research methods. With a strong focus on what works, the strategic research design engaged with and elicited the views of the diverse stakeholder groups including seldom\-heard groups. 

1.  **The service evaluation engaged with 2,354 participants ranging in age from young children to centenarian veterans, enabling the evidencing and showcasing of many incidences of good practice but this wide ranging sample also brought an evidence\-based understanding to areas requiring improvement and where procedures and practices needed to be ramped up to adequately safeguard beneficiaries** \[Sec.3, Ref.1\]. For example, child breaks provision by an out\-sourced provider were found to be highly problematic in some regards. The research exposed concerns over the safeguarding of children during adventure breaks. The LJMU researchers disclosed these promptly at the second in a series of Knowledge Exchange Events \(KEEs\). The impact of this proactive and iterative process of information sharing was that adventure breaks for 2018\-19 were suspended with immediate effect pending a thorough review. 

1.  **The evaluation utilised an effective method for the ongoing systematic monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the Service on beneficiary wellbeing. A bespoke Breaks Centre Wellbeing Scale \(BCBWBS\) was devised** which drew upon the widely known and internationally respected Warwick\-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale \(WEMWBS\) \[Sec.3, Ref.1\]. The BCBWBS demonstrated that wellbeing improves substantially during holiday breaks and then largely returns to pre\-break levels. In more detail, the BCBWBS revealed that the observed differences in average scores at the start of the break compared to the scores at the end of the break were statistically significant \(scores rose from 50 at start of break to 53 at end of break\). Up to six weeks after the break, BCBWBS returned to the levels observed before the holiday. The finding that wellbeing scores fall back to previous levels 4\-6 weeks after the break is in line with other published studies that identify a short\-lived impact of holidays on wellbeing.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The detailed findings of the national evaluation have significantly impacted upon the future of TRBL’s Breaks Service both at the local Break Centre level and at the national level through policy developments. The impact of the research evaluation on TRBL Breaks Service policy and practice is summarised below: 

 **Influence on Evidence Based Decision\-making Process** 

 TRBL published a foreword \[Sec.5, Ref.1\] to the National evaluation of Breaks Services 2017\-18 report in which the Director of Operations at TRBL stated “this report details an intensive and all\-encompassing 12\-month evaluation of the Legion’s Breaks Services. The intended focus of the research was to measure the impact of the service upon the physical well\-being, mental wellbeing, social isolation and exclusion, personal relationships, and confidence/self\-esteem of beneficiaries – yet the research team’s tireless flexibility when faced with a complex and wide reaching piece has led to a much richer set of findings than we had anticipated. This approach should be acknowledged as one, which has brought academic rigour and accessibility together throughout the research process and in the compiling of the report, which follows. Through an insightful set of findings and recommendations we have gained knowledge about the experiences of beneficiaries and staff, as well as an understanding of current policy. While I commend this document in its entirety, I also note the many methods, which were brought to this evaluative research design. This has helped inform a richer understanding of the relationship between hospitality and well\-being interventions, and indeed how the Legion specifically has created a unique association between the two. I would also draw attention to the important lessons gleaned about Break Centre locations \(and their associated strengths and challenges\); the needs of beneficiaries now and in the future, eligibility, and the voices of staff which will no doubt inform our forthcoming strategy” \[Sec.5, Ref.1 Ref.2\]. 

 **Impact on Continuous Service Improvement** 

 A series of KEEs with the research sponsors enabled a cyclical process of immediate information sharing to take place and on each occasion, the LJMU team were tasked with answering the key questions of what works and what does not work? On one such occasion, breaks provision by an out\-sourced provider were found to be highly problematic in some regards. The research exposed concerns over the safeguarding of children during adventure breaks. The LJMU researchers disclosed these promptly at the second in a series of KEEs \[Sec.5, Ref.2\]. The impact of this proactive and iterative process of information sharing was that adventure breaks for 2018\-19 were suspended with immediate effect pending a thorough review \[Sec.5, Ref.3\]. 

 **Impact on the Future of TRBL Breaks Services** 

 TRBL’s subsequent cost\-benefit analysis and strategic re\-alignment of all its charitable activities followed LJMU’s report, which pinpointed the short\-term impact of holidays \[Sec.5, Ref.3 Ref.4\]. In addition, the evaluation report also highlighted evidence where the Breaks Service could act as a meaningful gatekeeper to other Legion services and services available more generally through wider partnerships but also where the Service was falling short in this regard. In light of the financial investment in the Breaks Service amidst other pressing concerns, the TRBL Executive Board and Board of Trustees on the advice of a working group established in January 2019, led by the Director of Operations took the decision to move to a managed closure of the whole Breaks Service. Aside from the short\-term impacts of breaks on wellbeing, the key decisive factors in this major decision to phase out the Breaks Service was the following three factors: 

1.  The cost of operating the four UK Break Centres was GBP4.8 million per annum. 

1.  Well\-developed links between the Breaks Service and other Legion welfare were not evident in the evaluation report. 

1.  The key service offer from Break Centres of providing a free holiday to beneficiaries was considered to be of less relative value than other TRBL services designed to meet needs that are more significant. 

 The GBP4.8 million direct saving from the closure of the Breaks Centres and the global figure of approximately GBP6.7 million per year derived from the closure of all break\-related services has enabled TRBL to focus investment on areas it considers highly significant for the twenty\-first century AFC. There has been a rapid increase in the number of people TRBL supports that are facing multiple and often complex issues that require far greater resources than current delivery routes support, with the average expenditure per household through Immediate Needs Grants increasing from GBP900 to GBP1,330 \(45%\) since 2016. The costs associated with providing residential and nursing care within TRBL care homes have also increased significantly over the last ten years at a time of long\-term reductions in local authority funding for adult social care. Funds saved through ceasing the delivery of Break Services is being re\-invested in increased funding for Immediate Needs Grants and Care Services \[Sec.5, Ref.3\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In the mid 2000’s, an outbreak of Clostridioides \(previously known as Clostridium\) difficile infection caused hundreds of infections and deaths in the UK. King’s research provided strategies to help combat this disease in Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust \(GSTT\) by improving active case finding and laboratory diagnosis. King’s also evaluated and introduced unique infection control interventions which led to the development and adoption of novel therapeutic approaches referenced in NHS guidance. This has resulted in a significant reduction in all\-cause mortality, infection rates and disease recurrence locally at GSTT and nationally across England. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Emergence of Clostridioides difficile Infection \(CDI\) as a major healthcare associated pathogen.** C difficile produces toxins that damage the colon lining, causing symptoms ranging from mild, self\-limiting diarrhoea to colitis, perforation, sepsis and death. It primarily affects older patients with co\-morbidities, particularly those who have been exposed to antibiotics or those who are immunosuppressed. In the mid 2000’s CDI grew to become one of the most important healthcare associated infections. In 2006 \- 2007 rates of a North American hypervirulent strain were introduced in the UK, with cases increasing to over 55,000 per year and with a case fatality rate of 20\-30% \(14,000 deaths/year\). 

 **King’s research shows C. difficile infections are unrecognised and under\-reported across the NHS \[1\].** In 2011, we focused on improving diagnosis / case detection and found that there was significant under\-recognition of cases reported nationally, as a result of poorly performing diagnostic assays. Our research identified the diagnostic methods being used, finding that 70% were using insensitive methods leading to under diagnosis. Our research demonstrated the superiority of a multistep algorithmic approach incorporating PCR \(Polymerase Chain Reaction\) testing. We showed that earlier, more accurate case finding was key to effective infection control interventions. 

 **King’s demonstrate that disease prevention measures have been highly effective in reducing hospital infections.** In 2015, we evaluated a number of infection control interventions **\[2\]**. We observed that these interventions \(along with improvements in hand hygiene and antimicrobial stewardship\) have resulted in significant reductions in the rate of infection over the last decade. Our collaborative research with five other NHS Trusts also demonstrated the effectiveness of the control measures that we have adopted, showing only 7% of cases could plausibly result from in hospital transmission \(compared with an average of 20% across all hospitals\) **\[3\]**. 

 **King’s show that new treatment approaches using the antibiotic fidaxomicin dramatically improve patient outcomes in CDI.** Our work involving seven NHS Trusts and 1168 patients **\[4\]** has shown how the widespread adoption of a new antibiotic \(fidaxomicin\) to treat CDI has numerous advantages including significantly reduced recurrence rates \(from 16.3 to 3.1%\) and lower all\-cause mortality \(from 17.3 to 6.3%\). It demonstrated that the approach of using fidaxomicin as a first line agent resulted in greater benefit than those Trusts where it was introduced on a more restrictive basis. A further study has also shown that fidaxomicin use is associated with reduced contamination of the hospital environment \(reduction of 20.8%\) **\[2\]**. 

 We participated in a randomized controlled trial of a novel dosing \(extended\-pulsed\) regimen of this drug, which results in improved clinical cure and recurrence rates compared with standard therapies \(reduction of 11%\) **\[5\]**. We also looked at the effect of fidaxomicin in special groups where information on the use this drug is lacking, since these patients were excluded from phase 3 trials. This study **\[5\]** demonstrated the effectiveness of the drug in these poorly studied groups. We have shown the cost effectiveness of this drug in both UK and EU settings using modelling techniques **\[7\]**. In terms of quality\-adjusted life year gain, the higher cost of first line use fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin \(another antibiotic used to treat CDI\) is offset by lower total hospitalisation costs as a result of lower recurrence rates **\[7\]**. 

 **Research by King’s establishes Faecal Microbiota Transplant as an effective therapy for the treatment of recurrent CDI.** Faecal Microbiota Transplant \(FMT\) is a therapeutic strategy to correct the underlying intestinal dysbiosis that is associated with CDI. This involves transferring a consortium of diverse microorganisms from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of affected patients. It has a success rate of \~90% in patients with multiply recurrent CDI. King’s has shown that this novel treatment is effective therapy for the treatment of CDI **\[6\]** and in 2016, we opened a Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) licenced FMT research facility in CIDR laboratory, one of only two in the UK, which provides material for an increasing number of research studies and patients with recurrent CDI. This facility has enabled us to obtain NIHR grants for randomised controlled trials in novel therapeutic areas \(cirrhosis and antimicrobial resistance\). 

 **King’s research demonstrates the cost effectiveness of treating CDI for the NHS \[8\].** Our research has also examined the financial cost and overall healthcare burden of both initial CDI and recurrent disease to the local healthcare economy. This used micro\-costing methods to estimate fine detail parameters which are often not considered during health economics studies. In partnership with Public Health England and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we used multi\-state modelling to determine the excess length of stay of patients with severe and non\-severe CDI, as well as those with recurrent disease.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The improvements that were made in the clinical management of suspected or confirmed cases of CDI in Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust \(GSTT\) resulted from research conducted by King’s academics. This work has been adopted by GSTT and cited in national CDI guidance. This has led to a dramatic and sustained improvement in care for patients with CDI on a local and national level. 

 **King’s algorithm led to improvement in diagnosis and detection of cases locally and nationally.** Accurate and timely laboratory diagnosis is critical to allowing any infection control interventions to be implemented. In 2010, GSTT introduced a new testing algorithm developed by King’s **\[1\]** that was able to more accurately \(increased sensitivity and specificity\) identify cases **\[A.1\]**. The Trust also implemented better infection control interventions based on King’s research **\[2, 3\]** including rapid isolation, adherence to personal protective equipment and improving hand hygiene; enhanced methods of environmental decontamination \(including novel technologies such as sporicidal cleaning agents and automated cleaning technologies using vaporised hydrogen peroxide and UV light\) **\[A\]**. This led to dramatic reduction in cases, hospital spread, rate of infection, in\-hospital transmission and environmental contamination of the hospital environment. The Site General Manager at GSTT confirmed that the system has steadily helped to reduce the spread of infections, particularly CDI at GSTT **\[A.2\]**. 

 Since 2007, PHE has carried out mandatory enhanced surveillance of CDI for NHS acute trusts, which includes GSTT. When the annual report was first introduced, GSTT had a hospital\-onset CDI rate of 40.5 cases/100,000 Occupied Bed Days \(OBDs\). By the beginning of the impact assessment period this had already decreased to 13.5/100,000 OBDs and in 2019/2020 the rate decreased even further to 7.0 **\[B.1\]**. 

|#  2013/14 |#  2014/15 |#  2015/16 |#  2016/17 |#  2017/18 |#  2018/19 |#  2019/20 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13.5 | 15.8 | 15.4 | 11.2 | 7.8 | 6.3 | 7.0 |

#  Source \[B.1\] 

 This has resulted in GSTT achieving the lowest CDI rate in the Shelford Group \(of 10 leading academic NHS organisations\), a position which it has held for the past three financial years. This rate is almost half that of the next best performing Shelford Group Trust \(Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, with a rate of 15.2 cases/100,000 OBDs\) **\[B.1\].** This is further confirmed by GSTT’s Joint Director of Infection Prevention and Control **\[A.1\]:** “King’s research has significantly influenced hospital policy on control of this infection in the Trust. The introduction of many of the strategies outlined in King’s research has enabled rates of infection to be reduced to one of the lowest of any comparable NHS Trust *.*” 

 In March 2012, the Department of Health published updated guidance on the diagnosis and reporting of CDI **\[B.2\]** referencing King’s research **\[1\].** When this national guidance was published, the hospital\-onset CDI rate in England was 17.3/100,000 OBDs, by 2019/20 this had reduced to 13.6 **\[B.1\]**. The current protocol for testing and diagnosing remains unchanged and it’s based on the peer\-reviewed, published research which includes King’s work **\[1\]** as outlined on an NHS Improvement 2019/20 document on CDI objectives for NHS organisations **\[B.3\]**. 

 **King’s research on fidaxomicin contributed to the growing evidence that it reduces recurrence rates and lowers mortality and provides cost savings for the treatment of potentially fatal CDI.** Fidaxomicin **\(FDX\)** was approved for use in the UK in 2012. It is one of the only four drugs approved for CDI treatment. That same year, GSTT became one of the first hospitals in the country to routinely use this new drug for the treatment of adults. King’s research **\[4\]** showed that within the 1168 patients treated, there was a significant reduction in recurrence rates \(from 16.3 to 3.1%\) and lower all\-cause mortality \(from 17.3 to 6.3%\). This was the first and only real\-world evaluation of available antibiotics for CDI in the UK, that confirmed that first\-line use of fidaxomicin could improve clinical outcomes in the treatment and management of CDI and its associated recurrences, resulting in an overall cost saving **\[4\]**. 

 This work was awarded the Prix Galien award for Real World Evidence in 2016 **\[C\]**. Worldwide, the Prix Galien is regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in biopharmaceutical and medical technology research. Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of the UK Prix Galien judging panel, said: “A unique series of local service evaluations were conducted in 2013\-2014 to evaluate the impact of Dificlir \[trade name for fidaxomicin\] introduction on the NHS. The evaluation, studied in real\-world settings, included investigating its effects on service delivery, the management of CDI and its costs, primarily to inform local decision\-making. Results indicated the very significant contribution that Dificlir’s use can make to tackling the major public health problems of antimicrobial resistance through targeted antibiotic therapy and infection control **\[C.2\]**.” 

 Additionally, our work demonstrating the clinical benefits of using FDX **\[4\]** as well as its cost effectiveness **\[5,7,8\]**, has enabled its inclusion in the list of NHS England high\-cost drugs **\[D\]**. Drugs on this list are centrally funded by NHS England, which means it doesn’t come as a cost to individual NHS Trusts, thus making it more accessible for them to use. 

 **Methods to combat CDI were further validated by King’s research.** After GSTT introduced King’s algorithm and FDX, an analysis **\[3\]** was conducted to verify the effectiveness of these measures in comparison with other NHS Trusts \(Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Calderdale and Huddersfield, City Hospitals Sunderland, St. Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals and Great Western Hospitals\). The data ranging from June 2013 to August 2014, revealed a low rate of in\-hospital transmission at GSTT; only 7% of isolates could be potentially linked to a previous case at GSTT, compared with an average of 20% at the other NHS hospitals \(range 7\-24%\) **\[3\]**. 

 **King’s research enabled expansion of FMT services with a regulated and licensed manufacturing facility.** Although the initial treatment with anti\-C. difficile antibiotics is generally effective, a significant proportion of patients \(20\-30%\) suffer recurrent infection, which is associated with a disrupted/less diverse gut microbiota. Newer methods of manipulating the gut microbiota such **Faecal Microbiota Transplant \(FMT\)** are key to improving clinical outcomes. King’s research provided the evidence base **\[6\] \[E\]** for FMT to be introduced at GSTT in 2014. 

 In 2016, the success of FMT led to the creation of an MHRA licensed stool bank which has been used to treat over 250 patients from Guys and St Thomas. Owing to the current complexity of establishing an MHRA\-accredited service for FMT, GSTT has become a centre of referral for other NHS providers in South East England with CDI and Ulcerative Colitis. This is one of only two licensed facilities in England and has facilitated two successful NIHR grant applications for randomised controlled trials of FMT in cirrhosis **\[F.1\]** and antibiotic resistant organisms **\[F.2\]**. Clinical success rates for patients treated with FMT have been over 95% and have improved quality of life as outlined in a patient’s testimonial **\[F.3\]**: “I have a Primary Immunodeficiency and get virtually continuous urinary infections and frequent chest infections, all requiring a large number of antibiotics. Several times I have ended up with CDI, a difficult and dangerous gut infection as a side effect of the antibiotics. These have been treated with vancomycin and metronidazole sadly without effect on both occasions. I was left wondering if I was going to die of this. I spent a considerable effort trying to locate someone doing faecal transplants and fortunately eventually found Dr Goldenberg at Guys and St Thomas’ NHS trust in 2018. He was a real lifesaver and arranged transplants promptly and on both occasions the CDI was cleared within a few days and my symptoms resolved. I remain eternally grateful to him and hope I don’t need to do this again but if I do, I know where great treatment can be found.” 

 **King’s provide expert advice on treatment of CDI and guidelines for FMT.** As a result of this research the case study author has been invited to participate on a number of national working groups/advisory committees. Goldenberg was invited to the Joint British Society of Gastroenterology/Healthcare Infection Society working group on the on the use of FMT to treat CDI. In 2018, the group published a set of UK guidelines for which Goldenberg was joint Chair and joint senior author **\[E.1\]**. The guidelines are used by both charities’ members which combined amounts to over 4,000 professionals in the UK **\[E.2\]**. 

 In 2020, he joined the United European Gastroenterology \(UEG\) working group on FMT Banks and contributed to their European guidelines for processes involved with stool banking, such as handling of donor material, storage and donor screening and reviewed all of the evidence that the guidelines were based on **\[G.1\].** UEG is a professional non\-profit organisation recognised as the leading authority for digestive health.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This research impacts on numerous aspects of the culture of sport by raising awareness of alternative masculinities, and encouraging greater acceptance of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender \(LGBT\) communities. Perceptions of sport and hegemonic masculinity have also changed, in particular in raising awareness of concussion and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy \(CTE\) in contact sports, which result from the continuing masculine influence on sport and the unquestioning adherence to the sport ethic. The impact is in three key areas: 

-  Influence on societal understanding and acceptance of alterative versions of masculinity in a sport setting; 

-  Influence on the teaching of sport\-related subjects in UK higher education institutions; 

-  Influence on public debate into the safety in contact sports, and promoting the need for greater protection for children. 

 The research has resulted in numerous instances of media coverage, engagement with government and policy makers and a measurable attitudinal change within the wider population.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Organised team sport remains an avenue for displaying patriarchal structure, physical prowess and heterosexual domination. It has traditionally reinforced an orthodox or hegemonic form of 20<sup>th</sup> century masculinity that is linked to those who are white, middle class, able\-bodied and heterosexual. Anderson \(Professor\) developed the concept of inclusive masculinity to describe masculine performances that view hegemonic masculinity as undesirable with a willingness to embrace femininity **\(3.1\)**. Athletes that exhibit inclusive masculinity have been found to be more accepting of both women and gay males in sporting environments **\(3.2\)**. There is also evidence for increasing societal acceptance of gay athletes and a softening of media attitudes towards gay male athletes in the United Kingdom, United States of America and beyond **\(3.3\)**. Significantly, a shift away from hegemonic masculinity also results in challenges to aggressive competitiveness, toughness and risking the body. Anderson’s sustained body of work has underpinned research for this case study in two key areas: sport and masculinities, and challenging blind acceptance of the sport ethic and of sacrificing athletes’ bodies. 

 Anderson is one of the world’s leading experts on sport, masculinities and sexualities. His development of *inclusive masculinities* has shaped the thinking of scholars working in this area and has inspired further studies into changing masculinities and homophobia, particularly within the sociology of sport. His extensive body of work in this area has been a key element of the UoA since its establishment. His Inclusive Masculinity Theory has been used in contexts such as sport, class, and social media studies and in countries ranging from Australia to the Czech Republic. In particular, Anderson has collaborated with Parry \(University of Winchester, 2018\-20; Bournemouth University 2020\-present\) and Muir \(Visiting Professor\) to further develop this area by investigating the potential for inclusive rugby clubs to increase participation, particularly for gay males. He has also collaborated with scholars such as Gaston \(Liverpool John Moores University\) and Magrath \(Solent University\) to examine the shift towards inclusive masculinity in English professional football **\(3.4\)**. 

 By drawing attention to the significant role that hegemonic masculinity plays in sport **\(3.5\)**, this research has also highlighted the barrier to participation and danger to health that it represents. Hegemonic masculinity encourages risk taking and children \(especially boys\) playing in aggressive contact sports. A change or softening in masculinity lessens societal and parental pressure for boys to be involved in contact sports, and in thus doing reduces injury. Anderson’s research has identified a shift to supporting the notion of health over masculine ideals in the United States in particular **\(3.6\)**.  Anderson was also a founder of the Sport Collision Injury Collective, a group of academics raising awareness of the risk that injuries to the head and brain pose, particularly to children. This work has made a strong contribution to the growing debate for removing contact from sport and physical education within the school environment.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact from this case study is through three key areas: influence on societal understanding and acceptance of alterative versions of masculinity in a sport setting; influence on sport\-related subjects teaching in UK HE; and influence on public debate into the safety for children playing contact sport. 

-  **Influence on societal understanding and acceptance of alterative versions of masculinity in a sport setting** 

 Anderson’s work on inclusive masculinity has received substantial scholarly attention and he is widely cited in the media, for instance recently in the *New York Times* **\(5.1\)**. The widespread media coverage of this topic has helped increase society’s acceptance of homosexuality and understanding of alternative masculinities. Anderson has also written a series of articles for *The Conversation* on changing masculinities that have engaged the public on topics such as mental health awareness, paternity leave and domestic violence. These articles have been viewed by over 20,000 unique readers in the UK, India, the USA and Australia. Anderson has consulted with Sport England and with government officials in Catalonia to develop an understanding of alternative versions of masculinity at governmental and regulatory levels. He has also led a series of industry engagement activities involving a mixture of academics and sports organisations such as the English Football Association. Recently, Anderson \(with members of the UoA\) has been instrumental in setting up a LGBT\+ Research in Sport Network with Sport England. He has also delivered professional development sessions for several professional sports clubs to educate their players on inclusivity in sport. 

 In addition, Parry \(working with colleagues at Western Sydney University in Australia\) extended the focus on inclusion for sexual minorities to supporters’ clubs, working with Cricket Victoria \(the governing body of cricket in the Australian state of Victoria\) and the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades Big Bash cricket teams, to study the development of inclusive supporters’ groups in the Big Bash League. This project’s recommendations were implemented by the clubs and cricket association to provide inclusive, welcoming and safe environments for LGBT\+ supporters at Big Bash games in the state of Victoria **\(5.2\)**. These findings have subsequently been adopted in the neighbouring state of New South Wales, with the Sydney Sixers also developing an LGBT strategy to create a more inclusive environment. 

-  **Influence on the teaching of sport\-related subjects in UK higher education institutions and beyond** 

 Anderson’s work on inclusive masculinities has also impacted teaching. His textbooks have been adopted by universities in the UK \(Bournemouth University, Liverpool John Moores University\), and the United States \(California State University Chico and University of Oregon\). He has supervised 22 doctoral students, of which 11 have gone on to teach at higher education institutions in Australia, the USA and the UK. These students have also incorporated Anderson’s research into their teaching, therefore influencing the next generation of scholars and helping shape higher education practice. At institutions such as Oxford Brookes, Wolverhampton, Durham and Southampton Solent, inclusive masculinity now features on sport\-related and gender/sexuality\-related courses. In addition, the research of Anderson and colleagues \(e.g., McCormack\) is used as a model answer in the OCR A\-Level Sociology paper discussing the part of sexuality in exploring how identity is changing. Furthermore, Anderson has shown that his teaching on masculinities has been linked with decreasing levels of homophobia among undergraduate students **\(5.3\)**. In this study, student attitudes towards homosexuals were also seen to be significantly more positive after the twelve\-week course being taught by an openly gay lecturer. 

  

-  **Influence on public debate into the safety of contact sport and the need for greater protection to be afforded to children.** 

 Anderson is one of the founders of the Sport Collision Injury Collective \(SCIS\), a multidisciplinary collective of academics who are highlighting the injuries sustained in youth sport participation. This group published an open letter “Preventing injuries in children playing school rugby” penned by Professors Allyson Pollock \(Professor of Public Health Research and Policy, Newcastle University\) and Eric Anderson with 71 additional signatories sent to UK and Ireland Chief Medical Officers \(CMOs\), Children’s Commissioners and responsible ministers of state for health, education and sport. In response, the Ombudsman for Children in Ireland took this matter up with the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Health to make recommendations **\(5.4\)**. The Children’s Commissioner for Wales also responded to both the media attention and the open letter to indicate that participation in potentially dangerous sports such as rugby union should not be compulsory. Anderson has been invited to present the findings of this research to the Royal Society of Medicine, the Minister for Health, and two Members of Parliament. In addition, he has met with Association for Physical Education, the PE Subject Association, to shape the future of school sport in the UK. 

 The SCIC’s website has received over 900 million hits and the letter itself was published by major print and online newspapers such as *The Guardian*, *The Telegraph*, and *The Independent*. Anderson was interviewed by BBC News \(3<sup>rd</sup> August 2016 and 27<sup>th</sup> September 2017\) and Sky News \(15<sup>th</sup> October 2017\). There was substantial social media coverage of the letter with over 500 unique tweets on the topic. Overall, this work has contributed to a vigorous public debate on safety in school sport, and a move to change policy to enhance safety. For example, while the initial response to this call on social media was vitriolic, there has been a softening over time and Anderson was invited to present the plenary session within the 24th Annual Congress of the European College of Sport Science, indicating that there is growing acceptance of the significance of head injuries in sport. Recently, public debates have occurred concerning tackling in children’s rugby, and announcements made concerning heading in football training being banned for children under 12, and debates on tackling in children’s rugby. While debate and policy change comes from a variety of influences, the work **\(5.5\)** and lobbying of Anderson and colleagues **\(5.6\)** has very likely contributed to these positive changes concerning safety in children’s sport.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Enterprise Research Centre \(ERC\) is based jointly at Warwick and Aston University Business Schools and is led by Professor Stephen Roper. Since 2013, the Centre has produced a large body of research focused on understanding what drives performance and productivity in small and medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\). This research, much of which has been co\-produced with policymakers, has transformed the approach taken by government to measuring SME performance and improving firm\-level productivity in the UK. The findings from research carried out by the Warwick team have directly shaped several business policy initiatives, including the Business Basics Programme and Small Business Leadership Programme. It has also shaped government approaches to the allocation of innovation funding for businesses, particularly in response to the Covid\-19 crisis.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 SMEs \(firms with less than 250 employees\) make a vital contribution to the UK economy, making up 99.9% of the business population. However, the UK creates many SMEs with limited growth potential/aspiration and has few 'high\-growth' firms. The untapped potential of SMEs is a challenge that has captured the attention of policymakers as they have sought to find solutions to the UK's productivity problem. The Covid\-19 crisis has brought these issues even more to the fore of policy concerns, as SMEs are recognised as being likely to play a crucial role in economic recovery. 

 Over the past 7 years, the ERC has made a major contribution to knowledge on the behaviour and performance of SMEs. Whilst researchers based at Aston have specialised in business growth and dynamics, the team at Warwick has focused on understanding the drivers of SME productivity, with particular attention to innovation, technology adoption, and management practices. The Warwick team has also played a pivotal role in improving the data used by policymakers on SMEs. Since 2013, ERC Director Stephen Roper has provided strategic leadership on the design of the Longitudinal Small Business Survey \(LSBS\), an annual government\-funded survey of SMEs. The ERC team has also developed its own robust sources of data on the SME population. This includes a ground\-breaking survey 'Microbusiness Britain', involving 10,000 micro\-businesses \(firms with between 1\-9 employees that are typically excluded from official surveys\) **\(3.1\)**. 

 Analysis by the team at Warwick has provided valued insights into the drivers of SME performance in several areas. One main area of focus has been on innovation activity in firms. This work has explored what drives successful innovation outcomes in SMEs, identifying the range of attributes required such as technical and scientific knowledge, openness to partnership, access to advice and finance. This research has provided evidence on the benefits of cooperation for innovation, particularly between businesses and universities **\(3.1\)**. Further research has shown a strong positive association between innovation, exporting and performance. Recently, research has turned to look at the likely impacts of the Covid\-19 crisis on innovation activity. This work has indicated that we should expect sharp falls in the proportion of innovating firms due to the impact of Covid\-19, and that recovery to previous levels will be slow and highly skewed by region and sector **\(3.2\)**. The ERC has also been commissioned by Innovate UK to undertake a large\-scale survey assessing the impact of Covid\-19 for current and future innovation behaviour. 

 A second research focus has been technology adoption in SMEs **.** Ground\-breaking ERC research found evidence that use of digital technologies is strongly linked to sales per employee \(a useful measure of productivity\). Further analysis has explored the factors influencing technology adoption in SMEs. This found that firms with good networks and collaborative links, and those with stronger internal resources \(business plans, training, external finance\) are more likely to be digital innovators. It also showed that growth ambition is strongly associated with digital adoption, concluding that digital innovation is positively linked to future business performance **\(3.3\)**. 

 A third research theme has been the link between management capabilities/practices and SME performance. Research led by Dr. Kevin Mole found that leaders in high\-growth SMEs are more likely to use high\-performance work practices \(such as performance management and employee engagement\). SME leaders use these practices to motivate employees and build trust, thus enhancing business performance. Dr. Mole’s research has also demonstrated the importance of leadership skills in enhancing the productivity of small firms **\(3.4\)**. Other recent research has explored the links between employer approaches to workforce mental health and productivity, finding that **firms impacted by mental health\-related sickness absence suffer from a drop in their productivity by an average of a quarter.** 

 A fourth area of research has focused on SMEs and external business advice. Research has shown that characteristics such as workforce size and sector have an effect on the uptake of advice, as did those of the owner\-manager, particularly education level and gender. An SME leader’s own assessments of their ability to tackle business challenges also influences the take\-up of external assistance, as does the financial situation of the company and wider economic conditions. This research also showed that there are market failures in business support affecting almost one\-fifth of SMEs in the UK **\(3.5\)**. 

 A fifth research focus has been the theme of business resilience \(which is now especially pertinent given the Covid\-19 crisis\). An ERC study published in early 2020 involving a major survey of SMEs in 5 European cities found that survival\-threatening business crises are commonplace amongst SMEs, but only a minority have any sort of crisis plan in place. The work also found that firms run by women and ethnic minorities are at greater risk of crisis, whilst at the same time less likely to undertake crisis planning and use external business support **\(3.6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ERC research is used by policymakers at national and local levels, particularly within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), Innovate UK, and also by business support organisations working directly with SMEs, such as the Federation of Small Business \(FSB\), British Chambers of Commerce, British Business Bank and Growth Hubs. ERC research findings are also regularly covered by the media. Between July 2018 and July 2020, the Centre achieved 262 pieces of media coverage across print, broadcast and online media, reaching an estimated audience of 31,000,000 people **\(5.1\)**. Emphasis is also placed on effective communication with policymakers using a variety of meetings and events. All research publications are shared online via the Centre's website and social media channels. 

 Most of the ERC’s research is co\-produced with stakeholders who are involved throughout the research lifecycle, from project design through to completion and dissemination. The ERC team are in regular contact with policymakers and have become regarded as respected advisors and experts, and a source of stable, trusted insight. This has been especially valued in recent years within the context of a constantly shifting business policy landscape and many changes within government **\(5.2\)**. As the former Head of Policy at the FSB, Sonali Parekh, noted when interviewed as a part of a stakeholder evaluation, *""In my view the ERC are clearly the authoritative repository on a wide plethora of small business issues – with invaluable institutional memory""* **\(5.3\)**. This trusted expert role has been important in the context of the Covid\-19 pandemic, with ERC staff working closely to support policymakers during the crisis. The team have provided highly responsive advice and expertise to help develop strategies for business support during this challenging period, producing a range of research outputs \( [http://www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk/covid\-19\-resource\-directory](http://www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk/covid-19-resource-directory)\). 

 Looking more broadly over the last 7 years, research undertaken by the ERC team has transformed both the quantity and quality of data available on SMEs. Notably, Professor Roper's advice stimulated new investment by the UK Government in a major national survey of SMEs \(the LSBS\) in 2015, which was subsequently given official statistics status. As a result of Prof. Roper’s insights, the survey methodology was changed to take a longitudinal approach, with businesses re\-surveyed in subsequent years. This allowed, for the first time, a detailed analysis to be undertaken of factors that affect SME performance through time, thus vastly improving the quality of the data available to policymakers. This data helped to inform the development of new business support services such as the Growth Hubs in England, local public\-private partnerships led by the 38 Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\). As BEIS Principal Research Officer Ian Drummond summarised: *""...the ERC played a pivotal role in providing the technical input that underpinned the development of the \[LSBS\]... It would be difficult to overstate the impact that the development of the LSBS has had on policymaking throughout government. It has provided rigorous evidence on the factors that shape SME performance and growth that previously simply did not exist and in doing so has provided for more considered and better evidenced policymaking""* **\(5.4\).** The ERC's international 'Micro\-business Britain' survey has filled vital evidence gaps, with data used to directly inform policy. The findings have had a particular impact on SME policy development in Ireland, by drawing attention to variations in small business ambition that exist across the country. Prof. Roper, along with co\-author Jane Bourke of University College Cork, provided written and oral submissions on the evidence to the Public Consultation Committee on Small and Medium Sized Businesses in Ireland. The Committee's report, published in May 2019, draws on the survey findings to outline a national strategy supporting the growth and sustainability of Irish SMEs **\(5.5\)**. The report findings were widely reported in the Irish media **\(5.6\)**. 

 ERC research insights have also widened the focus of SME policy in the UK. Historically, UK policy related to the performance and growth of SMEs tended to have a narrow focus, with emphasis placed on improving access to finance and reducing regulatory burdens. By highlighting the importance of a range of other factors to SME performance, ERC research has given policymakers a more nuanced understanding that identifies new areas for policy intervention. 

 For example, Prof. Roper's research has raised awareness of the important role of innovation in SME performance. As BEIS Head of Innovation Policy and Finance Analysis Kyle Magee noted, this research has helped policymakers within government "" *to see innovation as something that happens within businesses \- not just something that happens in labs or at universities*"" **\(**interview with Kyle Magee reported in **5.2\)**. It has also informed the  [UK Government's Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future) in which innovation was identified as 1 of 5 underpinning foundational themes. Roper’s research has also influenced decisions about the allocation of innovation funding taken by Innovate UK \(the UK’s innovation agency\). As the previous Deputy Chief Executive of Innovate UK Kevin Baughan commented, *""Enterprise research of the quality being undertaken by the ERC under Stephen Roper's leadership is critical to our understanding of what is actually driving innovation. The ERC's work… has given us a lot of confidence that our investment of public money is achieving its goal""  \(5.7\)**. 

 One key finding to come from the research has been that leading\-edge firms attract a disproportionate share of innovation funding. This has prompted discussion within both Innovate UK and BEIS about 'inclusive innovation', which involves better targeting of innovation policy measures to actively reduce inequalities and at the same time stimulate advances in productivity. These discussions about the targeting of funding have risen in priority recently in the light of the Covid\-19 crisis, and since March 2020 Prof. Roper has provided regular advice on innovation policy options. He has provided advice to BEIS specifically on the ability of UK universities to support future R&D and innovation post\-crisis and has influenced the content of Innovate UK’s new 5\-year Innovation Strategy. This has involved working directly with the Innovate UK Executive Team, building on pre\-existing strong stakeholder relationships. Prof. Roper’s insights have helped Innovate UK formulate appropriate evidence\-based responses to the crisis. This has included advising on the future investment in several areas \(including Catapult Centres \- the UK’s network of innovation centres\) and shaping the submission to the Government’s Autumn 2020 Spending Review. As Geeta Nathan, Head of Economics and Insights at Innovate UK, stated in December 2020: “ *The input of \[Roper\], and evidence gathered from ERC, not only informed how we consider our intervention e.g. how we support high growth companies, but also how IUK supports innovative businesses strategically with direct impact on the emerging strategy for the UK’s innovative businesses”* **\(5.8\)**. 

 The ERC’s research has also led to new government investment in a series of initiatives designed to improve firm productivity. As Stuart Roddam, Business and Local Growth Analyst at BEIS, has stated: *""ERC research has added to our understanding of management skills/practices, SME resilience, firm growth patterns and evaluation methodology which has directly influenced the design of the 'Business Basics Programme', the 'Business Productivity Review', our work through 'Be The Business' and the development of the BEIS 'Business Support Evaluation Framework'""* **\(5.9\)**. Specifically, Prof. Roper's ground\-breaking work on digital adoption in SMEs influenced the design of the  ['Business Basics' programme](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/business-basics-programme). This GBP9,200,00 million, 4\-year programme was launched in 2018 as a part of the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy, and involves testing innovative ways of encouraging SMEs to adopt digital technologies. Prof. Roper’s work on digital adoption has also informed the activities of ‘ [Be the Business’,](https://www.bethebusiness.com/) an industry\-led initiative backed by government launched to help businesses across the UK benchmark and improve their productivity. The organisation has developed a programme to help SMEs take advantage of the productivity benefits associated with adopting technologies, with ERC insights used in the programme design. The ‘Be the Business’ team is now working with government and other partners on a strategy for mass technology diffusion and adoption in the context of recovery from the Covid\-19 crisis, again drawing on ERC research insights and advice. 

 The UK Government’s Business Productivity Review also drew directly on the ERC's research on management and leadership. The policy announcements coming from the Review included a GBP31,000,000 to boost firm level leadership and management through a business\-led package of initiatives aimed at driving up firm\-level productivity. This included the creation of a Small Business Leadership Programme providing management training to SMEs, with an ambition to train 10,000 people per year by 2025 as well as promoting local networks to focus on business improvement, and a new mentoring programme. This programme has subsequently been re\-orientated to give business leaders the confidence and leadership skills they need to ensure business recovery from the impacts of Covid\-19. The recognition of the ERC's input into these policy initiatives was acknowledged on the publication of the Review in 2018 by the \(then\) BEIS Deputy Director for Industrial Strategy, Rannia Leontaridi, thanking the Centre for its involvement and advice **\(5.10\)**. 

 As well as influencing national business policy, ERC research has also had an impact at local level. The Centre’s research on the links between workforce mental health and productivity has been used to shape the  [development of interventions](https://mhpp.me/about/) delivered by the mental health charity Mind to help reduce mental health\-related sickness absence amongst employers in the Midlands Engine region. The ERC's research on business resilience, which highlighted the need for better crisis planning amongst SMEs resulted in the development of a practical toolkit designed to be used by SMEs to benchmark their resilience and to help develop crisis plans. The toolkit has been developed in partnership with a specialist SME support organisation \(Oxford Innovation\) who are using it as part of their work to support SME recovery and growth following the Covid\-19 crisis. The toolkit has been integrated into a purpose\-built diagnostic and recovery planning tool for SMEs and is now being delivered to businesses across three Local Enterprise Partnership \(LEP\) areas **\(5.11\)**.

We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient.

Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The practise\-based research of artist Max Eastley was among the first to extensively investigate and model Aeolian devices – sound installations powered by atmospheric phenomena such as the wind – in the context of sound art. The research took place during an AHRC Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts at Oxford Brookes University’s Sonic Art Research Unit \(SARU\). The impact of Eastley’s research is demonstrated most clearly through the touring event *Audible Forces* \(2013–2014\) *,* a landscape of Aeolian sound installations produced by SARU and Oxford Contemporary Music \(OCM\). *Audible Forces* has had a transformative impact on the participating artists’ creative practice and career development, enabled organisational development for key production partners, and brought a legacy of sound art installations to appreciative new audiences in the UK and internationally.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Internationally renowned sound artist Max Eastley, whose career has spanned five decades, was one of first to develop an artistic practice on the border between sound in the natural environment and human intervention in that environment, using the driving forces of electricity, wind, water and ice. 

 The underpinning research for this case study took place during an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts hosted by SARU 2010–2013. The research project, entitled *Aeolian Sound: An investigation of Aeolian Phenomena and their incorporation into Sonic Culture*, focussed specifically on Aeolian phenomenon – the activation of sound through the action of the wind on natural materials. \( **R1, R2\)** The principal mode of investigation was to seek out materials that are activated by natural forces and test them in a variety of formations. Eastley used the annual SARU festival of sound art and experimental composition, audiograft, as a laboratory for the development of these Aeolian practices, experimenting with formations of latex \(2011, Fig.1 below, **R3a**\), and copper \(2013, Fig.2 below, **R3b**\), alongside a range of other materials including brass, aluminium and wound steel wires.

 Further practical explorations of Aeolian phenomena led Eastley to develop: an innovative indoor work for Raven Row Art Gallery, London in 2011; Aeolian harps at Tempelhof Airport, Berlin \(Berlin Sonic Places in 2012; and outdoor Aeolian devices at The Water Tower, Wasserturm, in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin\) in 2013. These works tested two key aspects of the research – the broadcast of Aeolian phenomena into indoor spaces and the use of arrays of Aeolian harps. 

 In *Gone with the Wind*, Eastley built an Aeolian installation on the roof of Raven Row Gallery and worked with engineer Dave Hunt to develop a means by which the sounds produced by the wind on the Aeolian device could be transmitted twelve meters down into the interior. This allowed visitors to experience and explore the relationship between the 18<sup>th</sup> century architecture and history of the Aeolian harp. **\(R3c\)** 

 The investigation of Aeolian Harps and devices became central to Eastley’s practice. For example, twelve Aeolian Harps, constructed on site, were installed for one day on the roof of a decommissioned meteorology building at Tempelhof Airport. The installation and an accompanying talk were part of a series of events curated by German Academic Exchange Service \(DAAD\) awardee – sound artist Peter Cusack. Eastley's contribution was part of the examination of how urban acoustic phenomena could be exploited for city planning and his role was to make imaginative suggestions as to how wind\-energised sound might be used to enhance future soundscapes. **\(R3d\)** In another work, eight Aeolian Harps were erected on the top of the external faces of the Water Tower \(Wasserturm\) in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. The sound from these was transmitted and projected into the interior of the building, in which Eastley had installed ten acoustic sculptures. The sounds of the Aeolian harps and the acoustic sculptures were combined to create an aural space that led visitors through the physical architecture, discovering the interior sculptures on the journey. **\(R3e\)** 

 Max Eastley's Aeolian sound explorations, as part of his AHRC Fellowship, led to the creation of *Audible Forces*, a touring exhibition produced by SARU and OCM and co\-commissioned by Brighton Festival and the Without Walls consortium of festivals and organisations dedicated to raising the profile of the UK outdoor arts sector. This was an outdoor exhibition of work by seven artists who all created new Aeolian works using the wind to produce sound. The exhibition toured for two years \(2013–2014\) and went to: Brighton Festival, Norfolk and Norwich Festival, Salisbury International Arts Festival, Greenwich and Docklands International Festival, Stockton International Riverside Festival, Kendal Lakes Alive, Quays Open Day \(Greater Manchester’s Waterfront\), Salford and Stoke\-on\-Trent. *Audible Forces* energised creative activity around Aeolian phenomena in the UK and opened the door for this practice into the mainstream of sound art. \( **R4\)** The research is archived and documented at  [www.maxeastley.co.uk](http://www.maxeastley.co.uk/). **\(R5\)**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 With production support from SARU and Oxford Contemporary Music \(OCM\), Eastley’s research into Aeolian phenomena led to the creation of *Audible Forces*, an ambitious outdoor touring show, featuring commissioned Aeolian sound art works from seven artists: Kathy Hinde \( *Sonic Reed Beds*; *Aeolian Soundmap* with Ed Holroyd\), Mike Blow \( *Arpeggi*\), Jony Easterby \( *Birdhouse Flock* and *Stress and stone*\), Nathaniel Mann \( *Pigeon Whistles* with Peter Petravicius\), Mark Anderson \( *Phantom Field*\), Dan Fox \( *Howling Wire*\) and Max Eastley \( *Aeolian Harp* and *Aeolian Percussion*\). *Audible Forces* was transformative for the artists and arts organisations involved, and has been a catalyst for a legacy of new art works, which continue to entertain and inspire audiences around the world. 

###  Inspiring and enabling artists to develop their practice and create new sound art 

 The artists engaged with *Audible Forces* benefited from the experience in many ways including: introduction to new networks enabling the co\-production of original sound art works; the development of novel practices requiring technical innovation; a new understanding of the potential of the field; and the development of new modes of thinking and new creative partnerships that have led to further commissions. 

 Mike Blow **\(S1a\)** states that ‘ *the experience of participating in Audible Forces was instrumental in developing my creative practice and building my professional profile, as well as enabling several key collaborations that have built a legacy of new art works, some of which have shown internationally*’. The commission for *Audible Forces* was a significant moment in the development of technical skills that Blow would use in future projects: ‘ *Audible Forces was the first time I had the platform to make a large, portable, robust artwork ... the first time I toured with an installation and the first time I had been involved in the UK festival scene, so it was a big learning and networking opportunity*.’ He expands on the networking opportunities that the commission afforded him: ‘ *Audible Forces ...undoubtedly raised my profile ... It introduced me to arts producers, festivals and promoters, and taught me a lot about working with other artists. The experience prompted me to get a studio in Plymouth, and helped me integrate into the art scene in the South West*.’ 

 Of the collaborative projects that the *Audible Forces* commission led to, Mike Blow’s further work with Ed Harcourt is perhaps the most productive example. It led to the creation of his work *Colony* \(together with Alison Ballard\), a multi\-channel touch and sound installation, consisting of up to seven internally lit, air filled spheres ranging in size from  2–3.5 meters, that emit an otherworldly 20\-minute sonic composition. These large tactile, sonic sculptures allows the audience to experience the physicality of sound through listening, touching, and hugging. *Colony* has toured in the UK since 2016. A precursor to *Colony* was *Pod* **\(S7\)**, a tactile sound sculpture which featured in Science Museum London's Wonderlab Gallery from 2016 until 2020. The relationship developed with Ed Harcourt as a result of *Audible Forces* was fundamental to these projects. **\(S1a\)** 

 Involvement in *Audible Forces* ‘had a huge impact’ on the creative practice and professional profile of Nathaniel Mann **\(S1b\)** who states that: ‘ *The successful trajectory of my subsequent career can in many ways be traced back to my involvement*.’ It was ‘ *the first time I had toured with an installation. It gave me huge exposure to new audiences – It honed my skills in being able to present to, and directly interact with, audiences*.’ His work *Pigeon Whistles* **\(S7\)** has been described by an audience member as ‘ *the closest thing to heaven that I have experienced*’ \(the Guardian 22/08/2014\). Mann went on to curate a temporary exhibit on pigeon whistles at Oxford University’s Pitt River Museum, which has been accessioned in the permanent collection of the museum. This was the first time he had curated a display: ‘ *The exhibit foregrounded those artefacts that were previously rarely noticed; introducing new audiences to ancient Chinese and Vietnamese listening practices and contextualising my own work with the museum collections.*’ In 2017, BBC Radio 4 commissioned a documentary about *Pigeon Whistles*, which featured on  [<ins>Radio 4</ins> ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08ynyk5)\(Pick of the week; July and September 2017\), which Mann presented. He has subsequently written and presented six BBC Radio documentaries, all of which were selected as BBC Radio 4 Picks of the Week. Pigeon Whistles was awarded the George Butterworth Prize for Composition 2014 and in 2019 Mann was recipient of the prestigious  [<ins>Paul</ins> <ins>Hamyln</ins> <ins>Foundation prize</ins>](https://www.phf.org.uk/our-work-in-the-uk/ideas/awards-for-artists/), a success which he attributes to the work that he did with *Audible Forces* and his Pitt Rivers residency. **\(S1b\)** 

 Award winning Sound Artist Kathy Hinde \(Ivor Novello Award for Sound Art 2020\) states that: ‘ *the research into aeolian instruments and possibilities has continued in my practice ever since… I have learnt a huge amount from the wealth of experience of the other Audible Forces artists, and we have all continued to work together in a variety of capacities... Audible Forces helped me expand areas of my practice more confidently into the outdoor arts realm… I learnt loads of practical know\-how, and took much inspiration from the wealth of work \[the other artists had made\]*.’ **\(S1c\)** 

 The underpinning research had a significant impact on Eastley’s own arts practice, particularly with regard to projects developed with German artist and producer Carsten Seifferth. Seiffarth explains that Eastley’s reputation, and the success of a previous project together, led, in 2014, to Eastley being the first British person appointed City Artist in Bonn, a role in which he created artistic connections with spaces in the city. This included the technically challenging design and installation of Aeolian harps mounted on two rafts floating on a lake in the Bonn Botanic Gardens \(Aeolian Islands\). **\(S7\)** The installations were enjoyed by visitors who came specifically to see them, and those who discovered them on their visit. In 2016, building on this, he developed *Windklänge* \(Wind Sounds\) at Herren Hausen Grosser Garten, Hannover, which used the floating harps on the canal of an 18th century formal garden. **\(S7\)** Seiffarth summarises: ‘ *Max's work has brought unique, inspiring experiences to many venues and new audiences in several cities in Germany. Max's extensive research into aeolian phenomena is impressive and enabled him to create beautiful new sound installations, which are unlike other things previously seen and heard in Germany.*’ **\(S2\)** 

###  Enabling Arts Organisations to develop new ways of producing shows and supporting emerging artists 

 For ACE funded Arts Organisation OCM, co\-producing *Audible Forces* led directly to changes in the way the organisation approaches production of shows and a new way of working with artists to develop public\-facing projects. *Audible Forces* was OCM’s first multi\-artist show for some time and taking a show of this size on tour was a significant undertaking. As OCM’s Deputy Director stated: ‘ *Because of the scale, the whole staff was involved in producing, not just the Director, which was a new approach for OCM and great for up\-skilling our colleagues. After the tour, the organisation restructured to share the producing work across more of the staff, partly as a result of the experience staff gained from this project.*’ Further, ‘ *the show and tour has been used to demonstrate to funders what OCM is able to achieve in terms of producing work, nurturing artists, and reaching and inspiring large audiences through our creative producing in partnership with organisations like Brookes/SARU.*’ **\(S3\)** 

 One key legacy of this was BOOM **\(S3\)**, the annual professional development scheme for musicians, sound practitioners and producers created by OCM: ‘ *We had seen how valuable the skill sharing and relationship building had been between artists during the Audible Forces tour. This had only been possible because they'd been given the opportunity to spend plenty of time together and it happened organically in the time they had off when they were on tour. We shaped the scheme so that we can recreate this valuable organic process for the participants.*’ **\(S4\)** BOOM residencies with OCM enable practitioners and producers \(c.20 so far\) to lead their own development, research or training programme over one year with no expectation of specific outcomes beyond the evidence of real and effective learning in their practice and profession. BOOM artists have included *Audible Forces* participants Mike Blow and Kathy Hinde, who used their residencies to create unique artworks. For example, Blow experienced how BOOM ‘ *provided the funding and space*’ to develop the *Hornet*, a synthesizer with gestural control, which has gone on to sell c.40 pieces internationally. **\(S1a, S7\)** 

###  Reaching new audiences and introducing them to unique, formative experiences 

 *Audible Forces*, with its dynamic concept and accessible locations, attracted new audiences across the UK, transforming their understanding of familiar places. One visitor noted: ‘ *We absolutely loved the installation – It felt as though it should always be there, a natural extension of how we experience the sea. We often walk along the promenade and it made that walk all the more ‘real’ and opened up our senses.*’ The event created an appetite for further engagement with many visitors visiting multiple times: ‘ *Enjoyed the event a lot – came down on 2 consecutive days to see if the weather altered the ‘performances*’. 

 The show inspired audiences of all ages including children: ‘ *We were fortunate enough to have timed our visit to coincide with the whistling pigeons. It was fantastic and my children \(12 & 9\) were really entranced also. My pre\-teen thinks everything is “boring” unless it has a screen attached to it but he really enjoyed this event.*’ A primary school teacher responded: ‘ *I thought it was really interesting as a way to look at how we generate sound and how \(like with wind/solar energy\) we can utilise the natural resources to create sound.  I took videos to show children in my school.  I loved the kinaesthetic layout of the exhibits*’. **\(S5\)** 

 Further, the show also promoted an awareness of the natural environment: ‘ *Some beautifully different pieces that awakened your own awareness to the weather and forces around us. Something that does need to occur every now and then to remind us of the scale and power of the environment we’re immersed in*’. 

 A subsequent installation by Eastley, Aeolian Harp and Sculptures for Perrott’s Folly **\(S7\)** produced by the Ikon Gallery, attracted 683 visitors from 10 May to 10 June 2018. One visitor summed up the response of many: ‘ *Thought\-provoking and totally immersive. The harps provide glorious sensory overload.*’ The Ikon Gallery’s Director confirmed. ‘ *The aeolian installation with Max was a great success, characteristically unpretentious, imaginative and inventive. It was engaging as it appealed to visitors’ sense of wonder.*’ **\(S6\)**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 As a result of our internationally leading research, infrastructure is today better prepared for climate change. Our improved projections of future climate, and models describing infrastructure performance in a changing climate, are now embedded in industry design guidance and practice, and in statutory adaptation reporting. Our geospatial infrastructure database model has underpinned development of the UK’s first National Infrastructure Strategy, a £895bn pipeline of infrastructure expenditure until 2050. We also informed the development of new government guidance that ensures climate resilience is considered in all government infrastructure expenditure \(£27bn in 2020/21\). Initially proven in the UK, our research now informs global climate policy and international businesses, including engineering consultancies and insurance brokers \(US$9bn revenue in 2019\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research has addressed four barriers that had hindered climate resilient infrastructure. Our interdisciplinary research programme has: \(i\) provided high resolution climate information tailored to engineering design, \(ii\) characterised how infrastructure asset performance is impacted by a changing climate, \(iii\) modelled how interdependence between infrastructure sectors creates new failure pathways for climate risks, and \(iv\) provided decision\-support tools that enable resilience to be mainstreamed into infrastructure investment decisions. 

 **2.1 Climate information for infrastructure design** 

 We developed two new robust methods to provide information on \(flood, drought, heat, wind\) climate hazards at the high spatio\-temporal resolution required by infrastructure engineers. \(a\) We undertook the first analysis of outputs from the Met Office’s new ‘convection permitting’ climate models \(that is able to reproduce small scale atmospheric processes\). We provided more reliable projections of how the frequency, intensity, timing, and spatial extent of short duration, extreme rainfall will change in the future \[P1\]. This is now used in surface water management design guidance. \(b\) To fully exploit this new climate model data for risk assessment, we developed and used a unique dynamic copula framework for stochastic rainfall modelling which preserves spatial\-temporal dependence and reproduces interannual persistence \[P2\]. This allows the long\-term impacts of change in climate variables over large catchments and nations to be assessed, a significant advance beyond the previous state of the art which did not account for spatial\-temporal dependence. Our range of new statistical methods have been used by utilities and insurers to analyse flood and drought risks across large catchments, and assess multiple climate risks to 571 European cities. 

 **2.2 Characterisation of engineering performance in a changing climate** 

 Our research has improved the performance and reliability of energy, road and rail infrastructure assets by producing fragility functions to describe the likelihood of failure during an extreme event, and establish the long\-term relationship between climate change, the engineering performance of infrastructure, and societal impacts. For example, we developed a new method to analyse 12,000 weather related failures in the electricity network to produce fragility functions for distribution assets \[P3\] subsequently used by utilities. Multi\-year experiments on our unique, full\-scale transport infrastructure embankment \[P4\] identified critical factors that control the magnitude and distribution of pore water pressure in embankments in response to weather events, providing increased sophistication in the understanding of climate\-engineering processes in infrastructure. 

 **2.3 Geospatial ‘systems\-of\-systems’ modelling of infrastructure** 

 Modern infrastructure systems are interdependent, relying on each other to function. Through our pivotal role as geospatial modelling leads in the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium, Newcastle developed NISMOD\-DB \(National Infrastructure Systems Model Database\), the world’s first data platform for national scale analysis and modelling of infrastructure. The platform is built on a technology stack of PostgreSQL, PostGIS and Neo4j systems. It integrates national scale information on the location, asset performance, geo\-temporal patterns of infrastructure demand, supply and capacity, flows and connectivity, and dependencies between networks. This has enabled the first national infrastructure assessment to consider cascading failure between different infrastructure networks \(e.g. water supply, electricity transmission, major roads, railways, telecoms\) which has highlighted geographic hotspots of infrastructure criticality across the nation \[P5\]. 

 **2.4 Valuing resilience in investment decisions** 

 Newcastle led the iBUILD programme that brought together engineers and economists to develop new business models for infrastructure. We developed a number of new methods to assess systemic risks, value the benefits of climate resilient infrastructure, and support decision\-making. This included new collaborative approaches to decision\-making \(e.g.  [https://tinyurl.com/collabdecision](https://tinyurl.com/collabdecision)\), as well as new decision\-support methods based on graph theory. This enables engineers and policy makers to identify the most cost\-effective locations across an infrastructure network to invest in adaptation measures to minimise risk. The method integrates information on network flows, capacity and performance, connectivity, and exposure to climate hazard. Application in Newcastle showed six carefully sited interventions reduced transport infrastructure impacts from flooding by a half \[P6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Globally, by 2100 climate change impacts on infrastructure are estimated to be US$4.2tn under a 2<sup>o</sup>C scenario \(i.e. if the Paris Agreement is met\), and as much as US$13.8tn if not \( [https://tinyurl.com/globinfra](https://tinyurl.com/globinfra)\). The Global Commission on Adaptation calculate that investment in climate resilient infrastructure provides a benefit to cost ratio of about 4:1. Newcastle University’s research has been at the forefront of providing data, methods, and guidance that have enabled engineers and decision\-makers to implement climate resilient infrastructure in practice. 

 **4.1 Design guidance for future flooding** 

 Flooding is the greatest climate risk to infrastructure, particularly flash floods. We worked with engineering consultants to translate our high\-resolution climate information \(Section 2.1\) into design guidance for UK Water Industry Research \(UKWIR\): Rainfall Intensity for Sewer Design, Report 15/CL/10/16. Our work showed the previous assumption of a \+20% allowance for future climate was insufficient and needed to account for regional variability e.g. guidance on additional design peak rainfall intensity from climate change is now \+35% in East Scotland, and \+55% in West Scotland. This work has provided ‘ *a basis for the long\-term planning and asset management of drainage and wastewater services across all Great Britain*’ to manage the long\-term risk of sewer flooding and pollution from sewer systems, comprising an annual spend of around £1bn \[E1\]. 

 Our models of future extreme rainfall and flood frequency have also been used by Willis Towers Watson, the world’s third largest insurance broker \(2019 revenue US$9bn\). This includes stress testing insurance portfolios against climate risks in reporting to the Bank of England, and has allowed Willis to “ *increase our climate service offerings to several of our UK insurance clients which are representing \[the\] majority of the UK insurance market*” \[E2\]. 

 **4.2 Design of robust water resources management** 

 After flooding, the Climate Change Committee \(CCC\) identified drought as the next most significant risk to the UK. Our stochastic rainfall model \(Section 2.1, P2\) has been used by Southern Water, water supplier to over 2.5 million people, to design their 2019 Water Resource Management Plan for infrastructure provision worth £1.8bn. Our approach is now standard across the UK water industry forming the basis of the new drought resilience framework for the Environment Agency, and has ‘ *entirely changed the planning paradigm, and significantly enhanced the resilience of the water resource infrastructure of the most water stressed regions of the UK*’ \[E3\]. 

 **4.3 Climate change adaptation strategies** 

 Windstorms caused 20% of all electricity customer disruptions between 1995 and 2011. Our fragility models of electricity assets \(Section 2.2\), and high\-resolution climate information \(Section 2.1\), were used to undertake a national scale risk assessment of the UK electricity transmission network to future climate, and to assess the vulnerability of 520,000 miles of overhead lines on the distribution network. This was used by energy regulator Ofgem, the National Grid, and all the Distribution Network Operators on the British mainland in their statutory 2016 Adaptation Reporting Power \(ARP\) submissions e.g. E4 and E5: “ *helping the industry to understand the potential impacts of climate change on wind patterns*” \(SP Energy Networks Adaptation Report\) and “ *this work was subsequently used by all the other distribution network operators on the British mainland to inform their 2<sup>nd</sup> round Climate change Adaptation Report submissions*” \(Western Power letter, E4a\) to assess current and future impacts of climate change. 

 Combining the fragility functions and climate projections, the National Grid was able to identify high risk ‘hotspots’ for windstorm and flooding on their network, providing a basis to prioritise adaptation. This included advice on where to site £3m in demountable flood defences to achieve the greatest reduction in risk, whilst maintaining confidence in the resilience of power supply, thereby generating savings of £11m in wasted investment through asset depreciation \[E4b\]. 

 Our research has also been applied to Highways England’s and Network Rail’s infrastructure networks which comprise around 50,000 and 200,000 geotechnical assets respectively \(Section 2.2\). Network Rail are investing £1.3bn in maintenance and renewal between 2019\-2024. We have worked with Mott MacDonald for over 20 years, most recently to apply our detailed slope stability analyses under a range of future climate scenarios. This has enabled Motts to better *“justify expenditure to regulatory bodies such as the Office of Rail and Road \(ORR\)”*, saving the taxpayer significant amounts of money as *“emergency repairs may cost 10 times planned works, which in turn may cost 10 times that of maintenance activities”* \[E6\]. 

 Prof. Dawson was appointed to the Adaptation Committee of the Climate Change Committee \(CCC\) in 2019. He has provided oral evidence direct to ministers on climate change adaptation \[E7\]. Moreover, the CCC’s advice on preparing for climate change is reflected in legislation and the government’s National Adaptation Plan which impacts upon every inhabitant of the UK. 

 **4.4 National infrastructure assessment** 

 Prof. Dawson led the Infrastructure section of the UK’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Climate Change Risk Assessment \(CCRA\) evidence report \[E7\]. This was used by government to directly inform the UK government’s National Adaptation Plan. Prof. Fowler is a contributing author to the 3<sup>rd</sup> evidence report to be published in 2022, and a member of Network Rail’s Weather Action Task Force. 

 NISMOD\-DB hosts several hundred national infrastructure network datasets, and manages information flows for infrastructure simulation, and enables visualisation of data and simulation results. This was used to provide the first national mapping of locations across England and Wales at risk of cascading failure from infrastructure interdependencies \[P5\]. This was crucial evidence on cross\-sectoral infrastructure risks in the 2<sup>nd</sup> CCRA evidence report \(Ch4, p27\). Furthermore, it enabled and underpinned the National Infrastructure Commission’s first National Infrastructure Assessment \[E8\], which included consideration of how climate change will impact upon the nation’s infrastructure. This proposed a pipeline of £895bn of infrastructure investment up to 2050 that the government have mostly committed to build in the National Infrastructure Strategy. 

 **4.5 Valuing resilience in infrastructure investment decisions** 

 We led the iBUILD research programme, in partnership with the Universities of Leeds and Birmingham. At the request of Infrastructure UK \(now the Infrastructure and Projects Authority\), a department in HM Treasury, iBUILD supported the development of supplementary guidance to the Green Book for infrastructure spend \[E9\]. The guidance drew from contributions across the iBUILD team, including Newcastle’s methods \(Section 2.4\) to value the benefits of resilient infrastructure. The Green Book is issued by HM Treasury and is used to appraise all government funded policies, programmes and projects. In recent years government infrastructure expenditure in the UK has been \~£20bn per year, but this is forecast to increase in the new National Infrastructure Strategy. The changes in the methods available to users of the Green Book enable government to derive additional value from infrastructure investments. 

 **4.6 Influencing climate resilient infrastructure in policy and practice around the world** 

 Our research has had significant impact internationally. As Coordinating Lead and Contributing Authors for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) 6<sup>th</sup> Assessment Reports, Profs. Dawson and Fowler are providing advice to 187 governments on climate change adaptation. 

 As co\-authors of the *Global Research and Action Agenda on Cities and Climate Change Science*, our recommendations on adaptation of infrastructure and cities were approved by all 187 member states of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2018 \[E10a\]. ICLEI \(an international body representing 1750 local governments in 84 countries\) state this “ *will strengthen evidence\-based, science\-driven action in cities*” \[E10a\]. Further, our risk assessment model results have been used by the European Environment Agency to identify adaptation priorities for cities and infrastructure across Europe. \[E10b\] 

 Many of the organisations we have worked with \[inc. E1, E2, E4, E6\] operate internationally and have extended the reach of our research. For example, our research on characterising engineering performance has benefited consultants “ *As a global company we are able to use this work to give us a competitive edge in our international consultancy work*” \[E5\]. Furthermore, our work to quantify flood risk, and define ‘event windows’ for insurers has played “ *a vital role in winning and retaining clients and maintaining a competitive edge…. driving revenue*” for Willis Towers Watson who operate in over 100 countries with a revenue of US$9bn \(2019\) \[E2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Migrations curatorial project encouraged internationally established artists and students to explore 'migration' through illustrated postcards. The project developed impact in two ways: 

-  Impact on education \- enhancing knowledge and understanding of issues around migration, and providing new opportunities, activities and learning processes, especially for children, nationally and internationally 

-  Impact on artists \(including migrants and refugees\), enriching their creative practice and knowledge, incorporating them into new artistic communities, and providing them with new cultural opportunities

###  2. Underpinning research 

 According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, the volume of media coverage featuring the terms ‘immigration’ or ‘migration’ steadily increased between 2011 and 2015. European news media had stoked fear and prejudice towards migrants and refugees, often employing derogatory terms and phrases when referring to these individuals. The Migrations curatorial research project \- being submitted in REF2 \- set out to challenge the current interpretation of the words, 'migrant' and 'migration' at the time of the migrant crisis in Europe \(2015 to present\) through illustration and crowd\-sourced exhibitions. 

 The aim of the Migrations project was to facilitate the communication of an alternative to media bias through curated illustration practice. Illustrators would interpret the words 'migrant' and 'migration' and visually communicate these interpretations through a postcard artwork. Postcards were selected as the format for the project because they are inclusive objects \- cheap, and easy to obtain and to send \(thus maximising participation\). A postcard is also highly symbolic of travel and movement, from the stamps that reflect its origins, to the marks, wear and tear picked up during its journey. On the back of the postcard would be the context for its production, which could take the form of a personal account of migration, a meaningful quote, or a positive comment that could challenge negative media discourse around migrants and migration. 

 The project research revealed that in contrast to the numerous negative news media stories of this subject, artists from around the world were responding to this theme by communicating a much more nuanced understanding of issues. Their work especially succeeded in engaging children. Examples are discussed in the paper: Davies, A., and McCannon D. \(2019\), ‘Contemporary Illustrative Reponses to the European Migration Crisis’, published in the conference proceedings of the International Conference on Illustration and Animation \(CONFIA\), Portugal. 

 Migrations resulted in exhibitions and intergenerational creative workshops in Europe, Africa and Asia, which received thousands of visitors. When exhibited in galleries, the display of postcards allowed viewers to access both sides of these objects. The tension and suspension of these postcards was interconnected by the installation of a wire network which rippled when a card was examined. This inter\-connectedness was designed as a physical embodiment and re\-construction of the virtual networks that had brought the works together, while also facilitating an interactive visitor experience. The availability of an iPad loaded with a map in exhibitions showing the origins of the postcards, as well as artist biographical details, further enhanced audience interaction and made the Migrations network available through digital navigation. 

 A selection of 50 postcards were used to create a book *Migrations \- Open Hearts, Open Borders*, published by Otter\-Barry Books \(2019\) in collaboration with Amnesty International. Proceeds from the book are donated to Amnesty International and IBBY \(International Board on Books for Young Children\). Illustrators featured in the book include Shaun Tan, Neal Layton, Jackie Morris, Christopher Corr, Nicola Davies, Petr Horacek, Axel Scheffler, Jane Ray, Marie Louise Gay and Roger Mello.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact on education</ins> 

 The Migrations research project has had an impact on the knowledge of members of the public \(adults, but particularly children\) who have attended its exhibitions and associated creative workshops \(2017 \- 2020\), and who have used the *Migrations* book in educational settings. New skills and artistic practices were gained by individuals given opportunities to engage in creative workshops and/or use the book in class. In discussions about the subject of 'migration' fuelled by the research, new knowledge, awareness and empathetic understanding of the issues faced by migrants and refugees was facilitated. 

 Bibiana, the International House of Art for Children based in Bratislava, Slovakia, became a partner of the project in 2017. Bibiana hosted the premiere presentation of the exhibition as an accompanying event of the 26<sup>th</sup> Biennial of Illustrations Bratislava. Viera Anoskinova \(Source A\) notes: ‘students of art schools and university were interested in means of integrating the idea, narrative, presentation and show installation. I was happy to see students obtaining new knowledge of issues around migration when engaging in the work.’ 

 Events took place during Hay Festival in 2017, with children able to contribute their work to the collection, providing ‘a powerful platform for young people to explore the social and political issues around migration and encouraging them to empathise with the lives of others through creative process and image making.’ \(Source B\) 

 The Centre for Literacy in Primary Education \(CLPE\), a UK based children's literacy charity working with primary schools, included the *Migrations* book as part of their 'Power of Reading’ project \(2019\-20\), placing the book in packs given to all teachers working on this project \(Source C\) **.** The book publication is now used in 600 schools across the UK to enable children's reading and understanding of issues around migration. The book is also identified as a core resource in Primary English teaching materials provided by another educational charity, the Hamilton Trust \(Source D\). 

 The North London Collegiate School \(Singapore\) has employed the *Migrations* book extensively in teaching, using it as a basis for an ongoing extra\-curricular project with two groups of Grade KG2\-Grade 3 pupils \(ages 4\-8 years\). Jonathan Guy \(Source E\) writes: ‘The outcomes of the project include greater understandings of the themes of migration; a development of a variety of art techniques using watercolours, collage and printing; and an increasing development of empathy within pupils from a young age.’ 

 Pam Dix, Chair of The International Board on Books for Young People \(IBBY UK\) writes: ‘The use of the postcard format has been used by teachers and illustrators as a way of engaging children in this powerful but constrained format – and their own illustrated postcards have been sent to children in other countries, refugee camps and other schools. It has also worked as a training medium, empowering teachers to think of the postcard as a format to be used for other projects. Similar work has been done with creative writing and creative responses to the messages on the reverse of the postcard. The fact that the book has become an integral part of the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education Power of Reading project speaks to the significance of this’ \(Source F\). 

 The Migrations project also provided inspiration for PGCE students at the University of Sussex, who have used its exploration of migration as a jumping off point for the development of their practice as teachers \(Source G\). 

 <ins>Impact on artists</ins> 

 The project had impact on several \(often marginalized\) artists through significant exposure of their work and recognition of their practice. It enabled 340 international artists to take part in a collaborative exhibition that travelled around the world, and for 50 of them to have their work published in a book sold in the UK and USA, thus impacting upon their practice and providing them with opportunities to share their work. For example, Mohammad Barrangi, an asylum seeker from Iran, had his artistic work included in both the travelling exhibition and in the *Migrations* book. He took part in the panel discussion that accompanied the book launch at Amnesty International in 2019 **.** Barrangi \(Source H\) testifies, ‘Being involved in Migrations was very valuable to me as it helped me develop my practice through artistic collaboration, and to think more about how art can tell stories about migration.’ Mary Louise Gay, an artist living in Montreal, Canada who produced a postcard for the project, explains that being involved in Migrations ‘gave me the time to explore thoughts about migration’ \(Source H\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Tax Gap \(the difference between tax liabilities and what is actually collected\) is a major concern to government, with the UK’s being £31 billion annually and the EU\-28’s, €1 trillion. 

 **Informing UK Tax Policy:** Engaged research by the University of Exeter’s Tax Administration Research Centre \(TARC\), provided the UK body responsible for tax collection \(HMRC\), with powerful, robust confirmation of existing Tax Gap estimates for self\-employment income, additionally identifying relevant economic sectors most prone to under\-reporting, and so informing their tax gap reduction strategies. 

 **Informing International Tax Policies:** Internationally, research underpinned: \(1\) the Greek Tax Administration Authority’s decision to restructure its national tax auditing strategy \(at a cost of €160 million\); \(2\) changes to the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency’s VAT Tax Gap measurement process; \(3\) the Rwanda Revenue Agency’s re\-evaluation of its tax auditing strategy; and \(4\) strengthened the work of the prominent EU Tax Gap Project Group. Additionally, Kotsogiannis was asked to work with the International Monetary Fund to evaluate their world\-leading TADAT tool, to improve performance of tax assessment globally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Tax Gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be paid, and what is actually paid.  Measurement of the Tax Gap is an important tool in helping governments to understand the relative size and nature of non\-compliance, and then to develop effective strategies aimed at reducing the gap. Better understanding and measurement of the Tax Gap is a top priority for all revenue agencies. The UK’s HMRC estimates the UK *income* Tax Gap to be in the region of £12 billion annually and in the EU\-28 it is estimated to be over €50 billion a year. Corresponding annual UK Tax Gaps relating to *all forms* of tax are estimated to be £31 billion \(UK; 4.7% of total theoretical tax liabilities\) and €1 trillion \(EU\-28\). 

 The major piece of research **\[3.1\]** underpinning this impact case study is the outcome of a longstanding close collaboration between the UK’s HMRC, and Professors Kotsogiannis and Myles of the University of Exeter Business School Tax Administration Research Centre \(TARC\). HMRC representatives sit on TARC’s Advisory Board and a PhD was delivered thorough this research \(Ana Cinta G. Cabral\). 

 The TARC/HMRC collaboration was consolidated through a research project led by Kotsogiannis \(2013\-2017\) on Tax Gap measurement, which specifically focused on the UK’s *Self\-employment Income* Tax Gap – estimated to be £1 to £2 billion annually **\[3.1\]**. The project was commissioned directly and co\-developed with the HMRC. Its aim was to contribute to improving understanding around some of the more challenging areas of tax gap estimation. The research **\[3.1\]** builds on the existing literature, which utilises the expenditure\-based methodology to measure income tax non\-compliance, and exploits the differing opportunity for under\-reporting of the two employment groups, the self\-employed and employed. 

 As income from employment is subject to ‘withholding taxes’, there are minimal possibilities for under\-reporting, and thus the income of the employed is assumed to be accurately reported. Through observing the expenditure pattern of the employed, the level of income necessary to sustain a certain level of expenditure can be ascertained. Therefore, any discrepancies between the income reported by the self\-employed and the employed, at a certain level of expenditure, can be used to elicit the extent of hidden income by the former group. A key research finding was that the discrepancy observed is due to the taxpayer’s decision to under\-report their tax liabilities, as opposed to being due to reasons related to the heterogeneous behaviour of occupational groups and the differences in their preferences, or by consumers saving and consuming differently, or error in measuring the variables of interest **\[3.1\]**. This is an important finding and innovation because, when events are studied that do not lend themselves to measurement \(as with the under\-reporting of income\), there might be several other explanations that challenge the underlying assumptions of the analysis, and could potentially bias the results, in this case, leading to a false attribution to income under\-reporting. 

 Following several robustness tests, the research **\[3.1\]**, confirms that the results are not caused by different preferences between the self\-employed and the employed. It shows that, on average, the self\-employed report only 80.4% of their true income \(or the self\-employed income\-gap is 19.6%\). Given that self\-employment income in the UK for the period of study \(2010–2012\) represented 5.5% of GDP, this translated into an estimate of unreported taxable income of 1.6% of GDP. 

 Further analysis **\[3.2\]**, carried out in collaboration with HMRC, identified the economic sectors which are contributing to the UK’s Hidden Economy \(defined as the economy operating outside formal channels\) with the highest risk of income under\-reporting. 

 The initial major piece of research **\[3.1\]** subsequently led to cooperation with a number of other national revenue authorities, including the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency \(BNRA\). With the support of the BNRA, TARC was awarded £100,000 by the Alan Turing Institute \(2018\-2020\) for the project ‘Detecting Anomalies in Networks: The Case of VAT’, which investigated Value Added Tax \(VAT\) fraud, being a component part of the Tax Gap. The project was delivered in collaboration with University College London. Insights obtained from the work with HMRC **\[3.1\]** were combined with Bulgarian administrative tax data, and resulted in a report and scientific contribution analysing how the VAT Tax Gap, resulting from fraud, can be minimised in Bulgaria **\[3.3\].** Using an algorithm, the research identified 8,000 registered traders from the Bulgarian tax base, previously categorised as low risk, that were in fact non\-compliant. 

 The initial research **\[3.1\]** was also developed to estimate the income Tax Gap in Greece in 2018 in collaboration with the Hellenic Republic’s Independent Authority for Public Revenue \(IAPR\). 

 Kotsogiannis’ continuing collaboration with UK’s HMRC’s Tax Gap team, and the new work with the BNRA **\[3.3\]**, subsequently led to the development and presentation of research which considered how revenue agencies can optimally choose the sample of tax payers to audit, with the objective of narrowing the Tax Gap **\[3.4\]**. 

 The TARC research portfolio also led to cooperation with the Rwanda Revenue Authority on an original policy report evaluating its audit strategy **\[3.5\]**. This delivered preliminary and provisional estimates of the effect of Rwanda Revenue Authority \(RRA\) audits on reporting behaviour after one and two years following the end of the whole audit process for Corporate Income Taxes \(CIT\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Better understanding and measurement of the Tax Gap is a top priority for all revenue agencies. TARC research has delivered impact to national government tax and revenue collection agencies in four different countries – the UK, Greece, Bulgaria, and Rwanda \- generated through collaborative working approaches with national agencies: UK’s HMRC, the Independent Authority for Public Revenue of the Hellenic Republic \(IAPR\), Bulgarian National Revenue Agency \(BRNA\) and Rwanda Revenue Agency \(RRA\). TARC research has **provided robust confirmation of existing estimates of Tax Gaps**; helped **identify the economic sectors which are more prone to under\-declaring their tax liabilities**; and **contributed to national reforms including the restructuring of tax auditing and planning**. The research also contributed to the international tax and revenue community through work with the prominent European Commission’s Tax Gap Project Group and through leading an influential International Monetary Fund review of their TADAT tool. 

 **Informing UK Government Tax Policy**: The underpinning research **\[3.1\]** confirmed HMRC estimates of Tax Gap magnitudes relating to self\-employed income in the UK, providing them with *“external assurance”* **\[5.1\]** and a powerful measure of the robustness of their own analytical approach. The research was the *“outcome of longstanding collaboration”* **\[5.1\],** co\-developed by TARC and the HMRC’s Tax Gap team between 2014 and 2016, along with contributions from HMRC’s Knowledge, Analytics and Investigations Team and Hidden Economy Team. It was driven by HMRC’s strategy around the validation of its approaches by obtaining alternative measurements of the UK’s Tax Gap, to deepen its understanding of that gap, and provide “ *the foundation for HMRC’s strategies which are most effective at reducing the gap*” **\[5.1\].** . 

 The TARC Programme Manager for HMRC explained: “ *Professor Kotsogiannis provided work which supported HMRC’s understanding of the self\-employed income Tax Gap. This has been a valuable contribution to HMRC. Estimating the Tax Gap…is an important tool for understanding the relative size and nature of non\-compliance.*” **\[5.1\].**  As the research also identifies ‘risky sectors’ \(i.e. those most prone to tax under\-reporting\), she further confirmed that HMRC was able to more efficiently target their auditing and tax investigation resources towards these sectors **\[5.1\]:**   *“the research developed the approach to explore under\-declaration of second/additional incomes, which are part of the moonlighting hidden economy”* and therefore *“provided valuable external insight into the key sectors in which this took place”* **\[5.1\].** Between 2014 and 2018, Kotsogiannis’ team delivered six presentations \(based on **\[3.1, 3.2\]**\) to HMRC’s Tax Gap team which *“helped to build shared understanding on the range of analytical approaches”* available to HMRC **\[5.1\].** 

 **Informing International Tax Policies** 

 **European Commission Tax Gap Project Group**: The impact of the research **\[3.1\]** was extended through Kotsogiannis being invited to present findings to the prominent Tax Gap Project Group, established under the EU’s FISCALIS 2020 programme. Coordinated by the EC’s Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union, this Group was established to pool knowledge and share experience in existing Tax Gap estimations across the EU\-28. In Nov 2015, Kotsogiannis presented to representatives of EU member states’ National Revenue Authorities working on the Tax Gap and the Hidden Economy, and the research was cited in, and contributed, to the Tax Gap Project Group’s 2016 report: ‘The Concept of Tax Gaps. Report on VAT Gap Estimations’ **\[5.2\].**

 **International Monetary Fund \(IMF\)**: As a further measure of the global significance and impact reach of TARC’s work, Kotsogiannis was approached by the IMF to work collaboratively with a team of experts, to evaluate the impact of their world\-leading TADAT tool – the International Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool. This tool assesses the speed of tax administration reforms and intends to improve performance of tax assessment globally.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 As resources for education, cultural and creative arts dwindle, it is becoming increasingly important for academics and practitioners to make existing assets available in a range of interactive ways. Sweetman and her team introduced hands\-on experiences with archaeological artefacts into various Scottish communities \(12 primary schools totalling over 1,000 people \(children\), 2 marginalized groups and 7 prison visits as part of Cellblock Science\). They have achieved key outcomes such as improvements in literacy, self\-worth and confidence in their participants. For example, after the literacy and archaeology sessions at a local primary school, the teacher noted a 63% rise in the students’ \(aged 8\-9\) confidence, measured through frequency of speaking in class. The team have ensured that hands\-on experiences continue through Continuing Professional Development sessions \(3 were undertaken before Covid\) and the creation of loan boxes of archaeological material \(for use in schools in Fife and Tayside, Scotland\) and lesson plans \(this is being developed for on\-line use since Covid\). Furthermore, their research has resulted in changes in attitudes and associated practices in heritage \(museums\) and creative art \(poetry and pottery\) sectors locally, nationally and internationally. Sweetman and her team have trained heritage professionals ranging from US military cultural advisers, to museums, such as the Te Papa in New Zealand and the Scottish Maritime Museum \(12 people\). They have presented and demonstrated their work to some 960 people \(museum and museum\-related professionals\).  They have also inspired 29 people \(poets and potters\) through workshops with the Bridges collection. 4 ‘artefact’ poems have been commissioned. These changes are sustained through the creation of 131 virtual artefacts and ‘how to’ guides which are freely available online via the project website \( [https://thebridgescollection.com/about/](https://thebridgescollection.com/about/)\) and through the Institute of Conservation Newsletter.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **1. Modes of engagement with archaeological material** 

 Over the last 15 years, Sweetman’s research has made significant gains in increasing the pedagogical potential of virtual reconstructions. Most recently, she has focused on the value of digital archaeology for accessibility and interpretation, thereby raising awareness of the facts that digital reconstructions are not necessarily useful for understanding and retaining information contrary to perceived ideas. Moreover, her research found that a variety of sensory engagements, in particular touch, enabled an enhanced understanding of material culture and associated context, while stimulating wellbeing and enjoyment. 

 These results came from a series of collaborative experiments \(Through a Glass Darkly, *TAGD*\), between April 2016 and October 2018, using the Bridges Collection of just under 200 physical artefacts dating from the Bronze Age to Byzantine period. It is on display in the School of Classics at the University of St Andrews. The first experiments tested perceptions of material culture using different sensory engagements: visually from behind a glass case; virtually\-visually via 3D digital reconstructions; haptically \(within sensory boxes\); and, finally, by simultaneous haptic and visual experience \(handling\). The results were unequivocal. Objects that were only viewed and not touched were deemed ‘art’ rather than artefact. Those that enabled interaction through touch were more likely to be considered artefact \(R1\), thereby encouraging more considerations of the people who made and used the object. 

 In a second collaboration with neuroscience, the team tested memory recall using three of the sensory experiences. The 2018 experiments showed that touch led to a heightened ability to recall information about the object, while 3D and viewing were about the same \(R2\). 

  

 **2. Accessibility of archaeological material** 

 
The work above has shown that virtual, visual and haptic modes of experience have different effects on users’ cognition, inspiration and memory retention. To date, however, there has been little empirical testing on the effect/s resulting from different forms of experiencing objects. The *TAGD* team have taken their research into the community to show how engagement with material culture contributes to overall wellbeing. They are helping to inform teachers, museum specialists and professionals of its value. This work builds on Sweetman’s long\-term interdisciplinary and collaborative projects geared to making archaeological material and its interpretation accessible to wide audiences. Examples of this include St Andrews Cathedral and the Sparta Basilica \(based on her excavations, R3 & R4\), as well as the creation of a virtual excavation \(R5\) and the Virtual App of Mediaeval St Andrews \(R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Drawing on their research into archaeological reconstruction and tactile experience with artefacts, Sweetman and her team have achieved improvements in literacy, self\-worth and confidence among 12 schools, 2 groups of dementia patients, 1 mental health group and 2 Scottish prisons. This work continues through ongoing Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) sessions, the lending of archaeological loan\-boxes, the distribution of lesson plans and the sharing of material \(e.g.  [https://www.scottishlearninggroup.com/what\-we\-ve\-done\-so\-far/categories/case\-studies](https://www.scottishlearninggroup.com/what-we-ve-done-so-far/categories/case-studies)\). In addition, Sweetman’s work has led to changes in attitudes and practices in the heritage and creative arts sectors, for 3 museums, 74 people: 1 military adviser, 1 museum software developer, 2 poets and their classes of 31 attendees, and 2 potters and their classes of 37 attendees. Sweetman and her team have also given regular showcases in museum meetings in Tayside, Fife, and the rest of the UK, with total attendees at these events amounting to 960 people \(museum and museum\-related professionals\). 

 **1. Transforming Educational Practice through Engagement with Material Culture** 

 Work done by Sweetman’s research group \( *TAGD*\) shows sensory engagement with artefacts encourages creative thinking and confidence to promote reading and writing. In ‘literacy workshops’ at 6 primary schools, the practice of ‘reading objects’ \(haptically and visually\) was seen to promote children’s understanding of narrative. By allowing children a choice in how they explored the objects, the workshops were said to motivate and empower the children in their literacy \(S1\). 

 After an all\-day workshop on archaeology and literacy on the 31 May 2019, with 119 people \(pupils\), one teacher commented, “ *I don’t think the children felt like it was ‘literacy’ as they know it and they enjoyed language in a different way.*” \(S1, p. 9\) 

 The work on engagement with material and literacy has involved over 1,000 people \(children\) over a period of 4 years, with an intensive 3\-month period from November 2019 to February 2020, whereby the children involved benefited directly or through CPD training and the creation of resources such as the loan boxes of replicas. This loan box provides lesson plans, props and replicas of archaeological artefacts to be used in promotion of literacy based on our studies. Typical comments from the 25 people \(teachers\) in 10 primary schools in Fife involved with the work are: “ *It gave me practical ideas to the curricular areas above \[i.e. linking “literacy and drama to social subjects \(people in the past\)*” and “Have come away with practical steps to implement sensory elements in my practice” \(Teacher CPD Development 15/11/19\) \(S1\). Primary 5 Teacher at Lawhead Primary School, Fife \(10/9/20\) follows up: “ *It has given me new teaching ideas, especially the cross curricular aspect and the value of resources towards pupil engagement*.” \(S1, p. 1\) The sessions also impacted on ‘extending the idea of literacy’ and not just ‘being focused on reading and writing’ \(Learning Support Teacher Cannongate Primary School, St Andrews, Fife 7/2/20\) \(S1, p. 7\). 

 After the literacy and archaeology sessions, childcare practitioners in Lawhead Primary School noted the children were “ *cooperating well, better than usual*” and there was increased participation even by “ *those who don’t often participate in group activities*” \(S1, p. 4\-5\). 

 **2. Improving learning & wellbeing of prisoners in two Scottish prisons and of dementia patients in Fife** 

 
Between July 2018 and December 2019 *TAGD* undertook 8 workshops in two prisons in Perth, Scotland with 50 people \(prisoners\) for their education and wellbeing \(this work has been on hold since Covid\) \(S2, esp. pp. 4\-5\). Following handling sessions and discussions of technology and engagement with their archaeology and literacy programme, 92% of the 38 prisoners surveyed recorded that, as a result of the engagement, they felt **‘**good’ and ‘privileged’ \(S10, pp. 1, 7, 9, 11, 12\) and that the activities made them feel ‘smart’ and ‘informed’ \(S10, p 6, 13, 15, 16\). 

 A key result of the research on sensory engagement has been the development of work with dementia patients. The project has engaged with Fife Museums forum \(15 people \(museum professionals\)\) to promote haptic and visual experience of unfamiliar artefacts as a beneficial practice in care for early and middle stage dementia sufferers. The project kicked off with St Andrews Memory Café \(February 2020\), a support group for patients and families, to launch the programme of work with 12 people \(dementia patients and carers\). Although this part of our project has been severely disrupted due to Covid, we have been taking it forward by initiating a collaboration with Fife and Tayside libraries, to provide well\-being opportunities for dementia patients and their carers through engagement with unfamiliar objects from the Bridges collection. 

 **3. Delivering training to shape material culture and heritage practices** 

 Building on her virtual reconstruction research \(R4, R5 and R6\), Sweetman converted 131 3D objects from the Bridges Collection into online reconstructions using Sketchfab, the free to use digital platform used by Museum and publishing professionals. The virtual Bridges Collection has had 9,100 views since its launch in 2017. In addition, between October 2016 and August 2020, Sweetman and team have delivered 29 separate events aimed at museum, gallery and heritage professionals. These include hands\-on workshops, individual meetings, and presentations given at museum and heritage sector conferences, with a total of 968 people \(participants\). Altogether, the dissemination work and provision of models on Sketchfab has resulted in at least 5 people \(museum professionals\) employing *TAGD’s* digitisation training in their work \(S3, S4 & S5\). 

 One example is the Assistant Professor\-Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Innovation Lab \(Citadel Military College, North Carolina, USA\), who has trained around 40 people \(US military personnel\) in recording material culture \(since 2018\). The Assistant Professor\-Strategy & Entrepreneurship spent two weeks at the Bridges Collection in 2017 and again in 2018, to experience 3D digitisation of archaeological artefacts directly. The *TAGD* team trained the Assistant Professor in safe artefact handling and basic identification as well as in the importance of preservation of archaeological material, which was reported by STV and shown on news bulletins in January 2018 reaching 1,500,000 people \(viewers\). \(S3\). 

 As a result of *TAGD*’s training, and subsequent work in training others, the Assistant Professor\-Strategy & Entrepreneurship is now collaborating with 6 people \(their students\), with the newly launched Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative. This works in tandem with the US military to scan and preserve at\-risk archaeological material. “ *This last year, the Department of Defence reauthorized the formation of this unit \[Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative\] and I was selected as one of the pilot study participants largely due to the work we accomplished through the Bridges collection*” \(S3, January 2020\). 

 


*TAGD* also provided 3D artefacts and advised the JIX team who developed a Touch Tank, a haptic experience of 3D artefacts, as part of MAHUKI \(the Te Papa Museum Innovation accelerator progamme\) 2018 \(New Zealand\) \(S4\). 

 The Founder and Design Technologist of JIX said *TAGD* *“gave us significant historical background of the objects and how they handle them with utmost care. This inspired the way we made the collections accessible in the MAHUKI Showcase which otherwise wouldn’t have been possible*”. And “ *We have found gallons of interest in emulating this project for several other museums. They want to use similar technologies to give access to various other institutions which haven’t been traditionally accessible*” \(S4, pp. 1\-2\). JIX have now gone on to develop their technology to use during the Covid pandemic in Christchurch International Airport. Commercial bodies such as Christchurch Casino and Te Pae Convention Centre have showed further interest in creating “ *touchless interfaces to combat physical hygiene concerns that have risen in using public touch screen kiosks*” \(S4, p. 3\). 

 Sweetman’s team have been disseminating good practice \(S3\-S6\) by working closely with colleagues to provide advice on scanning. One colleague, Curator of the Scottish Maritime Museum, called the team’s advice “ *a crucial influence on our writing the successful funding appli\-cation to Museums Galleries Scotland \- the Creating 3D Models Quick Guide was a great starting point for us non\-experts and gave us the confidence to write the bid for the project*” \(S5, p. 3\). 

 The underpinning research \(R1 & R2\) has informed museum curatorship and management on the value of multi\-sensory engagement opportunities at Fife and Tayside Museums \(Scotland\), the Te Papa Museum \(New Zealand\), Maritime Museum, Ayrshire \(Scotland\), and the Fisheries Museum, Fife \(Scotland\) \(S5, P1\-2\): “ *My goals in collaboration with the* TAGD *team were to experiment with different methods of interpretation for existing materials in a museum gallery, and to create an effective, interactive display to enhance one of our galleries. These goals have been met – we have decided to create a multi\-sensory display in the gallery*.” Curator, Fisheries Museum 23/01/20. \(S5, p. 1\) 

 Sweetman produced a *Quick Guide to creating 3D models*, which is available on the project web\-site for free download. This guide was also shared by Routledge’s Journal Editor, in the  [member newsletter](https://www.iiconservation.org/system/files/publications/journal/2018/b2018_4.pdf) \(S6 p. 20\) of the International Institute for Conservation with 1,800 views of the website announcement, linking to the guide, and the Institute of Conservation’s  [news blog](https://icon.org.uk/news/journal-of-the-institute-of-conservation-publishes-3d-models). The IIC newsletter is distributed in print and online to their approximately 1,500 people \(members\). \(S5, p. 3, S6\) 

 The National Museum of Scotland included *TAGD* as a case study at the launch of their National Strategy \(October 2017\) and our work has been highlighted as best practice to museum professionals during the UNIVERSEUM Digital Initiatives Working Party \(June 2018\), and as part of Scotland’s archaeology strategy \(July 2018\) and of the *New Futures for Replicas* publication which provides guidance for museum and heritage  [https://replicas.wordpress.stir.ac.uk/files/2020/07/NewFutureReplicas\-leaflet\-proof6\-spreadslow\-res.pdf](https://replicas.wordpress.stir.ac.uk/files/2020/07/NewFutureReplicas-leaflet-proof6-spreadslow-res.pdf). *TAGD* is also promoted on the Collections Trust website \(https://collectionstrust.org.uk/blog/through\-a\-glass\-darkly\-museum\-memory\-and\-senses/\) \(S5 & S6\). 

 **4. Encouraging use of diverse media in the creative arts** 

 


In the arts, the research on different modes of experience of artefacts was used in 2018 and 2019 as the inspiration for creative writing workshops at StAnza, the annual St Andrews poetry festival with 31 people \(poets\) attending and with two poets leading the sessions. Four people \(poets\) were commissioned to write poems inspired by the objects \(S7\).  The session leaders encouraged different interactions with the material culture to inspire new poems and ways of writing as noted by the poetry festival director \(S8, pp. 1\-3\). One poet wrote \(9/9/20\) “ *As soon as I was able to examine the figurine from all sides, something clicked for me and the first line of the poem came into my head*.” \(S8, pp. 3\-4\) 

 Between 2017 and 2019, Two potters \(A&B\), have worked independently with the Bridges Collection to create replicas of the archaeology and our work has inspired their practices. **“** *Interacting with the collection has inspired me to further explore incorporating domestic objects into the work as a way to look at the perceived role of women in ancient and modern society. The objects have given me fresh impetus and new ideas to feed into my work.”* \(S9, p. 2\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Recent civil wars across Africa have devastated the lives of many. Despite global efforts to stem the rise of violent conflict, relapse of civil wars in Africa remains a significant reality. Seeking to understand and break the cyclical nature of conflict, King’s research has had multi\-level transformational impact on approaches to building durable peace in Africa. Conceptually re\-framing peacebuilding around the notion of ‘societal conversation’ and the role of inclusive leadership, King’s research has shaped UN resolutions and policy, and the perspectives, policy and programming of African governments and major donors. At the same time, through the African Leadership Centre \(ALC\), King’s research has shaped a unique training programme which builds the careers, networks and influence of a new generation of female African leaders who are forging peace and security on the continent through NGOs, positions in government, and in institutions impacting communities, education, transitional justice and policy throughout the continent. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 According to the World Bank, every civil war in Africa that has begun since 2003 has been the resumption of a previous civil war. To understand and overcome this cyclical nature of conflict in Africa, over the last 15 years Professor ‘Funmi Olonisakin has undertaken numerous, multi\-layered research projects across 12 African countries. This body of work has pioneered inclusive research and a dynamic methodological approach that ensures key, yet previously excluded voices directly inform peacebuilding efforts. 

#  Building peace 

 King’s research has shown that systems created to build peace fail when they do not speak to the lived realities of the people most affected by conflict \[1\]. It posits that the current dominant narrative that constructs the building of institutions and infrastructure as a prerequisite to peace is flawed, because it does not work to re\-build fractured societal relationships. This leads to the exclusion of significant groups within conflict\-affected communities. 

 In particular, King’s research found that in conflict\-affected communities, youth and women have typically been routinely and disproportionately excluded from policy decisions \[2,3\], with the result that peacebuilding programmes do not speak to their practical realities. Research showed that this leads to alternative non\-state structures emerging, such as, in the case of vulnerable youth: armed groups, religious organisations, or informal economies \[1,2\]. These exist outside of the formal peacebuilding processes. They compete with them, making formal processes ineffective and, both knowingly and inadvertently, re\-enforce the recurrent patterns of insecurity in society. As a consequence, the conflict cycle is repeated. 

#  ‘Societal Conversation’ as a framework for understanding peacebuilding 

 King’s research has reframed the notion of conversation as central to the processes of building peace \[4\]. It highlights how conversations between those in power, and between them and society more widely, give rise to and/or fail to bring about particular ensembles of institutions and policy outcomes, and it identifies the ‘missing links’ in conversations about peace and security. It proposes that peacebuilding needs to be understood as being about the opening\-up and shifting of these conversations in non\-violent directions. This entails facilitating conversations that minimise what a society itself \(not external peacebuilders\) considers as violent, and building what a society itself agrees to be peace \[4,3\]. 

 This research articulates a new way of building peace centred around charting conversations among contending actors and society in non\-violent ways. In particular, it recommends an expanded notion of conversation that extends beyond formal dialogue to include wide\-ranging forms of interaction with a variety of groups within society, many of which were previously marginalised or excluded from peacebuilding efforts. From this perspective, individuals and organisations engage in talk and respond to issues through a range of actions including music, artefacts, theatre, protests and through inaction \- even silence is part of the conversation about peace and conflict \[4\]. King’s research proposes that tracking how people are talking and talking back to powerful actors enables a more inclusive national conversation about peace and security that is central to building lasting peace. 

#  The role of leadership in peacebuilding 

 Building and developing leadership for peacebuilding has traditionally been narrowly defined and person\-focused, either assigned to individuals and experts in positions of authority in peace operations and conflict affected societies, or understood as a by\-product of institution building. In stark contrast, King’s research argues for the systematic inclusion of a re\-conceptualised form of process\-based, inclusive leadership to be part of the core focus of peacebuilding, insisting that investment in African leadership is vital to breaking the cycle of conflict \[5,6\]. 

 This innovative approach takes, as its starting point, the contextual situation and identifies key actors that are working to address the common issues identified. It then posits that these relationships are studied and the capacities of these emerging leaders are built and that they become co\-producers and agents of peacebuilding conceptual innovation, policies and programming.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prof. Olonisakin’s cumulative body of research and engagement work has underpinned a wide variety of peacebuilding activities at the highest level. UN bodies, donors, governments, and influential fora have sought out her research, expertise and commitment to transformational leadership, making her a respected and influential agent of change. She was also ranked in the top 10 of the UK’s ‘Powerlist’ of the most influential people of African or African Caribbean heritage in the UK in 2019 \(and included in the 2020 and 2021 editions\). 

 Her work has resulted in extensive and substantive impact in four main areas: 

#  **Shaping UN resolutions on the peacebuilding agenda** 

 Through Prof. Olonisakin’s extensive engagement work, King’s research has become an integral part of UN discussions on peace and security in Africa. Consistently called upon to share research and evidence relating to women, youth, peace and security in a variety of UN settings, Prof. Olonisakin has created a clear network of influence and contributed to several UN Resolutions \(the formal expressions of the opinion or will of the United Nations, providing guidance to member states and giving direction to all policy and practice related to these areas\). This sustained engagement culminated in Prof. Olonisakin being appointed by UN Secretary\-General Ban Ki Moon as one of seven experts on the UN Advisory Group of Experts on the Review of UN Peacebuilding Architecture \(2015\) and the UN Secretary General’s Advisory Group of Experts for the UN Progress Study on Youth, Peace and Security \(2016\) \[A\]. 

 Most notably, Prof. Olonisakin’s extensive body of research has helped to shape the UN peacebuilding policy. The UN Charter has a vision of “sav\[ing\] succeeding generations from the scourge of war” \[B p.7\]. However, for many UN Member States and UN entities, peacebuilding has been an afterthought. The 2015 Review of UN Peacebuilding Architecture explored the challenge of sustaining peace, assessing both the evolving global context for peacebuilding and compiling an assessment of UN peacebuilding activities. As a member of the Advisory Group, Prof. Olonisakin included her extensive research knowledge of this area in the assessment. Based on detailed consideration of her proposal to move away from elite and imported peace, the recommendations from the 2015 Review stated that: “The UN, with its partners, should consider a new emphasis on building national leadership as an integral part of a reconciliation and nation\-building agenda, working to shift the focus away from the personal ambitions of protagonists to engaging in a common vision for the country” \[B p.56\]. The final report includes the concepts of ‘leadership and broadening inclusion’ \[B p.9\] developed by King’s research \[6\] as a way to build coherence in the delivery of the ‘sustaining peace’ agenda, stating that leadership \(at the national level\) is something that must be based on a mutually held goal/ vision between elite and society rather than an inter\-elite peace \[B p.33\]. Following this report, in 2016 a new UN Resolution \(2282 \[C\]\) was unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council, formally expressing the adjusted opinions of the UN, shifting the framing of leadership away from a focus on individuals towards understanding it as a process that must involve sectors of society. 

 In addition, Prof. Olonisakin presented her findings \[1,2\] at the Global Study to the Youth, Peace and Security, Advisory Group of Experts in Nairobi 2016, contributing towards the UN Progress Study on Youth, Peace and Security. This led to youth exclusion and vulnerability challenges being introduced into the study and Prof. Olonisakin’s work being referenced throughout the resulting Report \[D\], specifically calling attention to the violence of exclusion and the meaningful inclusion of youth. As a result, in 2018 UN Resolution 2419 \[E\] called on relevant actors to recognise youth marginalisation as being detrimental to building sustainable peace and to consider ways to increase the inclusive representation of youth in peacebuilding. 

#  Shaping national level policy and youth programmes 

 As a result of work to shape international level UN policy, Prof. Olonisakin has been in demand to help develop the thinking and policy of a number of national governments. For example, she was invited to advise the Nigerian Vice\-President at the 2017 National Economic Council Security Summit. He stated that Prof. Olonisakin’s research shaped discussions, clarifying root causes of conflict and possible solutions, and said “we have taken note of your various recommendations. We assure you that they will be useful in fine\-tuning the various reforms of our security architecture” \[F\]. 

 King’s research on youth peace\-building \[2\] has also had a substantial impact on Canada’s International Development Research Centre \(IDRC\), a Canadian Crown corporation that funds research in developing countries to advance knowledge and solutions for a more inclusive and sustainable world. As attested by the IDRC’s Regional Director \[G\], “King’s research has had a substantial impact on IDRC, informing and shaping our strategy and programming especially in relation to the importance of youth voices and perspectives in promoting inclusive development”. King’s research on youth economic vulnerability and exclusion \[2\] also informed an IDRC consultative workshop, engaging youth researchers to set a research agenda which subsequently funded an important cohort of youth\-led projects across the continent. For example, in Zimbabwe over 300 youths were supported to foster peace through capacity\-building and the creation of spaces that enable youth participation in civil and policy processes, and in South Africa over 200 young people formerly involved in gangs were supported to transition to different lifestyles \[G\]. 

#  Shaping conversations and driving action on security and peacebuilding in Africa 

 King’s research has had substantial impact on the development of fora which open new lines of conversation and shape action across a variety of security and peacebuilding issues in Africa. For example, the Tana High\-Level Forum on Security in Africa is a network that brings together African heads of state, former heads of state, policy practitioners, academics and other stakeholders to engage and explore African\-led security solutions. From its conception, King’s research has shaped the Forum’s core topics, particularly relating to the impact of conflict and state fragility on security and state\-building. With Prof. Olonisakin appointed to its Board in 2013, King’s research into the critical role of leadership in peacebuilding \[5,6\] has led to the systematic integration of leadership analysis into the Forum. In particular, as a result of King’s research analysing dominant trends and the shifts needed to enable peacebuilding solutions, meetings now have a standing item of ‘The State of Peace and Security in Africa’. Furthermore, King’s work on youth, peace and security underpins the Forum’s inclusion of youth voices, where previously the next generation of African scholars and leaders were uncommon contributors to such high\-level conversations. H.E. Olusegun Obasanjo, Former President of Nigeria and Chairperson of Tana Forum Board recognised this shift, stating that “without Prof. Olonisakin’s work we would not have been able to shape aspects of Tana Forum’s agenda in the ways that we did. We are extremely grateful to her for helping us to bring the best voices together to discuss the best topics in the right moments” \[H\]. 

 Prof. Olonisakin is also co\-chair of a partnership between Wilton Park \(an executive agency of the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office\) and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Convening key actors who would not ordinarily be in the same room, this forum links policy and government decision\-makers with academics, practitioners, activists, civil society, youth ambassadors and emerging African leaders. Resulting in greater inter\-generational collaboration and learning, the first ‘Peacebuilding in Africa’ conference was held in 2015, with annual meetings occurring across Africa, UK, US and Canada. The Carnegie Corporation’s Peacebuilding in Africa Programme Officer highlights how King’s research has provided “foundational inputs” to developing this forum and has “remained central to the conference’s success and its intellectual and policy framing” \[I\]. For example, in 2015 King’s research resulted in the conference report’s recommendation that peacebuilding be redefined as an activity that encapsulates the whole cycle of conflict and that includes leadership building in ways that focus on mutually held goals between elite/ protagonists and the wider society to include marginalised constituencies, such as youth and women \[J\]. 

#  Transforming a new generation of African leaders 

 The King’s\-based African Leadership Centre \(ALC\) has developed a model through which King’s knowledge and understanding around leadership \[5,6\] are brought to life. By seeking to build and empower a critical mass of young African leaders, the centre tackles the lack of representation of young, especially female Africans in positions of influence, taking a long\-term approach to invest in a new generation. Attempting to disrupt participants’ worldviews, unpick hierarchy and leadership, and change perspectives, ALC courses prepare individuals to challenge accepted norms and take on positions of leadership, creating a new narrative about Africa. 

 The ALC provides a unique portfolio curriculum that has developed from the King’s research acknowledgement that leadership should be inclusive, process\-based and inter\-generational \[5,6\]. As identified by alumni, the ALC experience is ‘life\-changing’, and provides an education that reaches beyond the classroom to help individuals forge life\-long networks and support systems that are ‘invaluable’ ‘enriching’, ‘transformative’ and ‘redefining’ \[K1\]. In addition, an independent evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation \(a repeated funder of the ALC\) noted that the ALC has “had an excellent and unmatched track record of results” \[L\]. Since August 2013 the ALC has successfully mentored 57 young African leaders from 18 African countries, particularly women, who have gone on to successfully shape policy and practice in Africa. Taking up jobs as analysts, officials, educators and practitioners, all are forging knowledge production, policy and practice in African organisations, governments, NGOs and civil society. Examples include Ebenezer Ofosu Asiedu, who became Head of Mediation Facilitation Division, Economic Community of West African States Commission in 2016 and has proffered recommendations that have informed policy change which has resulted in several violent conflicts having been either prevented or their impacts mitigated \[K2\]. In addition, the Hon. Abratha P. Doe, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Liberia, 2014\-17 represented Liberia at the 2014 African Union Arms Trade Treaty. Ms Doe stated that her ALC Fellowship provided her with “both the theoretical and practical knowledge that strategically positioned me to both win and successfully carry out my ministerial position” \[K3\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Novelists and playwrights rely on centuries\-old storytelling practices while at the same time needing to find new ways to remain relevant to audiences. Traditional forms of storytelling are sometimes framed as under threat from new technology, as the endless editorials proclaiming the ‘end of books’ or ‘demise of theatre’ demonstrate. With the rise in digital media and immersive technologies, the tools available to a writer to create stories are radically evolving. With audiences and readers becoming increasingly technologically curious and adept, new ways to engage with narrative are opening up, enabling audiences to be more present and active in the experience. In response to this, writers are investigating how they might redevelop their creative practice to provide a more personal and immediate experience for an audience. The challenge is to discover what new processes writers need to forge to explore the opportunities technology offers to storytelling, and how to engage with existing audiences whilst also building new audiences for these emerging hybrid creative forms. 

 Stemming from the Narrative & Emerging Technology Lab \(NET\) in the Centre for Cultural and Creative Industries \(CCCI\), Clark and Pullinger’s research into how emerging digital media technologies can remodel traditional literary forms has informed new models of narrative production for multiple sections of the UK creative industries. Impact spans across sector, practitioner and audience development, leading to: the creation of new polymorphic narrative forms based on the fusion of analogue and digital spaces; the development and sharing of new creative practice toolkits; the development of new creative alliances and practices in cross\-disciplinary collaborations with other artists and technologists; and the broadening of theatre audiences and prose readers for these emerging and cross\-disciplinary approaches.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Emerging from the unit’s strategic aim to nurture creatively motivated, technology\-based research, Pullinger and Clark’s practice\-as\-research grew out of their focused collaboration with Bath Spa University’s Centre for Cultural and Creative Industries \(CCCI\) and its Narrative & Emerging Technology Lab \(NET\). NET is a research group that engages with the shifts afforded by new forms of narrative delivery and audience interaction, from digital fiction and live performance through to virtual and augmented reality. The research of Pullinger and Clark explores new models of narrative production in response to both the challenges and opportunities enabled by emerging technologies. Pullinger and Clark both have long associations with innovating via technology: Pullinger produced her first computer\-mediated fiction in 2002 and Clark her first immersive theatre experience in 2012. Through their developing practices, both Pullinger and Clark have harnessed emerging digital technologies to produce new innovative hybrid forms, bringing new audiences and new ways for creators to interact with their audiences, while establishing them both as pioneers in their respective fields. 

 Clark’s contribution to the NET research gave rise to two original theatre productions – *The Stick House* \(2015, R1\) and *Ice Road* \(2017, R2\) – both of which were made through the immersive theatre company, Raucous, founded by Clark. Raucous is a network of over 25 artists, designers, composers and digital technologists. The two productions investigated how immersive theatre narratives could harness emerging digital media technologies to deliver a more immediate and emotive experience for a live audience. Both pieces fused live performance, projection mapping, original musical composition, smell, robotics and spatial sound. Crucial to both of these works was the design and development of ‘familiars’ – individually designed handheld object\-based media that respond to critical narrative and emotional beats within the storytelling. The ‘familiar’ is one of Clark’s unique contributions to original knowledge, providing a conceptual and literal tool that enables audiences to physically interact with live performance \(R3\). The productions were also conceived for two distinct buildings where theatre had never been staged – a series of railway tunnels under Bristol Temple Meads train station and disused Edwardian swimming baths – with the aim of producing theatre outside of perceived traditional theatre space in order to engage with a diverse community audience base. The success of these productions demonstrated a new willingness of audiences to directly engage with new technology in support of storytelling. 

 Meanwhile, Pullinger’s NET research explored how the short story format can be remodeled through digital media technology. *Breathe* \(2018, R4\) is a ghost story designed for and delivered through a smartphone that responds to the individual reader’s presence by identifying the world around them. Using application programming interfaces \(APIs\), the story leverages mobile data about the reader, including place, weather and time, in order to create an original reading experience, demonstrating to the reader the potential for data\-driven storytelling. *Breathe* was commissioned as part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council\-funded Ambient Literature project \(2016\-2018\), with partners from the University of the West of England, Bath Spa University and the University of Birmingham, with Pullinger as the sole writer\-practitioner among the team of co\-investigators. The wider Ambient Literature project focused on the study of emergent forms of literature that make use of new technologies in order to create evocative experiences for readers. *Breathe* is at the forefront of pushing forward research and innovation into literature and storytelling for the mobile phone \(R5\); its success demonstrated that readers are currently underserved by the potential for new technologies to transform reading beyond print and e\-book formats \(R6\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Clark and Pullinger’s work in narrative and emerging technology is motivated by the need to respond to an impetus for new artistic practices for the UK creative industries, and to reach out to new audiences alongside maintaining established ones. Their work expands understanding within the publishing and theatre sectors, in particular, about what shape a number of traditional media and creative forms – theatre productions, prose fiction, animation and film – might now take when augmented by emerging digital technologies. 

###  Shaping New Practices for the Publishing & Theatre Sectors 

 Pullinger’s *Breathe* was instrumental in the creation of a new genre for the publishing sector. It was shortlisted for the 2018 New Media Writing Prize and was used as a case study by the British Library’s Emerging Formats working group, as libraries around the UK and beyond continue to work on understanding how best to collect born\-digital, dynamic texts. As a digital literary text, *Breathe* is already widely studied and emulated as a key text as the publishing sector explores the potential for the personalisation of creative works. 

 The Ambient Literature project was conducted in active dialogue with advisors from the publishing industry. It aimed to focus industry attention on the idea of ambient literature with a view to supporting exchange between mainstream and emergent digital practices. The project website and the work with the advisory board constructed a broad conversation around writing and publishing practice. Impacts included running sold\-out workshops at Hay Literary Festival and partnering on sharing the research at the British Library. *Breathe* attracted substantial press interest, particularly in terms of its significance in boosting digital storytelling at a time when e\-book sales were falling \(E9\). Impact on the cultural sphere included a short feature in The Stylist magazine followed by entry in the Evening Standard’s ‘buzz words’ of summer 2018 list \(E9\), and an appearance in the Cambridge Online Dictionaries new words blog for March 2019 \(Cambridge Dictionary 2019\), as follows: 

 ambient literature *noun* \[U\]UK /ˌæm.bi.ənt.ˈlɪt.rə.tʃəʳ/ US /ˌæm.bi.ənt.ˈlɪt̬.ɚ.ə.tʃɚ/books that are read on an electronic device such as a tablet and which use information about the current date and time, the reader’s location, weather conditions etc. to personalise the experience for the reader 

 Clark’s work on immersive technologies and theatre audiences during her South West Creative Technology Network \(SWCTN\) Immersion Fellowship \(2017\-2018\) led to her being awarded a Digital Fellowship with the Royal Shakespeare Company and Magic Leap \(2019\-2020\), an internationally focused opportunity to work in partnership with one of the world’s most renowned theatre companies and a cutting\-edge U.S. augmented reality technology platform. This resulted in her writing and directing a new piece, *Where Once We*, that fused immersive theatre, live performance and wearable AR technology – one of the first productions of its kind. The Royal Shakespeare Company’s Digital Development Manager commented of Clark’s work: **“\[Clark\] blends the collective and individual theatrical experience resulting in a superb use and integration of technology which supports a narrative and allows the audience to hold the story”** \(E3\). In 2019, Clark began a consultancy with Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto on the creation of a new R&D space for explorations around theatre and digital technology, and was invited onto an advisory panel at Banff Centre for Creativity and the Arts on the formation of a new digital technology and arts hub for Alberta. 

 Clark’s work has been acknowledged by cultural institutions and national funding bodies as an important step change in how the theatre sector perceives its relationship with emerging technology. Director of Arts Council England, South West, stated, **“This willingness to challenge most of the norms around how performance is made, and how stories are shared, is proving transformative. I see increasing evidence of emerging companies across the south west whose practice appears to draw on the pioneering spirit of Raucous”** \(E4\). Bristol Old Vic’s Artistic Director has commented: “Raucous applies irresistible energy to genuinely ground\-breaking ideas. It's a thrill to be one of their advisors because you feel as if you're in an environment where an unexpected breakthrough might happen at any moment. Being near it is exciting and being able to support it hugely rewarding” \(E3\). 

###  Building New Toolkits for Writers 

 The relationship between technology, academia and literature was pivotal to the definition of ‘ambient literature’ as a new field for the creative sector. *Breathe* was created in collaboration with Editions at Play and is itself a collaboration between London\-based publisher Visual Editions and Google Creative Labs Sydney. Positioning the novelist as the instigator of an iterative creative design process where, working in tandem with technology, design and publishing partners, Pullinger redefined the narrative, content, form and platform, all working together to create a new way to tell a story: “ *Breathe* is different to many books in another way; it doesn’t have a straightforward linear narrative, meaning writing it required some out\-of\-the\-box thinking from Pullinger” \(Stylist magazine, 2017, E9\). Pullinger has long been an advocate of increasing digital knowledge for writers; for the past decade her online resource, The Writing Platform, has awarded bursaries that enable writers to work with technologists. Her collaboration with the Arts Council England\-funded writing hub Paper Nations led to Beyond the Book – a GBP20,000 initiative which awarded three bursaries in its inaugural year to writers for narrative and emerging technology projects. 

 Clark collaborated with 25 practitioners, such as designers, projection mappers, composers, roboticists, psychologists, actors and digital technologists, who each needed to investigate new modes of interdisciplinary communication and design blueprints for forging pathways to collaborate on storytelling. \[This         text        has     been        redacted\] had never worked in theatre before, while the opera set designer had not designed for interactions in a space between film and performance. New communication routes were forged so that collaborators could navigate each other’s technological cultures. 14 of the 25 collaborators had never seen a script before. \[This                                                                                                             text                                                                                     has                                                                                                                                                                 been                                                                                                                                            redacted                                                                       \] 

 Following the production of *The Stick House* and the forging of these new cross\-sector processes and collaborations, Google’s Innovation Hub asked Clark to design a series of exploration days for its team around creativity and tech. In these, 21 members of staff at Google worked on narrative and technology as part of their creative development: **“She \(Clark\) thinks differently about storytelling … about how people can be gifted a role to fulfil, how they can be a part of it. I have seen a lot of digital experiences but this just felt more… human. Made me think about how we engineer our relationships with our own ‘audiences’”** \(Workshop participant, E10\). In 2018 Clark became a mentor for the British film agency Creative England, where she works with Manchester\-based artists and technologists on how traditional creative industries can utilise innovative digital possibilities for their audiences. “\[Clark’s\] clear\-eyed approach to how live experience and technology can co\-create narrative made me re\-examine how I think about live performance and introduced me to the possibilities of building new and different creative relationships with people” \(E10\). 

###  Forging New Relationships with Audiences and Readers 

 Clark’s *The Stick House* reached a live audience of 3,245 in Bristol \(98% of capacity\) and an additional 22,345 engaged online. It comprised a collaborative network of 34 collaborators of writers, artists, technologists, scientists, filmmakers and designers. It garnered 4\- and 5\-star reviews in local and national press: “ *...* the mingling of performance with technology is brilliantly unobtrusive and effective” \( *The Guardian*, E2\). It was voted the best theatre production in Bristol for 2015 by 24/7 magazine \(E2\). *Ice Road*, meanwhile, had a live audience of 3,728 \(95% of capacity\) with over 21,000 online and brought together 33 collaborators. The press response was equally strong: “They envelop the audience in the world of the siege with inventive lighting and audio, and utilise the cavernous dimensions of the old baths to create – as the climax of the piece – a horrifying yet strangely beautiful representation of an aerial bombardment” \(24/7 Magazine, E2\). 

 By going beyond conventional ways of exhibiting theatre, Clark’s use of emerging digital technologies successfully opened up theatre to new audiences. Clark’s use of handheld object\-based media – familiars that respond to the emotional resonances of the narrative – reshaped how audiences experienced the story \(E5\). Audience research for *The Stick House* also showed that 32% had not been to the theatre in the previous five years, and 82% stated they had not seen a production like this before \(E1\). *The Stick House* production attracted audiences with little or no experience of immersive theatre using digital technology **: “Just breath\-taking. The show was by far the most exciting piece of theatre I have seen in Bristol for years”** \(E5\). “I wasn’t sure I would like it, technology sounds so intimidating, but it was like nothing else I had seen in theatre. It was breathtakingly original” \(E5\). 

 Meanwhile, readers’ relationship with literature was greatly expanded by Pullinger’s *Breathe,* with 28,606 readers and an average number of sessions per user of 1.59, meaning over half of the readers engaged with the work more than once. The reach of this work spanned 10 countries, with downloads being recorded in the United States, Canada, Poland and China \(E6\). 100% of the interviewees engaged during the evaluation said that they would be interested in experiencing more ambient literature, a strong acknowledgement that Breathe was opening up the potential for new ways of experiencing storytelling and literature \(E7, E8\). “... it makes a more personal connection with the story, in the sense that my location is acknowledged or referenced in the work, so therefore it’s some sort of a personal reinforcement as I’m reading, that, ‘Oh, there is some connection.’ The viewing of my environment was part of the experience so it was a different reading of a narrative than I’m accustomed to” \(E8\). “The concept of immersive reading has just been taken to a whole new level and I'm here for it. Never before have I actively enjoyed reading on my phone” \(E8\). Altogether, Clark and Pullinger’s widened audience reach, combined with a redefinition of practitioner’s practices, and wider collaborations with science and technology, has led to a more robust contingent of creative sectors prepared for the needs of today’s digital natives.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Compton’s research on electrochemical sensors led to development of the ChilliPot, GarlicPot and FoodSense, a series of handheld devices that measure analytes in food, drink and water \(including chilli heat, garlic strength and ginger intensity\), in collaboration with Zimmer & Peacock \(ZP\), a UK electrochemical sensor manufacturing company. Existing methods such as organoleptic \(taste\) testing and high\-performance liquid chromatography \(HPLC\) are time\-consuming and costly. Compton’s electrochemical sensors enable near instant results and the devices can be used by anyone needing to ensure food quality and safety. Since 2017 the devices have been sold to **\[text removed for publication\]** companies across the globe, ranging from agricultural businesses and government research organisations, through medium\-sized chilli sauce manufacturers to boutique chilli sauce producers. **\[Text removed for publication\]** The sensors have been instrumental to developing ‘The Science of Chilli Heat’, a schools outreach programme that has benefitted over 150 key stage 4 and 5 students through workshops and projects in collaboration with Compton’s research group. One participating school went on to be recognised in the UK Parliament for its work in encouraging girls to study STEM subjects.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the mid\-2000s Richard Compton and colleagues in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford began to undertake fundamental studies of adsorptive stripping voltammetry \(AdSV\) at multiwalled carbon nanotube modified basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes \(MWCNT\-BPPGE\) — electrodes coated in carbon nanotubes. The Compton group applied the technique to a variety of analytes; with paracetamol \[ **1**\] they obtained a detection limit of 10 nM, almost certainly the lowest limit of detection thus far reported for paracetamol using electrochemical techniques, showing that the technique was extremely sensitive. In a similar study on 4\-hexylresorcinol \(an anaesthetic and antiseptic used in pharmaceutical products\) \[ **2**\], Compton and colleagues experimented with MWCNT\-BPPGE modified screen\-printed electrodes, thereby demonstrating that the AdSV technique could easily be incorporated into a simple and inexpensive electrochemical sensor. 

 Compton and colleagues next turned their attention to food analytes, initially focusing on chilli. The ‘heat’ or piquancy of chillies is a result of the molecule capsaicin \(8\-methyl\-N\-vanillyl\-6\-nonenamide\) and related compounds called capsaicinoids. Compton’s group observed that capsaicin molecules spontaneously adsorbed onto a MWCNT\-BPPGE. Further, when the voltage at the electrode was adjusted appropriately, the molecules were oxidised and stripped from its surface. This finding led to the development of an AdSV technique which built on the fact that, if deposition and stripping conditions were kept constant, the process could be calibrated to link the voltammetric stripping current to solution concentration \[ **3**\]. The Compton group then developed an innovative electrochemical technique to reliably quantify the concentration of capsaicin in a sample. 

 Compton realised that there was a particular practical problem that might be solved through this application of AdSV. Chillies are used ubiquitously throughout the food industry, and in order to ensure consistency there is a need to assess chilli strength — or, more technically, capsaicin content — but existing assessment methods such as organoleptic \(taste\) testing and high\-performance liquid chromatography \(HPLC\) are time\-consuming and costly. The electrochemical technique in \[ **3**\] had the potential to provide a quick, cheap and reliable test. 

 The technique was refined by the group so that the multi\-wall carbon nanotube\-based electrode could be screen\-printed and used with a handheld sensor to assess capsaicin concentration outside the laboratory. To use the device, food extracts containing chilli are diluted in a ratio of 1:100 with 0.05M Britton\-Robinson buffer at pH 1.0 and then placed on the carbon nanotube electrode. Upon adsorption, capsaicin is electro\-chemically oxidised to an ortho\-benzoquinone molecule through two irreversible steps. This species then falls into a redox electrochemical loop with a catechol \(1,2\-dihydroxy benzene\) species. It is the equilibrium between these two species which is detected at the carbon nanotube electrode, giving rise to a novel capsaicin detection method. The result is converted into a measurement corresponding to the Scoville scale, which expresses the relative strength of chillies against that of pure capsaicin \(16 million Scoville units\). The technology was patented in 2008 by Isis Innovation Ltd, the University of Oxford's technology transfer division \(now Oxford University Innovation\) \[ **4**\]. The adsorptive stripping technique was then extended to the detection of ginger \(gingerol\), turmeric \(curcumin\) and vanillin \[ **5**\]. 

 The Compton group also developed an electrochemical technique using carbon\-based electrodes to measure the strength of garlic by identifying the presence of disulfides \[ **6**\]. This technology was patented in the UK by Isis Innovation in 2010. The garlic sensor uses a different electrochemical method to that used in the detection of chillies, turmeric and ginger. Bromide ions \(Br\-\) are oxidised to bromine \(Br<sub>2</sub>\) on the surface of a platinum electrode. Br<sub>2</sub> is then reduced by allicin \(a pungent species which gives garlic its characteristic smell, making up around 70% of the thiosulfates present in freshly chopped garlic\), forming a sulfonic acid and regenerating Br\- ions, thus completing the catalytic cycle. The Br\-/Br<sub>2</sub> redox system acts as a homogeneous redox mediator so that the recorded electrochemical signal is proportional to the organosulfur concentration present, enabling accurate detection of the garlic concentration.

###  Pathway to Impact 

 The research of the Compton group has given rise to electrochemical food sensors that can reliably and quickly test for a range of food analytes. Initially the focus was on developing a method of measuring the spiciness of chilli products without eating them. For over 100 years there was no quantitative procedure to measure the spiciness of chilli peppers, the standard method requiring the use of a panel of five ‘expert’ tasters. The Scoville organoleptic \(taste\) test \(dating back to 1912\) involved dissolving an exact weight of dried pepper in alcohol to extract capsaicin, the molecule responsible for the spice in chillies. Decreasing concentrations of extracted capsaicin were then given to the panel until a majority could no longer detect the heat. The test can give accurate results when performed by expert tasters, but is dependent on the capsaicin sensitivity of the tasters, and time\-consuming and costly to perform. More consistent scientific methods of measuring capsaicin content involve cumbersome and expensive high\-performance liquid chromatographs \(HPLC\), which also require trained staff and involve time for sample preparation and results analysis. 

 Professor Compton’s research delivered a test which was quick, reliable and cheap to manufacture. The electrochemical chilli sensor was patented in 2008 \[ **4**\]. In 2010 Beacon Foods \(South Wales\), an ingredient supplier, challenged Compton to develop a new method to objectively determine the strength of garlic, as opposed to the subjective organoleptic testing they were then currently using \[ **A**\]. The resulting garlic sensor, patented in 2010 \[ **B**\], was initially non\-exclusively licensed to Beacon Foods who used it as quality assurance on the garlic that they bought in for processing. Subsequently it, along with the chill sensor and others, was licensed to Zimmer & Peacock \(ZP\), an electrochemical sensor manufacturing company. 

###  Impact: Commerce and the economy 

###  The development of ChilliPot, GarlicPot and FoodSense 

 In 2017 an exclusive worldwide licence was agreed between Oxford University Innovation \(OUI\) and ZP to produce the ChilliPot device, the world's first commercial quick test for measuring the heat of chillies and chilli products. The ChilliPot is marketed at chilli growers, farmers, producers, manufacturers, and food technologists. The success of the ChilliPot led to ZP signing a new licensing deal with OUI for garlic, ginger and turmeric sensors in 2018 \[ **C**\], when ZP produced the GarlicPot, which had its first sale in South Africa later the same year. Around 15,700,000t of fresh garlic is produced worldwide each year and different batches vary significantly in the strengths of their flavour, so the development of such detection methods is important to ensure that garlic concentrations are standardised. In 2019 ZP licensed a 30\-minute assay for the rapid detection of E. coli. ZP then utilised Compton’s diverse research by creating FoodSense, a multi\-analytical device capable of measuring capsaicin in chilli, diallyl disulfide in garlic, gingerol in ginger, curcumin in turmeric, vanilla aldehyde in vanilla, pH and E. coli. \[ **D**\] 

 The ZP sensors have many advantages over existing sensing methods. All devices are handheld, accessible and easy to use, delivering results to an integrated smartphone app. The Compton Group’s use of carbon nanotubes and disposable screen\-printed electrodes are key to the accuracy, speed and low cost of the sensors. Readings are given within a minute, vastly quicker than the conventional method of using a panel of taste testers, and also quicker and cheaper than HPLC, which takes 3 days and costs in the region of GBP100 per test \[ **D**\]. E. coli results are available within 30 minutes. This speed is especially important for detecting the presence of E.coli in food, as current methods of pathogen and microbial testing can take 3 days or more, in which time contaminated products risk being shipped to supermarkets and consumers. \[ **D**\] 

 **\[Text removed for publication.\]** The company has additionally adopted the ChilliPot into its analytical service, offering testing at a cost of EUR85 per sample \[ **F**\]. 

 ZP reports very positive end user feedback: 

-  ‘The ChilliPot means not having to pay 170 Euros per HPLC test.’ 

-  ‘There is no other practical way of assessing the crop whilst in the field.’ 

-  ‘The business can’t afford HPLC but we can afford a FoodSense.’ \[ **E**\] 

 A Portuguese food company has used ZP’s logo on the bottle of chilli sauce next to the Scoville score as a testament to the reliability of the heat rating. \[ **G**\]

ZP’s licensing of Compton’s research has enabled the company to expand its operations into food sensing; it had previously specialised in biosensing and medical diagnostics.  ZP’s Director states: ‘Our long\-standing relationship with Professor Richard Compton at Oxford University has enabled us to benefit from his unique expertise in electrochemical sensing. This has given us a positive direction in the food quality and food safety testing market.’ \[ **E**\] 

 Professor Compton’s innovative advances on the development of sensors for food technology contributed to him receiving the 2018 Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science by the Royal Society of Chemistry, awarded for ‘innovative advances in the analytical detection of nano\-entities, seminal contributions to the calibration free measurement of pH and the development of sensors for food technology and medicine’. \[ **H**\] 

###  Impact: Understanding, learning and participation among school students 

 Chilli sensors present an engaging way to encourage school students to participate in practical science activities, to work in collaboration with students from other schools, and with researchers at Oxford. Since September 2013 Professor Compton and his research group have attended schools and organised outreach events on ‘chilli science’. The work produced by students at these workshops has included relating the colour of chillies to their heat, the relationship between the chilli anatomy \(such as the pith, seeds and flesh\) and the local heat content, and the effect of aging on chillies. 

 2 chilli conferences for schools were held in 2015 and 2016. Compton’s research group planned a 6\-month ‘Science of Chilli Heat’ research project for 24 key stage 5 students in collaboration with teachers at Highgate School in North London, acting as a hub for 7 local state schools. They created a programme with demonstrable links to the school curriculum, which also showcased the real\-world work of scientists. The programme enabled students to design their own experiments using potentiostats provided by the Compton Group. In parallel, a similar programme was developed for 50 key stage 4 students at state schools in West Yorkshire. The students participated in weekly sessions at their local school or hub, supported by Compton’s group, culminating in a conference held at Oxford’s Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory where students presented their findings to fellow participants and Oxford researchers. 

 Over 2 years more than 150 students from 12 different schools benefitted from the ‘chilli experience’. Feedback from Shelley College in West Yorkshire noted that the collaborative nature of the research project, in working alongside participants from other schools as well as researchers at Oxford Chemistry, ‘enabled students to develop the skills of collaboration, communication, resilience and often leadership. In addition to this, one student commented that once the presentation was over he felt like he could do anything\! I believe this shows that the social development \(above probably all else\) has really been developed very well by participation in the project.’ Students also reported being more interested in continuing to study chemistry at A\-level: ‘It has given \[students\] an appreciation that science has applications outside of the classroom and many of the students in the team have expressed interests in taking science at A\-level following the project.’ \[ **I**\] 

 Feedback from 10 pupils at Woodkirk Academy, West Yorkshire, who participated in the chilli conference project in 2015 showed that ‘7 students are more likely to choose science and maths A\-levels following the project and 6 are more likely to want a career in science.’ \[ **I**\] Woodkirk Academy went on to be recognised in a parliamentary debate on A\-level STEM subjects for ‘excellent work’ in encouraging girls to study STEM subjects and promote STEM careers \[ **J**\]. The Minister for Women and Equalities noted she ‘was impressed to see at first\-hand how the academies engage pupils in STEM subjects, demonstrating the application of science and maths and promoting STEM careers’. In their response to parliamentary recognition, Woodkirk cited the Oxford collaboration as a contributory factor of their success: ‘Woodkirk is also involved in exciting research together with Oxford University. Over 40 students are currently working on a research project investigating what factors affect the spiciness of chillies with the Compton Electrochemistry Group at Oxford University. Academics from Oxford University travelled to West Yorkshire to conduct troubleshooting on these projects and inform students about cutting\-edge research into nanochemistry and electrochemistry… South Devon Chilli Farm have also asked Woodkirk students to investigate the spiciness of their newest chilli varieties.’ \[ **K**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Dr Shaowei He’s** research on the rise of Chinese businesses and their relationship with overseas partners has shaped the engagement practices and policies of United Kingdom \(UK\) local authorities and businesses. It has enabled them to navigate the complex cross\-border partnership working process, which has resulted in stronger collaborations with their Chinese partners. In particular, his research has prompted reflections and changes among China engagement practitioners on how to forge long\-term successful relationships with China. This has involved working with UK members of parliament, local authorities and businesses and resulted in stronger business collaboration between the UK and Chinese regions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The China and Emerging Economics Centre \(CEEC\) at the University of Northampton is an interdisciplinary research group that focusses on the global impact of emerging economics and their relationship to the UK. **He’s** research is central to this focussing on the rise of Chinese firms and their impact on global business in the UK, as well as the underlying political, institutional and social factors that govern their relationships with international partners. 

 In an interdisciplinary study supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, **He** and colleagues examined the speed and scale of the rise of innovative Chinese firms and resultant impact on global value chains and global economic organisation **\[3.1\]**. This study shed light on the importance of Chinese companies’ leadership in global business, the nature of governance in Chinese businesses led global value chains and opportunities associated with their overseas investment. **He** and co\-authors have challenged the misconceptions that Chinese firms do not innovate and that their competitive advantages are mainly explained by cheap labour and a favourable monopoly position in their home market **\[3.2\]**. This study argued for the importance of recognising innovative capabilities in explaining the rapid rise and internationalisation of Chinese businesses. The research indicates that the UK government businesses who receive investment from China, need to look beyond immediate financial investment gains and focus on mutual benefits in innovation. 

 **He**’s Leverhulme/British Academy funded project, *Emerging economy multinational enterprises’ acquisitions in developed countries and capability upgrading in their acquired firms: a multiple case study in the UK*, explored mutual learning and power relationships between Chinese parent firms and their acquired British subsidiaries **\[3.3\]**. The research found that Chinese investing firms could offer new knowledge and learning opportunities leading to further innovation in the British subsidiaries that they had invested in. The research also highlighted that, in order to maximise transnational knowledge exchange, it is important to take account of the speciﬁcity of power relationships and characteristics alongside the power sources of partners. The research concluded that UK governments and businesses need to better understand power relationships between partners in order to maximise the benefits of transnational exchanges with China. 

 **He**’s research indicates that to effectively do business and engage with China, it is important to carefully consider: 

1.  the changing Chinese business landscape and its global impact as well as the underlying political and economic driving forces in order to achieve a better understanding of the context of engaging with China **\[3.1 and 3.2\]**; 

1.  Chinese firms’ innovative capabilities in order to achieve a better understanding of opportunities and benefits of engaging with China **\[3.2 and 3.3\]**; 

1.  power relationships in cross\-border partnerships in order to maximise the benefits of engaging with China **\[3.3 and 3.4\]**.

 **He**’s research on the opportunities and complexity of China engagement was presented to the general public via publication in media and professional magazines and to a range of local community and businesses leaders in the UK, including council leaders, senior managers of universities, CEOs of advanced manufacturing firms and trade associations, via a series of workshops and webinars. For example, **He** and the CEEC organised the 1st and 2nd Northampton – China Forum in 2016 and 2020 respectively.  The Deputy Leader of Northamptonshire County Council \(NCC\) stated that the events offered an ‘opportunity to discuss in a commercial perspective, Chinese relations’; the ‘genuinely interesting’ event enriched participant’s understanding of ‘the relationship structures respected by the Chinese’, which enabled a ‘greater focus on successful long\-term partnerships’ **\[5.1\]**. The Director of the Arc Universities Group \(AUG\) noted that **He**’s ‘strong, methodical stance and . . .  cultural sensitivity to both sides’ had ‘incredible power’ in facilitating a stronger UK\-China relationship **\[5.2\]**.  This was corroborated by the leader of the Northampton Borough Council \(NBC\) who stated that **He**’s work has resulted in an increase in understanding of ‘how the good foundation of building any sort of partnership is to establish some sort of local government relationship first’ **\[5.3\]**. In November 2020, based on **He**’s research and extensive knowledge of Chinese firms and his in\-depth case study of Chinese acquisitions in the UK, the House of Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee invited him to provide evidence to the Parliament inquiry into foreign investment into UK companies, contributing to the debate on scrutiny of foreign investment and Britain’s relationship with China **\[5.4\]**. 

 **He’s** research has significantly improved UK practitioners’ understanding of the complexity of engagement and their capacity to navigate through cross\-border partnership working.  This has prompted a number of actions.  For example, two local authorities have developed links with specific regions of China where they have common business interests.   After attending the 1st Northampton – China Forum, the CEO of South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership \(SEMLEP\), acknowledged **He**’s 'instrumental' role as 'unofficial ambassador' to the Hunan Province of China. **He** facilitated bringing a delegation from the region to meet with members of SEMLEP who subsequently developed and proposed a China strategy to the board **\[5.5\]**. Additionally, as a result of **He**’s work, both Lincolnshire County Council \(LCC\) and NBC have signed agreements with their Chinese partner regions, paving the way for closer regional collaboration as detailed below **\[5.3; 5.6\].** 

 **Enhanced business collaboration between UK and Chinese regions** 

 **He**’s research on China’s business landscape and Chinese firm’s innovation capabilities has informed a regional and sectoral focused approach in UK local authorities’ collaboration with Chinese partners. With his knowledge of the political, cultural and power factors in cross\-border partnership working, **He** has further guided relationship building between UK local authorities and their Chinese partners, which has led to stronger cross\-border business collaboration. 

 **Establishing new Relationships between Lincolnshire and Hunan** 

 Working with Lincolnshire County Council \(LCC\), **He** identified Hunan Province of China \(with nearly 70,000,000 population\) as an area of strategic focus. In 2015, he brought a senior Hunan government delegation to visit Lincolnshire. This resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding between the two regions to facilitate cross\-border civic, cultural, business and educational exchanges. This subsequently led to the signing of a formal Sister Region Agreement in 2018 **\[5.7\]**. Given the decisive role of the state in China’s economic and social development, this formal agreement presents one of the most significant steps in regional collaboration between Lincolnshire and Hunan. According to the leader of LCC, this formal relationship with Hunan “gives Lincolnshire much greater access to one of the largest and most important export markets in the world with huge potential for economic growth” **\[5.6\]**. 

 LCC recognised the importance of **He**’s research\-based advice and his essential role in ‘forging an economic sister relationship with Hunan province’ **\[5.6\]**. **He** was critical in initiating and strengthening the Hunan\-Lincolnshire relationship, which, according to LCC’s Assistant Director for Growth, has ‘helped to drive forward’: 

-  business to business contact between the two regions, including several new contracts being signed by businesses from both sides 

-  development of academic linkages, including student and lecturer exchanges between universities in both areas 

-  and attraction of government funding to explore food technology relationships, in terms of joint research and business relocation **\[5.6\]**. 

 The Deputy Director General of the Foreign Affairs Office of Hunan Province stated that insights from **He**’s research led to the ‘quick identification of strategic focus on three sectors where the two regions have world class characteristics: Agri\-tech, Advanced Manufacturing and Education’ **\[5.7\]**. This has increased the number of business, civic and cultural exchanges between Lincolnshire and Hunan, contributing to, for example: 

-  a 112% increase in Hunan’s trade with the UK in 2019, amounting to USD1,400,000,000 **\[5.7\]**; and 

-  the opening of direct flights between Changsha \(capital of Hunan\) and London in 2018, which witnessed passenger number exceeding 43,000 in 2019 **\[5.7\]**. 

 Building on this momentum, the Midlands Engine, which covers a population of 11,500,000 and 10 Local Enterprise Partnerships including Greater Lincolnshire, signed a strategic partnership agreement with Hunan in 2019. This effectively enabled the Midlands Engine region to access one of the fastest growing regions of China. According to the Deputy Director General of the Foreign Affairs Office of Hunan Province, this has also created a ‘springboard for \[Hunan’s\] wider collaboration with the UK’ **\[5.7\]**; the Chairman of Midlands Engine has concurred, stating that, the agreement with Hunan has established a strong foundation to “bring about further similar successes across the entire Midlands region” **\[5.8\]**. 

 **Creating the foundation for relationships between China and Northampton** 

 Given the sheer scale and complexity of the Chinese business landscape, both Northamptonshire County Council \(NCC\) and Northampton Borough Council \(NBC\) have adopted **He**’s recommendation to target Chinese selected cities and regions that have complementary capabilities in developing common strategic industries and innovation collaboration **\[5.3\]**. This led both NCC and NBC to focus on Hunan, Hubei \(nearly 60,000,000 population\) and Liaoning \(45,000,000 population\). 

 As part of the region’s wider China engagement, in 2018 CEEC signed an MOU with Silverstone Circuits Ltd. to develop further partnerships. The then Head of Partnership of the company commented that the ‘university has helped not only Silverstone Circuit but also the wider Northants community to both identify opportunities and ensure that ongoing dialogue is conducted effectively and in a culturally respectable manner” between local businesses and their Chinese counterparts. **\[5.9\]**. 

 In October 2018, the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, invited **He** to organise and lead a delegation of leaders from Northamptonshire’s civic, university and business communities to the 4<sup>th</sup> UK\-China Regional Leader’s Summit in China. This enabled Northamptonshire community leaders to closely engage with their counterparts in Dalian and Liaoning, the host city and province of the Summit. Indeed, with **He**’s facilitation, NBC and Dalian Municipal Government signed an MOU at the Summit to develop a formal sister\-city relationship **\[5.9\]**. The leader of NBC noted that **He**’s work has led to ‘a form of partnership with a couple of different places and some further opportunities to explore’ **\[5.3\]**. This was supported by the ‘level of knowledge, the understanding of who to be talking to and then making all of that happen, which has been delivered by \[ **He**\] through CEEC’, which led, ‘without a doubt’, to the council’s subsequent work with China. This has established ‘a very solid foundation’ for the council to further develop these relationships **\[5.3\]**. Indeed, with **He’s** direct facilitation and advice, in the last few years Northamptonshire hosted business tours for the former and current Minister Counsellors of the Chinese Embassy and delegations from Hunan, Liaoning, Dalian and Nanjing, laying good foundations for further collaboration with China. These visits were particularly essential in helping businesses in the local community to understand the Chinese business landscape, opportunities for working with China and the relational aspects in cross\-border partnership working. The CEO of Silverstone Technology Cluster \(STC\) confirmed that **He**’s ‘tireless efforts to create or participate with various China\-focused events have had a really positive impact’, generating direct engagement opportunities with Chinese business delegations and bringing to the fore a lot of ‘knowledge of the marketplace and the potential opportunities that exist’ **\[5.10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words. 100 words\) 

 Gears and bearings employed in high\-pressure environments, such as naval and aviation vehicles, necessitate precise design and monitoring. Cardiff’s tribology expertise facilitated the development of accurate models of such components, enabling improved design of complex gear mechanisms by industry partners, leading to: 

-  improved naval gearbox design tools for David Brown Santasalo, supporting a £100M design and build contract for Type 26 Frigate propulsion systems; 

-  SKF Aerospace’s accelerated development of a new range of helicopter composite liner bearings, enhancing international commercialisation; 

-  design tools improving Rolls\-Royce high\-pressure fuel pumps and reducing development costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Gear contacts operating in high\-pressure environments and at extreme failure conditions \(e.g., highly loaded power transmission gears\), generally have surface roughness asperities that are larger than the lubricant film thickness. In mixed\-lubrication contacts, where load is supported partly by lubricant pressure \(via elastohydrodynamic lubrication: EHL\) and partly by direct contact of roughness asperities, asperity collision and lubricant film rupture can occur. 

 Cardiff University’s 40\-year research heritage in tribology culminated in a coupled solver **\[3.1\]** that can analyse mixed\-lubrication contacts to reduce gear failure. The solver gives transient surface load history at asperity scale, leading to tooth surface fatigue analysis for real gear micropitting tests. The solver and design functionality was applied in multiple scenarios including military thrust cone design, modelling liner bearings, and Rolls\-Royce fuel pumps. 

 **2.1 Thrust Cone design tools for David Brown Santasalo** 

 Cardiff’s Thrust Cone Design Aids \(TCDA\) software for helical gear thrust cones used in high power transmissions has been mandated by the Ministry of Defence for all prospective military designs since 2003. The software was further developed through the 15\-year R&D relationship between industrial gears specialist David Brown Santasalo \(DBS\) and Cardiff University, with a focus on thrust cone contact and tribology in high\-performance naval ships and machinery. 

 
 **Figure 1:** \(a\) Thrust cone bearings \(arrowed\) used in a low ratio single helical gear pair transmitting 6MW and \(b\) close\-up of tooth meshing area showing the overlapping cones. 

 \(a\) 

 \(b\) 

The thrust cones \(Figure 1\) enable use of single helical gears rather than larger and more complex double helical arrangements. The overlapping cones react axial tooth loads \(developed due to the helix angle\) in an EHL\-bearing contact. The TCDA tool was reconfigured and enhanced for DBS during the REF period, providing improved model film/contact thermal behaviour prediction **\[3.2, 3.3\]** allowing the tool to simultaneously model film thickness and substrate behaviour. 

 **2.2 Modelling liner bearings with SKF Aerospace** 

 Cardiff’s expertise was also applied to development of new simulation tools and new liner materials for SKF Aerospace. Cardiff began testing and modelling friction and wear in composite liner bearings for SKF UK in 2009. The research developed a wear model for composite liner bearings, which are used in a wide range of control and actuation applications within both fixed and rotary wing aircraft. This new research direction updated the former approach for worm gears **\[3.4\]** and developed into an ongoing collaboration with SKF for testing, wear modelling, and condition monitoring of lubricant\-free bearings **\[3.5\]**. The research was supported by a Knowledge Transfer Partnership award \(TSB rated outstanding\) **\[G3.1\]** and seven subsequent SKF grants totalling £850,000 \(e.g. **\[G3.2\]**\). Cardiff’s research also led SKF to obtain development funding of £300,000 through the ADS National Aerospace Technology Programme. 

 **2.3 Evaluation of fuel pumps within Rolls\-Royce engines** 

 In research sponsored by Goodrich Control Systems \(now Rolls\-Royce\) in 2006, Cardiff’s work on mixed lubrication was extended to plain bearing applications in aerospace fuel pumps. The initial application of the EHL model to the sealing surfaces of the pump was subsequently developed into a general approach for mixed lubrication in plain bearings based on calculating flow factors to quantify the average effect of the measured surface roughness on lubricant flow. This required a loaded contact analysis of the bearing surfaces, taking the 3D surface roughness into account, and was achieved using the methods of the coupled solver **\[3.1\]** in an elasto\-plastic analysis **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of Impact** 

 Gear mechanisms in high\-powered machinery are subject to significant forces and require precise design and monitoring to ensure performance. Cardiff’s research in tribology and elastohydrodynamic lubrication \(EHL\) led to tools and methods improving the design of gear mechanisms, which in turn: 

-  aided the design of naval thrust cone contacts and influenced global naval investments; 

-  reduced friction and wear in helicopter composite liner bearings and enabled faster product development cycles; and 

-  improved the design of Rolls\-Royce aircraft fuel pumps and allowed more efficient modelling of prospective gear designs. 

 **4.1 Aided the design of naval thrust cone contacts** 

 David Brown Santasalo \(DBS\) are a global producer of gear mechanisms, and develop thrust cones for specialised applications, providing significant benefits to gearbox power density, noise reduction and energy efficiency in high power \(multi MW\) capital plant applications **\[5.1\]**. Having discussed a programme with Cardiff on thrust cone design solution performance modelling in 2014, DBS contracted the University to improve the Cardiff Thrust Cone Design Aid \(TCDA\) tool, mandated by the Ministry of Defence \(MoD\) for military applications since 2003 **\[5.2\]**. Completed in 2016, with extended modelling in 2018, the revised TCDA tool now simultaneously models film thickness and substrate behaviour, which enabled DBS to design and develop more efficient thrust cone propulsion systems. 

 Scott Tran, Engineering Director for DBS stated: “ *The advances in analytical design and validation technologies enabled by the research and computational methods developed by Cardiff have strongly supported the creation of class leading engineered solutions for large scale power transmission equipment*” **\[5.1\]**. DBS noted how the advanced TCDA tool enabled them to engineer solutions with **“**increased accuracy and confidence""*, highlighting that the ability to predict oil film thickness in the micron scale was vital to define the required manufacturing requirements and assure a long and reliable transmission life in service **\[5.1\]**. 

 DBS confirmed that Cardiff’s TCDA was used within the transmission design process for the most recent Naval vessels under build for the MoD **\[5.1\]**, including the DBS contract to design and supply the main propulsion gear units of the new Type 26 \(T26\) Frigate, developed by BAE Systems **\[5.3\]**. The T26 design attracted considerable domestic and international demand: 

-  in 2017, the Royal Navy confirmed purchase of eight T26 Frigates, starting with an investment of £3.7BN for three ships **\[5.4\]**; 

-  in 2018 the Australian Navy confirmed an £18.1BN investment in nine T26 Frigates **\[5.5\]**; 

-  in 2019 the Canadian Navy ordered 15 ships based on the T26 design at total cost of around £32.5BN **\[5.6\]**. 

 Steve Watson, Managing Director of DBS noted that the contract to supply the gearboxes for the Type 26 ships is the largest single order in the firm’s 150\-year history **\[5.3\]**. The contract resulted in DBS making significant investments in infrastructure which *“transformed a semi\-derelict area of our Huddersfield site into new state of the art manufacturing, assembly, and test facilities*” **\[5.3\]**. DBS confirmed the T26 contract created commercial opportunities that “collectively measure in the scale of £100m\+*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Reduced friction and wear in helicopter composite liner bearings** 

 SKF Aerospace are an international supplier of commercial aeroengine components. Cardiff’s expertise modelling, simulating and testing composite liner systems improved SKF’s capability to develop new self\-lubricating composite liner bearings within critical flight controls for helicopters, highlighted by SKF as a significant commercial market **\[5.7\]**. Through collaborative research with Cardiff, Grant Dennis, Business and Product Development, SKF Aerospace stated that “ *SKF have been able to accelerate the development of a new product line of improved performance self\-lubricating plain bearings* **”** that can typically take years between development and installation **\[5.7\]**. At the time of writing, SKF noted that the bearings are currently at TRL 8 and would fly on aircraft within 2020, with expectations of global commercialisation within 2021 **\[5.7\]**. 

 Cardiff research also enabled SKF to bring to market new condition monitoring solutions by developing algorithms to support early detection of the end\-of\-life for products.  SKF confirmed the research “ *has brought the technology to TRL 4, where SKF can embark on technology and product development activities to bring the solution to market*” **\[5.7\]**. SKF noted that condition monitoring is a growing market, and “ *building on the strong foundation*” of work with Cardiff has given them a “ *competitive advantage*” to penetrate the US market, forecasting increased revenue by “ *tens of millions of pounds annually*” as a result **\[5.7\]**. 

 SKF stated that the collaborative research undertaken with the Cardiff *“had a significant impact on the development activities carried out by SKF, consolidating the company’s strong position in the European market and developing competitive new products for the US market*” **\[5.7\]**. The materials have numerous other applications in aerospace and other high performance, high value markets such as motorsport. 

 **4.3 Improved design of Rolls\-Royce aircraft fuel pumps** 

 In 2005, Cardiff University partnered with Goodrich Control Systems \(now part of Rolls\-Royce\) to explore methods of modelling mixed lubrication within the fuel control systems in their aero engines. Of essential importance is the high\-pressure fuel pump, a component that includes several tribological interfaces lubricated by the fuel itself. Martin Yates, Engineering Associate Fellow at Rolls\-Royce stated: “ *This is a particularly challenging interface to engineer \[…\] should these interfaces fail, this can lead to an inflight shutdown of the engine*” **\[5.8\]**. 

 Cardiff developed several methods \(e.g. **\[3.6\]**\) to model the complexity of mixed\-film lubrication within critical components including the thrust and journal bearings of the pump and in the shaft seal. The shaft seal prevents fuel leaks, and Cardiff’s methods have been deployed by Rolls\-Royce to better understand the performance of this shaft seal, which helped the company to *“improve the performance of an existing in\-service design*” **\[5.8\]**. 

 Rolls\-Royce highlighted how Cardiff developed “ *an essential tool*” **\[5.8\]** for investigating materials within fuel pumps, specifically the suitability of new materials to facilitate the company’s move away from undesirable legacy materials \(e.g. lead and copper\) while meeting challenging requirements. Rolls\-Royce stated: “ *Without the use of this type of sophisticated modelling a purely experimental approach would be required which would be far more expensive and time consuming than approach lead \[sic\] by analysis and validated by testing.”* **\[5.8\]**

###  The first strand \[1,4\] sought to understand how ecopreneurial education could be harnessed to develop enterprise and innovation within the land\-based sector. This pedagogic research identified the methods and tools that could be employed within the curriculum of a land\-based university to train the ecopreneur of the future. 

###  Entrepreneurship and particularly ecopreneurship are essential to drive the sustainable transitions needed in agriculture, the rural economy and wider food supply chains, to meet the challenges of climate change, ecological degradation and the human health crisis. One impact of this research has been an exceptional track\-record of 578 RAU student enterprise participants and 91 start\-ups. 

###  The second strand researched barriers to the diffusion of innovation and technology adoption \[2,3\] – essential to deliver effective change in developed and emergent economies. The RAU has been undertaking research in this area since 2012 through the *Knowledge Exchange and Diffusion of Innovation* model \(KEDI\) which demonstrates how an innovation ecosystem can promote self\-development and ideation, and group and network dynamics, in order to develop ideas and enable scale\-up and commercialisation. It was this research that led directly to the establishment of these new centres at the RAU, where research academics, as well as students at every level, can work with innovators, in a seamless campus or ‘living\-land\-lab’. While found in other industries, this approach is rare in the context of agriculture and the rural economy. Central to this ecopreneurial innovation and the drive for sustainable development is the combination of real\-life environments, relevant activities, and multi\-actor engagement. To overcome barriers to uptake of innovation, research academics carried out work on farmer\-led innovation through multi actor\-innovation networks \[7\]. 

###  The third strand researched artisan and farmer entrepreneurial and welfare collaborations and how these could be applied to the land\-based sector \[5, 6\]. We were part of a global project that examined, using the ideas behind social and natural capital, how collaborative social groups \(a key element of the KEDI model\) could significantly influence sustainability and deliver individual and public benefits, improve well\-being and natural capital, and provide platforms for wider progress towards sustainability. 

###  *Our ongoing research examines evolving models of entrepreneurial universities as anchor institutions that can generate within the agricultural sector new forms of knowledge, problem\-solving skills and types of learner opportunities. This provides a catalyst for driving widening participation and diversity in the agricultural industry though supporting students, fledgling entrepreneurs or industry specialists who can nurture talent. As a body of knowledge our research has created new and innovative networks for driving entrepreneurship and innovation in the agricultural sector.*

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Incubator business development and diffusion of innovation** 

 Through our research in *Knowledge Exchange and Diffusion of Innovation* \(KEDI\) the university was able to secure significant funding through  [GFirstLEP](https://www.gfirstlep.com/) \[1\] the EU ERDF and the John Oldacre Trust for a series of initiatives to support the development of innovation in the land\-based sector. In 2015, the Rural Innovation Centre was established at Harnhill Farm, including five studio\-workshops for incubator start\-ups. Examples of now successful companies that started in these workshops include: 

-  [*Multibox*](http://multibox.farm/) *– used the space to create a prototype insect farm in order to develop best practice and how the technology could be scaled to deliver a stepchange in the novel protein sector.* 

-  [*CopperNose*](https://coppernose.com/) *– company started by an RAU alumnus to produce beef jerky.* 

-  *MagGrow –this*  [*award\-winning*](https://www.maggrow.com/awards) *company developed magnets to reduce spray drift in pesticide and fertiliser application* \[2\]. 

-  [*Soil Fixer*](https://www.soilfixer.co.uk/) *– promotes the use of bio\-char in agriculture.* 

 This was followed by the construction of the £4.2m Alliston Centre on the University Campus, which houses the  [Cirencester Growth Hub](https://www.thegrowthhub.biz/cirencester) and  [Farm 491](https://farm491.com/), funded by the RAU and GFirstLEP. The Growth Hub focusses around local rural businesses, and since opening in July 2018, it has directly supported more than 250 local businesses and is providing professional workspace to 36 SMEs. 

  

 
*Farm491 innovation ecosystem, based around <ins>the</ins> <ins>K</ins><ins>nowledge</ins> <ins>E</ins><ins>xchange and</ins> <ins>D</ins><ins>iffusion of</ins> <ins>I</ins><ins>nnovation model \(KEDI\)</ins> \(Source Farm491 Interim Project Evaluation Report\)* 

 Farm491 also occupies the Alliston Centre and is the leading UK\-based Agri\-tech incubator \[3\].  Opened in July 2017, it is highly successful in facilitating inter\-business exchange relationships through a unique set of 1\-2\-1 support, peer networking and expert workshops, enabling businesses to gain from the facilitated ideas exchange. Today, Farm491 supports 70 active members with a total of 192 companies having received support throughout the project from the start in 2016 to date.  Farm491 has helped establish four grant funded research collaborations in the last three years, created new employment opportunities and enabled members to bring their ideas to the market and raise a total of £32.8 million in funding. 

 Embedded within this purpose is the  [mission of Farm491](https://farm491.com/about-farm491/) in the delivery of the European Regional Development Fund \(ERDF\) co\-funded “Inspiring Agri\-tech Innovation” \(IAI\) programme \[4\]. Farm491 and RAU academics worked with GFirstLEP on the  [Gloucestershire Agri\-food and Rural Economy](https://www.gfirstlep.com/about-us/our-vision/agri-food-and-rural-economy-report-for-gloucestershire/) Report, which resulted in advanced agri\-technology being embedded into the draft  [Gloucestershire Local Industrial Strategy](https://www.gfirstlep.com/downloads/2019/gloucestershire_draft_local-industrial-strategy_2019.pdf) \(2019, 46\-50\). 

 Farm491 has been active in hosting official delegations and outreach events that embrace agri\-tech innovations. These have included: 

-  Liuzhou City Government Delegation \(Guangxi Province, September 2019\) to view agri\-tech innovation 

-  New Zealand agri\-tech mission \(September 2019\) 

-  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\-sponsored inward investment delegation visit from Kuwait in February 2020 with a specific focus on food security, with a follow\-up on conference on food security \[5\] 

-  Hosting webinars with the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on  [Climate Smart Agriculture](https://www.rau.ac.uk/about/news-and-events/news/rau-cohosts-climate-smart-agriculture-webinar-embassy-kingdom-netherlands) and  [Animal Welfare](https://www.rau.ac.uk/about/news-and-events/news/rau-hosts-farm-animal-welfare-webinar-embassy-kingdom-netherlands). 

###  Building on research on farmer led\-innovation we established the Farmer\-Led Innovation Network \(FLIN\) to understand, learn from and ‘power up’ farmer\-led research and innovation initiatives. 

 **Innovation in the rural economy.** 

 As a result of our research into entrepreneurial collaborations and collaborative social groups, we are a founder member of the  [National Innovation Centre for Rural Enterprise](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/cre/nationalinnovationcentreforruralenterprise/), established in 2020. NICRE champions innovation and enterprise in rural areas, fostering resilient and sustainable communities and removing barriers to rural productivity. As part of a consortium of four universities, together we have been able to achieve greater leverage, and to place land\-based education and enterprise at the core of the initiative. Through our research on innovation we have been able to directly influence government policy, contributing via Farm491 to the development of UKRI’s pioneering  [Series A investor partnership for SMEs](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/smes-transforming-food-production-series-a-investor-partnership/), and informing DEFRA’s  [Farming Innovation Pathways](https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/852/overview) competition \[6\]. 

 **Student enterprise** 

 Our research into enterprise, entrepreneurship and diffusion of innovation has driven institutional impact in the land\-based sector. Our student\-focused  [Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Programme](https://www.rau.ac.uk/study/enterprise-entrepreneurship), resulted in the RAU being named an Institute of Enterprise and Entrepreneurs “Centre of Excellence” in 2019, and in 2020  being shortlisted as “outstanding entrepreneurial university of the year”\[7\].  The RAU currently has two student focused social enterprise projects:  [Cotswold Hills Wine](http://www.cotswoldhills.org.uk/) and  [Muddy Wellies Ale](https://waitrose.pressarea.com/pressrelease/details/78/NEWS_13/11097) \[8\]. These provide students with the opportunity to develop their enterprise and entrepreneurial skills, whilst proceeds go into a First Steps fund to support students to start their own businesses \[9\].  Of the 148 applications since 2013, the Enterprise Programme has funded 97 to develop their concept further and 69 innovators have launched their businesses after leaving the university. The RAU’s student business planning competition “The Grand Idea” has had 13 entrepreneurial winners to date \(8 women and 5 men\), 10 of whom are heading up businesses today. 

 *This impact case study collectively shows how the University has developed its research outputs to focus on the development of innovation ecosystems that drive commercialisation of innovation to support transition to sustainable agriculture using agri\-technology at both the local and global scale. These initiatives have a global reach in promoting agri\-tech solutions and sustainable food production.*

###  5. Sources to corroborate the impact \(indicative maximum of 10 references\) 

 \[1\] The research undertaken at the RAU directly influenced the  [Gfirst LEP Strategic Economic Plan](https://www.gfirstlep.com/downloads/library/4-sep.pdf) for Gloucestershire March 2014, establishing ‘Growth Hubs’ around University campuses in the county \(p. 46\-51\). In the SEP 2.0 \(2018\), seven key investments were listed with £101,696m of inward government investment, two of which were linked to the RAU – the establishment of new  [Growth Hubs](https://www.gfirstlep.com/projects/the-growth-hub/),and the creation of Farm491 on the Cirencester Campus and at Harnhill through a £2.92m  [funding package](https://www.gfirstlep.com/projects/farm-491/). Subsequent investment of £1m in 2018 at Hartpury University’s “Tech to Plate’ facility complemented Farm491 as a technology application and training centre. Investment in Farm491 was seen ‘as a nationally important centre for agri\-tech’. A further £550k was awarded to the RAU by the  [European Structural and Investment Fund](https://www.gfirstlep.com/downloads/2018/sep-2-update2018v3.pdf) \(p. 39\) to ‘deliver a bespoke programme of research and innovation programme of outreach and support activities for local existing and start\-up agri\-tech businesses and those seeking to diversify into agri\-tech’ \(p.39\) The draft  [Gloucestershire Local Industrial Strategy](https://www.gfirstlep.com/downloads/2019/gloucestershire_draft_local-industrial-strategy_2019.pdf) recognises agri\-tech at the heart of innovation, ‘utilising agri\-tech to create a healthy circular economy in food and farming that is good for the planet builds natural capital and will reduce food\-related illness, making Gloucestershire the first in the world to do so \(p. 7\). The CEO of GFirstLEP, wrote \(letter 01/03/2021\) ‘Farm491 has enabled the creation of a vibrant innovation ecosystem which sits at the heart of Gloucestershire's aspiration to take a leading role in the promotion of advanced agri\-technology that drives inward investment and prosperity in the county. Agri\-technology sits at the heart of our local industrial strategy, and Farm491 plays a pivotal role.’ 

 \[2\] Maggrow is a strong example of how a small Irish company has in three years achieved exponential growth. In July 2018, Maggrow based its crop science team in new workshops at Harnhill and joined Farm491. By 2020, the firm had spent €10m on the science behind magnet\-controlled spraying and secured a  [further €7m](https://farm491.com/2020/09/08/farm491-member-maggrow-attracts-7-1m-investment-for-series-a-round/) of investment. It is now an international company, with trade awards from UK, Ireland, California and New Zealand. 

 \[3\]  [Farm491](https://farm491.com/) was conceived in 2016 and moved into the Alliston Centre in 2018. In the four years, it has gained a membership of 135 companies and with inward investment of £32.8m and employed 111 new staff, or 303 including the founders; for a list of  [current members](https://farm491.com/members/). \(Source: Farm491 Interim Project Evaluation Report\). 

 \[4\] A further 57 companies have been supported through the ERDF project ‘Inspiring Agri\-tech Innovation”. \(Source: Farm491 Evaluation Report 2021\). In the evolving GFirst LEP Local Industrial Strategy, the success of Farm 491 has been an important element in the inclusion of agri\-tech, as one of key element of the industrial strategy. One example of success from the IAI programme is  [Breedr](https://www.breedr.co/), a precision livestock app, whose founders attended the first workshop in 2018, and have now raised £6m and have hired 35 employees and commented ‘Farm491 had been a key part of supporting the business through the founding phase which led to the raise of £2m in Jan 2019. We see them as a key part of the future of Agritech in the UK and look forward to continuing to work together’. 

 \[5\] An example of this activity was the  [Kuwait Science Inward Visit](https://www.kisr.edu.kw/media/filer_public/2a/bf/2abfed7d-6d4c-4bc9-8d7d-0096471b0200/kuwait_science_inward_visit__uk_2020_ebook.pdf) to the UK, organised by the FCDO. Farm491 / RAU was chosen to represent the UK’s leading centre for agri\-tech and sustainable agriculture. This has been followed up by presentations at Research Round Table Workshop in March 2021. 

 \[6\] Letter from DEFRA to Professor Tom Macmillan dated 11/02/2021. ‘We are very grateful for all your input into the design of the R&D Innovation package already, and we have drawn on these valuable insights again in the process of shaping the Farming Innovation Pathways competition.’ 

 \[7\] The published feedback report of the IoEE \(2019\), noted, ‘There is strong evidence of an enterprise eco\-system … mapping the core elements of the ecosystem and creating a clear pathway for students engaging in their entrepreneurial journey. This is fully supported by the close links to the LEP, Growth Hub and a variety of other external stakeholders. RAU is committed to embedding enterprise education across the university and indeed many of the staff involved in the visit were business owners themselves or have been involved in the running of an SME.’ 

 \[8\] Muddy Wellies Ale is sold in 40 independent shops plus 3 Gloucestershire Waitrose stores while Cotswold Hills Wine is in 130 outlets across Southern England, including 87 Mid\-Counties Co\-Op stores. Both brands have won a series of awards. The social enterprise has voluntary student teams who have access to all areas of the project from pruning the vines to sales, marketing and new product development.  In addition, the social enterprises are used as live business case studies in a number of taught modules. 

 \[9\] Two examples are  [Pre\-O](https://www.pre-o.com/), designed to help farmers achieve a higher price for their pre\-organic produce and Vermtek Pest Control.  [Vermtek](https://www.vermtek.com/) is now a national pest control business, with clients Airbus UK, CBRE, HMP, MOD, the NHS and Serco. One of the judges of the competition commented ‘The RAU has enterprise and entrepreneurship in its DNA. I've been inspired and privileged to watch that characteristic bloom in its students. Some of the most exciting ideas I've seen recently have come in disciplines like agri\-tech and food security, areas where so many of today's graduates will go on to benefit society.’

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Childhood is changing: 300 years ago, 5% of children grew up in cities, compared to 50% today. UEL’s BabyDev Group has pioneered new methods to uncover how changing modern living environments affect early cognitive and emotional development. The research has had wide\-ranging impact across the public and commercial sectors – including: i\) direct impact on local councils’ Early Years provision within the UK, ii\) contribution to governmental campaigns from Public Health England and the Department of Education, iii\) involvement in high\-impact television and other media work and iv\) projects with commercial organisations, including shopping centre and hotel design. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The BabyDev group at UEL is located in the London Borough of Newham, in one of the most demographically mixed and socioeconomically challenged areas of the UK. Children growing up in the catchment area experience an exceptionally wide range of different types of early life environment.  The research investigates how these diverse home environments affect early development. 

  

 The BabyDev group, led by Wass, has been awarded a number of large\-scale grants over the past 6 years, including from the Nuffield Foundation, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, a Marie Curie Fellowship and a €1.5 million European Research Council Starter Grant. These projects have been developed in consultation with local council authorities and Children’s Centres in Newham. The group also has funded collaborations with other researchers in the UK \(London \(Institute of Psychiatry, Birkbeck\), Cambridge, Belfast\) and internationally \(Belgium, Germany, Austria, Finland, Israel, US, Canada, Chile\). Through these, they have pioneered new methodologies for understanding how the early home environment affects children’s development. These include, for example, wireless miniaturised wearable microphones, cameras and physiological stress monitors that can be worn by babies and parents at home, and dual neuroimaging to observe early parent\-child interactions. Using these, they can examine for the first time how changing levels of noise and chaos in the home environment can immediately impact on children’s physiological stress, concentration, and social engagement. 

  

 In two recent papers \( **R1**, **R2**\) they showed that, even by 12 months of age, children growing up in physically noisier home environments have higher physiological stress, affecting both their cognitive performance and their emotional responsiveness. Importantly, these differences were not all indicative of poor development: While they were more highly stressed, urban children showed lower sustained attention and greater emotional instability, they showed faster learning speeds in some contexts. This research offers the first mechanistic evidence for how the early living environment can affect multiple different types of problem – e.g. impaired academic performance and adverse mental health outcomes. But it also offers new insights for clinicians, educationalists and parents into maximising learning potential for more highly stressed ‘city kids’. The research examines differential susceptibility: how, and why, some children may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of noisy, cramped environments, and what can be done to protect these children. 

  

 Other papers \( **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\) have pioneered new techniques such as dual parent\-child neuroimaging to examine ‘stress contagion’: how stress and anxiety is shared between adults and children both at home and at school. As well as typical development, atypical parent\-child dyads, where the adult has clinical anxiety or depression, were investigated. This research has widespread relevance both for identifying high\-risk parent\-child dyads, and developing new intervention techniques to minimise long\-term harm.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Informing government policy** 

 Wass has been involved in multiple recent government public initiatives targeting early development – such as two recent Department of Education campaigns to raise parent awareness about the importance of getting children back to school post COVID\-19, for which he acted as official spokesperson. He also contributed to a recent Start4Life campaign on behalf of Public Health England \( **S1**\). 

 **Changing practice in the early years educational sector** 

 Wass has presented his research findings to over 50,000 Early Years practitioners, including the head teachers of over 2,000 primary schools and nurseries, through interactive keynote presentations and workshops that Wass has given at early years conferences such as: The National Day Nurseries Association; National Childminder Conference; Barnardo’s children’s charity; Together for Children; International Association of Prep Schools; and Early Excellence Annual National Meeting \( **S2**\). He has also presented at over 40 local Councils or Academy Trusts around the UK.  His research was published in articles in the Times Educational Supplement \( **S3**\), Early Years Educator, Nursery World, the Chartered College of Teaching and many others. 

 These presentations have led to fundamental change in practitioners’ understanding of how noisy and chaotic environments influence children’s learning \( **S4**\). In particular, practitioners are learning to reduce auditory and visual noise in teaching environments wherever possible – so that the types of ‘stress reduction’ techniques that have been introduced into Special Needs schools over the past 10\-20 years are, increasingly being introduced in mainstream settings, too. As a result of this research, a number of councils have also introduced steps to identify children who are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of noisy environments, and to alter their teaching practice to reflect this. 

 **Raising awareness and creating debate among public audiences** 

 Regularly, including during the recent Covid\-19 pandemic, Wass has appeared as expert commentator on national TV networks \(e.g., BBC Breakfast, ITV This Morning, Sky Sunrise, the Victoria Derbyshire show\), radio stations \(BBC Radio 2/3/4/5 Live, Heart, Capital Radio, Kiss FM\) and newspapers \( **S5**\). These appearances have raised awareness for parents about how their children are affected by stress and anxiety. The research also featured in a recent 2019 TEDx talk which amassed 62,000 views \( **S6**\). 

 From 2013 to 2018 Wass was involved in the Channel 4 series The Secret Life of 4 and 5\-Years Olds \( **S7**\). Wass contributed heavily to the development of the show, which involved him and other scientists observing and commenting live on children’s interactions. The UK show reached over 5 million people and the format has been remade in over 10 countries, including the United States and China. The show received backing from the Wellcome Trust and widespread praise for its innovative approach to making scientific findings about child development accessible to parents at home. It received a Broadcast award and was twice nominated for a BAFTA. 

 **Providing information resources for commercial campaigns** 

 The child directed commercial sector has engaged extensively with Wass’ research. For example, he was heavily involved in a project with Thomas Cook, contributing to the design of the leisure facilities at their holiday resorts. He also worked with New River, who own 35 shopping centres around the UK, to raise awareness of how shopping centres can be stressful and over\-stimulating environments for children, and to introduce steps to make the shopping centres more accommodating to children and adults vulnerable to over\-stimulation \( **S8**\). 

 He contributed to work with Center Parcs based on his research into the importance of shared parent\-child engagement during leisure time and acted as a child development expert in consultancy work with other organisations including: Lego, Fisher Price, Tesco, Dulux, Ikea, Argos, Nickelodeon, the Cartoon Network and Aardman Animations. 

 **NGOs and other organisation influenced by the research** 

 Wass further raised public awareness and engagement with the findings of his research through their informing campaigns for charities such as the 2016 National Trust campaign ’50 things to do before you’re 11 ¾’, a Save the Children campaign on childhood literacy, and work for Barnados charity \( **S9**\). Dr Wass is also official scientific consultant for the new Early Years gallery in development at The Science Museum \( **S10**\).

 **1.** **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Almost 50,000 individuals are diagnosed every year with prostate cancer in the UK, with an estimated 400,000 living with the disease \(Prostate Cancer UK, 2020\). The radiopharmaceutical Xofigo® is approved in more than 40 countries \(European Medicines Agency, 2020\) for the treatment of prostate cancer with bone metastases and has been shown to increase life expectancy and quality of life significantly \(Parker et al., *N Engl J Med* 2013; 369:213\-223\). 

 Professor Regan’s group at the University of Surrey and the National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\) led research resulting in the re\-evaluation of the primary calibration standards and the resetting of calibration factors for Xofigo® in more than 3,000 clinics worldwide.

 **2.** **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Xofigo® \(radium \(Ra\-223\) \- dichloride\) is a registered palliative therapy for prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases \( [http://bayer.com/en/innovation/research\-development\-drugs](http://bayer.com/en/innovation/research-development-drugs)\). Since radium is chemically similar to calcium, it binds selectively to areas of increased cell turnover in bone metastases. At these sites, the Ra\-223 active material emits alpha particles which deposit their energy over a range corresponding to between 2 and 10 cell layers. The rapid slowing down and energy dispersion of these alpha particles causes double\-strand DNA breaks, leading to a cytotoxic effect on tumour cells. Xofigo® is used in more than 3,000 clinics worldwide to provide life\-extending treatments for patients with metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(CRPC\). To ensure that patients are treated with the correct dosage, detailed information on the radioactive decay properties of this material are required.  The accurate measurement of radium \(Ra\-223\) dichloride activity is assured by adjustment of dose calibrators using the National Measurements Institute \(NMI\) traceable reference standard, which is provided to the licensee of the drug. The absolute accuracy of the traceable standard is the first point in the calibration chain and, if incorrect, results in potentially too high or too low doses of the drug being administered. 

 The high\-precision nuclear decay data associated with the isotope\-specific radioactive signatures for Ra\-223 measured by Prof. Regan’s group **\[R1\-R3\]**, underpins the provision of an absolute primary calibration standard for dose application for Xofigo® and indeed all radiopharmaceuticals. Primary calibration standards are linked directly to clinic\-based sources and the related ionisation chamber calibration factors which are needed to determine the dose administered to patients. It is crucial for public and clinical confidence in the quality assurance of such treatments that the clinic\-based calibration factors are directly traceable to the primary standards held at NMIs, such as the National Physical Laboratory \(UK\) and the National Institute for Standards and Technology \(NIST\) in the USA. Cross\-continental measurements need to be consistent when compared with each other and any other standards held at each NMI. If they are inconsistent, different doses of Ra\-223 may be administered to patients depending on where they are being treated. 

 The precision radioactive decay data generated by Prof. Regan’s group **\[R1\-R3\]** led directly to the correction of the NIST\-based standard for the first alpha admitting radiopharmaceutical approved for the treatment of metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer. As a result, the clinic\-based calibration factors were revised by more than 10% following the correction of the US\-based standard held by NIST \(see  [https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1526/ML15264B095.pdf](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1526/ML15264B095.pdf)\). When compared to the previously claimed calibration accuracy of 0.3% \( [https://dx.doi.org/10.6028%2Fjres.120.004](https://dx.doi.org/10.6028%2Fjres.120.004)\), this systematic shift/error of this magnitude could have led to significant over/under dosage of Xofigo® and a significant effect on ultimate patient outcomes \( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697)\). 

 Prof. Regan’s group also conducted a range of measurements to provide the absolute nuclear decay data for other related, pre\-clinical radiopharmaceutical nuclides, including thorium \(Th\-227\) **\[R2\]**. This is particularly important as this radionuclide is used as a generator source for Ra\-223, the active material used in Xofigo® **\[R1, R2\]**. This work was conducted using the same experimental analysis and interpretation techniques as Prof. Regan’s STFC\-funded studies into the decay signatures of radioactive nuclei for absolute standardisation **\[R4, R5\]** and the evolution of nuclear structure with changing proton and neutron numbers \(e.g. **\[R6\]**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research led by Prof. Regan’s Nuclear Metrology Group \(Surrey\-NPL\), identified a major discrepancy in the existing primary standardisation of the alpha\-emitting radiopharmaceutical material Ra\-223. High\-precision radioactive decay data generated and validated by the Surrey\-NPL group **\[R1\-R3\]** was responsible for the 2015 revision to the National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) standard for the use of the castration\-resistant prostate cancer therapy, Xofigo®. The calibration\-factor correction was initiated following the identification of discrepancies between the existing radiological standards and the underpinning nuclear decay data by Prof. Regan’s group **\[R1\-R6\]**, some two orders of magnitude greater than the acceptable range with regards to primary standards. In clinical trials, larger dosages of Xofigo® have been shown to lead to increased radiological progression that caused treatment to be prematurely terminated \( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697)\). In such instances, such a large miscalibration error could have led to significantly poorer health outcomes for patients on Xofigo®. 

 Correcting the global radiopharmaceutical standard for Xofigo®: Nuclear decay data measurements by Prof. Regan’s group highlighted a discrepancy in the pre\-existing \(2008\) standard for the alpha\-emitter Ra\-223. This prompted a thorough evaluation by NIST who, after replicating the experimental work, confirmed an approximate \+10% adjustment in the absolute calibration factor from their existing \(2008\) standard. The high\-precision nuclear decay data, generated by Prof. Regan’s group, led directly to the provision of the updated, corrected, absolute primary calibration standard. 

 On 11 March 2015, NIST published information regarding the revised primary standard for Ra\-223 resulting in a numerical increase of 10.5% for the new primary standard. **\[S1, S2\]** This change was only to the numerical value of the quantity of Ra\-223, as the actual amount of Ra\-223 in the primary standard did not change. Thus, the work conducted by Prof. Regan and the NPL Nuclear Metrology Group provided the foundation and motivation for the upgraded standardisation for the Ra\-223 radionuclide by NIST. This is confirmed by the statement in **\[S1\]** by the NIST group \(as **\[S3\]**\): “As a result of a discrepancy involving our published secondary standards for 223Ra brought to our attention by colleagues at the National Physical Laboratory, we have undertaken a thorough review of our 2008 work and performed two large studies to re\-standardize this radionuclide that will hopefully provide an explanation for the source of the discrepancy” and “This new primary standard is based on measurements made with methods that are more robust than those available in the original 2008 experiments.” **\[S1\]** 

 In March 2015, Bayer Pharmaceuticals Ltd notified the clinical community to this change in calibration dial factor standards following the revision of the \(NIST\) standard **\[S4, S5\]**. This required a simultaneous worldwide recalibration of all devices for measuring radiation dose carried out at more than 3,000 clinics worldwide. Bayer also stated that they would increase the numerical values listed on the package label by approximately 10%. That is, the labelling of the patient dose was updated from 50 kBq/kg of body weight to 55 kBq/kg of body weight, and product documentation was updated to read 110 kBq/ml \(previously 1000 kBq/ml\) and 6.6 MBq/vial \(previously 6.0 MBq/vial\). Bayer further stated that the revised standard for Ra\-223 does not change the actual amount of Ra\-223 dichloride being administered to patients and will therefore not impact the safety and efficacy of Xofigo® **\[S5\-S7\]**. 

 Absolute, traceable radioactivity standards are vital in retaining public confidence in the application of every radiopharmaceutical in the medical arena worldwide. The discrepancy identified by Prof. Regan’s group **\[S1\-S8\]** in the universally accepted standard for the alpha\-emitter Ra\-223 highlights the need for a continuous evaluation of the radiopharmaceuticals currently in use worldwide and the potential impact on the future of cancer treatments.

 ‘DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES 

 In 2013, NIST was made aware of studies performed by the National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\) \(the National Measurement Institute of the United Kingdom\) in which an approximately 10 percent difference was found between NPL’s activities obtained using several primary methods and those obtained with the calibration factors published by NIST from 2010. Subsequently, NIST performed additional testing using more robust methods than previously available to verify NPL’s results and confirmed that activity readings were lower than expected.   On March 11, 2015, NIST published information regarding the revised primary standard for Ra\-223 resulting in a numerical increase of 10.5 percent for the new primary standard.’

 ‘Xofigo © \(radium\-223 dichloride\), which has been hailed as a “huge step forward” in treating prostate cancer patients, is now available for the treatment of men with castration\-resistant prostate cancer who have symptomatic bone metastases. 

 The drug was so successful in the trial phases that it was stopped early once it became clear that the drug was effective. The drug not only enabled men to live longer but when they are taking it they have fewer side\-effects and less pain, giving them a better quality of life.’ 

 ‘Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men in the UK. In 2010, around 41,000 men were diagnosed with the disease. On average, 10\-20% of prostate cancer patients develop castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(CRPC\) within approximately 5 years of follow up and of those almost 84% have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.’  [https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/news\-and\-events/news/xofigo\-radium\-223\-launches\-uk](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/news-and-events/news/xofigo-radium-223-launches-uk)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Leisure\-based prescriptions in primary care \(‘social prescribing’\) for improving health & wellbeing are better understood, better implemented, and more widely commissioned as a result of our research.  Critically, objective and subjective patient benefits are repeatedly demonstrated from social prescribing care pathways fundamentally informed by our research.  An iterative action research and impact model is adopted, where the researchers are funded to be involved in the prescription care pathway design from the outset, with the evaluation informing future commissioning and evaluation approaches. The case study demonstrates impact from the end\-user up to the policy level. Programmes have adopted our evidence to enhance delivery and outcomes, and more national\-level implementation of social prescribing modalities in primary care have been supported by the evidence generated from the unit. Beyond, it has been included in international discussions regarding the use of social prescribing. The research has been funded by commissioners and a range of health trusts, public and third sector organisations. Ranging from the inclusion of social prescribing as part of the NHS Long Term Plan, to more local commissioning and practice advances, the impact now has national reach, with Gloucestershire internationally renowned as leading in this field of public health.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This social prescribing research builds on the international reputation and impact of the Unit’s research on exercise on prescription in the late 1990s and 2000s \(e.g., **8**\), and the subsequent research on health care pathways involving physical activity from 2010, to some of the earliest large\-scale observational studies of arts on prescription in the 21<sup>st</sup> century \(e.g., **6, 7**\).  More latterly, our reputation has drawn in other significant commissioners, including the Wildlife Trust health partnering for nature prescriptions, and Macmillan for cancer patient arts therapy. 

 Poor mental health is the second largest source of disease burden in England \(Public Health England, 2019\), and is associated with a variety of physical health indicators.  Poor mental health intersecting with physical health issues can also drive up the cost of healthcare spending per patient by as much as 50% \(NHS England Mental Health Taskforce, 2016\).  Over many years, our Unit’s expertise and track\-record in the application and impact of leisure\-based prescriptions in health has now placed us at the forefront of advancements in the growing social prescribing movement in primary care, with notable contribution to the July 2017 All\-Party Parliamentary Group Arts, Health & Wellbeing Inquiry Report. 

 A selection of research outputs are provided in section 3.  To quote from one of our testimonials, the convenor of the Arts, Health & Wellbeing special interest group of the Royal Society for Public Health, “ *I would say that nationally and probably internationally, the Artlift evaluation is regarded as a beacon in relation to the whole concept of social prescribing.  Certainly, I know that in the context of the recent training provision for link workers within the social prescribing initiative for England, the work of University of Gloucestershire has been flagged up as a very important source of evidence on the value of this kind of activity.  In a recent review of social prescribing, the authors reached the conclusion that, as yet, there is not very much published evidence on social prescribing aside from that produced by University of Gloucestershire.*”  Over five commissioned UK\-based funded research projects have led to these outputs, and outcomes have been presented both nationally and throughout the European Union.  The presented body of research dates back to 2009, showing the evolution of social prescribing research, and the growing interest in arts, wider wellbeing, and nature. 

 Adopting an iterative action learning and impact research model \(a genuinely non\-linear co\-production approach\), researchers were always funded to design the intervention as well as the evaluation, and then evaluation learning was fed into future commissions.  Learning was informed by objective and subjective patient outcomes and benefits, as well as pathway design factors.  Critical to commissioners was the overall efficacy and cost\-benefit implications.  Examples of learning included the potential to shorten the duration of these expensive interventions whilst maintaining the efficacy.  Similarly, better targeting of the interventions based on patient sociodemographic and medical history resulted from the research.  This combination of both process and outcome evaluation within a co\-production environment, resulted in rapid advances in funding, practice and patient benefit. 

 The body of research provides an authoritative evidence base that is routinely cited in national policy for social prescribing in primary care, including for the first time in the field prospective observational studies with large participant cohorts \(n=245 to 1297\) and drawing on epidemiologic quantitative analysis techniques \(e.g., **1**, **3**, **5**\).  This is novel in this field of research, with no other studies of this size or complexity.  To explore further the patients’ and other actors’ experiences and perspectives, a range of qualitative approaches have been adopted, drawing data from this large body of participants \(e.g., **2**, **4**\).  The combination of findings from all research approaches can sometimes reveal novel insight \(e.g., **2**\) that is not possible from the approaches in isolation. In particular, some of these findings have moved our work into the further contemporary areas of wider wellbeing \(given the social isolation dynamics, for example\) and nature \(given the uptake rates and overall efficacy for arts\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The recognition of the impact of the Unit’s research at a national level is exemplified by this quotation from the Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Prof Helen Stokes\-Lampard in 2019:  “ *for me to be able to wholeheartedly encourage NHS England and Government to support initiatives – as time has gone on, the evidence base has widened considerably and you are an important part of that.  As a result of our combined efforts, this means that we now have Social Prescribing specifically mentioned within the NHS Long Term Plan for England and Social Prescribers are being funded as part of the 2019 GP Contract, a 5\-year settlement for the profession.  Thank you for your ongoing research and interest in this area and I look forward to reading more of your inputs in the coming years.*” 

 Furthermore, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Arts for Health inquiry report \(2017\) had a special whole page ‘exemplar of innovation in health’ based on the Gloucestershire model of arts commissioning for health, and the integration of research evaluation by the Unit from the outset \( **A**\).  The significant impact of the research is also evident from the WHO Report \( **B**\), What is the evidence on the role of the arts in improving health and well\-being? A scoping review \(Fancourt, D., & Finn, S., 2020\). This report shows the importance of the unit’s research in the emerging international focus of social prescribing, and its gaining momentum as a key source of support for patient health and wellbeing beyond the UK. 

 The research\-impact relationship is iterative, based on a co\-production model.  The commissioning of evaluation at the same time as care pathway design, leads to rapid implementation of evaluation findings, and subsequent benefits for future commissioning, and the patients and other actors.  On behalf of the Royal Society for Public Health, Arts, Health & Wellbeing Special Interest Group \( **C**\), the convenor, Prof Stephen Clift outlines the impact of the research.  “ *I have been impressed with the data collection for many reasons. The first is that the numbers of patients they have been able to follow has increased, and so it is in the order of several thousand now across the county.  Secondly, they have been able to gather information on different models of delivery to provide important evidence for practice.  They have also been able to look at different art forms, because Artlift offer different kinds of arts activity and some might suit some people better than others.  They have been very good making use of widely used validated standardised instruments for assessing wellbeing.  One of these is the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. They have recently been able to supplement that with more clinically oriented measures of anxiety and depression, again, showing positive results.  All of these studies have produced a solid evidence base that people clearly benefit from participation.  They have also been able to look at repeated cycles of referral.  This kind of re\-referral is a very important aspect of these kinds of projects and UoG’s work has been able to capture that.  The other thing I would say is very strong, is that UoG has also gathered a lot of qualitative feedback.  They have collated and analysed a lot of narrative accounts from people accessing these programmes, and it is very clear from what people have to say, that they have benefited.  This type of evidence gives greater insight into how these interventions work, what the kind of processes are that lead to benefits for people in terms of their wellbeing.*” 

 Clinical Lead for Social Prescribing at NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group \( **D**\), Dr Simon Opher MBE, further exemplifies the co\-production model. “ *The evaluation was done as a co\-production as we developed the arts on prescription service*.”  In his testimonial, he also goes on to explain the national impact of the research conducted within Gloucestershire.  “ *On a national level, I think the research influenced people who were looking at new ways of working. The new reformed GP contract from the NHS, providing primary care networks with the ability to set up their own social prescribing schemes, partly came from the work in Arts and Health, and that work has been very much contributed to by work in Gloucestershire, so it definitely had a big impact nationally.*” 

 The significant impact of the research for Clinical Commissioning has been outlined by the Senior Programme Manager, Social Prescribing & Cultural Commissioning, Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group \( **E**\), Ms Jules Ford.  The Head of Public Health and Wellbeing, West Berkshire \(formerly Gloucestershire\) Clinical Commissioning Group \( **F**\), Mr Matthew Pearce, explains how integrated the research evaluation model has become, and how influential it is now beyond Gloucestershire.  The Executive Director, Artlift \( **G**\), Ms Cath Wilkins, also supports that national reach of the impact of the research, illustrating how Gloucestershire is now a leader in the field, and novel in the underpinning evidence to inform practice. 

 The impact to the end\-user is emphasised and made possible by the iterative action research and impact model adopted by the research team. Here, social prescribing programmes have been refined and improved through these iterative processes to provide meaningful and profound impact to the end users. This is outlined by Macmillan’s Professional Development and Knowledge Manager, Ms Libby Potter \( **I**\): “ *The work UoG undertook helped me hugely to understand the role of social prescribing and the potential for something like Flourish to be something that could be prescribed. Because we were able to identify the particular features and benefits via the research, we could then apply that to the person and what matters to them particularly.”* The impact on both patient\-participants and the NHS is also echoed by Dr Simon Opher MBE \( **D**\), who alongside being the clinical lead for social prescribing in Gloucestershire, is also a local GP: “ *the effects on patients have been varied but quite profound, so that people have actually felt better in themselves having completed the Art Intervention, they have got lower rates of consulting their GP \(which I have personally seen, as a GP\). They often do not need other agencies once they have engaged in the arts project, and they also quite often have carried on doing art outside of their prescribed course. That is really a fantastic outcome for the NHS because it means that we do not have to fund continuing therapy that is working for patients, and it has allowed a degree of patient autonomy as well.”.* Ultimately, without the research from the unit many of these services would not be commissioned, nor continued, nor extended to use as models for UK social prescribing provision to make these profound impacts on the lives of UK primary care patients. 

 The impact of the research is also now well beyond arts, with the Head of Community Programmes, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust \( **H**\), Ms Lorna Fox, illustrating how the research has informed nature prescriptions in Gloucestershire, and also now influence national nature and health policy.  Similarly, the Macmillan Senior Learning and Development Manager for South West & Midlands \( **I**\), Ms Libby Potter, illustrates how cancer patient therapy is now embracing Arts, and the profound impacts on the patients’ wellbeing and identity, and sense of purpose.  Photography is also now featuring as a growing intervention, particularly involving nature, with the Director, Look Again \( **J**\), Ms Ruth Davey, showing how enterprises are already building in the prior evidence and evaluation models developed through the Unit’s research to enhance practice and optimise benefits for the end users.

The telecommunications and internet service provider which is ranked in the Top 4 of market share holders among mobile operators, had commissioned Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli to prepare a technical report on the impact of speed on consumers’ switching intentions in the UK mobile telephone industry in September 2016. Three UK subsequently used the research to reinforce their own assessment of speed and to revamp their advertising campaigns which had a direct influence on the creation of their 2018 and 2019 television commercials for mobile phones.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Dey \(then, Senior Lecturer\) and Dr Al\-Karaghouli of Brunel Business School have conducted extensive research on digital consumer culture, customers’ satisfaction and service quality. \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 4\). Dr Dey’s work conceptualised and theorised digital consumer culture \(Ref.5\) and explored and analysed consumers’ interaction with and appropriation of digital technology \(Ref.6\) 

 Their most recent research project concentrated on the role speed plays for UK mobile telephone customers \(Ref. 1\). 

 Mobile telecom is a highly competitive industry where each operator’s products are seen as only partial substitutes for other providers’ products. Mobile operators try to retain and grow their customer base through differentiated products and services that have multiple attributes. As a result, a wide range of factors may influence customers’ assessment of mobile telecom services and in turn influence their decision to remain or switch. It is important for operators and policy makers to know which factors influence a customer’s decision to remain with and switch from their existing provider as the cumulative effect of this type of decision will have a major impact on competitive dynamics. 

 In addition to basic product features such as quality of voice calls and text messaging services, customers are likely to value other features such as data network coverage and speed of Internet access. However, it is not clear from the existing literature whether internet speed on mobile telephones has any influence on customers’ service satisfaction and subsequent switching decision. This lack of clarity inhibited mobile telephone service providers’ marketing strategies and endeavour to offer and promote appropriate service features. Even if they attempted to highlight speed as a decisive factor, due to a lack of academic research regulatory bodies such as Ofcom, did not properly recognise their claims. This was the case when Ofcom blocked Hutchison’s \(widely known as Three Mobile\) campaign geared towards investigating whether in the changing market environment consumers take notice of speed which in turn affects their perception of the brand and value of the network provider. 

 After Ofcom’s evaluation, Three UK commissioned Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli in September 2016 to produce independent academic research to test the impact of speed on consumers’ switching decisions in the UK mobile telephone industry. Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli took a marketing perspective and developed a conceptual framework from critically analysing the extensive review of the relevant academic literature that selected on consumer behaviour, branding and electronics engineering \(Ref. 1\). 

 The research findings showed that customers rate speed as the second most significant component of service quality after call quality, when choosing a mobile telecom provider. Their data also confirmed that brand image is positively associated with speed and a significant driver in the creation and maintenance of a company’s perceived value among mobile telephone customers.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Meeting the high competitions and the rapid consumers’ demand for the wide use of smartphones and increasing subscription to high speed data networks, there is a predictive trajectory of customers’ growing reliance on Internet\-mediated services and facilities. A 2016 Ofcom report on ‘Coping in the connected world’ suggests that 9 in 10 adults in the UK go online every day and indicates that smartphones and tablets offer the most convenient means for being connected with the Internet world. A 2020 ‘UK Mobile Phones Market Report’ from Mintel, one of the largest market intelligence agencies globally, estimates that the UK smartphone market was worth GBP6,520,000,000 in 2019. Providers within the UK mobile telephone industry therefore continually determine how consumers choose providers \(e.g. based on speed and coverage\) in order to keep up in a competitive market and growing userbase. The measures are required to stay ahead of competitors, acquire new customers and retain existing customer base by achieving customer satisfaction through high quality products and services. 

 Three UK carries 36% of the UK’s mobile data traffic and is the fastest growing network in the country which covers more than 97% of the population. With approximately 10,100,000 active customers who use over 3.5 times more mobile data than the industry average, they are one of the most popular mobile telephone providers in the UK. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research outputs in the form of the project report and published article were submitted to Ofcom to reconsider their initial decision of blocking Three’s campaign. Although the outputs did not make significant changes in Ofcom’s position, the documents were widely used by the Three management. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research findings informed the ways in which Three engages with regulators. The Senior Strategy Manager of Three confirms, that the report “validated our initial assumptions that in the changing market environment consumers pay increasing attention to speed which in turn contributes to their perceptions of the brand and value of a network provider” \(E1\). 

 Three subsequently used the document as a point of reference for their current and future strategies, which increasingly recognise the importance of speed. While remaining compliant to Ofcom, the report produced by Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli has improved the quality of discussion at Three. Prior to the report, Three was unsure whether their own assessment, which showed that it is worthwhile putting speed to the forefront, was accurate. However, the research “reinforces and concurs with our own assessment of speed,” says the Senior Strategy Manager, and it has convinced them to stick to their existing operational strategy \(E1\). Importantly, it also influenced their decision to make speed a core part of their strategic decision\-making and marketing communications. 

 Three used the research findings to enhance their brand image and customers’ perceived value, and discourage them from switching to a competitor. For example, they have made both call quality and speed key aspects of their marketing communications in order to grow their position in the UK mobile telecom industry. 

 Three’s recent advertising campaigns highlight the importance of customers’ perceived value underpinned by the call quality, brand image and network speed. Their 2018 TV ad ‘Phone History \#PhonesAreGood’ “for instance has strong indication that speed has significant impact on consumption experience” \(E1\). It also comically depicts how major historical events could have been alleviated if only the people at the time had had a good smartphone with excellent speed by their side \(such as the Captain of the Titanic successfully circumnavigating the iceberg and Henry VIII averting any unfortunate marriages with the means of a dating app\). Likewise, the 2019 TV ad ‘The Switch | Switch to Three’ advertises the high influence of call quality on consumers when depicting a customer at sea with perfect reception on her mobile phone. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research have informed the strategic decision\-making process and marketing communications at Three UK, a company that ranks in the top 4 mobile operators that hold the biggest market share in the country. Three UK confirms that they “plan to make further progress with our partnership with Dr Dey, Dr Al\-Karaghouli and Brunel University London to explore and apply further implications of the research” \(E1\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bingham’s research has directly informed the work of public inquiries, the police, lawyers, and social workers, helping them understand, and respond to, historical cases of child sexual abuse. Ever since revelations about the offences perpetrated by Jimmy Savile emerged in 2012, historical child sexual abuse has been high on the public agenda. Although policymakers and practitioners had access to extensive information about contemporary manifestations of abuse, there was much less knowledge of its presence in earlier decades, or how patterns had changed over time – a dimension that became critical when hundreds of cases dating back to the 1950s were being investigated and recommendations were being made to improve safeguarding. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Bingham’s research has demonstrated the central role of the press in shaping ideas about sex and sexuality in twentieth\-century Britain. His book *Family Newspapers?* \(R1\) showed that popular national daily newspapers, in particular, were a hugely significant source of knowledge and imagery about sexual behaviour, personal relationships and moral codes. In that book, he charted the growing anxiety about the threat of ‘paedophiles’ from the mid\-1970s. As the issue of historical child sexual abuse rose up the public agenda, he recognised that more focused research on the press would make a valuable contribution. In collaboration with two other historians, Lucy Delap \(now University of Cambridge\) and Louise Jackson \(University of Edinburgh\), a successful application was made to the Economic and Social Research Council to examine the changing ways in which child sexual abuse was reported in the press, tackled by practitioners \(social workers, police, children’s homes etc\), and dealt with by the criminal justice system \(G1\). This was the first detailed historical investigation of its kind. Professor Bingham led the strand on the press coverage, and, working with a Research Assistant, Dr Louise Settle, produced an extensive database of reporting from the period 1918 to 1990, identifying around 1,000 articles from a representative selection of national and local newspapers. This was an unprecedentedly rich and varied database of content through which changes in the public discussion of child sexual abuse could be traced with unusual sensitivity. This press coverage not only influenced public opinion, it also informed the work of, and prompted responses from, politicians, policy\-makers, the police and campaigners. 

 The key finding from Professor Bingham’s strand of research was that child sexual abuse was not ‘invisible’ before the 1970s and 1980s, as is often claimed, but was discussed in different ways and with different types of language; these shifts were intimately connected to, and shaped by, wider political agendas and perceptions of social, cultural and moral change \(R2, R3, R4\). Across the period court reporting provided numerous instances of the prosecution of abuse, but euphemistic language often obscured the precise nature of the alleged offences. During the 1950s and 1960s, sex crimes were reported in more detail, but because child sexual abuse had not yet been clearly defined as a distinctive criminal category, it was repeatedly conflated with ‘homosexuality’ or with other forms of ‘deviancy’. It was only in the mid\-1970s, when ‘child abuse’ was conceptualized as a ‘social problem’ and the terminology of the ‘paedophile’ gained popular currency, that the press placed the issue firmly on the public agenda, and started to deploy it as a symbol of the moral decay brought by ‘permissiveness’. Even then, the press’s attention was largely focused on certain manifestations of abuse, notably that committed by strangers rather than carried out within the home, and the cultures sustaining it were not properly interrogated. These blind spots enabled offenders like Jimmy Savile to continue to hide in plain sight \(R2, R4, R5\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bingham’s research has provided policymakers and practitioners with a deeper understanding of child sexual abuse in the recent past, enabling a better response to the hundreds of historical cases that have emerged since 2012. 

 Impact on inquiries 

 Several official inquiries into historical child sexual abuse were established after the Savile revelations. In May 2013, Bingham was one of eight historians invited to brief the inquiries into Jimmy Savile’s offences on NHS properties, overseen by Kate Lampard QC and involving investigators from Broadmoor, Leeds General Infirmary and Stoke Mandeville hospitals. Bingham was asked why journalists did not expose Savile’s actions until after his death, and how he used his celebrity to evade scrutiny. Bingham explained that gendered attitudes in the newsrooms, journalistic reluctance to challenge high\-profile figures, and stringent libel laws all discouraged newspapers from spotlighting alleged sexual offences \(S1\). 

 Kate Lampard QC noted that the evidence from Bingham and the other historians ‘helped all three organisations \[Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Leeds General and Broadmoor\] avoid hindsight bias and added significantly to the rigour, thoroughness and fairness of their investigation reports’ \(S1\). Bingham’s research was summarised across more than 300 words in Lampard’s 2015 *Lessons Learnt* report \(p.37\), which was written for the Health Secretary to make recommendations for changes in NHS practices, and which received extensive media coverage \(S2\). It was also used \(c.100 words\) in the 2014 Broadmoor Hospital report \(p.13\) and the 2015 Stoke Mandeville hospital report \(p.190\) \(S3, S4\). Bingham’s evidence was thus central to ensuring that policymakers and practitioners had a historically accurate understanding of Savile’s activities, and could therefore learn the right lessons to improve safeguarding for the future.

 At both sessions, Bingham circulated his 4,000\-word History and Policy briefing paper. This resource had a wider impact, with 5128 unique page views between August 2015 and October 2020 \(S6\). 

 Impact on practitioners 

 Having generated a reputation in the field, Bingham, Delap, and Jackson were invited to present at several events for practitioners. The Independent Police Complaints Commission’s Director of Operations requested a presentation because of the IPCC’s involvement in ‘high profile investigations where potential failings in the police response to child abuse… have been identified’ \(S7\). In February 2016, Bingham and Delap presented at the IPCC Development Day on Child Abuse to around 60 IPCC staff involved in relevant investigations. 

 Bingham was invited to present at the St Mary’s Sexual Assault Referral Centre’s annual conference in February 2017. The event attracted c.200 practitioners \(including senior police officers, barristers, social workers, and clinicians\) and was designed to share ‘knowledge and experience in order that we can improve services and standards both in the UK and internationally’ \(S8\). Bingham’s talk generated positive feedback, with 55% of respondents saying that it was ‘very good’, and another 42% ‘good’ \(S8\). 

 In June 2018 Bingham, Jackson and Delap were invited to present at a four\-hour seminar organised by the law firm Farrer & Co for organisations working with children. David Smellie, Head of Farrer’s Safeguarding Unit said: “ *I have no doubt that the important work of these academics in contextualising past failings will significantly assist organisations to put in place more robust systems today*.” Numerous respondents, including delegates from St Paul’s School, Cognita Schools, the London Borough of Islington, the Caledon Trust and Ealing Abbey, said that they ‘definitely’ learnt something that would be useful for their work from Bingham’s talk. Hannah Jenner, the Safeguarding Children Training Facilitator at the Scout Association, said Bingham’s talk was “ *clear and incisive at exposing the prevailing narratives and assumptions that we are working with as individuals in society and in the organisations we work for*” \(S9\). 

 Bingham’s research has therefore directly informed the work of public inquiries, the police, lawyers and social workers, helping them understand, and respond to, historical cases of child sexual abuse. In January 2018, Bingham was awarded, with Delap and Jackson, the Royal Historical Society’s inaugural Public History Prize for Public Debate and Policy. The citation noted that the winners ‘have been notably successful, the judges feel, in ensuring that the policy\-making implications of this research reaches key audiences’ \(S10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Each year over $15bn of pharmaceuticals are sold which unintentionally cause or exacerbate heart disease. Since 2002 Coventry University researchers have developed a novel predictive Work\-Loop assay, and complementary computational methods, to improve the early detection of adverse drug issues on heart contraction. 

 One result of this research was the successful spin\-out company InoCardia Ltd., founded in 2013 to provide innovative services in cardiovascular safety assessment, creating revenue and jobs from its Coventry headquarters. Research has driven health sector innovation and productivity gains for \[text removed for publication\] and benefitted patient outcomes.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 One of the major reasons for safety\-related attrition \(drug failure\) is adverse effects drugs can have on the cardiovascular system, including effects on the force of contraction of the heart \(inotropy\). Current cardiovascular tests used within the pharmaceutical industry cannot reliably predict drug effects on human hearts, and this often results in postponements or withdrawal to the development of safe and effective products. 

 Responding to this, CU’s Professor Helen Maddock and Professor Rob James investigated the use of an in\-vitro test, using heart tissue in the lab to closely mimic the physiology of the contraction and relaxation of the heart. This aimed to improve the safety assessment of drugs in development within the pharmaceutical industry, and reduce drug\-induced cardiotoxicity \[R1\-3\] \[G1\-8\]. 

 From 2000, initial research by Maddock using a functional working heart model \[R4\] \[G1\], and by James using skeletal muscle \[R5\] \[G2\], led to collaborative work where they developed a heart tissue in\-vitro test referred to as the work\-loop assay. This was capable of more closely simulating cardiac contractile physiology, mimicking the forces that are required to occur when the heart fills with blood in order for it to be pumped around the body, and enabled researchers to successfully predict both the negative and positive side effects medical drugs would have on the heart, before the clinical testing stage \[G3\] \[R1\-3; R6\]. 

 Using papillary muscle, the work\-loop assay was considered to be important to the pharmaceutical industry and in 2013 InoCardia Ltd. was founded to providing a cardiac drug safety assessment service for pharmaceutical companies, using an investment of £529,000 over four years from the Mercia Fund. From 2013\-20 Maddock led on the development and expansion of their research portfolio and in collaboration with James, with InoCardia and CU respectively building InoCardia’s cardiac safety assessment portfolio, supported by over £2.5m funding \[G3\-8\] from InnovateUK, NC3R, European Development Research Fund and Horizon 2020. 

 From development of the initial academic research \[R1; R3\], InoCardia has optimised and industrialised the in vitro work *\-*loop: the world's first non\-clinical contractility assay which offers superior predictivity and is currently revolutionising the field of cardiac safety assessment \[R1\-3 **;** R6\]. The resultant ‘Work\-Loop Platform’ is superior to competitor technologies in that it is better able to predict the risk that a new medicine may affect heart contractility in humans. The platform is validated for use by safety pharmacologists prior to experimental medicine entering clinic, to manage embedded inotropy risk. 

 Following funding from an EIT\-Digital\-Horizon 2020 award \[G7\] InoCardia launched an online virtual screen named ‘The Contractome\-AI’. Rather than physical testing in the lab, this  provides users with the ability to perform risk\-assessments on drugs using computer modelling, helping assess their safety far before they reach clinical trial stages \[R6\] \[G7\-8\]. Research underpinning InoCardia’s work received a recent ‘Technological Innovation Award’ from the global Safety Pharmacology Society in 2020, and in December 2020 Maddock was awarded a Women in Innovation award, recognising InoCardia’s contribution to solving a pressing societal, environmental and economic challenges in the UK \[G8\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As a consequence of CU’s research, the commercially successful spin\-out company InoCardia Ltd. has changed the face of drug development by offering new capabilities and knowledge within safety testing in pharmaceutical production, to improve patient health outcomes. 

 <ins>Spin\-Out \- InoCardia</ins> 

 In December 2013, InoCardia Ltd. was spun out from CU as a company specialising in the provision of predictive cardiac contractility assessment for early drug discovery. InoCardia is a successful self\-funding business and has leveraged \[text removed for publication\] investor and public UK/EU funding from bodies including InnovateUK, NC3Rs, and EIT Digital \[S1, G5\-8\], to develop the innovative Work\-Loop Platform \[S1\]. Since its foundation the company has created seven full\-time staff positions at its Coventry Headquarters and employs an additional three PhD students. InoCardia has worked with global pharmaceutical companies \[text removed for publication\] \[S1\] to screen new drugs in development, develop bespoke testing assays, and identify cardiovascular toxicity in exemplars from compound libraries \[S1\]. The novel assay has been used in the assessment of \[text removed for publication\], providing a predictive test approach to preclinical safety and efficacy assessment \[S1\]. 

 <ins>Informing Drugs’ Development</ins> 

 Both the *in\-vitro* work\-loop heart cell test and the Contractome\-AI have established InoCardia as a world leader in cardiac contractility safety assessment, through better prediction of drug activity prior to clinical trials. InoCardia brings an ‘entirely new approach to characterise drug effects on the full contractile/relaxation cycle in vitro’ \[S2; S3\]. As the Senior Director of UCB Biopharma states, the Work\-Loop Platform has ‘greater predictivity to humans than existing tests’ \[S4; S5\]. Safety Pharmacology Society \(SPS\) acknowledges InoCardia has enabled companies ‘to better characterise drug treatment effects’, taking into account ‘the full contraction/relaxation phase of the contractile response’ \[S6\]. The former Pfizer head of Global Safety Pharmacology attests that the assays ‘add fundamental scientific knowledge and relevant improvements’ in the relatively unexplored ‘area of cardiovascular safety pharmacology’ \[S2\]. 

 <ins>Improving Drugs Testing and Production</ins> 

 InoCardia’s radical approach is a major step forward in the production of safe, effective medicines. The effectiveness of the Work\-Loop Platform has changed ‘confidence in the predictivity of the *in vitro* assays’ rather than *in vivo* animal testing, allowing project teams to make ‘a better allocation of resources to compounds that have a greater chance of success’ \[S2\]. The Work\-Loop assay ‘only requires milligram quantities of material’ and therefore, ‘can be used much earlier in the drug discovery process’ \[S2\]. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies have reduced money they would have spent on the development of drugs doomed to fail at clinical trial; the ‘ability to detect cardiac contractility issues earlier allows money \(many millions of pounds\) to be spent on compounds with a higher chance of success’ \[S4\]. 

 The most recent innovation from InoCardia, the *in\-silico* Contractome\-AI, has given pharmaceutical companies a pioneering new capacity to model compounds for cardiac contractility virtually, based on known qualities of components. Developed in collaboration with a computational chemistry\-modelling company Cresset, used by eight of the top ten pharmaceutical companies, this has allowed an ‘even earlier assessment of compounds’ potential effects on cardiac contractility’\[S7; S8\]. As the Senior Director of UCB states, ‘pharmaceutical companies of all sizes’ can now make these savings, ‘with no reduction in confidence in the compound safety’ \[S4\]. Informed by InoCardia, the collaboration also drove ‘scientific development of Cresset’, which ‘encouraged the company scientists to take a more holistic view of biological issues \[S7; S8\]. 

 InoCardia’s processes, underpinned by CU research, have driven gains in productivity, enhanced processes, and reduced waste. The company have also used their human tissue assay in safety assessments to advocate for technology that reduces and replaces animal use in research: in May 2017 Maddock organised a Safety Pharmacology Society meeting with NC3RS, which provided ‘valuable information’ on how use of ‘human tissue in safety assessment has evolved’, to inform and optimise practice \[S6; S9, p.29\]. InoCardia’s innovative services have helped position the UK as a leader in new drugs development technologies  which reduce animal tissue use, which according to the former Pfizer Head of Global Safety Pharmacology, marks a ‘…new era of drug discovery’ \[S2\]. 

 <ins>Improving Patient Health Outcomes</ins> 

 Further to improving patient health outcomes through improved drugs development, Maddock has also collaborated with University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire \(UHCW\) to support improvements in the detection of cardiac injury in cancer patients. The research which underpins InoCardia’s work has also given ‘important clinical insight and knowledge in relation to therapy induced cardiac toxicity’ in a clinical setting \[S10\].  It has ‘provided fundamental scientific knowledge, research culture and support’ to practitioners at UHCW, resulting in institutional change represented by the creation of a ‘new and important collaborative multi\-disciplinary Cardio\-Oncology team between Oncology and Cardiology colleagues’ \[S10\]. This has driven ‘beneficial changes’ in the clinicians’ abilities ’to undertake research and improve clinical patient outcomes’, as there was previously little formal collaboration between cancer treatment teams and cardiac health specialists, despite the negative responses the heart can have to radiotherapy \[S10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Parkinson’s research has underpinned the academic development strategy, methods, and reach of the Council for At\-Risk Academics’ Syria Programme since March 2017, improving the academic capacity, connectedness, well\-being, and professional identity of hundreds of Syrian academics living in exile in Turkey. Participants have gained research and teaching capacity, and built networks through a programme of research\-informed activities. Since 2017, participants have submitted over 100 grant applications, published 30 peer\-reviewed outputs, and established independent Syrian\-led entities such as the Gaziantep\-based CSO Academic Centre for Development and Peace Studies. Dozens of participating Syrian academics in exile who continue to teach inside Syria are improving their teaching skills and enhancing Syrian higher education for thousands of Syrian learners.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since **March 2017**, Dr Tom Parkinson has led on a programme of action research with Syrian and UK academics participating in the Council for At\-Risk Academics \(Cara\) Syria Programme. Cara launched its Syria Programme \(Cara SP\) in Turkey in late 2016 to provide support to Syrian academics in the Middle East region affected by the Syria crisis, and its capacity\-building activities began in March 2017. Most Syrian academics forced into exile in Turkey, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the region have a strong desire to play a vital role in the future rebuilding of Syria and its HE and research sectors, but for now they urgently need opportunities to work, connect, and develop professionally **\[R4, R5\]**. 

 Action research seeks not only to understand but also to address real\-world problems and improve stakeholders’ situations through cycles of planning, action, and reflective evaluation. At Cara’s request, Parkinson and his colleagues have developed innovative participatory methods and action research frameworks to understand the academic development needs, priorities, and challenges of hundreds of Syrian academics living in exile in Turkey, and directly address these through the delivery of community development and capacity\-building activities on the Syria Programme **\[R3, R4, R5\]**. 

 Through Cara\-commissioned research reported in **\[R3\]**, Parkinson and colleagues \(McDonald and Quinlan\) elicited five key priority areas for Syrian academics in exile: 

1.  *Responsibility* towards Syria, the scientific community, their dependents, and themselves. Syrian exiled academics embody the country’s intellectual heritage and expertise. Research participants felt a great sense of responsibility towards younger generations of Syrian learners, and wished to participate in Syria’s rebuilding; 

1.  *Disciplinarity*: Working within and contributing to one’s discipline; 

1.  *Teaching:* Skills and approaches relevant to teaching in the Syrian context, both inside the country and in refugee and diaspora communities; 

1.  *Research:* Skills, resources, and opportunities; 

1.  *Collaboration* **:** Finding opportunities to participate in international academia and develop collaborative projects. 

 These five priority areas **\[R3\]** were directly used to guide the agenda, strategy, and delivery of the Cara SP’s academic development programme. Between **2017** and **2020**, workshops, mentoring, and online activities have been designed to target the self\-identified needs of participants. This programme of ongoing research **\[R3, R4, R5\]** has also generated rich insights into programme participants’ experiences of displacement and conflict; the impact displacement and conflict have had on Syrian academics’ work and community; and the implications for Syria’s intellectual future. Playing a leading role in Cara SP planning and delivery as chair of the Academic Development steering group and a lead facilitator of residential workshops, Parkinson has worked with Syrian and UK\-based colleagues to identify additional areas of concern that subsequent research has responded to directly. This research has included: 

1.  *Comparative experiences of higher education in \(post\-\)conflict and refugee contexts*. Through analysis of group processes, focus groups, and interview data collected from Cara SP participants, in **2018\-19,** Parkinson established that Syrian academics had a desire to connect with and learn from international counterparts who had experienced similar circumstances. In response, Parkinson secured GCRF funding and organised \(with Cara SP Director Kate Robertson\) and co\-chaired \(with Dr Juliet Millican, ICS\) a series of roundtables at the Swedish Consulate in Istanbul in **June 2019**. These roundtables brought together researchers from seven international contexts to explore how to sustain academic work and community under conditions of conflict, exile, or displacement. This dialogue revealed both commonalities and stark differences between international contexts that impact on academics’ work and well\-being. It also highlighted the affordances of international collectivism and solidarity in supporting beleaguered academic communities **\[R2\]**. 

1.  *Reconnecting Syrian academics in exile with learners in Syria*. Parkinson and colleagues’ \(Abdullateef and Sarmini\) **2018** evaluation of the use of blended technologies to teach emergency agricultural engineering methods **\[R1\]** led to a model for collaboration between NGOs, Syrian academics in exile, civil society, and community groups to support higher education delivery in Syria. 

1.  *Collaborative research and research writing in global North–South partnerships*. To build research capacity and international networks, Syrian researchers on the Cara SP have been paired with UK or international academics to conduct collaborative research since **June 2018**. Through analysis of research\-group dynamics, and the role of different types of expertise in the research\-writing process, Parkinson and colleagues \(Heron, Alajaj, Khuder\) identified effective strategies for collaborative research writing **\[R6\]**, resulting in evidence\-based models for writing support that have underpinned the design of several writing workshops, including a **2020** British Academy\-funded GCRF Writing Workshop.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since its first academic development activities in **March 2017**, Parkinson and his colleagues’ collaborative action research has directly underpinned the agenda, strategy, design, and delivery of the Cara SP, for which Parkinson chairs the Academic Development Steering Group. Parkinson and colleagues’ research and engagement in this field have led to the development of multiple capacity\-building, academic development, and community development practices. Below are identified some of the key benefits that have arisen as a result, and which have supported hundreds of Syrian academics to continue their academic work whilst improving their well\-being and professional identity **\[a\]**. 

 **Advancing Cara SP’s Strategy, Methods, and Reach** 

 Between **2017** and **2020**, the number of international academics contributing to the Cara SP’s academic development activities has grown from eight to over 200, and the Cara SP cohort from 29 to over 400, with 160 regularly active participants **\[a, j\]**. Cara’s Executive Director, Stephen Wordsworth, praised the ‘transformative practices that have stemmed from Tom’s research’, asserting that ‘the action research that Tom has led has been instrumental in helping Cara to develop a strategy for the Syria Programme, and indeed a model for future comparable programmes \[and\] has played a critical part in advancing our understanding of Syrian academic needs and challenges, and in the development of the Programme’s methods and practice’ **\[a\]**. Similarly, in reference to the needs analysis undertaken by Parkinson and colleagues reported in **\[R3\]** and **\[R4\]**, the Cara SP’s independent evaluator applauded the ‘innovative processes \[used\] to identify \[…\] academic skills needs and participant priorities’ **\[i\]**, and confirmed that ‘\[the Cara SP\] has achieved significant results in terms of its intended outputs and towards outcomes. The programme improved skills and networks among Syrian academics and in particular succeeded in its intention to enable academic engagement by Syrian academics in exile in Turkey’ **\[j\]**. 

 **Improving Syrian Academics’ Well\-Being and Professional Identity** 

 Through a programme of activities targeted towards the priorities identified in Parkinson, McDonald, and Quinlan’s research **\[R3\],** the Cara SP has contributed to exiled Syrian academics’ greater sense of well\-being, belonging, and identity. As highlighted by Wordsworth: ‘participants attest to the transformative impact of the Syria Programme on their self\-efficacy, research and teaching capacities, professional opportunities, community cohesion and overall well\-being, enhancing their work as educators and researchers in both Turkish and non\-regime\-controlled universities in Northern Syria’ **\[a\]**. Participants have described the Cara SP as ‘a light in a very dark tunnel’: ‘I feel I am an academic again. I \[now\] have networks with other colleagues in the UK and even in Syria’; ‘I have felt reborn. This programme helps me to work in a team and improve my academic skills, especially in \[...\] scientific writing so I can prepare my work for publication’; ‘It encouraged me to work, to write something. To feel about myself as an academic. I had lost that feeling’ **\[b\]**. 

 **Building Syrian Academics’ International and Cross\-Sectoral Networks** 

 Since **2017**, Parkinson and his colleagues’ research has raised the profile of Syrian academia and the Cara SP, stimulating the growth of an international network of more than 200 academics, including experts and stakeholders in the fields of displacement and \(post\-\)conflict higher education. Wordsworth confirmed that ‘Tom’s publications and research presentations to universities and professional bodies have contributed to the in\-kind support from which the Programme has benefited \[…\] valued at well over £1 million’, adding that ‘Tom continues to apply the findings of his research to drive access to opportunity for marginalised Syrian academics’ **\[a\]**. As an example, Wordsworth highlighted that, in **2019**, Parkinson ‘secured GCRF funding \[…\] to support a four\-day roundtable held in June 2019 in lstanbul \[bringing\] academics together with academics from Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kenya, Northern lreland, Palestine, Serbia, and South Africa. \[…\]. ln his role as chair for the first two days, Tom contributed his research\-led expertise to this unique forum for knowledge\-sharing between international academics, joined by regional and international NGOs and UN agencies, an event and opportunity that was highly valued by participants informing attendees' organisational practice, helping to build solidarity and community for a growing international and cross\-sectoral alliance in support of Syrian academics’ **\[a\]**. 

 **Advancing the Syrian Academic Community, Partnerships, and Research Capacity** 

 Independent evaluator Teresa Hanley asserted that the Cara SP has ‘increased visibility of the Syrian participants to academia, policy makers and practitioners’ **\[j\]**, and that these encounters have catalysed a number of collaborations and initiatives that ‘move beyond the Cara Syria Programme’s direct activities to more sustainable academic engagement and indeed livelihoods’ **\[j\].** Hanley noted in particular that the roundtables in June 2019 had ‘brought participants together with international and local humanitarian responders to the Syria Crisis and academics from other parts of the world’, and that ‘participants interviewed noted their appreciation, particularly of the chance to discuss higher education development and other conflict\-affected countries’ experience’ **\[j\].** Following advice and encouragement from delegates at the research\-led round tables **\[c\],** several Cara SP academics established the Academic Centre for Development and Peace Studies \(ACDP\), a Syrian\-led civil society organisation and academic consortium in Gaziantep, Turkey, in **December 2019**. ACDP Co\-Director Shaher Abdullateef attested to the impact of the roundtables in creating the impetus for ACDP: ‘\[At the round tables\] we heard different cases \[from\] Belarus, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kenya, Northern Ireland, Palestine, Serbia and South Africa. It was very useful to develop ideas about how to organise \[…\] and what to do as a first step. \[…\] we finally established \[ACDP\] as a space to collect \[...\] and to conduct research relative to Syria context. The idea of empowering Syrian academics \[and\] rais\[ing\] their voices is older than two years \[but\] I wasn’t sure if this is the right way to do it. During the event we Syrian participants were more confident, and the way to connect \[with\] and involve \[…\] international academia was clearer, especially \[with\] great encouragement from the international participants.’ **\[c\]** Co\-Director Fateh Shaban meanwhile asserted that ‘the invaluable support that the Cara Syria Programme has provided to Syrian academics in exile \[…\] has helped us to sustain a working academic network and establish formal organisations such as our Centre, which now serves as a hub through which Syrian academics can access professional and research opportunities and engage effectively with stakeholders in Syria and in diaspora. \[…\] The directors of ACDP began our collaboration on the Cara Syria Programme, and our network of affiliate members comprises many Syrian Programme participants, as well as international experts whom we met at Cara’s Roundtables funded by the University of Kent in 2019’ **\[d\]**. 

 Evidence–based capacity building and support models developed by Parkinson and colleagues \(e.g. **\[R4, R6\]**\) have been implemented at several residential retreats and regular online events in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These have supported Syrian academics in writing over 100 grant applications; publishing over 30 peer\-reviewed outputs as authors or co\-authors \(2017\-20\) **\[a\]**, and attaining internationally recognised teaching fellowships **\[e\]**. 

 **Supporting Syrian Higher Education** 

 Parkinson’s and colleagues’ research to inform the Cara SP’s academic development strategy **\[R3, R4\]** has enhanced Syrian teaching and learning through targeted CPD for academics teaching in Turkey and in northern Syria **\[a\]**. Abdullateef, Parkinson, and Sarmini’s research **\[R1\]** has enabled and enhanced distance teaching for learners in conflict\-affected regions of northern Syria, delivered by exiled academics. For example, Rahmet Relief Foundation \(a regional NGO\) noted that this research **\[R1\]** has directly ‘enabled effective delivery of vital agricultural knowledge to learners in Syria, which has greatly benefitted \[…\] stakeholders \[whilst also\] providing vital insight for others offering similar interventions’ **\[f\]**. Another NGO partner, Shafak, declared that this research had led to ‘refinement of educational delivery models that now ensure sustainable knowledge and support to learners and professionals, online, offline and through physical learning tools’ **\[g\]**. Furthermore, learners in northern Syria reported that the educational interventions developed through Parkinson’s and colleagues’ research provided an invaluable source of specialist training, and ‘expressed their appreciation of this learning and its value to their education and livelihoods’ **\[g\]**. One participant noted: ‘\[It\] helped me to review the knowledge on protected agriculture that I took during my studies which were cut off, and also increased my knowledge about methods and areas of use of aquaculture’ \[h\]**. Shafak’s CEO, Omar Atik, stated that these interventions were ‘building hope, community and solidarity’ \[g\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **De Liddo’s** research on the theories and methods required to harvest the Collective Intelligence \(CI\) of large numbers of people has developed new technologies which public sector organisations, educators, broadcasters and NGOs have used to engage people to participate in decision\-making. Through these tools, **De Liddo’s** work has: 

-  Equipped more than 800 UK Health Visitors with a tool to enhance their professional practice; 

-  Enabled more than 1,300 school and university teachers in Brazil to engage in online collaborative learning; 

-  Promoted citizen engagement with political election debates in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 UK General Elections; 

-  Supported peace building education in Rwanda after the 1994’s genocide.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **De Liddo’s** research explores the socio\-technical theories, methods and tools required to harvest the Collective Intelligence \(CI\) of large numbers of globally distributed people to work together to solve complex societal challenges. Her work creates intuitive, easy to use tools which engage people in useful, unbiased, and democratic conversations that lead to intelligent group behaviours and actions to address critical issues, such as climate change, democratic and health crises. These technologies also produce a wealth of structured data on which De Liddo conducts advanced computational and visual analyses of sensemaking, the process by which people make sense of their collective experience. 

 In a 2012 article **\[O1\]**, **De Liddo** argued that a new type of collective intelligence was necessary to help people collectively to make sense of and co\-create innovative solutions to complex societal challenges, to which there is no single correct answer. This Contested Collective Intelligence \(CCI\) approach enables large scale deliberation between distributed users. It applies advanced computational methods, such as Natural Language Processing and argumentation mining, to structure and analyse online written dialogue between individuals and identify both stated and unstated points of agreement. It creates opportunities for collective sensemaking by enabling people to visualise and reflect on each other’s ideas and arguments. 

  

 **De Liddo** applied the approach to a prototype visual tool, named Cohere, which allowed users to create, mark\-up, connect and share ideas online. Her 2014 publication **\[O2\]** evidenced that i\) showing people a visualisation of their online dialogue and ii\) structuring their interactions through the social process of argumentation, which encourages people to reach conclusions through logical reasoning, could successfully support large scale decision\-making. 

 In a subsequent article **\[O3\]**, **De Liddo** further defined this novel research agenda on deliberation technologies in the field of collective intelligence, establishing a critical set of research challenges, such as “ *summarising the state and content of deliberation to promote engagement and deepen understanding; generating collective creative solutions; and translating proposals into commitments to action*”. 

 Between 2013 and 2015, **De Liddo** led a European Commission\-funded GBP2.25 million CATALYST research programme and a health innovation project funded by the Burdett Trust for Nursing \(200K\) to apply her CCI approach to develop and test three new tools. The first, The Evidence Hub, built on Cohere’s argumentation data model to enable online communities of practice to gather and debate ideas and solutions to specific community issues. The second tool, LiteMap, used collaborative knowledge mapping, web annotation and argumentation technology to enable users to visualise debates online. The tool provides crucial support to brainstorming, creative ideation and idea structuring. Finally, DebateHub directly facilitates group decision\-making by supporting online campaigns. Through these, users collectively propose, debate and select new ideas to tackle open challenges. 

 **De Liddo** continued this research theme during the 2013 to 2016 EPSRC\-funded Election Debate \(EDV\) Visualisation project. The GBP284,000 programme examined how CCI technologies could improve citizen engagement and sensemaking during political elections. 

 EDV produced a novel technology for advanced video replays of televised UK election debates, named Democratic Replay. It also created a new method and interactive tool to harness audience feedback on live political debates at scale, called Democratic Reflection. This interactive web app consists of a grid of coloured flashcards. Each represents a short statement the viewer would like to express during debates, such as “ *This is a strong argument*”, or “ *This is getting interesting, I love this\!*”, or “ *Even if what he says is true I do not trust him*”. Democratic Reflection records, aggregates and automatically analyses users’ feedback to produce personal learning analytics that they can explore at the end of the debate. Research findings from live and lab tests demonstrated these civic technologies’ value in supporting citizens in the complex sensemaking process of political choice. Crucially, they indicate that innovative discourse\-based CI tools are effective instruments to promote critical thinking and shift political opinion **\[O4, O5, O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Equipping UK’s Health Visitors with a tool to collectively enhance their professional practice** 

 In 2014, the UK’s professional body for health visitors, the Institute of Health Visiting \(iHV\) adopted The Evidence Hub, based on **De Liddo’s** research **\[O1\-O3\]**, to create its e\-Community of Practice Evidence Hub \(HVeCOP\). The platform allows health visitors to raise issues, access a wide variety of resources and discuss practices to improve the children and families’ health. Approximately 776 of the specially\-trained UK nurses and midwives who support young children and their families have since used the tool to systematically capture and harness evidence of good practice **\[C1**, p.3 **\]**. This community has also used the Evidence Hub to discuss 137 issues, propose 76 changes to health visiting practice, share 379 resources and foster a network of 39 organisations **\[C1**, pp.5\-9 **\]**. Writing about the technology on the iHV’s website, health visitors have described the hub as “ *a fantastic resource”,* which provides *“support through a robust and substantive network headed by a small team of Champions from the Institute”* **\[C1**, p.10 **\]**. 

 In a January 2021 letter, a prominent iHV Fellow explained how “ *the EH platform enables a process of evidence\-building to be followed, from posing a question or problem, to discussing the question, providing resources, case examples and sharing scientific papers*”. This, they explain, allows the classification of evidence “ *into topic areas that were instantly relevant to health visitors*” **\[C1**, pp.2\-3 **\]**. The iHV fellow also describes how health visitors could use the software “during an encounter with parents if a question came up that needed shared decision making”, and how it allows them “ *to record their interventions on the platform as CPD \[Continuous Professional Development\]*”. It also creates “ *a mechanism for archiving evidence that could be used to influence policy as well as practice*” **\[C1**, p.3 **\]**. They believe the Evidence Hub “ *has addressed issues of health care and health visiting practice that, in tandem with research and policy development, have led to more open dialogue with service users \(Parents\) and an opportunity to present evidence to public health commissioners*” **\[C1**, p.4 **\]**. 

 An independent evaluation of the tool **\[C2\]** suggests that the hub is also a useful resource that complements agile and paperless working. A health visitor and Evidence Hub user, reflecting on the mobile nature of her working practice, notes that they “ *have now been issued tablets as part of our agile and paperless working future \[…\]. In my future practice in my car or in Tesco as a mobile worker I will no longer have that luxury \[of knowing where my team members are\]. Yes, I could phone my colleagues, but I won't know if they are with a family, on the phone or driving. The evidence hub will be able to fill that void and become my first resource*” **\[C2**, p.438 **\]**. 

 **Enabling online collaborative learning in Brazil** 

 In 2015, the Brazilian open research community, COLEARN, translated **De Liddo’s** LiteMap technology into Portuguese. It drew on her research **\[O1\-O3\]** to build an online network to enable approximately 1,346 schoolteachers and researchers from 5 universities and 319 local schools across Brazil to collaborate and coordinate online course activities **\[C3**, pp.7\-8 **\]**. Using LiteMap, the community advanced many projects, such as encouraging 1,473 learners to coordinate with 36 research educators to develop collaborative knowledge maps about genetically modified foods **\[C4**, p.42 **\]**. It also used the LiteMap tool for undergraduate\-led inquiry and professional development of teaching staff. In feedback collected during a European project with the same community, called ENGAGE, teachers acknowledged “ *the discussion supported by technologies increased students’ participation*”. They also noted that the “ *tasks introduced helped students generate more questions and arguments, resulting in very reflective interaction in the classroom*” **\[C4**, p.43 **\]**. A comprehensive review of the ENGAGE project demonstrated that **De Liddo’s** LiteMap technology improved collaborative online learning experiences by enabling the systematic gathering, mapping and visualisation of individual students’ contributions to various online dialogues **\[C3\]**. For instance, students used LiteMap to share questions, ideas, arguments, counterarguments, data and facts, to systematise their evidence\-based opinions about reducing the Zika virus. Litemap also increased students’ awareness of both Zika’s spread and the importance of fostering scientific literacy **\[C3**, p.11 **\]**. The review shows that LiteMap was successfully used alongside mainstream social media tools such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Hangout, to promote Responsible Research and Innovation \(RRI\) through open education, and fostered the second largest community of RRI adopters in Brazil, after Facebook **\[C3**, table 2, p.8 **\]**. 

 **Promoting citizen engagement in political election debates in the UK** 

 One of the UK’s leading broadcasters, ITV, trialled the Democratic Reflection tool **\[O4, O5\]** with a representative panel of 242 UK voters, during its 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2015 televised debate between all seven UK political party leaders, ahead of that year’s 7<sup>th</sup> May general election **\[C5\]**. In feedback collected during the trial, these panel members either agreed or strongly agreed that the tool made them “ *really focus on the debate*” \(79.8%\) **\[C6**, p.13 **\]**. Crucially, 56% also agreed that the experience with Democratic Reflection defined how “ *they would like to be involved in political election debates in the future*” **\[C6**, p.17 **\]**. ITV repeated the exercise during leaders debates before the June 2017 and December 2019 UK general elections **\[C7\]**. Citizens who used the technology during the 2017 elections said that the platform’s personal analytics altered how they looked at specific political leaders: "" *I came into this group more or less decided on what I was going to vote for, but the statistics completely changed my mind, so that helped""; “When I came in I was a conservative. But my analytics showed Jeremy Corbyn on top, I was so surprised\!”; “To someone who's really undecided on who to vote for, it is quite interesting to see what my reactions were \[…\] I was a bit like oh, right. Okay, so obviously I agree with what they're saying. Maybe I need to go back and look at their manifesto and read it all through again”* **\[C8\]**. Meanwhile, approximately 70% of the 69\-strong undecided UK voters who took part in 2019 agreed that Democratic Reflection “ *helped them reflect on the debate in a deeper way*” and 65% agreed that watching the debate with the tool “ *changed some initial assumptions they had before the debate*” **\[C6**, pp.31\-32 **\]**. 

 **Supporting peace education in Rwanda** 

 In March 2019, UK\-based NGO, The Aegis Trust, which works on the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities worldwide, used the Democratic Reflection tool **\[O4, O5\]** to engage a community of 50 teachers and young people. Part of the Isôoko project, which uses digital technologies to support peace education, the initiative encouraged participants to actively listen and reflect on a video, called “Ubumuntu”, which tells a range of stories that relate to the 1994 Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. Democratic Reflection helped users connect to the accounts personally and challenge their prior assumptions **\[C9**, p.2 **\]**. 

 In a December 2019 interview with **De Liddo**, the Aegis Trust Digital Resources and Comms Manager for Rwanda explained how Democratic Reflection gave the trust “ *the power of knowing what's going on in the people they train*” **\[C10**, p. 4, line 1 **\]**. They describe it as a tool to “ *increase value in terms of engagement*” with peace building efforts, which “ *gives content producers the possibility of learning from people who are actually using their content”* **\[C10**, p.2, last paragraph; p.3, line 9 **\]**.  Speaking of the tool’s role in peace education, they noted “ *you can only achieve \[peace education\] if individually people are connected, and people are really reflecting on their role in society. That is something Democratic Reflection \[…\] was really promoting”* **\[C10**, p.5, line 11 **\]**. They also reported very positive feedback from both parents and young people. Young people in particular recognized the tool’s capability to promote reflection and capture emotional reactions **\[C10**, p. 4, last paragraph; p.5, second paragraph **\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 International Large\-Scale Assessments \(ILSAs\) collect comparable data on education to enable policy analysis in over 100 countries.  However, the validity and relevance of the data they produce has been questioned. Since 2017, Research at University of Bath has: 

1.  Improved the validity and relevance of results for two major international large\-scale assessments in education through improved technical procedures: the UNESCO’s Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study across 19 Latin American Countries; and UNICEF’s Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics across 6 countries. 

1.  Developed the measuring and monitoring strategy for the Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\) on sustainability and social justice in Education \(SDG 4.7\). This has been adopted and used across all UN member states as a result of improved confidence in the validity and comparability of that data. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 When UN member states adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\), for 2030, there was little discussion about how to measure progress toward these goals. Deciding on a measurement strategy for all SDGs has become a pressing issue. International Large\-Scale Assessments \(ILSAs\) in Education were considered the most suitable source of information to measure and monitor progress. ILSAs offer information from more than 100 education systems, provide high coverage of the indicators included in the SDGs framework, and have unrivalled data quality assurance mechanisms. The scale of ILSAs is a strength and weakness. As national participation in ILSAs has grown, it has become more difficult to produce information that is strictly comparable across countries. For example, constructs like socioeconomic status are traditionally estimated using items such as parental education, parental occupational status or household items. But it is not clear to what extent such constructs can be validly compared across countries. 

  

 Research into the application of ILSAs to support measurement of SDGs began in 2018 when the Director of the Global Education Monitoring Report \(GEMR\) approached Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez to write one of the Background Papers for the GEMR 2019 \[S1\] on this issue. The main objective of the paper \[R1\] was to evaluate whether any ILSA could be used to monitor specific aspects of SDG Target 4.7 which relates to sustainability, citizenship and social justice. The GEMR 2019 report concluded that there is evidence of a good fit between concepts evaluated in the International Civic and Citizenship Study and those included in SDG 4.7 \[R1\]. However, the main limitation listed in the background paper was the lack of evidence to evaluate the cross\-cultural comparability of the scales used to operationalise these indicators. From these initial results two research strands were developed: 

 **A technical strand** focusing on the cross\-cultural comparability of ILSAs background scales. Research under this strand had two main objectives: 

1.  Establishing the extent to which constructs reported by ILSAs are validly comparable across countries; 

1.  Developing a statistical method to evaluate cross\-cultural comparability in ILSAs. 

 Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez began publishing on cross\-cultural comparability in 2017, in relation to the development and operationalisation of a theoretical model of young citizen participation, using nationally representative data from 38 countries that participated in an International Civic and Citizenship Study \(ICCS\).The paper used multigroup confirmatory factor analysis to establish the comparability of the resulting scales at different levels and discussed how this procedure improves the validity of this type of analysis \[R2\]. This was followed in 2019 and 2020 by \[R3\] and \[R4\], where the procedure to evaluate cross\-cultural comparability within ILSAs was further refined and expanded. Initial research focused on socioeconomic background scales in three additional ILSAs: the Programme for International Student Assessment \(PISA\), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study \(TIMSS\) and the Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study \(ERCE\), and outlined a step\-by\-step procedure to evaluate the comparability of scales considering the complex assessment and complex sampling design characteristic of ILSA data \[R3\]. Building on the statistical method proposed in R2 and R3 the research was expanded to evaluate cross\-cultural comparability within geographical regions or culturally relevant groups of countries \[R4\]. 

 **An operational strand** focusing on the use of ILSAs to measure and monitor the achievement of SDG Target 4.7. The 2018 Background Paper \[R1\] for the GEMR 2019 report led the UNESCO Institute for Statistics \(UIS\) to commission Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez to conduct additional research in 2018 that led to two additional reports. The first, developed a proposal for a Measurement Strategy for Thematic Indicators using ILSA data \[R5\], which was accepted by the *Global Alliance to Monitor Learning* \(GAML\) in November 2019 \[S2\]; the second \[R6\], produced a set of scores that refer to knowledge about global citizenship and sustainability and attitudes/behaviours towards gender equality, multiculturality, human rights, freedom of expression, social justice \(thematic indicators 4.7.4,4.7.5\) available through UNESCO’s official data repository \[S9\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez’s research at University of Bath has had a significant impact on two main areas: 

 a\) it has improved the technical procedures to process data and report results from two major international large\-scale assessments \(ILSAs\) in education, UNESCO’s Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study and UNICEF’s Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics. These improvements are crucial for assessing and trusting country claims, for example, in relation to progress on equality and social justice in education \(Sustainable and Development Goal 4\). In turn this enables countries to learn from each other’s policies. 

 b\) it has informed and shaped the understanding and the decision\-making process of those responsible for measuring and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals in Education in UN member states. 

 **Improving Technical procedures in ILSAs **to enhance validity and relevance** 

 The Global Education Monitoring Report in 2018 \[R1\], in which Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez points to the importance of testing and reporting cross\-cultural comparability of hypothetical constructs, generated widespread interest among the ILSA research and policy community. This, along with Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez’s previous work in this area \[R2, R3\], led to his appointment on the Technical Advisory Boards of two major large\-scale assessments in education; UNESCO’s Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study \(ERCE\) and UNICEF’s Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics \(SEA\-PLM\). These assessments help to measure learning outcomes to inform policy making and accelerate progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 4. The two international assessments have adopted the concepts and procedures that Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez developed concerning the evaluation of measurement invariance \[R2, R3, R4\]: 

 *UNESCO’s Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study* 

 In 2018, Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez was appointed as Senior Adviser of the UNESCO’s Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study \(ERCE\) \[S3\].  The ERCE study was carried out across 19 Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay \[S3\] starting in 2018 and results will be published in July 2021.  The Technical Report presented to the ERCE Steering Committee \[S5\] in 2018 to kick off the study, widely cited Sandoval\-Hernandez’s research \[R3\], stating “ *Sandoval and colleagues’ invariance proposal \(2018\) was implemented to evaluate the comparability of the measurement models across the participant countries \[…\]*” \(S5, page 4 paragraph 7\).  UNESCO’s Specialist in Measurement and Evaluation of Education stated that “ *Sandoval’s academic expertise, underpinned by his research \(see above \[R2,R3\]\), played a crucial role in shaping and improving the procedures that we currently implement to evaluate and report cross\-cultural comparability which, in turn, increased the trust of the different stakeholders in the validity of ERCE’s results*”\[S3\].  “ *The main benefit is the improvement of the validity of the data provided by ERCE \[…\] policymakers are secure in their cross\-country comparisons, for example, when it is claimed that a country has more or less effective policies in terms of educational inequalities”* \[S3\]. 

 *UNICEF’s Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics* 

 In 2019, Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez was appointed as Co\-Chair of the Technical Advisory Group to UNICEF’s Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics \(SEA\-PLM\) to provide independent advice on methodology and technical oversight to ensure high\-quality reliable data \[S4\]. SEA\-PLM was developed to “ *better measure and understand the status of children’s learning achievement by applying culturally appropriate metrics to learning outcomes associated with reading, writing, mathematics, and global citizenship*” \[S6\].  SEA\-PLM 10th Regional Steering Committee Meeting Report held in 2019 \[S6\] notes the input of the Technical Advisory Group, specifically around the preparation and use of regional and national results. UNICEF’s Educational Specialist specifically acknowledges the co\-chair’s contributions “ *\[..\] and Dr. Andres Sandoval for the substantial role they played during the meeting and they will continue to play during the next steps*” \[p13, S6\].  SEA\-PLM was implemented across 6 countries \[S4\] Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam and this equates to approximately 5,500,000  pupils and 1,000 educational officials and teachers benefitting from SEA\-PLM \[p3,S8\]. 

  

 **Informing decision making around the measurement and monitoring of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Education \(4**. **7**\) 

 Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez’s paper for the Global Education Monitoring Report \[R1\] in 2018 demonstrated the potential of international large\-scale assessments \(ILSAs\) to measure specific aspects of the UN’s SDGs. This resulted in the UNESCO Institute for Statistics asking Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez to develop a proposal for measuring elements of SDG 4.7 \(4.7.1, 4.7.4 and 4.7.5\) on sustainability and social justice with ILSA data \[R5\]. This proposal was then taken to the GAML 6th Meeting of the Technical Cooperation Group in Yerevan, in August 2019 \[S2\]. The attendees to this meeting, which included high profile educational policymakers from countries representing all regions, and international organisations such as the European Commission, the World Bank, UNICEF, OECD and the Global Partnership for Education \[S2\], voted Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez’s proposal as the best option to measure targets 4.7.4 and 4.7.5. 

 This support led to the commissioning of new research \[R6\] that implemented his proposal to produce data to monitor the proportion of students who achieve the targets within and across countries. The methodological strategy and findings \[R6\] are available on UNESCO’s official data repository website \[S9\]. 

 The Director of Statistical Information at the Italian Institute for the Evaluation of Education and Training stated “ *the work of Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez on SDGs provided a sound framework and a robust methodology that made it possible to report the progress of Italy on Targets 4.7.4 and 4.7.5*.” \[S7\] and “ *This was not previously possible due to the lack of internationally comparable data produced using sound framework and robust methodology*” \[S7\]. 

 The former Director of Educational Evaluation Projects at the Mexican Institute for the Evaluation of Education stated that “ *Dr Sandoval’s work saved invaluable resources to the Institute by offering a strategy to use existing data to measure the extent to which global citizenship education and education for sustainable development, including gender equality and human rights, are mainstreamed in the Mexican education system in an internationally comparable fashion \(SDG 4.7.4 and  4.7.5\)*” \[S10\]. 

 Dr Sandoval\-Hernandez's measurement and monitoring strategy is now being used by all the UN member states.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Reichold co\-developed and patented advanced Frequency Scanning Interferometry \(FSI\). Initially this technology underpinned the operation of the ATLAS detector at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, and ultimately it became the world’s most accurate commercial instrument for absolute distance measurement. Prof. Reichold commercialised the technology through collaboration with Etalon, who manufacture and sell the Absolute Multiline product for industrial and scientific applications with sales in excess of GBP3,000,000. The technology’s data acquisition elements have been further developed in collaboration with VadaTech UK, who now produce the MicroTCA\-based \(Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture\) DAQ \(Data Acquisition\) system, which includes a novel optical receiver circuit board developed at Oxford Physics. Manufacturing companies using Absolute Multiline have benefitted from the significantly improved manufacturing accuracy that this system enables. Furthermore, industrial metrology standards have been improved through its deployment at national standards laboratories \(NPL, PTB, le cnam, INRiM\), thus benefitting a wide range of organisations by improved calibration. The success of this technology has influenced European National Metrology Institutes \(NMI\) to devote significant resources to explore how industry can maximally benefit from further FSI development.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **ATLAS Silicon Tracking Detector** \(SCT, 2003 – 2007\): 

 A metrology system of sub\-micron accuracy was required to monitor the positions of components of the semiconductor tracker at the Large Hadron Collider. To satisfy the extreme constraints imposed by the environment of a particle physics collider experiment, it had to be very small, low\-mass, passive, radiation\-hard, inexpensive, and able to simultaneously monitor 842 distances remotely. To meet this need, the Oxford ATLAS group proposed, developed, constructed and installed \[1,3\] an extremely scalable FSI system. To achieve this, they made essential advances in FSI technology: they developed a highly efficient data\-acquisition system, and a new technique for manufacturing miniature reflectors and launch optics. 

 **Linear Collider Alignment and Survey** \(LiCAS, 2002 – 2009\): 

 This project developed a robotic survey system for the 35km tunnel of a future linear collider \(ILC\). Reichold proposed the Rapid Tunnel Reference Surveyor \(RTRS\) – a short train of measurement cars that can rapidly and automatically determine the 3D positions of a network of reference markers with sufficient accuracy to determine the straightness of the accelerator to 200 microns over any 600m long segment. This requires a sub\-micron accuracy on individual distance measurements made by the RTRS. One key step was the development by Reichold of a new FSI data analysis technique using Lomb Periodograms allowing simultaneous observation of multiple reflectors in a single interferometer. Other major achievements were the ability to feed light in and read it out through a single fibre. A further novel feature was the use of two lasers which simultaneously scanned their frequencies in opposite directions. This completely eliminated the effect of variations in the measured distance during the measurement, which would otherwise generate errors of about 20 times the size of the drift. Cost efficient beam collimation and the use of Erbium\-doped fibre amplifiers has extended the measurement range to 20 metres.  The improved system provided sufficient capability for 36 simultaneous distance measurements. The RTRS was deployed and tested in a tunnel at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg \[2\]. The RTRS was the instrument that first caught the interest of future industrial collaborator Etalon. 

 **Advanced Metrology Using LasEr Tracers project** \(AMULET, 2010 – 2013\): 

 Following the above two particle and accelerator physics projects, the AMULET project, led by Reichold, then developed a new technique called dynamic FSI to give measurements that were both absolute and traceable \[4\] \(both these attributes are essential for industrial applications\). The project included two partners: The National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\) and Etalon. A major advance was to use the molecular absorption frequencies in a gas cell as the primary traceable frequency standard. The new dynamic\-FSI technique was able to measure distances at a repetition rate of 2.7 MHz \(54,000 time faster than the original ATLAS system\) which enabled its use in high\-speed vibration measurements. The new DAQ system was also much more compact \(more channels per unit volume\) which is of crucial importance for industrial applications. The development of AMULET was the key step that enabled FSI to be used in absolute distance multilateration systems \(multilateration is the measurement of coordinates through distances alone\) which play an essential role in current approaches to large\-volume metrology by National Metrology Institutes. AMULET led directly to the licenses underpinning Absolute Multiline Technology. 

 **FSI Upgrades** \(2014 – 2015\): 

 Oxford Physics manufactured the original DAQ \(Data Acquisition\) systems for Etalon but given increased sales it was no longer feasible to continue manufacture. Applications in accelerators require extended bandwidth with real\-time readout and the capacity for remote management since the DAQ systems are often inaccessible. To address these demands a collaboration with VadaTech UK was established to produce a cost\-efficient multi\-channel DAQ system by combining commercially available µTCA.4 \(micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture\) components with custom optical receiver boards developed at Oxford which transfer data into a host PC via a PCIe bus extension. The increased bandwidth of 67 MHz \(up from 1.3 MHz\) and decreased acquisition time jitter of sub 1 microsecond \(down from several milliseconds\) enables uses in fast real time feedback systems. 

 **Phase Modulation Interferometry** \(PaMIr, 2016 – present\): 

 Phase Modulation Interferometry as developed by PaMIr allows the unambiguous determination of *displacements* \(rather than absolute distance\) using a phase\-modulated laser beam with only a single detection of the interference intensity, and is backward compatible with the FSI hardware. The current Multiline technology has a latency between 0.1 and 1 seconds and can measure targets moving at speeds below 19 mm/s. However, many industrial applications need to measure faster moving targets, and with much lower latency to enable machine tool feedback. FSI already scales cost effectively to multiple simultaneous measurements, and targets located up to several km from the central system can be measured, making it highly attractive for large\-scale deployment, e.g., many CNC \(Computer Numerically Controlled\) machines in a single factory, but it lacks real\-time capability.  Reichold and his team developed the PaMIr method which extends FSI to low\-latency \(1 microsecond\) measurement of highly dynamic targets \(up to 1 m/s\). It preserves the attractive features of FSI, such as simultaneous measurements of many distances with a low cost per measurement channel. This compatibility allows combination of absolute distance measurements via FSI, with tracking high\-speed objects using the PaMIr method. Even if the beams are broken, absolute target positions can be re\-established without needing to return the reflectors to reference positions. This feature results in a substantial reduction in time spent on recovering from errors.

###  Industrial need for FSI Technology 

 In modern industrial societies length measurements are deeply embedded into all production processes. Requirements for range, resolution, speed and absolute accuracy are constantly becoming more stringent. One important and demanding application is the control of CNC mills or lathes.  CNC machining heads move at high speeds \(m/s\). Position control requires rapid, simultaneous measurement to micron resolution of dozens of absolute distances in the sub\-mm to tens of metres range. Commercial FSI has a distance range of 30 m, measurement uncertainty of 0.5 ppm and high sampling rate of 125 MHz on up to 96 simultaneous channels, making it the ideal technology for calibrating CNC machines. Furthermore, FSI sensors are robust \(unaffected by electromagnetic interference\), compact \(no moving parts\), and can be positioned several kilometres from their central electronics. This enables measurements under extremely rough environmental conditions, such as those found in the UK Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre \(NAMRC\) in Sheffield where highly radioactive materials are being processed. Unlike competing conventional interferometers, FSI beams can be interrupted without loss of precision: absolute distance measurement is resumed fractions of a second after an interrupted beam is restored. FSI length measurements are non\-contact and traceable to the SI metre, making this technology highly suitable for in\-situ metrology systems, as piloted at the German national metrology institute, PTB. FSI offers improved accuracy for multilateration compared to traditional sequential kinematic measurements and is being developed by national metrology institutions \(NMIs\) across Europe. 

 In an effort to bring FSI technology into a product form suitable for the largest range of applications and to make it known and available to the maximum range of customers Reichold teamed up with industrial partner Etalon and later also with VadaTech UK. Etalon offers high\-end system solutions for the calibration, monitoring and accuracy enhancement of machines, robots and structures. Etalon customers include companies from mechanical engineering, industrial instrumentation, automotive and aerospace technology and the research sectors. Etalon licensed Oxford’s FSI technology and initially invested EUR200,000 to bring it to the market in the form of Absolute Multiline \[ **A**\], a universal and highly configurable metrology toolkit \[ **B**\]. VadaTech is the world’s largest manufacturer of MicroTCA systems and the only vendor that develops and manufactures all elements of the MicroTCA infrastructure in\-house. Between 2014 and 2018, Oxford, in collaboration with VadaTech, developed the second generation DAQ system for Absolute Multiline on the MicroTCA platform. 

###  Applications of Etalon’s Absolute Multiline \[A\] 

 *Manufacturing industry customers of Absolute Multiline include*: 

-  **Safran Reosc**: Metrology system enabling Safran to measure the absolute shape of mirrors during manufacture of the 900 mirror segments of the primary mirror of the European Extremely Large Telescope with a measurement uncertainty < 20 nm. 

-  **Siemens**: Deformation monitoring of *BorWin Gamma* \(a EUR1,000,000,000 AC to DC offshore converter platform\) during its loading, transfer and deployment from the shipyard in Dubai to an offshore wind park in the North Sea. This ensured that any deformations that could damage the sensitive electrical installations on the platform could be detected and remedied prior to commissioning. 

-  **General Electric**: Gas turbines are highly loaded structures with extremely tight tolerances. Absolute Multiline systems are used to monitor the distortions of turbines in test runs at General Electric to indicate possible problems. 

-  **DMG Pfronten**: Monitoring of thermal deformations of DMG’s CNC machines. 

-  **Heidenhain**: Monitoring of thermal deformation of machine tools and development of new methods for calibration of glass ruler manufacturing. 

 *Research Technology Organisation customers using Absolute Multiline include*: 

-  **UK NARMC \(Nuclear Advanced Materials Research Centre\)**: System used for a facility\-wide metrology network for the calibration and monitoring of large coordinate measurement machines and machine tools for the ultra\-precise manufacturing of large components for the next generation of nuclear reactors. 

-  **PTB \(Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany**\): Purchase used for multiple purposes: \(i\) calibration and monitoring of a test rig for mobile metrology instruments, \(ii\) calibration and monitoring of a large ultra\-precision Co\-ordinate Measuring Machine \(CMM\) and \(iii\) measurements of deformations for a torque test stand for wind energy. 

-  **University of Dresden**: Bought to identify the deformation of robots, machine tools and presses. This purchase allows new approaches for assuring dimensional stability of manufacturing processes \(Industry 4.0\). Industry 4.0 automates traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology and metrology. 

 **Impact on Etalon \[A\]:** Etalon currently holds five licences from Oxford University. Etalon have sold Absolute Multiline products since 2013 with a total value of GBP3,267,000 \(22 individual sales\) of which GBP3,113,000 occurred since August 2013, accounting for 15% of Etalon’s business, supporting three full\-time positions at Etalon. The list price for the products with software ranges between GBP30,000 and GBP430,000 depending on the number of channels and non\-recurring engineering prices for customer specific elements. Since 2015 Etalon have invested GBP240,000 on continual upgrades of the technology in collaboration with us. The success of the Absolute Multiline contributed significantly to the decision of the global Hexagon corporation to acquire Etalon in January 2019. 

 **Impact on VadaTech \[C\]**: Since May 2019 the Absolute Multiline DAQ elements are commercially available and have seen sales of approximately GBP600,000. The Managing Director of VadaTech Ltd describes the impact of our work on VadaTech Ltd in the UK as follows: “ *Due to our collaboration with Oxford Physics, the UK office has been able to drive product development in both USA and Taiwan to meet specific requirements of our European customers.  Since we did not directly fund that development, we gain value from the resulting engineering work. UK\-based product development marks a paradigm shift for VadaTech \[the mother corporation of VadaTech Ltd\] that allows the company to develop product ownership here in the UK, which strengthens UK control of VadaTech’s strategic direction..*. *Business at VadaTech Ltd. derived from our collaboration with Oxford currently supports 50% of one engineering position and led to local manufacturing partnerships that are now proving useful across a wider product range.*” 

 **Further investments to increase impact of FSI, 2018 – present \[A,C\]:** As described at the start of this section, CNC manufacturing machines are the key drivers of metrology requirements in industry. Etalon estimated the potential market share of a suitably enhanced Absolute Multiline technology to be EUR1,000,000 \- EUR2,000,000 per annum by 2024. Although the old Absolute Multiline technology was too slow for real\-time operation \(thus was limited to being used for calibration only\), its inherent scalability, low\-cost front\-end hardware and large channel count made it highly suitable for such an extension. The proof of principle work done in preparation for the PaMIr project and PaMIr’s initial studies convinced our commercial partners to invest in the development of these extensions in 2018. Etalon invested EUR280,000 \(their annual turnover is EUR3,240,000\). Commenting on the PaMIr project, the Managing Director of VadaTech Ltd said, “ *VadaTech has invested GBP103,500 into PaMIr. We are also committed to recruit the project’s senior electronics engineer, now employed at Oxford, at the end of his contract*”. 

 **Influencing Industry via European National Metrology Institutes \(NMI\) \[D\]** 

 One of the key roles of NMIs is the provision of the fundamental data and standardisation processes enabling the traceability of metrological measurements to the SI system of units, which is critical for measurement technologies in industry. NPL is the UK's NMI, developing and maintaining the national primary measurement standards and is a Public Corporation owned by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\). The European NMIs identified FSI as one of the most important themes for Europe’s future Large Volume Metrology \(LVM\), because of its ability to measure the size, location, orientation and shape of large objects, assemblies or machine tools. These are critical requirements in many high value industries where the UK and EU are globally competitive, such as aerospace, automotion, civil engineering, and power generation. LVM is also an underpinning technology used in critical periodic alignment of large advanced science facilities such as those at CERN or ESRF, in preparation for particle beam\-based therapy systems for healthcare, and in the civil engineering and surveying industries. NMIs affirmed the importance of FSI in the current EMPIR \(European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research\) project called  [LaVa](http://empir.npl.co.uk/lava/) \(2018\-2021\) and its successor DynaMITE \(2022\-2025\), both of which focus on FSI as one of the key technologies for future LVM. These projects are the strategic innovation initiatives of European NMIs and address the industrial need for more accurate, large volume coordinate measurements. The Science Area Leader, Dimensional Metrology of NPL, describes the impact of Oxford\-NPL\-Etalon research **\[4\]** on FSI on the strategic direction of European NMIs as follows: “ *The successful outcome of the AMULET project showed us that FSI is an extremely powerful and adaptable measurement technique that is applicable to many scenarios outside the research lab and can easily be made traceable to the SI metre. The positive outcome of AMULET has informed and influenced the decisions of NPL and other European NMIs to focus parts of their research in large volume metrology on those extensions of FSI that would maximally benefit industry needs. More specifically, the FSI related work in LUMINAR focussed on the development of OPTIMUM for industrial applications in, for example, the aerospace industry. DynaMITE will extend this capability to dynamic coordinate measurement for metrology assisted robotic machining and assembly applications. And, LaVA is aiming to provide the most accurate measurements to date of the spectrum of HCN such that it can be ratified by the Consultative Committee for Length as a secondary realisation of the metre, thus enhancing SI traceability of FSI. In another recent development, we have used FSI to make the first measurement of the separation of gridded ion thruster acceleration grids while the thruster is in operation – the so\-called ‘hot gap’. This measurement provided a crucial validation of the theoretical performance of this critical operating parameter which affects the overall efficiency and lifetime of the engine. Our measurement was instrumental in convincing ESA that the ion thrusters developed for the BepiColumbo mission were fit for purpose and would be capable of performing the 14 months continuous deceleration burn on the approach to Mercury*”.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Magmatic ore deposits contain nickel \(Ni\), copper \(Cu\) and platinum\-group elements \(PGE\) that are highly valued for industrial and commercial applications. Cardiff’s geochemical vectoring and petrological strategies for mapping and prospecting these deposits enabled more efficient exploration, which were less invasive to the environment than drilling. This research benefited the following commercial and governmental organisations: 

1.  Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. in South Africa \(PGE\); 

1.  The Geological Survey of Western Australia \(PGE, Ni, Cu\); 

1.  Northern Shield Resources Inc. in Canada \(PGE\). 

 Use of Cardiff’s exploration strategies created financial savings of over £23M and prevented disruption and immense costs of relocating communities, protecting culturally sensitive land and forming unique partnerships with local people in these areas. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Magmatic ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, particularly Platinum\- Group Elements \(PGE\) as well as Chromium \(Cr\), Vanadium \(V\), Nickel \(Ni\), and Copper \(Cu\). PGEs are used in auto catalysts, Cu in electric infrastructure, and Cr, Ni and V are used in the manufacture of steel and batteries. Global energy requirements and climate targets will significantly influence future metal demand and supplies. For example, building the infrastructure underpinning the green economy transition, including key areas of renewable energy production, storage, and electric vehicles, will trigger a >100% increase in demand for many key metals over the next decades \(Vidal et al., 2013, Nature Geoscience, 6, 894\-896\). Similar demand growth is also likely for PGE, in view of their essential use in fuel cells. 

 Maier and McDonald, of the Economic Geology and Geoscience Africa research groups at Cardiff University, have worked with global exploration companies and geological survey organisations over the last 15 years to create new techniques for exploring magmatic ore deposits. This work focussed on mapping, sampling, petrologic\-geochemical characterisation, and genetic interpretation of mineral prospective regions. 

 **2.1 Bushveld Complex, South Africa – Ivanhoe Mines** 

 In South Africa, several new PGE deposits were characterised within the Bushveld Complex, the largest ore belt on Earth, by Maier and McDonald. Specifically, Cardiff research **\[G3.1\]** led to a new model of fluid\-based palladium mobilisation at the Aurora deposit **\[3.1\]**. The research also showed that strongly contaminated reefs at the margins of intrusions can be stratigraphically correlated with uncontaminated reefs within intrusions, and that both types are formed by hydrodynamic processes **\[3.2\]**. 

 The research supported by **\[G3.2\]** and **\[G3.3\]** led to a new exploration model for PGE reefs involving metal concentration in hydrodynamic traps and magma conduits **\[3.2\]**. The ore model was confirmed by the discovery of the ‘Flatreef’ deposit, found beneath existing mine operations and deposits in 2012, and characterised by Maier and colleagues in 2018 **\[3.2\]**. Cardiff research was essential in the decision that further exploration should target hydrodynamic traps in the centre of intrusions **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.2 Musgrave and Albany Fraser ore deposit belts, Western Australia – Geological Survey of Western Australia** 

 Cardiff’s research was instrumental in the first detailed chemical and mineralogical characterisation, and interpretation of the ore forming processes in the Musgrave and Albany Fraser magmatic ore deposit belts \(2012\-2016\). Both are vast, remote territories in Western Australia totalling around 60,000km<sup>2</sup> and are among the least understood and explored domains in the region. At Musgrave, Cardiff researchers were able to identify how long\-lived mantle upwelling and relatively slow cooling rates created the Giles Complex, one of the world’s greatest clusters of layered intrusions **\[3.3\]**. The Giles intrusions are rich in Ni, Cu, V and PGE, concentrated during subsidence of slowly cooling magma chambers and the sagging of cumulate mushes. At Albany Fraser, Cardiff researchers explored the composition of mafic\-ultramafic rocks to determine the magmatic sulphide ore potential of the region **\[3.4\]**. The Fraser zone’s potential as a significant new source for nickel, an essential metal in steel manufacturing and next generation high performance Ni batteries, was acknowledged following Cardiff’s research. 

 **2.3 Labrador Trough, Canada – Northern Shield Resources** 

 Maier began working with Northern Shield Resources in 2007, starting in Ontario but expanding to northern Québec. Northern Shield began focussing their exploration for Ni\-Cu\-PGE in the Labrador Trough, namely the Huckleberry property, in 2014. Despite the apparent prospectivity of the province, exploration of the area remained at a formative stage until Cardiff’s team joined the project. The Cardiff researchers \(Maier and his PhD student Smith\) interpreted the extensive geochemical data generated during the exploration programme, designed an ore deposit model, and proposed further drill targets based on geochemical vectors, also developed by Maier **\[3.5\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The findings of Maier and McDonald resulted in identification of high\-value exploration sites and enabled new ore discoveries, generating exploration cost savings of over £23M. Furthermore, Cardiff research helped minimise societal and cultural impacts for landowners and indigenous groups within these prospective areas, removing the need to relocate or disrupt communities in these provinces. Cardiff’s work was applied across the world, benefiting the following mining organisations: 

1.  Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. in South Africa; 

1.  The Geological Survey of Western Australia; 

1.  Northern Shield Resources Inc. in Canada. 

 **4.1 Geological modelling in South Africa** 

 Ivanplats \(a subsidiary of Ivanhoe Mines\) are exploring the northern Bushveld Complex of South Africa, an area estimated to hold 75% of the world’s supply of platinum. In 2014, the company was granted mining rights to a deposit named “Flatreef”, with indicated mineral resources of 41.9 million ounces of PGE and gold \( *in situ* value currently >£40B\), and an additional 52.8 million ounces of PGE and gold in inferred resources. 

 Since 2012 Ivanhoe worked with Maier and McDonald to develop a clearer geological definition of the Flatreef and wider area. Dr Danie Grobler, Head of Geology and Exploration, Ivanhoe Mines confirmed that Cardiff’s assessment and validation of the stratigraphic interpretation “ *enabled Ivanhoe Mines \(and our competitors on adjacent properties\) to better understand the internal structure of the Flatreef orebody*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 Cardiff’s geochemical prospectivity vectoring and petrological mapping of the Flatreef area generated significant economic and strategic benefits: “ *As a company, Ivanhoe has derived enormous value from the results of these studies and from the ideas and independent scrutiny offered by Dr McDonald and Professor Maier that have helped to test and refine our geological model*” **\[5.1\]**. Specifically, Cardiff’s independent assessment and validation of the stratigraphic interpretation used by Ivanhoe to plan development of mine locations “ *enabled Ivanhoe to better predict the occurrence and economic potential associated with these rocks*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 Ivanhoe Mines estimated that: “ *Considering that total exploration expenses in the last few years has been US$100M, this work translates into at least US$30M \[£23.1M\] in exploration cost savings*” **\[5.1\]** and further notes that the research enabled Ivanhoe Mines “ *to identify 3 new high priority exploration targets in Southern Africa and globally”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Improved exploration increased social welfare for local people “ *by reducing the amount of drilling required to identify new ore resources and by making drilling unnecessary on ground judged to be non\-prospective*” **\[5.1\]**. The northern Bushveld Complex is densely populated and Cardiff’s research delineated non\-prospective areas within these community neighbourhoods. Ivanplats stated that “ *The area of ground affected by these developments is approximately 4km<sup>2</sup>, on which at least 20,000 people are currently living and will therefore not need to be relocated. The potential cost of this relocation would have been approximately US$ 100M \[£77.6M\]”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 The research further enhanced professional methods used by Ivanplats across the world: “ *Specific guidelines for exploration in the Bushveld and elsewhere that are now applied as best practice by Ivanplats exploration teams”* are *“used regularly by the Ivanplats geological teams, comprising at least 15 employees*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Prospectivity of culturally sensitive Western Australian sites** 

 The Western Australian government is responsible for natural resources within the largest state in Australia, approximately ten times the area of the UK. The Geological Survey of Western Australia \(GSWA\) oversees geological exploration for the state and, as stated by Dr Hugh Smithies, Project Manager of Geoscience Mapping, has “ *routinely requested Prof. Maier’s help in various aspects of nickel\- and copper\-mineralised systems throughout central Australia and southern Western Australia*” **\[5.2\]**. Of specific importance is the evolution of nickel and copper\-mineralised systems in the Albany\-Fraser Orogen region and West Musgrave Province of Western Australia **\[5.2\]**. 

 Cardiff’s work within the Albany\-Fraser Orogen area “ *identified geochemical and isotopic discriminators of high\- and low\- prospective ground and these have been incorporated into current exploration models for that region”* **\[5.2\]**. In addition, the GSWA stated that Cardiff’s research “ *provided perhaps the most significant body of data and of interpretations relating to the nickel\- and copper\-prospectivity of the west Musgrave region in central Australia*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 Cardiff’s research is currently directing exploration into the Musgrave region and within the Albany\-Fraser Orogen where Smithies notes the economic and material potential “ *cannot be understated*” **\[5.2\]**.The GSWA has a unique policy of publicly releasing all prospectivity maps to encourage private exploration, which is estimated to deliver a return on investment of AUS$23.7 for each AUS$ spent through granted mineral rights, taxes, and employment **\[5.3\]**. Through collaborative research and mapping, Cardiff’s input “ *has been a critical component to the success of GSWA programs in these regions*” and *“significantly advanced the understanding of the geological evolution of these regions and their economic potential*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 A priority for the GSWA is working alongside indigenous traditional landowners, and the Musgrave and Albany Fraser ore deposit belts are some of the most culturally sensitive regions in Australia, home to a wide range of indigenous groups. The GSWA emphasised how the research “ *provided a firm geological base, including detailed mapping and geological interpretations, upon which all land\-use activities could be better planned and executed – providing clear benefits in terms of minimising potential disturbance of culturally and environmentally sensitive land*” **\[5.2\]**. As a result, Cardiff’s research in the west Musgrave region “ *formed part of a unique cooperative agreement between the Western Australian State Government and the indigenous Traditional Owners of that region \(represented by the Ngaanyatjarra Council\)*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.3 Discovery of Canadian magmatic ore deposits through non\-invasive methods** 

 Northern Shield Resources is a Canadian company that aims to conduct non\-invasive exploration, using geochemical tools that reduce risk in early\-stage exploration. Since 2006, Northern Shield collaborated with Maier on the implementation of geochemical vectoring. These methods now underpin the company strategy. Ian Bliss, the President/CEO of Northern Shield, notes that Maier “ *was largely responsible for developing Northern Shield’s methodology to discriminate prospective from non\-prospective mafic\-ultramafic intrusions and once prospective targets were defined, utilizing geochemistry as a vectoring tool, both on property and drill\-hole scale*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 Northern Shield’s application of Cardiff’s geochemical prospecting strategies “ *led directly to the Huckleberry discovery in 2014*” a Nickel\-Copper\-PGM site being actively explored under a joint venture between Northern Shield and South32 Ltd., with an estimated CDN$3M \(£1.75M\) spent on exploration **\[5.4\]**. Although Northern Shield cannot provide a definitive monetary value on Cardiff’s expertise, Bliss estimated that “ *contributions at Huckleberry resulted in cost savings of CDN$300,000 \(two drill\-holes, \[£172,000\]\) and $400,000 \[£230,000\] for regional exploration and project generation*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 Maier’s knowledge and application of non\-invasive geochemical prospectivity vectors in remote regions of Québec was equally critical: “ *Beyond dollar values our exploration methods, based on Dr Maier have positive social and environmental impact*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 Northern Shield’s operations in the area are near local indigenous First Nation and Inuit communities. Bliss stated that by using Cardiff’s *“prospectivity discrimination and vectoring methods based on rock geochemistry, unnecessary damage to the environment, no matter how light, is avoided by reducing the amount of drilling required*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.4 Summary** 

 Cardiff research resulted in delineation of highly prospective exploration tracts and the discovery of new magmatic ore deposits of PGE, nickel and copper in Africa, Australia and Canada. Equally importantly, the research identified areas of lower ore potential, reducing detrimental societal and cultural impacts for landowners and indigenous groups. In total, exploration cost savings of at least £23M were generated.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 An exercise and lifestyle intervention for young people \(aged 16\-25\) experiencing a first episode psychosis, developed in partnership between an interdisciplinary research team at the University of Worcester and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, has been shown to bring both economic benefits for service providers and significant health benefits for users. The intervention has been rolled out across Worcestershire by a dedicated team \(and extended to all outpatient mental health service users\) but has also been adopted more widely in the UK and internationally thanks to a coordinated good practice dissemination programme. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Researchers in Exercise Science \(Peters and Griffiths\) have brought their research expertise to the evaluation of physical activity interventions over a period of 10\+ years. Peters was part of a multidisciplinary team, funded by local government \(Grant 1\) to evaluate child weight management interventions in the West Midlands. The results of this evaluation highlighted the limitations of the interventions and set out recommendations for future commissioning to ensure increased effectiveness \(Reference 1\). 

 Peters was subsequently commissioned to evaluate a further PA intervention with Griffiths \(Grant 2\), the final report for which was published in 2013. The findings of this study again highlighted the ineffectiveness of the intervention but also pointed the way forward for future interventions, with emphasis on the need to adopt a multicomponent approach that draws support from across multiple sectors and environments and to take full account of the socio\-cultural context in community\-based interventions \(Reference 2\). 

 Subsequently, bringing the findings from earlier research on PA interventions, Griffiths became part of the interdisciplinary team which developed and evaluated, through Health Foundation funding \(Grant 3\), an exercise and lifestyle intervention for young people who have recently experience first episode psychosis. The SHAPE intervention consisted of a 12\-week programme, with weekly, 90\-minute sessions comprising a healthy behaviour education session, followed by a facilitated exercise session. 27 participants were recruited to the pilot. Anthropometric data from participants was collected at baseline, 12 weeks, and 12 months post\-intervention. Health behaviours and clinical measurements were assessed at baseline and 12 months. 

 Mean baseline data suggests participants were at an increased health risk on entry to the program, with elevated values in mean body mass index \(BMI; 70% overweight/obese\), waist circumference, resting heart rate, and triglycerides. 50% reported smoking daily, 64% ate less than 5 fruits/vegetables per day, and 52% of participants were prescribed highly obesogenic antipsychotic medications \(i.e., Olanzapine\). At 12 weeks and 12 months, contrary to expectations that these would be elevated, no changes were observed in mean BMI, waist circumference or any other clinical variable \(p > 0.05\). At 12 months, participants reported a positive impact on health behaviours including improved diet, increased physical activity levels, and cessation of substance use, alcohol use, and smoking. Focus groups captured participant experiences, engagement with and satisfaction with the program, including challenges/barriers to program adherence. Overall, the research showed that the programme supported participants to attenuate their physical health risk which was sustained at 12 months follow up \(Reference 3\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The evaluation of the SHAPE programme \(Source A\) showed the clear clinical benefits of the intervention. The programme: 

-  effectively supported weight maintenance 

-  reduced harmful lifestyle behaviours such as tobacco and alcohol use 

-  increased physical activity levels. 

 An economic evaluation of the programme \(Source B\) highlighted a wide range of potential costs savings derived from: 

-  improved clinical outcomes for users 

-  improved “quality of life years” for users \(QALY\) 

 Following the success of the pilot programme, in 2017 Worcestershire Clinical Commissioning Group extended the delivery of the SHAPE intervention to all outpatient mental health service users in the county and introduced three new permanent job roles \(Physical Health Lead, Physical Activity Health Coordinator, Physical Activity Support Worker\) to oversee, deliver and support the delivery of the SHAPE intervention across Worcestershire at a cost of £70,000 \(Source C\). The introduction of the programme, with associated referral processes, has enabled the Trust to improve their collection of physical and mental health data, with associated benefits for service users, but also Trust performance against nationally identified performance measures, e.g. CQUINs, and national initiatives, e.g. Making Every Contact Count; Don’t just screen, intervene \(Source C\). 

 The ongoing delivery of the programme was supported by the SHAPE project team through: 

-  the development of a new clinical health assessment form to standardise screening, now used as part of the standard clinical assessment process in Worcestershire. 

-  the design and delivery of a one day training course entitled ‘Physical Health Training for Mental Health Nurses’ which provides an overview of the NHS Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) responsibilities and training for physical health assessments \(blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference\) for mental health care professionals to assess and monitor patient physical health \(Source D\). 

 The SHAPE team received an additional £30,000 funding from a Health Foundation *Spreading Improvement* grant to disseminate further the findings of the project and the resources developed. This supported the development of a ‘mySHAPE’ website to provide patients, carers, providers and commissioners online access to physical health care information for individuals with psychosis and to give healthcare providers free access to all SHAPE intervention programme materials, allowing them to deliver the SHAPE programme in their region. 

 The SHAPE team adopted a wider dissemination programme which saw them deliver to both academic and practitioner audiences regionally, nationally and internationally. This included: NHS National Learning Network \(April 2015\); Health Services Journal \(HSJ\) Value in Healthcare Congress \(May 2016\); American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meeting, Boston, USA \(June 2016\); IEPA 10th International Conference on Early Intervention in Mental Health, Milan, Italy \(October 2017\); West Midlands Early Intervention Psychiatry regional network \(March 2017\); NICE Shared Learning Awards \(June 2017\). 

 The SHAPE intervention has been recognised in the NICE Shared Learning Database which underlines how the intervention addresses recent NICE guidance and quality standards \-NICE CG178, NICE CG155, NICE QS80, NICE QS102 \(Source E\). The intervention is also highlighted in the King’s Fund learning network for *Integrated Physical and Mental Health* \(Source F\). Further, the intervention was identified as a key area of evidence in the British Association for Psychopharmacology \(BAP\) Guidelines \(co\-authored by Jo Smith\) on the management of weight gain, metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular risk associated with psychosis and antipsychotic drug treatment \(Source G\). 

 The SHAPE programme has now been delivered \(and continues to be delivered, including online during the Covid pandemic\) in a number of NHS trusts across the Midlands: 

-  North and South Worcestershire \(Worcester, Malvern, Evesham, Kidderminster, Redditch, Bromsgrove\) 

-  Dudley and Walsall 

-  Hereford \(in partnership with a local fitness centre provider \(Halo\) and offered to service users from a range of different adult mental health services \(not restricted to the FEP / EI service\) 

-  Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust 

 The SHAPE programme has thus been delivered to 38 groups of service users across 4 NHS trusts in the West Midlands. 

 SHAPE has also informed the development of a similar programmes nationally, e.g. in the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, and internationally, in Australia and Portugal. This wider impact on the SHAPE programme is articulated by Dr David Shiers, lead for the National Early Intervention in Psychosis Programme \(2004\-2010\), who states: “the SHAPE programme continues to play an important role in influencing other healthcare professionals within EIP services, made a compelling case for how services can help tackle this health inequality by addressing health risks in the critical first few years of psychosis and its treatment” \(Source H\). 

 To sum up, the research described in section 2 has had the following impacts on health and wellbeing: 

-  the development of a new lifestyle intervention trialled with users which demonstrated a positive outcome for users and healthcare providers alike 

-  informed decisions taken by a health service and improved provision of health services 

-  influenced the content of CPD for health professionals 

-  raised awareness of the importance of exercise in the treatment of mental health and early cardio\-metabolic risk for young people with FEP

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 O’Toole’s research on Muslim civic engagement and the impact of UK Counter Terrorism policy on Muslim civil society organisations has: 

-  influenced national policy debate on the impact of counter\-radicalisation policy on Muslim civic inclusion, including the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism, and the House of Lords Select Committee on Citizenship and Civic Engagement; 

-  shaped public understanding of the Birmingham ‘Trojan Horse’ affair; 

-  led to improved mechanisms for inclusion of Muslims in local governance in Bristol. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 O’Toole’s research addresses Muslim inclusion in governance, and the impact of Prevent \(the government’s counter\-radicalisation policy\) on Muslim civic engagement in the UK. From 2010, O’Toole led two major ESRC/AHRC projects **\[i, ii\]**, and produced a co\-authored book with Holmwood \(University of Nottingham\) on the Birmingham ‘Trojan Horse’ affair. 

 The first project \(2010\-13\) **\[3.1\]** **\[i\]** found, contrary to perceptions that Muslims were minimally engaged in governance, increasing engagement with the state across policy domains from the mid\-1990s, and a growth, pluralisation and maturation of Muslim civil society organisations. It highlighted the significance of local contexts, and activism of Muslim actors and local agencies, creating variation in the implementation and impact of policies on cohesion, integration and security. Notwithstanding the dominance of Prevent, the research challenged the view of it as a coherent, top\-down disciplinary regime by drawing attention to local contestation and innovation **\[3.2\]**. 

 The second research project \(2013\-18\) **\[3.3\] \[ii\]** used collaborative and participatory methods to study Building the Bridge, a local Muslim forum established to implement Prevent in Bristol. The research analysed its development and impact, the implications of Prevent for Muslim civic engagement, and opportunities for Muslim women’s civic participation. The research found that Building the Bridge created a new political opportunity structure in the city for Muslim civic engagement that had not hitherto existed **\[3.3\]**. It concluded its effectiveness would have been stronger had it not been organised under the rubric of Prevent. Through co\-produced research with Muslim women, the study identified barriers to their civic engagement and mechanisms to enhance their inclusion in the governance of religious, community and statutory bodies – highlighting the innovations they contribute **\[3.4\].** 

 O’Toole’s \(2017\) co\-authored book with Holmwood **\[3.5\]** scrutinised claims of an extremist plot in 2014 to Islamicise state schools in Birmingham \(the ‘Trojan Horse affair’\), that led to the replacement of the management in several schools and attempts to disbar permanently several teachers. Holmwood and O’Toole exposed errors, gaps and cover\-ups in the arguments and evidence against the schools, and in relation to their alleged failures to comply with requirements of Prevent, community cohesion, religious expression and teaching of fundamental British values. They concluded the allegations constituted a major miscarriage of justice. 

 Drawing on the cumulative findings of this research, O’Toole contributed to local and national policy debates on the impact of Prevent on Muslim civic engagement and public understandings of the Birmingham Trojan Horse affair **\[3.2\]\[3.5\]\[3.6\]**. She called for an independent review of Prevent **\[3.6\]** that addresses: the definition of extremism on which it is based; its impact on equalities and civil liberties **\[3.6\]**; its remit, paying attention to overlap with other policy areas \(such as integration\) and Public Sector Duties **\[3.5\]\[3.6\]**; and its implications for Muslim civic inclusion **\[3.2\]\[3.5\]\[3.6\].** She argued for more locally\-driven and sensitive approaches, which permit local actors to develop and give critical feedback to counter\-radicalisation policy, beyond being mobilised for the purposes of implementation **\[3.3\]\[3.6\]**. She advanced proposals for better state engagement with a wider range of Muslim groups and voices. Such engagement, she argued, should go beyond the narrow focus of Prevent **\[3.1\]\[3.3\]\[3.6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 O’Toole’s research has influenced national policy and debate on Muslim civic engagement in the UK. Her investigation of the Birmingham Trojan Horse affair shaped public understanding of what she and Holmwood found to be a major miscarriage of justice. In Bristol, her research has improved mechanisms for the inclusion of Muslims in local governance. 

###  Influenced national policy and debate on Prevent and state\-Muslim engagement in the UK 

 Between 2015 and 2017, O’Toole was invited to feed her research findings **\[3.1\-3.3\]** into government departments’ consultation processes on engagement, cohesion and extremism including: 

-  the Department for Communities and Local Government \(DCLG\) in December 2015 to discuss her research on local models of Prevent implementation **;** 

-  the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism \(OSCT\) in 2016 to discuss her research on the impact of Prevent **\[5.1\]**; 

-  the House of Lords Select Committee on Citizenship and Civic Engagement in October 2017 to give oral evidence on the impact of Prevent on Muslim civic engagement **\[5.2\].** 

 O’Toole’s work has raised awareness of the key challenges relating to the implementation of the UK government’s counter\-radicalisation policy, Prevent. OSCT’s Head of CT Strategy and Performance states that O’Toole’s research on ‘ *community based approaches to counter\-terrorism and the importance of participatory decision making helped us with our own thinking on the matter’* **\[5.1\]**. O’Toole’s evidence to the Select Committee was cited in four of its recommendations to government in its report *The Ties that Bind* **\[5.2\]** which stated that government should: 

-  uncouple shared British values from counter\-extremism policy \(paras 66\-70, and recommendation 5 **\[5.2\]**\), 

-  clarify the essential purposes of Prevent \(paras 390 & 392 and recommendation 62 **\[5.2\]**\), 

-  ensure greater local involvement in the implementation of Prevent \(paras 394 & 397 and recommendation 63 **\[5.2\]**\), and 

-  review the definition of extremism within Prevent \(paras 398 & 400 and recommendation 64 **\[5.2\]**\). 

 The recommendation concerning the need to uncouple shared British values from counter\-extremism was taken up by Lord Harries of Pentregarth \(column 91\) **\[5.3: p.35\]** and Lord Tyler \(column 103\) **\[5.3: p.52\]** in a House of Lords debate on the Ties that Bind report on 19th November 2018 **\[5.3\]**. 

###  Shaped public understanding of the Trojan Horse affair in Birmingham 

 O’Toole and Holmwood’s Birmingham ‘Trojan Horse’ investigation **\[3.5\]** has influenced public understanding of the affair. Writing in 2018 for *Middle East Eye*, former distinguished Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail journalist \(short\-listed for the 2020 Orwell prize for journalism\), Peter Oborne, stated *“I cannot recommend strongly enough … the recently published book by sociologists John Holmwood and Therese O'Toole. It is an assiduous, impeccably researched account of the events that took place in Birmingham. It makes utterly devastating reading*. *And it is profoundly troubling in light of the official significance of the case*” **\[5.4\].** The article was shared over 2,100 times. Their book informed LUNG Theatre’s production of Trojan Horse, which won the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award when it premiered in 2018. This was followed by two national tours in October\-November 2019 and January\-February 2020 with over 60 performances at 26 different venues, attended by over 5,000 people. Reviewers praised Trojan Horse as ‘ *Perhaps the bravest and most astutely political of shows…relevant, terrifying and beautifully told…*', What’s On Stage, and ‘ *a sober, forceful condemnation of injustice’*, The Guardian **\[5.5\]**. In 2017, MEND \(Muslim Engagement & Development\) organised a conference in Birmingham with 300 participants on the Trojan Horse affair that included discussion of the book’s findings **\[5.5\].** 

###  Improved mechanisms for the inclusion/engagement of Muslim women in local governance 

 At the local level, O’Toole’s research shaped Bristol City Council’s \(BCC\) approach to Muslim civic engagement in the city. The 2014 report, *Building the Bridge: Muslim community engagement in Bristol* **\[3.3\],** influenced BCC’s decision to continue to support Building the Bridge despite the withdrawal of central government funding **\[5.6\]\[5.7\].** The Chair of Building the Bridge states: ‘ *Your research was valuable for informing the structure and continuation of Building the Bridge, enabling its continuation as an important forum for Muslim voices in the city*’ **\[5.6\].** The research team co\-produced with Muslim women from the city: a\) a policy brief with recommendations for women’s effective inclusion, including that statutory and community organisations should create opportunities for women to take up leadership roles, rather than expecting them to ‘fight their way in’, and networking opportunities for Muslim women to share experiences and concerns **\[5.8\];** and b\) a film exploring Muslim women’s visions of more effective participatory spaces \( *What Do You See?*\) **\[5.8\].** The film premiered in October 2015 at the Watershed, the leading arts centre in the city, and was the focus of a ‘Made in Bristol’ TV programme. 

 The research outputs on the role and participation of women in Building the Bridge and the resulting recommendations on how local structures could be improved **\[3.3\]\[3.4\]\[5.8\],** led the City Council to set up a gender\-balanced co\-chairing arrangement for Building the Bridge **\[5.6\]\[5.7\]\[5.9\]**, and a Women’s Partnership Advisory Group \(PAG\) within Building the Bridge to enable the input of Muslim women on a range of issues **\[5.6\]\[5.7\]**. As a City Council Report stated: ‘ *in line with the report **\[3.3\]\[5.8\]** recommendations, the Women’s Partnership Advisory Group \(PAG\) was formed in September 2015 to give a voice to Muslim women’* **\[5.9\].** 

 Informed by the research findings **\[3.3\],** a specific recommendation on creating networking opportunities for Muslim women to share experiences and concerns **\[5.8\]** and the launch of the project’s Bristol Big Sisters Exhibition on 29 October 2015, BCC and the Women’s PAG organised a Bristol Big Sisters Conference in Autumn 2016, with input from O’Toole. The Conference was attended by 200 Muslim women to debate issues that concerned them **\[5.9\].** The City Council also went on to take the project’s Bristol Big Sister’s exhibition on tour to over 100 venues including libraries, children centres, college campuses, health centres and community hubs across and beyond Bristol **\[5.9\].** 

 Since then, O’Toole joined \(by invitation\) a new Muslim civic forum, the Bristol Muslim Strategic Leadership Group in 2019, which promotes engagement between Muslims and statutory organisations in the city across a range of policy areas – extending beyond Prevent and security concerns **\[5.10\]**. She sits on its Research Task Group to identify ways in which research can support the work of the BMSLG. This includes providing her research insights into the creation of a booklet on Muslims in Britain and Bristol for use by professionals, educators, practitioners, journalists and interested readers \(with a foreword by Baroness Sayeeda Warsi\), and supporting a co\-produced research project on Muslim perceptions and experiences of policing in Bristol, to feed into the work of Avon and Somerset Police \(with funding from the University of Bristol Temple Quarter Engagement Fund\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mycotoxins are poisonous compounds naturally produced by strains of fungus growing on staple cereals, nuts and oilseeds. Dietary exposure to aflatoxins, the most toxic mycotoxins, significantly increases the risk of chronic malnutrition and stunting in children. Prof Gong’s research on the effects of mycotoxins on foetal development and children’s health, alongside the evaluation of low\-cost solutions to minimise dietary exposure, have influenced global food safety standards and policies. Additionally, in sub\-Saharan Africa this research has built capacity, leading to increased preparedness to deal with outbreaks and financial support for aflatoxin control measures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof Gong has led an intensive research programme on different mycotoxins across Africa in collaboration with global partners such as the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. This work has focused on providing several stages of evidence identifying the relationships between aflatoxin exposure and children’s health. The primary method of measuring chronic malnutrition in children is the prevalence of stunting, affecting more than a third of children in African countries. 

 The first stage of the research examined the relationship between weaning practices, the levels of an aflatoxin biomarker, and growth parameters in 480 children aged 9 months to 5 years in Benin and Togo. This research reported a statistically significant association between biomarkers, the presence of aflatoxin in food, and three growth parameters. The findings strongly suggested that aflatoxin exposure contributes to the risk of chronic undernutrition and stunting **\[1\].** 

 The second stage of the research was a longitudinal study in Benin, examining aflatoxin exposure in children aged 16\-36 months over an 8\-month period. After adjustment for confounders, the children with lower levels of aflatoxin exposure had on average gained 1.7 cm more in height than those with higher exposure, thereby supporting the hypothesis that reducing aflatoxin exposure substantially reduces the risk of stunting **\[2\]**. 

 The third stage of research was a randomised controlled trial that evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce aflatoxin exposure. Prof Gong designed, implemented and evaluated low\-cost, culturally acceptable intervention strategies to reduce post\-harvest aflatoxin contamination and human exposure at the subsistence farm level in Guinea **\[3\]**. The intervention package included education and facilities for effective post\-harvest handling of maize. This intervention reduced aflatoxin exposure by 60% as assessed using an aflatoxin biomarker **\[3\]**. 

 Following this research, Prof Gong worked in the Gambia to assess how aflatoxin exposure in the womb limits the growth of infants in the first year of life. Biomarker levels were measured in maternal blood during pregnancy, in cord blood and infants at age 16 weeks. Levels in maternal blood were found to be a strong predictor of both weight and height gain in infants. A reduction in exposure from 110 pg/mg to 10 pg/mg was associated with a 0.8 kg increase in weight and a 2 cm increase in height within the first year of life. The research demonstrated that aflatoxins cross the maternal placental barrier **\[4\]**. 

 The extent of children’s dietary exposure to two mycotoxins \(aflatoxin and fumonisin B1\) was demonstrated through a survey of 148 children aged 12–22 months in Tanzania. Working with the Tanzanian Food and Drug Authority \(TFDA\), aflatoxin and fumonisin biomarkers were were detected in 84% and 96% of children. The highest levels were measured in children who had been fully weaned. The research provided the first detailed quantitative exposure data on aflatoxin and fumonisin in Tanzanian children and demonstrated that consumption of contaminated maize\-based food leads to chronic exposure to mycotoxins, increasing with age **\[5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof Gong’s research on the effects of mycotoxins on foetal development and children’s health, alongside design and evaluation of low\-cost solutions to minimise dietary exposure, have influenced global food safety standards and policies. Additionally, in sub\-Saharan Africa this research has built capacity, leading to increased preparedness to deal with outbreaks and financial support for aflatoxin control measures. 

 **Influencing Global Food Safety Standards** 

 Prof Gong’s research has contributed evidence to world leading policy\-making bodies and resulted in the creation and maintenance of crucial safety standards for contaminants. As a world\-leading expert in aflatoxins and their impact on chronic childhood malnutrition, Prof Gong is a working group member of the International Agency for Research on Cancer \(IARC\), whose reports influence global policy. Prof Gong’s research is cited in IARC Report No. 9 **\[A\]**. This included evidence on how aflatoxins negatively affect children’s growth and their impact upon foetus development in utero. The report also highlighted the urgent need for clear intervention measures and global action to prevent harm to children. 

 Prof Gong’s research **\[1\-4\]** strongly influenced a monograph **\[B\]** by the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization \(WHO\), two leading organisations involved in global food safety. The monograph was used to advise all member states on the safe evaluation of aflatoxin contaminants in food. A further WHO technical report **\[C\]** cites Prof Gong’s work **\[1,2,4\]**, highlighting the need for intervention strategies. 

 Prof Gong has contributed extensively to the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) as a working group member, authoring six official mycotoxins risk assessment documents over seven years. The decision to maintain the EU food safety regulation limit levels for *fusarium* mycotoxins has been based on this work **\[D\]**. 

 **Influencing African Policy and Action** 

 Prof Gong is an expert member of the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa \(PACA\) **\[E\]**, uniting more than 50 organisations from 54 African countries. Led by the African Union, PACA strategy aims to reduce aflatoxin exposure through awareness, preparedness and influencing government policy. 

 In 2013, PACA published a 10\-year strategy document on aflatoxin control and evidence for action **\[E\]**. As an expert member, Prof Gong’s research played a pivotal role in shaping this strategy. Prof Gong’s research on the effects of aflatoxin on child stunting was cited in both the executive summary **\[1,2\]** and in the ‘Opportunities to improve health’ section **\[1\-3\]** as evidence underpinning the need to reduce aflatoxin exposure. 

 Aflatoxin control actions have been established in 34 African states. PACA has led aflatoxin initiatives in three regional economic communities and 12 African countries, building awareness and improving preparedness amongst decision makers. Over 100 heads of state and government and ministers and deputy ministers have received training from PACA **\[F\]**. 

 In 2014, Prof Gong produced a series of technical reports as lead author to influence aflatoxin policy across the East African Communities \(EAC\) region **\[G\]**, based on research evidence **\[1,2,4,5\]**. In 2018, the EAC released nine policy briefings to their six\-country membership as a direct result of these technical reports **\[H\]**. In addition, the EAC aflatoxin prevention, control strategy and action plan were underpinned by Prof Gong’s research **\[I\]**. 

 The manager in charge of Food Risk Analysis at TFDA who worked with Prof Gong as a food safety scientist, credits Prof Gong’s research for successfully dealing with an aflatoxin outbreak explaining that “capacity built through the implementation of Prof Gong’s research facilitated successful investigation of a food borne disease outbreak, which occurred in Tanzania in 2016 as a result of consumption of maize contaminated with aflatoxin. The built capacity also facilitated the identification and implementation of appropriate risk management actions for control and prevention of the problem” **\[I\]**. 

 Research findings were input into the development of proposals for TANIPAC **\[2,5 referred to in K\]**. TANIPAC \(Tanzania Initiative for Preventing Aflatoxin Contamination\) is a $20M investment from the World Bank, Global Agriculture and Food Security Program and African Development Fund, developing a five\-year project in Tanzania \(2018\-2023\) aimed at minimising aflatoxin occurrence. Through developing infrastructure, including establishing post\-harvest centres for grain and bio\-control units, and raising public awareness through education, TANIPAC is expected to benefit 60,000 farmers **\[J\]**. Five other African countries have also made financial commitments to create scalable models for aflatoxin mitigation **\[F\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth’s Historic Dockyard is one of the most celebrated heritage centres in the UK. Since the museum opened in 2013, scientists from the University of Kent and the Mary Rose Trust have used synchrotron\-based approaches to annually monitor the ship’s hull during a critical drying period. This has enabled chemical changes in the ship to be measured in real time, thus ensuring its integrity and informing conservation strategies. In 2016, a pioneering strontium carbonate nanoparticle procedure was developed to mitigate imminent and long\-term threats of acid degradation, and this has been used to successfully treat some of the artefacts now on display in the museum. Preservation of the *Mary Rose* and the thousands of artefacts has been central to the museum’s popularity, providing cultural, economic, and educational benefits. As a result, Kent’s research is also being used to inform cultural heritage conservation projects internationally.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The *Mary Rose* was King Henry VIII’s flagship from 1512 until she sank in 1545. The ship remained relatively intact on the seabed, buried in silt, for nearly 400 years, before it was uncovered and raised in 1982. Following its removal from the sea, yellow salt precipitates started to appear on the ship’s timbers. A similar problem was encountered with the *Vasa*, King Adolphus of Sweden’s warship, which sank in 1628. The *Vasa*, whose oak beams were seemingly in excellent condition when first raised, dramatically deteriorated while housed in the Wasavarvet restoration facility \( *Nature* 415: 893\-897 \[2002\]\). The problem, now commonly referred to as ‘the sulfur problem’, occurs when sulfur compounds in the timbers, which originate from bacterial processes whilst underwater, are oxidised to sulfuric acid on exposure to air. This acid attacks the cellulose within the beams, resulting in dramatic deterioration of the wood. Work on the *Vasa* has shown that the oxidation is catalysed by iron, which is prevalent across the ship in the form of bolts and other structural components, compounding the problem and accelerating the deterioration. 

 Since **2008**, Professor Chadwick’s team from the School of Physical Sciences at Kent has conducted research with the Mary Rose Trust to understand the oxidation processes occurring in the ship **\[R1, R2\]**, to develop new chemical treatments that mitigate the ‘sulfur problem’ **\[R2, R3, R4, R5\]**, and to monitor the state of the ship through the use of synchrotron radiation studies to ensure its integrity **\[R6\]**. 

 **Research into the ‘sulfur problem’ and the preservation of the **Mary Rose** 

 Published in **2008**, the Kent team’s research reported on the analysis of core samples taken from untreated timbers of the *Mary Rose*. Synchrotron\-based sulfur and iron K\-edge X\-ray absorption spectroscopy \(XAS\) of the cores revealed that sulfur oxidation was more prevalent at the surface than in the depth of the timbers, and that the ‘sulfur problem’ was worse the nearer the samples were taken from a piece of metal in the wood, particularly iron **\[R1\]**. Between **2009** and **2011**, the Kent team, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund **\[G1\]**, investigated chemical treatments to solve the ‘sulfur problem’, including iron removal **\[R2\]** and nanoparticle de\-acidification **\[R3\]**, and continued to work with synchrotron beamlines to characterise treatment effectiveness **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 When the *Mary Rose* was first raised, she was sprayed regularly with water to stop the hull from drying out and prevent microbial activity. In 1992, the conservation team stopped spraying with water and started spraying the ship with polyethylene glycol \(PEG\) to displace the water in the cellular structure of the wood to prevent shrinkage and collapse. In **2013**, the wood had become saturated with PEG and the process of drying the ship began. At this point, the Kent team and the Mary Rose Trust set up a programme of work with Diamond Light Source \(the UK’s national synchrotron facility\) to take samples annually from the ship for analysis to monitor any changes in real time **\[G2\]**. 

 Monitoring experiments carried out between **2013** and **2018** analysed 14 well\-defined cores of the ship’s hull, chosen as being representative of major areas of the *Mary Rose*’s timber. Samples were initially collected during the PEG treatment and again in real time during the drying period, enabling the analysis of both drying time and depth into the wood. The cores were subjected to sulfur and iron K\-edge XAS, using the synchrotron at the national facility and results were analysed by comparing the spectra with well\-defined standards. During the initial phase of the study, it was shown that significant amounts of oxidised sulfur were appearing on surfaces where previously not observed. In **2016**, a procedure to mitigate this oxidation using strontium carbonate nanoparticles was introduced by the Kent team **\[R4\]**. Importantly, this study showed that PEG does not prevent the reactivity of the nanoparticles with the sulfur compounds present in the artefacts, and a surface brushing method was found to be successful in removing the oxidised sulfur **\[R4\]**. Initial monitoring results also indicated that oxidised sulfur was progressing into the depth of the timber core, and oxidised zinc was found in coexistence with oxidised sulfur and iron in highly degraded regions **\[R6\]**. Reduced sulfur based species, such as sulfur, cystine, and methionine, and iron compounds were found to be present within the timber core at all times. 

 The monitoring project has shown that the level of oxidised sulfur building within the ship has levelled out and stabilised, and is not an immediate threat to the ship’s integrity, indicating that the conservation methods being applied are working successfully. A report on core samples taken from six locations across the hull during the PEG treatment and again five months into the drying phase, has been published **\[R6\]**. Future publications are in the pipeline and a short film describing the project has been produced by KMTV. The Kent team continues to evaluate the effectiveness of PEG in the conservation of the *Mary Rose* **\[R5\]**.

 **Pioneering conservation technology to preserve underwater cultural heritage** 

1.  *Measuring chemical changes in the* Mary Rose *in real time* 

 Chadwick has a longstanding relationship with the Mary Rose Trust, and has been exploring technologies to preserve the ship and her artefacts since 2008. His pioneering research, undertaken by Kent with the Mary Rose Trust and Diamond Light Source between **2013** and **2018**, enabled chemical changes in the ship to be measured in ‘real time’ for the first time **\[a, b\]**. At the outset of the study, the Kent team, the Mary Rose Trust, and Diamond Light Source had to design a robust chamber to collect XAS spectra for soft elements like sulfur. This was built at the Diamond Light Source, and thanks to its success is now being used as standard equipment on the beamline used in the project \(B18\). Principal Beamline Scientists at Diamond Light Source, Professors Giannantonio Cibin and Fred Mosselmans, confirm that ‘The problem posed by the complexity and the nature of the \[ *Mary Rose*\] material itself has helped us to provide new techniques, to be able to push \[…\] our technology’, and that the use of the new techniques ‘has enabled the conservation tactics used on the *Mary Rose* to develop’ **\[b\]**. 

 Under the research guidance of the Kent team, the oxidation processes within the *Mary Rose* timbers are now much better understood, particularly in the museum environment. These monitoring and evaluation experiments have informed conservation practice, including decisions made about the upgrade to the air\-conditioning system in **2016**, which has provided a stable environment for the *Mary Rose* and all of its artefacts. Although further similar experiments and monitoring will be required in the future, the work has provided a platform for many years of conservation. Professor Eleanor Schofield, Head of Conservation and Collections Care at the Mary Rose Trust and an Honorary Professor at Kent, highlights the importance of the monitoring project to the preservation of the *Mary Rose*, stating it ‘has confirmed during the final stages of drying the ship, that our conservation methods are working and has given us confidence that the environment surrounding the ship is correct’ **\[a\]**. 

1.  *Eliminating acid degradation in wood and other materials* 

 Discoveries made during the monitoring research enabled the Kent team to develop a pioneering strontium carbonate nanoparticle treatment to eliminate imminent and long\-term threats of acid degradation **\[b\]**. This treatment has already been used on artefacts now on display. Schofield confirms that ‘Work completed at Kent, developing nanoparticle treatments for the conservation issues of marine archaeological wood, has been implemented in the museum. Specifically, artefacts set to go on display in the new museum in 2013 were treated to combat conservation issues, which left unresolved would have resulted in the items being unable to go on display. These included things like gun carriages, which are critical for the curational narrative of the museum’ **\[a\]**. Having proved the chemistry, ways to apply the nanoparticles to the bulk of the ship are now being investigated **\[b\]**. Schofield confirms that ‘Kent research and our collaboration with the Kent team has also facilitated the beginning of a pilot project at the Mary Rose Trust for conservators to investigate different application methods’ **\[a\]**. 

 Kent’s researchers, the Mary Rose Trust team, and Diamond Light Source are continuing to develop techniques to treat the artefacts, including the ship’s bricks **\[b\]**. Schofield explains that ‘The issues that we see with the salts in the wood we are starting to see in other materials and one of those is the bricks’ **\[b\]**. The Kent team is currently working with the Mary Rose Trust team to understand what impurity phases are resulting in the degradation of the ship’s bricks **\[a, b\]**. ‘It is expected that this understanding can then be exploited to develop preservation techniques.’ **\[a\]** 

1.  *International impacts on cultural heritage conservation* 

 Kent’s research on nanoparticle de\-acidification of waterlogged wood and the real\-time monitoring of chemical degradation in the *Mary Rose* has also assisted other conservation projects around the world, including the preservation of wooden artefacts from the Norwegian Viking ship *Oseberg* **\[c\]** and timbers from the *Princess Carolina*, an eighteenth\-century wooden merchant vessel excavated in the 1980s in Manhattan **\[d\]**. Dr Susan Braovac, Conservator on the Saving Oseberg Project \(Norway\), confirms that ‘Research on archaeological materials is a relatively small field. Only a handful of institutions have research positions specializing in these materials’, and she highlights that ‘Research on the *Mary Rose* contributes to the knowledge\-building that helps preservation specialists make the right decisions’ **\[c\]** *.* 

 Kent’s research is helping to improve understanding of the *Oseberg*’s wooden artefacts treated with alum salts. Braovac explains that even though the groups are working with different types of archaeological woods, they are dealing with similar types of chemical degradation \(sulfates and iron\) and confirms that the Kent team’s work ‘on deacidification of wood using nanoparticles \(strontium carbonate\) has inspired \[her\] own research on nanoparticle application to deacidify wood, albeit, a different type \(calcium hydroxide\)’ **\[c\]**. Braovac also highlights the impact of Kent’s real\-time monitoring project and its findings: ‘The publication on chemical degraders in the *Mary Rose* is \[…\] relevant for my own understanding of the chemistry of alum\-treated wood. We have \[…\] observed similar elements \[described in the Kent paper\] \(zinc\) present in the wood. I had not previously read about zinc in archaeological wood outside of my own work’ **\[c\]**. 

 Elsa Sangouard, Senior Conservator at the Mariners’ Museum \(USA\), describes the Kent’s team’s research on the application of nanoparticles to archaeological wood as ‘critical work that has led the way in improving, diversifying, and strengthening the conservation of such cultural heritage for present and future generations. Today, this research is providing a foundation for the work we, and other conservation laboratories around the world, are conducting.’ A preservation project at the Mariners’ Museum has carried out tests on previously treated acidified waterlogged wood from the *Princess Carolina*, using an approach similar to that reported by the Kent team. Sangouard states that ‘Initial test trials have begun \[…\]. If they are conclusive, we may apply nano\-calcium carbonate particles, one of the products investigated by Schofield et al., on a large\-scale to the re\-treatment of timbers from the Princess Carolina’ **\[d\]**. 

 Overall, the Kent team’s research into the preservation of the *Mary Rose* and her artefacts since 2008 has had a significant impact on cultural heritage research and has been widely cited by the conservation community. The *Mary Rose* website **\[f\]** provides a list of published papers from research projects that have focused on the ship and her artefacts, including the six articles cited here **\[R1\-R6\]** that describe key work carried out by the Kent team. Other projects that have cited the work of the Kent team in their research publications include the conservation of sculptures and decorative artefacts from the *Vasa*, Norwegian Viking age wooden objects \(from the *Oseberg*\), a Bronze Age logboat \(the *Hanson*\) from Derby, a Gallo\-Roman wreck \(the *Lyon Saint\-Georges 4*\) in France, Baroque retables and altarpieces from Portugal, and a Polish medieval bridge and other artefacts **\[e\]**. 

 **Cultural, Economic, and Educational Benefits** 

 Housed in its own purpose built museum, the restored *Mary Rose* is the central attraction in Portsmouth’s Historic Dockyard, one of the most important and visited heritage sites in the UK. The museum employs 11 front\-of\-house staff directly involved with the upkeep and operations of the museum as well as two academic researchers and two conservators **\[a\]**. Schofield, Head of Conservation and Collections Care at the Mary Rose Trust, explains that ‘The concept of the museum is to provide an immersive experience for the visitors showing them, through the objects, day\-to\-day life on board the *Mary Rose*’, and confirms that ‘Having the artefacts with the ship enables us to display everything in context which allows us to tell the story of the people that worked on board more effectively’ **\[a\]**. The Trust has an extensive website describing the extraordinary history of the ship, including large sections on the conservation process and research projects, which reference the Kent team’s research **\[f\]**. The website also states that there are now 19,000 artefacts in the collection, with 5,000 of the preserved items now being on display in the museum **\[f\]**. 

 Preserving and presenting the thousands of artefacts in a pristine condition has been central to the museum’s popularity **\[b\]**. This is acknowledged by Jane Singh, Visit Portsmouth Tourism and Marketing Manager at Portsmouth City Council, who states: ‘The conservation of the *Mary Rose* and the role played by the University of Kent in this work has been essential in ensuring the ship and related artefacts can be successfully conserved and remain on view in the museum. \[…\] As the only ship of her kind on display in the world, along with the thousands of original objects found with her, the *Mary Rose* offers a unique insight into Tudor England’ **\[g\]**. Josephine Payter\-Harris, Guest Experience Manager at the Mary Rose Trust, also highlights the impact that Kent’s research has had on the museum experience: ‘Without all of the conservation work these artefacts wouldn’t be here on display and it’s something that people find absolutely fascinating that these are real artefacts \[…\] that were under the water for all that time’ **\[b\]**. 

 There is a growing focus at the museum on highlighting the various processes involved in the conservation, with a view to including more of this information in outreach projects **\[b, f\]**. Singh, from Portsmouth City Council, confirms that ‘The *Mary Rose* also has a huge part to play in the cultural offer for both local residents and visitors and offers, in more usual times, a range of events and educational activities that complement the museum visit’ **\[g\]**. Schofield states that between **2014** and **2019** the museum received on average 300 school visits and over 255,000 individual visitors annually \(the museum was temporarily closed in 2020 in line with government COVID\-19 regulations\) **\[a\]**. Portsmouth City Council highlights the economic importance of the *Mary Rose* to Portsmouth, where it is regarded as its top attraction and a key driver for visitors, and the role it plays in generating income from tourism in excess of £610 million, supporting around 12,700 jobs \(Portsmouth, Economic Impact of Tourism estimates, 2015, Tourism South East\) **\[g\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Over 500,000 spinal fusion surgeries requiring a bone graft substitute are carried out each year in the US alone. However, traditional synthetic materials mean that, in at least 20% of cases, the materials fail to achieve successful fusion, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Research at the University of Aberdeen has resulted in new approaches for the development and production of synthetic materials that overcome these limitations, leading to 3 patents and commercial exploitation via a spin\-out company. Since August 2013, this new company has used the underpinning research to fuel its expansion, attracting GBP6M in financing between 2014\-2020, which led to an GBP8.4M acquisition in 2020 by an international company, increasing company headcount to deliver economic impact. The company has also created new products that fill unmet clinical needs.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Trauma or disease requiring bone to be replaced can be grafted by surgeons. In fact, in the US alone, there are over 500,000 spinal fusion surgeries requiring a bone graft substitute every year. However, commercial synthetic bone graft substitutes have been typically synthesised using either ceramic\-based approaches or melt\-derived glass approaches. These traditional materials are dense, unlike bone mineral, and have had limited clinical success both due to generation of fibrous tissue growth around the material, rather than new bone, and lack of resorption into the body. These failures account for around 20% of cases, leading to significant implications on patient health, quality of life and ability to return to work, with concomitant socio\-economic costs to society. Even with these limitations, the current annual share for synthetic substitutes represents almost a third of the USD3.2 billion bone graft global market. Research started in 2005 at the University of Aberdeen – supported first by an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship awarded to Professor Iain Gibson \( **P1**\) and then a Scottish Enterprise Proof of Concept Grant \( **P2**\) – sought to address this problem by developing a novel synthetic bone graft substitute using a different approach to synthesise the materials. This multi\-disciplinary research project was carried out within the Institute of Medical Sciences and the Department of Chemistry \(with co\-applicants Skakle and Aspden\), and included pre\-clinical assessment managed through sub\-contracted collaborators. 

 The research aimed to develop a synthetic approach that produced a bone graft scaffold material that exhibited chemical and morphological similarities to bone mineral, based on the hypothesis that such a scaffold architecture would support faster bone repair and be capable of cell\-mediated resorption. If successful this would address two unmet clinical needs: an off\-the\-shelf synthetic bone graft substitute that would perform as well as or better than autograft \(the clinical gold standard, but an approach that is accompanied by longer patient healing time, and postoperative pain at the autograft harvest site\); and a synthetic material that would eventually be fully remodelled and replaced by host bone. 

 The research involved the development of both a novel composition of silicate\-containing calcium phosphate material and the process of making it into a new synthetic bone graft substitute material. \[ **R1**, **R2**\] The resulting material was designed to have a crystal morphology and size that is closer to that of the bone mineral crystals in bone, compared to other synthetic bone graft materials, with crystal dimensions ranging from approximately 50 nm to 150 nm. The processing of the composition into a granule bone graft resulted in a similar amount of total porosity to common macroporous bone grafts \(>75% total porosity\), but the size of the pores is significantly smaller \(sub\-micron sized\), rather than macropores \(100\-500 microns\), meaning that the resulting material has a high surface area. The hypothesis of this material design was that making a bone graft with much smaller crystal sizes and a high surface area would result in a bone graft that would provide a surface that supports bone repair and would be more readily remodelled than current ‘ceramic’ synthetic bone graft substitutes. Further research identified specific microstructural features in calcium phosphate materials, and methods to produce these, that led to an osteoinductive property in the material \[ **R3**\]. Pre\-clinical testing of this material showed that the rate of bone formation was significantly faster than observed for one of the leading synthetic bone graft substitutes on the market, using a challenging model of spinal fusion. This study also showed that the graft material was remodelled and slowly replaced by host bone. 

 Following the completion of the Proof\-of\-Concept project, the technology and intellectual property formed the basis of a spin\-out company from the University of Aberdeen in 2011 \(SIRAKOSS Ltd.\), who continue to commercialise the technology. 

 Research and development of the underpinning research continued through a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Industrial Fellowship funded PhD project at the University of Aberdeen, supervised by Professor Iain Gibson from 2013 to 2016. 

 Building on the underpinning research, a recent study by SIRAKOSS demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the final developed product in a regulatory pre\-clinical study, leading to 100% fusion success after 26 weeks, which further validated the Aberdeen\-led research \[ **R4**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The SIRAKOSS technology, underpinned by the Aberdeen research, addresses the unmet clinical needs for bone graft substitutes by creating an off\-the\-shelf synthetic bone graft that accelerates bone formation and repair so that the graft is fully remodelled and eventually replaced by new bone. The technology has enabled the growth and expansion of a spin out company, attracting equity investment, company led research funding, creating new employment and created 2 new products that fill unmet commercial needs. 

 **Growth of a spin\-out company, attracting investment, creating employment and winning awards** 

 Since spinning out from the University of Aberdeen, SIRAKOSS has raised significant investment and grant funding for an early\-stage medical device company, securing a total of approximately GBP6M in financing, which lead to an GBP8.4M acquisition within the REF period \[ **S1**\]. 

 SIRAKOSS was acquired by OssDsign in November 2020, enabling the new partnership to market innovative products in the USA and Europe, the two major territories for this technology. The OssDsign deal of GBP8.4M to acquire SIRAKOSS yielded GBP3.8M to investors and other shareholders in November 2020, with final payments due in 2021 with additional future milestone and royalty payments agreed. \[ **S2**\] 

 The growth of SIRAKOSS led to an increase in headcount during the REF period, growing from 2 FTE to 7 FTE. Professor Gibson continues to work with SIRAKOSS/OssDsign on a 0.4FTE basis. The expansion also supported a range of subcontracted services by the company, including finance, IP, regulatory, IT and marketing/branding, all to UK\-based companies \[ **S3**\]. 

 OssDsign anticipate product launches based on the SIRAKOSS acquisition, starting in 2021. Completion of milestones to date, along with achieving major projected commercial milestones during the REF period, supported a significant increase in company valuation and a growth in company size, increasing the headcount significantly. These activities enable SIRAKOSS/OssDsign to market innovative products in the two major territories for this technology, in a bone graft market worth over USD3 billion. The next stage of growth anticipated in 2021, based on this acquisition, will be to build commercial sales in the USA and to capture clinical evidence. 

 Investment has been supported by industry recognition of the SIRAKOSS technology, through a number of awards. In 2014, the technology was awarded the Venture Prize from The Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers \[ **S4**\]. The company has been shortlisted twice in the Scottish Enterprise Life Science Awards, first for the Investment of the Year \(2016\) and then for the Innovation Award \(2020\) \[ **S5**\]. 

 **Creating 2 new products that fill unmet commercial needs** 

  

 The SIRAKOSS technology has led to the development of 2 new products, all of which address unmet clinical needs, namely the availability of a synthetic bone graft substitute material with a similar efficacy to biologics but with a lower cost and reduced risk. A CE Mark for the first product, Osteo<sup>3</sup> Granules, was awarded in 2019 \[ **S6**\] and the second product, Osteo<sup>3</sup> ZP Putty, a formulation with ready\-to\-use intra\-operative handling characteristics, was cleared by the FDA in the USA for use in trauma and spine surgery in 2020 \[ **S7**\]. Current synthetic materials do not provide surgeons with a bone graft that performs at a level that reliably matches or exceeds that of autograft, or approach the efficacy of expensive biologics. A clear unmet commercial need exists for a synthetic material that achieves clinical outcomes that would meet or exceed autograft, and would approach the performance of biologics but at lower cost to healthcare providers. A US\-based orthopaedic spine surgeon said “ *the bone graft technology that has been developed by Sirakoss is very interesting and I found the existing data to be very compelling, demonstrating at a minimum an equivalent performance to autograft… I believe that these results will be of great interest to surgeons who rely on these types of bone graft substitutes. In summary, based upon my review, I believe that this novel material represents an exciting advance in synthetic bone graft technology*” \[ **S8**\]. 

 At the time of acquisition SIRAKOSS was a pre\-revenue company but the acquirer, OssDsign, anticipate product launches in 2021. Innovation continues, including a new bone graft composition developed by SIRAKOSS in 2019\-2020, with a patent application submitted in August 2020. This new composition will enable new clinical applications of the core science, extending into medical implants such as spinal cages.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by the Military History Group has examined the development of Armed Forces using historical case studies to analyse and explain military performance and effectiveness, including. command and leadership, performance and participation, and technological development. 

 This research played a role in shaping the UK commemorative agenda during the First World War Centenary with considerable impact on public understanding of that conflict. Initially, the Centenary of the First World War did not include the battles of movement in 1918, and would have conveyed a narrative of unremitting attrition. Sheffield was able to include in the Centenary the Battle of Amiens and subsequent actions in 1918, which were characterised by movement. This is important because it both overturned the narrative of attrition and demonstrated the existence of a “learning curve” among the British generals and General Staff of the period. 

 Research done by the Military History Group \(MHG\) has also had significant pedagogical impact upon the professional education of militaries through its use in training exercises and course development, contributing to the strategic aims of contemporary militaries as well as influencing individual understanding amongst military personnel. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The group substantially advanced existing interpretive concepts regarding strategic and tactical development amongst allied forces in Twentieth Century conflict through three major contributions. Firstly, the MHG’s research included an expansion of the “learning curve” model, that term having been initiated in the 1970s by revisionist historians of the First World War. The second contribution derived through the study of adaptation and innovation within the British Army officer corps 1914\-1918. The third is the relative importance of technological development in the implementation of air power by the RAF. Their work in each of these areas is central to the Findings \[F\] described below: 

 <ins>a\) Command & Leadership</ins> 

 The narrative had taken hold that the First World War had been fought only in trenches, in static formations, and that nothing had been learnt throughout its course. This has been comprehensively disproven yet the narrative persists. Indeed, the beginning and the end of the war on the Western Front were characterised by movement and, in the case of the latter, by considerable tactical and technological innovation. 

 <ins>F1.</ins> Sheffield has produced a nuanced re\-interpretation of Douglas Haig’s generalship. This refutes the perception that he was callous and incompetent, situating Haig’s command in the context of the military, technological and political realities of 1914\-18, and establishing his generalship as central to the 1918 victories \[R1\]. 

 <ins>F2.</ins> Jones’ work demonstrates that professional standards, training, and planning amongst of the British Army officers in 1914 were considerably higher than has been previously recognised by historians. He attributes this to experience gained on campaign in South Africa \(1899\-1902\), pre\-war training, and a generally embraced meritocratic system of promotion. The result was much higher level of battlefield effectiveness in 1914 than has been previously recognised \[R2 and R3\]. 

 <ins>b\) Performance & Participation</ins> 

 The group have re\-assessed the performance of allied forces during the First World War, considering their effectiveness and cultural significance. 

 <ins>F3.</ins> Sheffield’s revisionist stance calls for a shift in interpretation to recognise the British Army’s decisive role in the war. He has emphasised the difficulties in transforming a mass citizen army into a militarily effective force that made a decisive contribution to victory \[R3\]. 

 <ins>F4.</ins> Jones has published a reassessment of Britain’s experience of the Battle of the Somme, arguing that it embraced ‘Total War’ principles to a hitherto unrecognised level. The ‘totality’ of the experience contributed to the enormous cultural significance of the battle in British consciousness \[R4\]. 

 <ins>c\)</ins> <ins>Technological Development</ins> 

 The group have achieved new insights around military technological development notably in connection with air power. Buckley has re\-examined the use and importance of technology in the development and implementation of air power, British inter\-war air and defence policy, inter\-service and international co\-operation, and air power and ‘Total War’. 

 <ins>F5.</ins> In light of the centenary anniversary of the formation of the RAF \(2018\), Buckley synthesised this research on a hundred years of British Air Power, examining seminal moments in that history and, crucially, anchoring that history in future challenges facing the RAF in a new century of cyber challenges and space flight innovations \[R5 & R6\]. Throughout, Buckley has demonstrated the close relationship between government policy, defence doctrine, and equipment procurement and integration.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings from the MHG at Wolverhampton have led to two main areas of impact \[I\]. The first concerns a significant policy change regarding the centenary of the First World War and the second relates to impacts in pedagogy, of which there are three. 

 <ins>I1. Policy Change: UK Commemorative Agenda and the First World War Centenary</ins> 

 The application of the group’s research has influenced the UK Government’s policy on the First World War Centenary. This has given rise to further impacts on public understanding of the conflict, for example understanding the relevance of Amiens, as well as pedagogical impacts on professional military education. 

 Central to changing policy regarding the First World War Centenary has been the ability to persuade public and politicians that the “futility” narrative had been a flawed one, that Haig’s generalship encompassed a process of learning from its mistakes, and that the British Army that ended the war was considerably more advanced than the one that entered it \[F1\]. Political acceptance of that version of events came from Michael Gove in 2014 and he cited Sheffield as an influence on his thinking \[C1\]. 

 The official programme of commemoration first announced in 2012 had omitted the 1918 Allied victories, thus endorsing the “futility” narrative refuted by Sheffield \[F3\]. The subsequent addition of a major ceremony to commemorate the Battle of Amiens re\-balanced that view. Significantly, Sheffield helped persuade Andrew Murrison, The Prime Minister’s Special Representative for the Centenary of the Great War, to include Amiens \[C2\] \[F1\]. 

 Sheffield was also influential in the policy debate in Parliament in July 2017 and his work was cited extensively by Dr Julian Lewis, MP, to support the addition of Amiens to the programme \[C3\]. Lewis was Chair of the Defence Select Committee at the time and his voice was an important addition to those advocating the inclusion of Amiens in the programme. Lewis stated that: 

 “A book called “Forgotten Victory” \[R3\] is a study of the western front battles that rightly draws attention to the 100 days campaign in which the allied coalition won a sequence of decisive victories between mid\-July and early November 1918. Its author, Professor Gary Sheffield, regrets the extent to which the British success in those battles at the end of the first world war has been disregarded. … So it is absolutely right that, as well as commemorating all the disasters of world war one, one of which we are commemorating today, we will next year recognise the triumph of the battle of Amiens in August 1918. Like others who have spoken in the debate, I pay the warmest tribute to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South West Wiltshire \(Dr Murrison\) for all the great work he has done on this rolling series of commemorations of the events, failures and successes of the first world war.” \[C3\] 

 This was a significant change to the original programme and was accepted as such by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in their evaluation report of the Centenary \[C4\]. 

 <ins>I2.</ins> <ins>Pedagogical Impacts: Professional Military Education</ins> 

 The group’s findings have shaped military training policies and practices, and these have impacted upon the successful delivery of strategic priorities and influenced the understanding of serving personnel. 

 I2a. The British Army’s major contribution to the Centenary was Operation REFLECT. A core aim was to learn ‘lessons that will enhance our own professional understanding’. There were three REFLECT Staff Rides to France and Belgium \(2014; 2016 & 2018\), to study “how the character of warfare was transformed by the combined mass citizen armies, industrial production and new technologies” \[C5\]. Jones and Sheffield were central to delivering these aims \[F1\-F4\]. Sheffield’s research shaped the structure of all three tours, collaborating with Major\-General James Cowan, GOC 3 Division \(Director of REFLECT 2014\) and Major\-General Mungo Melvin \(Lead Military Advisor on Staff Rides\). Sheffield influenced the route, key points of interest, the themes to be discussed, the recommended readings and the selection of supporting historians. Sheffield’s and Jones’ research were included in the research guide issued as preparatory reading \[C5\]. As a senior historian, Sheffield provided historical analysis on REFLECT 2014, and was the Lead Historian on REFLECT 2016, giving presentations on the battlefields to the entire party and providing context and analysis of operations. He acted as a roving mentor during syndicate discussions that considered how the lessons of 1914\-18 could inform the modern military. REFLECT 2016 involved 200 military participants mainly from the British Army, with representatives from French, German, Commonwealth and US Armed forces, the RAF and the MOD. Jones led a syndicate of eight officers \(five British, three overseas\). This group’s feedback noted a deepened understanding of the Somme Campaign \[C6\], demonstrating fundamental change to the way the First World War has been understood by the British military. 

 I2b. Jones’ research achieved pedagogical impacts in the professional education programmes of the Portuguese and Australian militaries. In 2015, Jones’ work on leadership in the British Army \[F2\] resulted in an invitation to address officers at the Portuguese Military Academy. Jones’ research spoke to contemporary debates on problems facing the modern Portuguese Army and offered lessons as to how these might be overcome. The Academy noted the ‘importance of his research’ to their contemporary activities \[C7\]. In 2018 Jones developed a webinar for the Australian Defence Force’s professional military education service, *The Cove*, used by c.5,000 members of that force. Aired on 20 July 2018, Jones’ research was deployed to illustrate the use of pre\-emptive adaptation and innovation \[F2 and F4\]. Major Andrew Banks, Force Provost Marshal, testified how this had directly enforced the ADF’s “mantra that individuals should seek innovative methods to achieve their aims” \[C8\]. 

 I2c. Buckley’s research on air power has been utilised by the MoD, as part of the Chief of the Air Staff’s Trenchard Fellowship Scheme for serving members of the RAF. Working in conjunction with Buckley and the University of Wolverhampton, the MoD has invested £700,000 into an MA in Air, Space and Cyber Power Studies that started in September 2019.  The course included the work of Buckley \[R6\], which was also adopted as a core text on the Chief of the Air Staff’s Reading List \[C10\]. New appointments \(Air Commodore Pete Gray \(retired\) and Dr Maria Burczynska\), enabled the development and improvement of the ‘intellectual capital of the RAF’ \[C9\]. The programme is directly linked to the Strategic Priorities detailed in the RAF Command Plan and the RAF Strategy 2017 and expands the horizons of the MOD’s current provision to “meet the challenges of the future by incorporating space and cyber power” \[C9\]. The award and delivery of the course demonstrate Buckley’s research impact in relation to shaping the policies of professional military education \[F5\]. Air power has long been an essential component in modern warfighting and the research findings have had strategic value as they have influenced how RAF officers are trained. 

 In terms of impact overall, attitudes to the First World War have changed and research findings have actively informed and shaped the way the British and other militaries educate their forces.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peter’s maritime design history research has underpinned commercial, economic and cultural impacts in countries around the world. It has transformed marketing and sales processes for 4 global shipping companies, enhancing customer confidence and increasing sales. It has also enabled a new approach to stock acquisition for the world’s largest ferry operator, enabling very considerable savings \(estimated at over USD80,000,000\) and encouraging innovation. These benefits have been realised in Denmark, Sweden, China and Japan. In North America and the UK, Peter’s research has stimulated cultural tourism through contributions to major new exhibitions, attracting large audiences, new funding and new revenue through book sales. Finally, Peter’s research has reached global audiences, with 26,000 copies of Peter’s books sold since 2013, generating over GBP1,001,000, and through TV programmes broadcast internationally, attracting audiences of 2,000,000\+.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Academic research on maritime history has traditionally focused on technical design, largely exploring military history, not merchant shipping. Research by GSA’s Professor Bruce Peter has transformed the field by building a new body of work that combines the history of technology with design and business history and cultural studies methods. His approach has created fresh insights into the architectural and technical design, consumer culture and operational contexts of twentieth century passenger ships in British, Danish and international contexts. Through interviews \(with naval architects, interior designers and shipping company managers\) and extensive archival research, the body of work ascertains relationships between the technology, engineering and economy of modern ships and their aestheticisation for public consumption. Peter’s approach is innovative in its application of these methods to analyse the subject equally in terms of the ‘production’ of ships, the ‘consumption’ of their interiors and onboard facilities by users, and their cultural and design contexts in terms of architecture, fashion and other related areas. Comprising mainly monographs, Peter’s research falls into two broad areas: applying his innovative approach to examine particular ships, companies and types of passenger vessel; and investigating the history of ship design through the different lenses. 

 The first of these areas can be illustrated by three key examples. In 2007, Peter explored 70 years of the history and context of the passenger ship design work of Knud E. Hansen \(KEH\), a naval architecture consultancy based in Denmark with clients around the world. Peter’s research develops a new understanding of how a small specialist firm, innovating primarily in ferry and cruise ship design, developed operationally efficient vessels with unprecedented ranges of facilities to attract wider demographics of travellers and generate increased onboard revenue. The research introduces insights into the thoughts of the company's famous ship engineers, including Knud E. Hansen, Tage Wandborg, Dag Rogne and Holger Terpet. \[R1\] Following this research, and working with Canadian maritime historian Philip Dawson, Peter co\-authored *Queen Elizabeth 2: Britain’s Greatest Liner* in 2008, exploring the social and cultural contexts from which the liner emerged and providing an in\-depth view of the design process, from earliest proposals to detailed designs of different iterations of the vessel. Peter looks in detail at how – and why – the world’s most famous ocean liner has been transformed from a futuristic Modernist icon into a 'retro' ship, based upon nostalgia for a lost 'golden age' of inter\-war liner travel. \[R2\] A third example includes Peter’s 2010 design history of the roll\-on, roll\-off \(ro\-ro\) ferry from the mid\-nineteenth century until the present day. *The Ferry: A Drive\-Through History* comprehensively documented for the first time the design origins of the modern ro\-ro and the various international strands of ferry design development, filling a significant gap in the historical record of modern merchant shipping. The work revealed the challenges relating to the compromises between commercial requirements for fast throughput and safety concerns arising from open and undivided vehicle decks. \[R3\] 

 Examples of Peter’s investigation of ship design more broadly include the co\-authored 2006 *Cruise: Identity, Design and Culture*, exploring the design and culture of cruise ships from the interwar period to the present day. Using a cultural studies perspective, Peter’s work examines both interior and exterior design, as well as onboard entertainment and the dining experience. \[R4\] This was followed in 2010 with *Ship Style: Modernism and Modernity at Sea in the 20th Century,* which focused on modern passenger ship design since the 1880s and contained original scholarship on the manifestation of modernism in ships and their interiors, as well as the influence of modern ships on architecture, design and spatial planning ashore. Comparing and contrasting the ways that modernism was interpreted in ship design in various European countries, the USA, Israel and elsewhere was a further innovation. \[R5\] 

 A significant sole\-authored work \(published in English and Danish\) was *Dansk Linjefart*, the first published account of how Denmark became the leading nation in international liner shipping and how Danish liner operators applied innovative technologies, including propulsion and cargo handling efficiency, to gain increased advantage in what is a highly competitive market. The research focused on the technical innovations, business histories and operational contexts of the major shipping lines – DFDS, EAC and Maersk – and involved interviews with leading Danish naval architects, engineers and technical staff who had been involved in the development of Danish owned and built cargo liners and container ships from the 1950s onwards. For this project, A.P. Møller\-Maersk enabled Peter to interview their current senior technical and design staff, which generated unique material, unavailable elsewhere, on the development of the company’s newest container ships. \[R6\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Taken together, the research constitutes an authoritative and original body of knowledge documenting and contextualising the development of design of modern merchant ships. This body of knowledge has transformed marketing and sales processes for global shipping companies, enabled a new approach to stock acquisition for the world’s largest ferry operator, stimulated cultural tourism through contributions to major new exhibitions and enhanced public interest and understanding in maritime design. Impact has been global, spanning the UK, North America, Scandinavia, China and Japan. 

####  Transforming marketing and sales processes for global shipping companies 

 Ship design and construction is a costly and competitive activity, representing a considerable financial risk \(USD2,000,000\+\) for clients and investors. Conventional marketing strategies were insufficiently refined in the specificity of technical and contextual information and something else was needed to help companies mitigate the risks. As a result of his research, Peter has been invited by 4 major Danish shipping companies to produce accessible literature to promote technological innovations, products and services to – and build and strengthen relationships with – clientele in international markets. These authoritative works of maritime history scholarship have been able to convey comprehensive knowledge to convince clients who themselves are technical and business experts. Specific examples include: 

-  **Knud E.Hansen** has worked with Peter for over a decade, using his publications as corporate gifts and marketing tools. Since August 2013, KEH has gifted approximately 850 of Peter’s books as part of an enhanced sales process, gaining 28 major commissions for complete designs plus over 900 other commissions from leading European shipowners and major Chinese shipyards, including Jinling Shipyard in Nanjing, for which the company designed ultra\-large ro\-ro ferries for DFDS, Grimaldi Lines and Finnlines. The tendering process included the client providing a score for professional reputation, which the books effectively demonstrated. In 2016 the company commissioned a third book, *Ship Design Through Eight Decades,* to celebrate their 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary and to present as an exclusive corporate gift. As KEH’s Managing Director noted, Peter’s work has helped to ‘strengthen the image of our company and encourage new clients better to understand our background, expertise and key skills’. \[S1\] 

-  **MAN Diesel & Turbo**, since renamed MAN Energy Solutions, a marine engineering firm and propeller licensee, bought 300 copies of Peter’s 2015 book, *The Story of the Kappel Propeller,* which itself was commissioned by the Technical University of Denmark and provides a comprehensive understanding of what lead to the development of this innovative propeller type. Senior Manager Jens Ring Neilsen has said that MAN includes the book as part of their general promotion of the product, as it ‘accurately informs … potential customers about the lengthy, complex and precise research processes through which the Kappel propeller was developed’ and ‘allows clients to feel knowledgeable about the propeller’s background and thereby makes them feel more confident about its effectiveness’. Prior to using the book as a sales tool, the company sold 50 propellers in 13 years \(2003\-2017\). Since including the book in its sales strategy, sales have increased exponentially, with 70 propellers selling in a 3\-year period \(2017\-2019\) \[S2\] 

-  In late 2013, **A.P. Møller\-Maersk**, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, commissioned an expanded English\-language version of Peter’s book *Dansk Linjefart*, which featured Maersk ships, translated as *Danish Liners Around the World* \(2014\) and used by Maersk as corporate gifts. Henning Morgen, Maersk Group Historian, describes the value of Peter’s research as ‘useable and credible in the production of postings on social media, reaching a global audience that includes… employees, clients and other stakeholders’, helping ‘in particular… to foster better customer relations’ and enabling ‘large numbers of people to develop knowledge about our background and values’. Maersk social media reaches the company’s 80,000 employees in 130 countries and 3,075,000\+ customers, stakeholders and followers. \[S3\] 

-  Another major Danish shipping company, **DFDS**, commissioned a substantial book, *DFDS 150* \(Lyngby: Polyteknisk Forlag, 2016\) for their 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and bought large numbers of copies to use as corporate gifts. \[S4\] According to Gert Jakobsen, Vice President Communications at DFDS, the book is ‘the DFDS Group’s point of reference as regards the company’s history and is widely used in all 21 countries in which DFDS is represented, from Norway to Turkey, from Ireland and the UK to the Baltic countries … It forms the basis from which daily answers to questions and requests from the public, individuals, media, learning institutes or politics are answered’ and ‘has supplied and continues to supply historical information used in our communications via social media’ which reaches over 18,000 people.’ 

####  Enabling a new approach to stock acquisition for Stena Ro\-Ro 

 Peter’s co\-written book with Japanese maritime historian Tsuyoshi Ishiyama, *Japanese Ferries,* formed the basis for a presentation on Japanese ferries, their design, and the Japanese domestic ferry market at the 2013 ShipPax Ferry Shipping Conference, attended by shipping professionals from around the world. A presentation led to an invitation by the world’s largest ferry owner \(by gross tonnage and freight capacity\) **Stena Ro\-Ro**, to present to its senior managers, commercial and technical staff at its headquarters in Gothenburg in December 2013. The Sales & Purchase Manager at Stena Ro\-Ro has described this presentation as ‘opening the door to something which has given us new experience and new challenges’, resulting in the decision to purchase a second hand ferry from Japan. Peter’s research was the catalyst for this new approach to stock acquisition, enabling both the acquisition of this ship for Stena RoRo and the ship sale for its Japanese owner in 2019. Shipbrokers specialising in ferry sale and purchase estimate the ferry’s value at approximately USD12,000,000. An equivalent ferry, bought new, would cost over USD100,000,000, thereby saving Stena RoRo over USD80,000,000, relative to building equivalent new tonnage. \[S5\] 

  

####  Stimulating cultural tourism and enhancing major new exhibitions 

 Peter was commissioned by the new **Danish national maritime museum, Museet for Søfart** to write the official book about its site and context, the design of the new building \(by the leading Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, costing DKK330,000,000\), and its permanent displays. Publication of the book coincided with the opening of the new museum in October 2013. 5,000 copies of the book were produced by the leading Swedish architectural publisher Arvinius\+ Orfeus in Danish and English editions entitled respectively *Museet i Dokken* and *The Museum in the Dock,* for sale to museum visitors and as a corporate gifts. The museum’s architects also purchased 200 copies of the book which they use as part of their marketing strategy for the international showcasing of their practice and, as Bjarke Ingels’ architect David Zahle states, ‘to gain fresh commissions.’ As the Chairman and CEO of ‘Maritim Museums Byg Aps’, a body established for fundraising and managing the construction of the new museum, has said, ‘the publication of the book has greatly helped to put the project on the world map.’ \[S6\] 

 In 2017 Peter was invited by **Victoria & Albert Museum** senior curator, Ghislaine Wood \(now Acting Director, Sainsbury Centre\), and her American colleague Daniel Finamore \(Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, MA\) to act as expert consultant on a major international touring exhibition, *Ocean Liners: Speed and Style*. For Wood, Peter’s books on ocean liners, *Ship Style* and *Cruise: Identity, Design and Culture,* ‘were an important source of inspiration and knowledge’ which led to the invitation to participate. The exhibition used themes and case\-studies derived from Peter’s books and he contributed two chapters to the exhibition catalogue. 16,500 copies of the catalogue were produced and the exhibition was seen by over 500,000 visitors in Salem, London and Dundee, generating substantial revenues for the 3 venues. For the V&A, this is a significant outcome when compared against their benchmark of success \(the ‘David Bowie Is,’ exhibition \(2013\-18\), shown at eleven venues and attracting 2,000,000 visitors\). As the exhibition’s curator notes, ‘As the inaugural show of V&A Dundee, it was at the centre of the £80million regeneration programme … Visitor feedback confirmed that the exhibition was successful in enhancing their understanding of the design and cultural impact of the ocean liner \(97%\) and how it had inspired artists, designers and filmmakers \(96.6%\), as well as capturing a sense of life on board an ocean liner \(95%\).’ For 67% of visitors, it was their sole or main reason for visiting Dundee. \[S7\] 

 The exhibition has also led to ‘significant tangible benefits’ for the **Peabody Essex Museum** \(PEM\), its initial host. Finamore, the museum’s Associate Director, has identified Peter’s contribution to enhancing public awareness of the subject, reaching larger audiences, preserving maritime art and artefacts, and improving the museum’s professional profile amongst leaders in the field, including maritime scholars and collectors. Since the *Ocean Liners* exhibition, the Peabody has received 7 offers of significant collections, 2 of which they have accepted, and attracted the involvement of prominent American collectors and their families. *Ocean Liners* also enabled the museum to establish a new relationship with a major regional bank, who became a USD100,000\+ sponsor of the exhibition and are now poised to sponsor a second show scheduled for 2021. Finally, the exhibition has significantly increased outreach, including 140 placements in print media, yielding circulation of 7,650,356; mention in 40 known blogs; and 591 mentions in social media with a potential reach of 6,200,000 views. As Finamore has stated, ‘the impact of our exhibition and book project on PEM was among the most effective we have undertaken, and our consultations with Bruce Peter helped assure the impact and overall success of this project.’ \[S8\] 

 Following his contribution to *Ocean Liners,* Peter was commissioned by Wood to write two chapters for the monograph accompanying her next major exhibition *Art Deco by the Sea*, inaugurated at the **Sainsbury Centre for the Arts in Norwich** in 2020 and, like *Ocean Liners*, intended to generate knowledge and to achieve economic impact. Covid\-19 has prevented these objectives from being realised as anticipated; however, the exhibition had attracted 15,000 visitors by late\-November 2020 and expanded its national and international reach through its selection for the BBC’s *Culture in Quarantine* series. Wood describes this as ‘the most significant showing of Art Deco in Britain since the Thirties exhibition at the Hayward in 1976’ and states that Peter’s ‘great empirical knowledge of architectural history and the histories of transport were a vital part of the project.’ \[S7\] 

####  Enhacing public interest and understanding in maritime design 

 Peter has enabled the expansion of public knowledge of maritime design history, reaching large popular audiences through his role as expert contributor to TV programmes for major UK broadcasters: *Queen Mary: Greatest Ocean Liner* \(Scottish Television for BBC 2, 2016\); *Great British Royal Ships: Her Majesty’s Yacht Britannia* \(Channel 5, 2017, 1,000,000\+ viewers\); and *QE2: The World’s Greatest Cruise Ship* \(Channel 5, 2018, 1,000,000\+ viewers\). The programmes were subsequently re\-sold internationally by Channel 5’s parent company, Viacom, and have been viewed in much of Europe and the USA \(via PBS\). Programmes made in recent years add to a suite of earlier shows that continue to be broadcast, generating economic activity through programme\-making and sales and through accompanying commercial advertising slots. Approximately 25,000 copies of Peter’s books published since 2013 have been sold around the world, generating over GBP1,001,000. \[S9\] As well as public programmes, Peter was also invited by the Dorchester Hotel Group – operating nine luxury hotels in the UK, Italy, France and the USA – to record one of eight interviews with the art collector and curator Cathy Wills, based on his contributions to the *Ocean Liners* and *Art Deco by the Sea* exhibitions. The interviews were sent to 17,000 global clients of the Dorchester group to raise brand awareness, and made available on the Dorchester’s website. \[S10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 By adopting a historical lens, Valerie Worth\-Stylianou enables healthcare professionals, social scientists, archivists and others to reflect on major debates in women’s healthcare and fetal medicine. Her research into early modern scientific and literary French texts about birth provides innovative support for midwives and obstetricians to develop as ‘reflective practitioners’ – a process promoted by professional, statutory and regulatory bodies. Worth\-Stylianou collaborated with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives, midwifery trainers and research midwives, through workshops, exhibitions and public events. ‘Birth Through History’ empowered health professionals to develop as reflective practitioners and to communicate in an informed manner with a wide lay audience. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Worth\-Stylianou's research is marked by its period\-spanning breadth. She draws on information from the time of the earliest printed midwifery manuals in Europe \(in the sixteenth century\) through to the emergence of men\-midwives \(i.e. surgeons specialised in childbirth\) in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and makes comparisons with contemporary writings. Working with healthcare professionals, archivists and historians, in ‘Birth Through History’ she has explored the constants and changes, from the early modern period to the present day. Following from an earlier study of obstetric writings in French before 1630 \( *Les traités d’obstétrique en langue française au seuil de la modernité*\), her book on pregnancy and birth in early modern France **\[R1\]** combined translations and critical editions of treatises by François Rousset, Jean Liebault, Jacques Guillemeau, Jacques Duval and Louis de Serres with a bilingual companion website \(http://www.birthingtales.org/\) including a glossary, commented text extracts and contextual analysis. The 2013 volume made ‘a contribution as welcome as it is well\-documented’, as the review in *French History* put it, and was Winner of the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women’s 2014 prize for Best Teaching Edition for the ‘challenging of conventional views of female subordination and inferiority’. 

 Worth\-Stylianou followed up on this research, on the one hand extending her field of enquiry into how the history of birthing is represented in modern French 'autofiction' **\[R2\]**, which mediates personal experiences and creative writing, and on the other focusing on the historical circulation of information about pregnancy, birth and women's health. She examined printed works, their dissemination, translation, incorporation of images, and readership **\[R4\]**, and the ways and extent to which these impacted on developments in the practice of birthing care and obstetric medicine. She used this approach in researching and preparing the exhibition featuring materials from the Royal College of Obstetricians’ own archives. The booklet accompanying the exhibition, co\-authored with the Chair of De Partu, the research group on the history of childbirth, contextualised the written and visual documents, investigating the controversies that surrounded many of these writings and ideas, with attention to the ""porous boundaries between translation, interpretation and commentary"" \(Worth\-Stylianou's phrase for a 2018 seminar at Princeton\) involved in translating historical medical texts and transposing medical knowledge to a new, sometimes transnational cultural setting. Another focus of her research investigated who was present at labour and birth historically **\[R3\]**, and how this can inform current medical, cultural and anthropological discussions. Since 2018, Worth\-Stylianou has been working on the medical and cultural history of ‘involuntary childlessness’ \(historically termed ‘infertility’\), with the early history of this tracked in a major article discussing the different language and approaches of midwives, surgeons and physicians in sixteenth\- and seventeenth\-century France **\[R5\]**. Worth\-Stylianou’s research foregrounds how shifts and debates in understanding were closely dependent on the evolving use of the French language, notably the frequent recourse to metaphors and comparisons to explain medical and biological observations. 

 As one of the leading figures in this research area, Worth\-Stylianou was invited to author the article ‘Midwifery’ **\[R6\]** for the influential *Oxford Bibliographies* \(2017\), and her international status is demonstrated by the requests to give keynote addresses at conferences bringing together midwives, obstetricians and historians in the UK, France \(Paris 2015, 2017 and Bordeaux 2019\) and Austria \(Vienna 2019\).

 **4. Details of the impact** **Shaped public understanding and professional policy on good practice in gynaecology, pregnancy and childbirth** 

 Worth\-Stylianou’s research focuses on the significance, from 1500 to the present, of clear written publications and sympathetic, nuanced oral communications between healthcare professionals and users. Drawing on her research, she assesses their contribution to contemporary public understanding of good practice in pregnancy and childbirth. This is evidenced by her contributions as a lay member of the Women’s Voices panel of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(RCOG\) where she: 

-  Mediated medical information for lay readers in contributions to the RCOG’s patient information leaflet ‘A Breech Baby at the End of Pregnancy’ \(2017—subsequently recorded as a podcast; 2045 listeners\). **\[S1\]** 

-  Mediated the presentation of complex medical information addressed to both medically\-trained and other parties as one of two invited lay members of the team reviewing RCOG benign gynaecological indicators for UK hospitals \(2015\-16\). The final report informs quality improvement initiatives and enables comparative benchmarking of gynaecological services in NHS Hospitals in England. **\[S2\]** 

-  Was one of 25 lay members selected to contribute to the syllabus review, ‘Training Specialists of the Future’, which underpinned the new RCOG Curriculum \(launched 2019\). Worth\-Stylianou’s contributions at the foundational stage emphasised the importance of shared information between patients and healthcare professionals; support for professionals through traumatic incidents; and the use of sensitive language in the birthing room to respect the diversity of family groupings **\[S3\]**. On the syllabus’s launch, the Head of Patient Engagement recognised the importance of ensuring that the new framework guarantees specialists of tomorrow have non\-technical skills, alongside the technical skills and knowledge to deliver high quality care: ‘Many of the themes that emerged through engagement with the public were around the importance of these non\-technical skills. Skills around communication; developing equal, trusting partnerships with patients; and the ability to provide tailored care and support so patients feel well informed and in control of their decision making.’ **\[S3\]** 

 **Strengthened reflective performance of practitioners in delivery of professional services** 

 In collaboration with the RCOG, the Royal College of Midwives \(RCM\) and De Partu, Worth\-Stylianou developed an exhibition in the RCOG’S Learning Centre and a display in the joint RCOG\-RCM Library. Comments by midwives after the seminar held to mark the opening of the exhibition included *'Being addressed by academics, the CEO of the RCOG, and the Director of Midwifery, RCM, really made me feel valued as a professional*.' The 2015\-2017 exhibition contextualised materials from the College’s archives, investigating the controversies and challenges of transposing medical knowledge to a new, sometimes transnational cultural setting. The exhibition’s digital version attracted 525 views in the first 6 weeks **\[S4\]**, and several hundred copies of the accompanying brochure were disseminated within twelve months **\[S5\]**. A former RCOG and RCM Archivist commented: ‘ *The posters and booklets helped… \[with\] engaging visitors who may not otherwise set foot in the library. \[… Worth\-Stylianou’s work\] inspired further displays requested by the College President who had been impressed by the increased visibility of the library and heritage collections.*’ **\[S5\]** 

 200 Foundation Year 1 and 2 doctors attending a 2015 study day with Worth\-Stylianou to decide whether to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology viewed the exhibition. A female health provider commented that the historical context enabled her to challenge assumptions about health professionals’ gender roles. Subsequent study days in London \(2015\) and Oxford \(2016; 2018\), for practitioners, archivists, and academics, initiated self\-reflection among practitioners and midwifery tutors on history and current debates about: delayed cord\-clamping; parent education for birth and early months; prioritization of post\-natal care; and the human dynamics of successful teamwork in operating theatres. The RCM Professor of Midwifery noted: *‘the project was especially beneficial for student and newly qualified midwives and subsequent discussions indicated that participants were able to draw on historical perspectives to better understand contemporary challenges’* **\[S6\]**. Healthcare professionals recognised the impact on their understanding: ‘ *each presentation gave us a different way of looking at these topics*’ **\[S7\]**. A Professor of Perinatal Education commented: ‘ *The dialogue between academic researchers and practitioners enabled by these study\-days and by the exhibitions modelled a means of linking theory and practice essential for shaping maternity services that best serve the needs of women*.’ **\[S8\]Contribution to continuing personal and professional development** 

 Day conferences on Pregnancy and Birth, and Worth\-Stylianou’s presentations for over 100 student midwives \(2018\) at Oxford Brookes and some 30 Oxfordshire research midwives \(2019\), reached audiences, including practitioners, educators and educational publishers. They empowered attendees to develop their own competences as self\-reflective practitioners and embed this in their professional settings. The 2018 study day, attended by midwives, publishers and historians, specifically reflected Worth\-Stylianou’s expertise in the history and transnational circulation of midwifery textbooks. Uniquely, it brought medical educational publishers \(including the Senior Content Strategist, Nursing and Midwifery, Elsevier\) into dialogue with midwifery tutors, midwives and historians, in particular exploring how two best\-selling textbooks–Mayes and Myles–might be merged **\[S9\]**. The research forum ‘ *has benefitted my work as an editor for the next edition of Mayes Midwifery, one of the leading midwifery textbooks in the UK. This already has a large historical chapter included, and \[the revised edition\] will be informed by this \[workshop\]*’ \(midwifery educator and author\) **\[S9\]**. 

 Worth\-Stylianou has addressed research events for midwives from student status to advanced research midwives. At the 2018 Oxford Brookes conference, attended by over 100 students, tutors and other specialists, Worth\-Stylianou gave the first talk, setting the theme–‘The team around the \[birthing\] woman’–in its historical and transnational context, and proposing subjects for debate, which speakers and delegates used to reflect on their own approaches. The organising Senior Midwifery Lecturer at Oxford Brookes notes that Worth\-Stylianou’s ‘ *talks have been instrumental in helping students situate midwifery care historically and \[to\] understand how it has been shaped by prevailing cultures and social conventions. Valerie’s knowledge and enthusiasm have helped inspire students to think about how midwifery care can be developed*.’ **\[S10\]** In 2019 at the 7<sup>th</sup> ‘Colloque de la Société de la Naissance’ \(Bordeaux\), Worth\-Stylianou’s opening keynote \(attended by some 70 French practitioners\) examined the history of the sense of smell in midwifery, and enabled comparisons with present\-day deliveries. Midwives attending commented that Worth\-Stylianou’s historical research was particularly valuable in validating their goal of patient\-focused individual care, in which attention to all five senses is crucial. **\[S11\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 UofG research on the environmental and economic implications of deep\-sea bottom fishing established a depth below which trawl fishing has negative ecological and economic impacts. This finding provided an important contribution to the negotiation of the new Regulation \(EU\) 2016/2336 of the European Parliament, which applies to deep\-sea fisheries in all EU member states. Effective as of 12 January 2017, bottom\-trawling below 800 metres is prohibited in EU waters \(\~932,000 km<sup>2</sup>\) and by EU vessels in international waters around the central east Atlantic Ocean. As a result, 49 species of vulnerable deep\-sea fishes will never be trawled again, and deep\-sea coral and sponge ecosystems are now protected. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Deep\-sea bottom\-trawling is an invasive fishing technique that uses weighted nets attached to steel plates and heavy rollers to drag the seabed in search of commercially desirable fish species. Sensitive ecosystems, such as coral and sponges and numerous ‘unwanted’ fish species, are destroyed by this fishing method. Limiting the depth to which trawling can occur has long been a priority for scientists, conservation groups and others. The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition of more than 70 environmental organisations, fishers’ groups, and law and policy institutes reported that ‘in 2004, more than one thousand scientists from 69 countries  [signed a statement](http://www.savethehighseas.org/deep-sea-fishing/lobbying-and-advocacy/) calling on governments and the United Nations \(UN\) General Assembly to adopt a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling.’ The UN General Assembly in turn called on countries to restrict deep\-sea trawling. In European Union \(EU\) countries, any such change to regulations was robustly opposed by the fishing industries in several countries, and an initial legislative proposal in 2012 was narrowly defeated. 

 Economically and ecologically sustainable management of fisheries in areas of the deep\-sea requires good quality data on the life history and populations of deep water fish species. Historically, however, such data have been scarce; there is very little long\-term data available for non\-target fish species affected by deep\-sea fishing and for fish species that reside at sea depths deeper than that of typical fishing grounds. 

 Research undertaken between 2008–2009 at the University of Glasgow \(UofG\), led by Dr David Bailey, revealed — for the first time — the spatial extent and indiscriminate nature of deep water fishing in the north\-east \(NE\) Atlantic. This research showed that fish abundance was reduced at depths much lower than the 1500 m maximum depth of commercial fishing, suggesting that the effects of fishing at this depth are transmitted to deeper areas of the ocean. Furthermore, these negative impacts extend to a horizontal distance of more than 70 km beyond the limits of fishing \[1\]. This work was highly cited and became immediately well\-known in deep\-sea research and the conservation community. Meanwhile, progress stalled in international policy discussions on deep\-sea conservation, particularly around setting a depth limit for deep\-sea fishing. 

 In 2014, the UofG team initiated new research to address the following question: should there be a depth limit set for deep\-sea fishing, and if so, at what depth should this limit be set? The UofG’s Dr Bailey and Dr Francis Neat \(of Marine Scotland\) identified a way to address this question by looking at how trends in catch composition change with depth. They used data from trawl surveys collected between 240m and 1,500m in the NE Atlantic. These data derived from the use of different fishing gear used at various locations between 1978 and 2013. The resulting analysis revealed a clear transition in the composition and value of catches at depths of 600 to 800 metres, including a significant increase in biodiversity and in the ratio of discarded to commercial biomass, as well as in the ratio of sharks and rays to commercial biomass. As the ecological impacts increased, the commercial value per unit of effort decreased; trawling at greater depth requires more fuel and pulls up non\-commercial fish species that are discarded \[2\]. 

 The 2015 paper produced from this work \[2\] proposed limiting bottom trawling to a maximum depth of 600 m as an effective management strategy for deep\-sea fishing that would meet the needs of European legislations, such as the Common Fisheries Policy \(EC no. 1380/2013\) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive \(2008/56/EC\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 UofG research on the impacts of trawling at different depths on deep\-sea fish species provided pertinent and timely evidence to support an EU policy in 2016 to ban trawling at depths of 800m or lower. 

 **Lead\-up to policy change** 

 UofG research has played an important role in the long\-running debate concerning deep\-sea trawling and environmental damage. Bailey was a co\-author on a 2011 report \[A\] that reviewed the implementation of previous UN General Assembly resolutions on deep\-sea fisheries, which cited Bailey’s previous deep\-sea data \[3.1\]. This report found that the UN’s resolutions were not being fully implemented, that precious ecosystems were not protected as intended and that the impact on non\-commercial species, which were being caught and discarded as bycatch in significant numbers, was not being adequately measured. This and other work kept up the calls for the seabed’s protection. Nevertheless, EU restrictions imposed in December 2013 were not implemented due to lack of approval from some member states. 

 In 2014, a debate was held at ‘The Future of Scotland’s Deep Sea Fisheries’ \(Edinburgh\), in which Bailey participated as a panel member and discussed his research \[3.1\] on the long\-term changes to deep\-sea fish populations. Speaking on this discussion, the co\-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition highlighted the need for an evidence base to support change: ‘ *We don’t know the value of deep sea ecosystems so we don’t know what we might lose*’ \[B\]. As a result of his participation in this event, the Pew Charitable Trust invited Bailey to speak with EU officials in Brussels in late 2014 about this research. This meeting focussed on the need for changes to trawling depth limits, which had been proposed, to be guided by scientific evidence and led Bailey *et al*. to commence research \(ultimately published in 3.2\) to address this requirement. Bailey was also invited to present to UK policymakers at Westminster \(20 January 2015\) about deep\-sea fisheries and the conservation of deep water ecosystems. He again discussed his earlier work \[3.1\] on the impact of deep\-sea fishing, and his preliminary findings on conservation impact trends as a result of fishing depth \[B\]. In January 2015, Bailey also co\-authored a letter, alongside other UK and international marine scientists, to the UK Fisheries Minister, which advocated for the UK to play a pro\-active role in upcoming EU negotiations on the management of deep\-sea fishing \[C\]. As correspondence between Bailey and the European Commission noted at the time, ‘ *We at the European Commission are very much convinced about the benefits of restricting deep sea fishing to shallower depths like 600m. It is mostly some particular Member States in the EU that criticize your paper and of course parts of the fishing industry, but that is not surprising as they do not want to see any depths limitation in the new legislation on deep sea fishing*’ \[D\]. 

 In August 2015, Bailey’s research \[3.2\] was published, providing evidence of the environmental consequences of seabed trawling, in addition to decreased economic returns for fishermen trawling at then\-current depths. This work was extensively covered in the media across Europe \[E\], given the commercial and political sensitivities of the European fishing industry \(the sector is dominated by France, Spain, the UK and Denmark, but all EU members engage to some extent\). There was significant pushback on the suggested depth limit, and UofG researchers responded accordingly, citing their findings that the dangers to certain bycatch species’ populations, endangered by trawling practice, increased significantly at depths of 600m and greater \[F\]. In October 2015, Bailey spoke at a public event at the Zoological Society of London on the conservation value of European deep\-sea habitats and met with UK government policymakers in attendance \[G\]. These public engagements coincided with the European Parliament reopening discussions on fishing limits. The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition co\-founder, speaking about the UofG research, stated that not only did ‘ *\[we make\] extensive use of their research in our work with policy\-makers in Brussels and in EU Member States advocating for a new and more rigorous regulation for the management of deep\-sea fisheries in EU waters*’, but also that the ‘ *work has…been recognised in numerous discussions amongst Members of European Parliament and their staff, the European Commission and Member States involved in the negotiation of the new legislation*’ \[H\]. 

 On 14 December 2016, the European Parliament passed Regulation \(EU\) 2016/2336 ‘establishing specific conditions for fishing for deep\-sea stocks’, which stated that ‘ *In order to mitigate the potential damaging impacts of bottom trawling, it is appropriate to permit fishing with bottom trawls only at, or above, a depth of 800 metres*’ \[I\]. Adopting an 800m limit was seen as ‘ *a compromise between those rejecting any limit and scientific evidence supporting a shallower 600m limit*’ \[J\]. Reflecting the significance of the research, the Marine Scotland collaborator Dr Francis Neat  joined an EU delegation to a UN workshop on sea\-floor bottom fishing \(held in New York, USA\); he stated that, “… *our study was highlighted by the EU as being an important piece of evidence in their decision to prohibit bottom trawling at depths > 800m. So, it was rewarding to see our efforts being acknowledged at that level*” \[K\]. The EU legislation was also welcomed in the UK by the The Scottish White Fish Producers’ Association, UK’s largest fishing association \[L\]. 

 
 <sup>Figure</sup> <sup>1</sup><sup>: 932,000 km2 now protected \(green\)</sup> 

The new legislation came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2017 and applies across an area of 932,000km<sup>2</sup> \(Fig. 1 green zones, now protected\). It has particular impact across the 15% \(143,000km<sup>2</sup>\) of EU waters \(primarily continental slope\) that has traditionally been fished to 1500m depth. The new legislation will benefit \~49 species of deep\-sea fish, including roundnose grenadier \( *Coryphaenoides rupestris*\), black scabbardfish \( *Aphanopus carbo*\), birdbeak dogfish \( *Deania calceus*\), orange roughy \( *Hoplostethus atlanticus*\), rabbit fish \( *Chimaeridae*\), blue ling \( *Molva dypterygia*\) and anglerfish \( *Lophius piscatorius*\) \[3.1\]. In Scottish ports in 2012, 3,737 tonnes of three deep\-sea fish species \(black scabbardfish, blue ling and Greenland halibut\) were landed by all vessels combined. Of this, 94% were landed by foreign vessels, mostly French and Spanish. Since 2016, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\) data indicate a large drop in landings of ecologically important deep\-sea target species, notably of the endangered roundnose grenadier. Catches of this species decreased from 38 to 30 tonnes in ‘Division 5.b.’ \(area north of UK\); from 725 to 202 tonnes in ‘Division 6’ \(area north\-west of UK\); and from 4 to 0.8 tonnes in ‘Division 7’ \(area west of UK\) \[M\]—some fish are still caught as they can move to shallower waters, which aren’t protected. Furthermore, within the ICES report an observation from the French observers at sea programme, which monitor landings and discards, reported that discards as % weight of total catch had decreased from 5% weight in 2016 to an almost negligible 0.7% weight in 2019, and that this was related to, a\) a change in the depth of the French fleet towards shallower depths; and 2\) attempts to avoid areas where discards are high \[M\]. 

 Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, the adopted EU regulation 2016/2336 has been converted and preserved in the UK as *retained EU law,* thus binding UK fisheries to this legislation. Furthermore, in September 2020 the Scottish Government designated a 100,000km<sup>2</sup> area of national waters in the North\-East Atlantic as the West of Scotland Marine Protected Area \(MPA\). This deep\-sea marine reserve provides additional protections to some of the deepest parts of Scotland’s seas. The region falls outwith the area protected in the EU regulation, but the EU regulation was used as the basis for the area, extending protections against trawling at depths below 800m within the MPA, the boundary of which follows the 800m depth contour of the seabed \[N\]. 

 Additional impacts of the legislation include protection to sea floor cold\-water coral reef and sponge ecosystems. Work at Plymouth University has shown that prohibiting trawl fishing below 800m will substantially increase the area of protection for vulnerable cold\-water corals \(Ireland: from 15% to 43%; UK: from 41% to 53%\), sponges \(Ireland: from 2% to 100%; UK: from 11% to 100%\) and xenophyophore communities \(Ireland: from 7% to 99%; UK: from 13% to 99%\) \[O\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Jim Phillips helped change the Scottish Government’s approach to justice in relation to the miners’ strike, benefiting over 500 ex\-miners in Scotland who were convicted of public order offences in 1984\-85. Phillips used UK Government papers, released under the 30\-year rule in 2014, to reveal the extent of injustice. The findings were shared with campaigners and Scottish Government officials, who reversed earlier policy to appoint an Independent Review of Policing in the Strike in Scotland in June 2018. The Review’s final Report was published in October 2020, accompanied by the Scottish Government’s announcement that the central recommendation, the collective and posthumous pardon of more than 500 ex\-miners, would be legislated for in 2021.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Jim Phillips carried out his research into the miners’ strike in Scotland in two phases. From 2007 to 2011 he used government, industry and union records, integrated with oral history interviews with strike activists \[3.1; 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8\], to establish the distinct character of the strike in Scotland. He found that anti\-union initiatives by National Coal Board \(NCB\) management in 1982\-83 transgressed established customs in the Scottish industry, and that 50% of Scottish miners were in dispute at pit\-level before the British\-wide strike commenced in March 1984. Around 200 miners were sacked by the NCB in Scotland and not reinstated after the strike because of their entanglements in the criminal justice system. Victimisation of union activists was not replicated on this scale anywhere else in the British coalfields by the NCB. 

 From January 2014 to May 2015 Phillips then used minutes of the UK government’s Cabinet Ministerial Group on Coal \(CMGC\) from 1984, released by The National Archives on 1 January 2014. These showed for the first time that the CMGC, which met twice\-weekly, chaired by then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was micro\-managing the strike. The government’s goal, of removing effective union representation from the coal industry, particularly on the question of pit closures, was identified by Phillips in his reading of these minutes and emphasised in subsequent publications \[3.2, 3.3\]. These contained two other new findings, each with implications for understanding justice in the coalfields. 

 First, the Prime Minister intervened on policing, ensuring that strikers were prevented from mustering at power stations, steel works, and other pressure points. Specifically, she asked \(8 May 1984\) why officers in Scotland were not preventing miners from travelling to picket the steel mill at Ravenscraig and ore terminal at Hunterston. The Secretary of State for Scotland was detailed to investigate, and on 10 May eight coachloads of miners were apprehended on the open road, arrested and detained. This practice was thereafter followed by Scottish police, reducing the effectiveness of the strike. 

 Second, the Parliamentary Under\-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office, Michael Ancram, advised that in Scotland additional resources had been provided to bring forward prosecutions against miners \(4 September 1984\). Subsequent penalties for picket\-line offences were typically *at least* four or five times higher than for other public order offences. In some cases, they were ten, fifteen or even twenty times higher. Once arrested, moreover, miners were summarily dismissed by the NCB, and refused reinstatement even where charges were later either dropped or convictions not secured. 

 The research by Phillips established beyond doubt that there was an unusually high level of victimisation of miners’ union activists in Scotland in terms of arrests and dismissals. This met the government’s aim of disciplining the generality of strikers in Scotland, but severely compromised the integrity of the criminal justice system and led to long\-term social and economic consequences for otherwise law\-abiding miners who found themselves on the wrong side of the law.

 **Establishment of Government Review into the Policing of the Miners’ Strike in Scotland** 

 Phillips’ research became known to campaigners via his 2012 book \[3.1\] which established his work as authoritative regarding the miners’ strike in Scotland. Neil Findlay, MSP for Lothians \[5.1\], who has co\-ordinated the ex\-strikers’ campaign for justice since 2010, contacted Phillips in 2013 to seek expert advice on the character and extent of the injustices experienced by the strikers. Findlay noted that ‘ *Jim’s work and knowledge has had a very positive impact on this campaign. \[The research\] showed the extent to which striking miners in Scotland were victimised disproportionately by the criminal justice system … Jim provided my office with briefing notes that were helpful in strengthening the case for an independent review…*’ \[5.1\]. 

 Findlay and fellow Labour MSP Iain Gray, making use of a summary from Phillips of his research using the 30\-year\-old CMGC minutes \[3.2\], then secured a  [2014 anniversary debate](http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=9054&i=92799). The Scottish government at this stage refused to establish a review into the criminal justice aspects of the strike. Findlay commented that ‘ *together with testimonies gathered from ex\-miners … this research helped me strengthen the case further for a review. This was critical in pressuring the Scottish Government to change its position in 2018 and set up the review, chaired by John Scott QC’* \[5.1\]. 

 In October 2016 the UK Government had announced that there would be no official inquiry into policing of the strike in England, giving new impetus to the campaign for a Scottish inquiry, and Findlay, along with Bruce Shields of Thompsons Solicitors, Scotland, representing the National Union of Mineworkers \(NUM\), cited Phillips’ CMGC research \[3.2, 3.3\] to lobby the Scottish Government. In February 2017, Michael Matheson, Cabinet Secretary for Justice, instructed officials to examine claims that systematic injustices had been experienced by strikers. These officials contacted Phillips, interviewed him at length, and read his published analyses. 

 Consequently, in June 2018 Matheson reversed the Scottish government’s position and announced an  [Independent Review of Policing of the Miners’ Strike in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/groups/independent-review-policing-miners-strike/), noting  [to the Scottish Parliament in June 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIJhv-VKIb8) the moral and cultural significance of its topic: ‘ *in some areas of the country most heavily impacted, the sense of having been hurt and wronged remains corrosive and alienating \[including\] those employed in the mining industry at the time … but also wider families and communities’* \[5.2, also quoted in 5.3\]. 

 The review, chaired by John Scott QC \[5.3\], and assisted by Dennis Canavan, former Labour MP and MSP for coalfield constituencies in Stirlingshire; Jim Murdoch, Professor of Public Law at the University of Glasgow; and Kate Thomson, former Assistant Chief Constable in Police Scotland, began collecting evidence in August 2018. John Scott QC commented that ‘ *from early discussions and initial research, it was clear that Professor Phillips was an expert on the strike and … we used his research throughout our work … he was able to offer additional information, advice and suggestions which were of great assistance to us’*. Scott added that Phillips reviewed a first draft of the report and assisted with hearings in ex\-coal communities \[5.3\], eight of which were held during October\-December 2018, where ex\-miners gave testimony \[listed in 5.4, p85\]. 

 **The findings and impact of the Review’s Report** 

 The  [Interim Report](https://www.gov.scot/publications/miners-strike-review-interim-report/) \[5.5\] was published in February 2019, acknowledging Phillips’ support and his ‘ *considerable knowledge about all aspects of the strike’*, stating, ‘ *we have benefitted greatly from his undoubted expertise in this area*.’ The final Report \[5.4\] was delayed due to the Covid\-19 pandemic but finally  [published in late October 2020](https://www.gov.scot/publications/independent-review-impact-communities-policing-miners-strike-1984-85/), and it references Phillips’ research repeatedly, for example noting, ‘ *Jim Phillips has been of invaluable assistance to us throughout the period of the review’,* and opening with a direct quotation from Phillips’ research, that ‘ *the miners’ strike is a site of contested memories*’. 

 The Report notes the continued alienation of many in mining communities from the police and attributes some responsibility for this to the UK government, citing ‘ *the CMGC Minutes of 8 May 1984 \[as\] evidence of, at the very least, their scant disregard for the independence of the police’* \[5.4, p70\]. The Report goes on: ‘ *referring back to some of the points made by Dr Jim Phillips … there are lessons for Government in how to manage such a major change without unnecessary and lasting damage to jobs and communities’*. 

 The Report concludes that ‘ *strikingly, there was widespread recognition on all sides of the disproportionate consequences of the Strike for some miners who were arrested or convicted, particularly in relation to dismissal and all that flowed from it. Taking all of this into account … we have settled on a single recommendation…*’, intended to promote reconciliation and inclusion. That recommendation, based on the conclusion that unfair convictions led to dismissals that were ‘ *disproportionate, excessive and unreasonable’,* was that in the cases of striking miners who had neither previously nor subsequently been in trouble with the law, convictions for ‘ *matters related to the Strike’* that were *‘disposed by way of a fine’* should be pardoned. 

 Humza Yousaf, Cabinet Secretary for Justice, announced upon publication of the Review report that ‘ *the Scottish Government accepts the recommendation in principle, and that we intend to introduce legislation that will give a collective pardon to miners who were convicted for matters related to the strike’* \[5.6\]. This development is now providing vindication to the miners who were wronged. One ex\-miner \(AB\), who supported a young family at the time he was arrested while picketing in Midlothian and then summarily dismissed by the coal board, stated: ‘ *I was blacklisted. I couldn’t get a job for three years … I’m 74 at my next birthday and I’ve never even had a parking ticket … \[being pardoned would\] right a wrong.’* \[quoted in 5.7\]. Another former miner \(AW\) said he was ‘elated’ to know he may now be pardoned \[5.7\]. Widespread media coverage \[e.g. 5.8\] has included calls by Fife Council for a further UK inquiry into the Miners’ Strike \[5.9\].

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  The Challenge: technological barriers preventing the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transport 

 Whilst batteries are emerging as a viable and scalable technology to power cars for the domestic market, hydrogen fuel cells are envisaged as a more appropriate technology for clean\-emission public transportation, including for buses, trains and ferries. This is due to the combination of the high energy value of hydrogen that can translate to a greater range for these modes of transport coupled with sufficient on\-board storage of the fuel. In addition, an infrastructure of centralized refuelling depots can be rolled out, using hydrogen generated via electrolysers from electricity derived from renewable sources. Key to delivering this low carbon vision is the technological expertise in the use of fuel cells and electrolysers at scale. 

  

##  Key Research Findings 

 Since 2003, EaStCHEM Professor Irvine has optimised electrochemically active materials for use in high temperature fuel cells and electrolysers, improving their durability and stability, as well as reducing the cost of manufacture.  His landmark early report concerned the development of new fuel flexible solid oxide anode formulations, such as the perovskite composition LSCM, \(La,Sr\)Mn<sub>0.5</sub>Cr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which enable efficient utilisation of fuels **\[R1\]**, including hydrogen **\[R2\]**, for electricity generation. Separately, proton\-conducting **\[R3\]** oxides and hydride\-conducting oxides **\[R5\]** applicable to hydrogen production were developed, led to the discovery of a highly effective route to fabricate electrolytes for electrolysers **\[R3\]**, materials that have ultimately been patented \( [**US7906006**](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7906006B2/en?oq=US7906006),  [**EP1730327**](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1730327B1/en?oq=EP1730327),  [**CA2561852**](https://patents.google.com/patent/CA2561852C/en?oq=CA2561852),  [**US8262896**](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8262896B2/en?oq=US8262896)\) and adopted by industrial collaborators *LERG* \(see section 4.3\). 

 Irvine’s research on solid state materials led to him being PI on large interdisciplinary grants, such as the EPSRC\-funded Supergen project *Delivery of Sustainable Hydrogen* \( *DOSH*, EPG01244X/1 2008\-2012\). This project broadened his research interests into techno\-economic and policy aspects of using hydrogen to power public transportation, in collaboration with EaStCHEM colleague Dr Martin Smith. They pioneered new technologies and became agents **\[R6\]** in policy development for hydrogen rollout. One direct result from this project was the discovery of redox exsolution, which in turn led to the switching phenomenon discovered for steam electrolysis and fuel cells **\[R4\]** – a more efficient technology for producing and using hydrogen.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  4.1. Input to and implementation of transport policy in Scotland 

 EaStCHEM Professor Irvine’s world\-leading research in fuel cells and electrolysers, as exemplified by **\[R1\-R5\]**, together with his and Dr. Martin Smith’s techno\-economic expertise **\[R6\]**, led to both becoming leading technical advisors on the use of hydrogen for public transport in Scotland. Between 2006 and 2013, Irvine co\-founded and led the *Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association* \( *SHFCA*\) bringing together industry, academia and government, to promote the use of renewably generated \(green\) hydrogen and to create significant new industrial activity/jobs. Smith is presently on *SHFCA*’s board of directors. This “ *extensive research experience and expertise…underpin many of the technological and policy activities that have arisen since the inception of SHFCA*” **\[S1\]**. In 2005, Irvine was appointed to the Scottish Government’s *Hydrogen Energy Group* \( *HEG*\), which formulated the initial hydrogen energy policy for Scotland as part of the 2009 *Climate Change Bill and Renewables Action Plan for Scotland*. This activity, together with input from major demonstrator projects, some driven by the technical expertise of and coordinated by Irvine and/or Smith \(Section 4.2\), has culminated in the publication of the Scottish Government’s *Scottish “Hydrogen Policy Statement”* \(12\-2020\) **\[S2\]**, which is an update of the 2015 document *“2020 Routemap for Renewable Energy in Scotland”*, on which Irvine consulted **\[S3\]**. This commits Scotland to the future decarbonisation of public transport using hydrogen, for which the *Hydrogen Accelerator* programme, led by Irvine, is one of the key drivers \(Section 4.2c\). The Scottish government, now committed to a Hydrogen economy, has already coordinated the investment of “ *over GBP40,000,000*”, which “ *has been successfully invested or earmarked for ground\-breaking hydrogen transport projects*” over the past 5 years **\[S2, p39\]**. Based on its assessment, the Scottish Government estimates that the scale of the economic opportunity from the production and use of hydrogen transport will be “ *over 300,000 jobs supported and Gross Value Added \(GVA\) impacts of GBP25,000,000,000 by 2045*” **\[S2, p4\]**.

##  4.2. Demonstrations of the use of hydrogen for public transportation in Scotland 

 Irvine and Smith have both been actively involved in the implementation of the following projects, demonstrating the potential of hydrogen to power clean\-emission public transport in Scotland \(Figure 1\). 

 **\(a\) Aberdeen hydrogen buses.** As a result of the hydrogen energy policy for Scotland set out by the *HEG*, *Aberdeen City Council* assembled Europe’s largest hydrogen\-powered fleet of buses, supported by two hydrogen fuelling stations, funded as part of a 2015 green transport demonstration project \(Figure 2a\). This is one of the world’s largest, fully integrated, green transport demonstration projects **\[S4\]**. Relying on his techno\-economic analysis, Smith built the original project consortium, which led to the project’s GBP19,000,000 EU funding **\[S4, S5\]** across a range of public and private sector partners. 

 In the first year \(2015\-2016\), the fleet of 21 buses, operated by companies *First* and *Stagecoach*, had travelled 250,000 miles carrying more than 440,000 people \(passengers\). Using green electricity generation, there is now a significant 156t CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction per H<sub>2</sub>\-bus per year **\[S5, p32\]**. Studies also showed a 40% reduction in NOx emissions within Aberdeen, which contributes to improved air quality **\[S5, p33\]**. As of 2018, Aberdeen’s hydrogen buses have carried over 1,600,000 people \(passengers\) and travelled approximately 1,000,000 miles. 

 Jo Bamford, owner and Executive Chairman of UK\-based bus manufacturing company *Wrightbus*, remarked on 19\-10\-2020: *“these buses represent much more than Aberdeen striving to reach a clean air, zero\-carbon future. They represent the start of what could be a world\-leading hydrogen economy here in Scotland which will bring with it multi\-million\-pound investments and tens of thousands of jobs.”* **\[S4\]** 

 Recognizing the success of this program, an additional GBP4,500,000 has been awarded by the Scottish Government, as part of its *Scottish Hydrogen Assessment* commitment to decarbonise public transport, in order to procure 10 hydrogen double decker buses to add to the existing Aberdeen hydrogen bus fleet. Overall, approximately GBP40,000,000 has, or is being, invested in hydrogen mobility projects across Scotland, including refuelling infrastructure for Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow as of December 2020 \(Section 4.2c\) **\[S2, p41\]**.

 **Figure 2.** a\) Hydrogen\-powered bus in Aberdeen; b\) plan of the H<sub>2</sub> ferry in construction via HySeasIII*; *c\) ScotRail Class 314 electric set on its way to be converted into an H<sub>2</sub> train.* 


 **\(b\) Hydrogen Ferries.** The *HySeas* program, initiated in 2011 by Smith and *Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd*, aims to deliver the world’s first hydrogen\-powered zero\-emission ferry \(Figure 2b\). Its current phase, *HySeasIII*, coordinated by Smith **\[S6\]**, began in 2018 and targets vessel delivery. *HySeasIII* is funded by the EU \(EUR12,000,000\) in partnership with a consortium including *Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd* \(UK\); *Ballard Power Systems Europe* \(Denmark\); *Kongsberg Maritime AS* \(Norway\); *Interferry* \(Belgium\); *DLR Energy Systems Institute* \(Germany\) and *Orkney Islands Council* as the operator. The first ferry is presently under construction in Glasgow. The ferry will be powered by renewable hydrogen generated from the *SHFCA\-*initiated projects *Surf’n’Turf* and *BIG HIT*, both of which are also based in Orkney with combined investment of GBP13,000,000. These projects represent a substantial economic investment in Scotland and beyond, with accompanying jobs creation. The *HySeasIII* consortium won the 2019 award for *The* *Innovation of the Year* at *The Green Awards.* 

 **\(c\) The **Hydrogen Accelerator** \( **H<sub>2</sub>A**\).** Based on Irvine’s expertise in hydrogen technology and its implementation and his successful leadership of past and present demonstration projects, *Transport Scotland* engaged him to deliver the *Hydrogen Accelerator* \( *H<sub>2</sub>A*\) programme with an initial investment of GBP300,000. Based at the University of St. Andrews, *H<sub>2</sub>A* links academic, public and commercial interests towards the development and deployment of hydrogen technologies and provides expertise and support to the design, development and implementation of transport initiatives across Scotland. As such it plays a central role in defining and delivering decarbonisation in Scotland, supporting the Scottish government’s commitment to its net\-zero target of 2045, including support its ambition to phase out petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032. 

  

 Although only launched in 07\-2020, the *H<sub>2</sub>A* has successfully achieved the following. 

 **i\)** Arranged and awarded a GBP3,500,000 contract to *Arcola Energy*, a leading specialist in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, to build a showpiece hydrogen train \(Figure 2c\) using a Scottish supply chain for the *UN Climate Change Conference* \(COP26, Glasgow 2021\). This has led to the initial creation of 20 jobs to date at *Arcola Energy* located at the *Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc* \( *MSIP*\) in Dundee **\[S7\]**. 

 **ii\)** Following from the successes of the Aberdeen H<sub>2</sub>\-bus roll out, the *H<sub>2</sub>A* has delivered a techno\-economic assessment of and provided the technical specification for the contract negotiations to purchase a fleet of 12 hydrogen buses and the associated hydrogen refuelling infrastructure \(contract tendered: 12\-2020\) that have been ordered by *Dundee City Council* through the Scottish Cities Alliance \(with each bus costed at just over GBP500,000, as part of the EUR25,000,000 *Joint Initiative for hydrogen Vehicles across Europe – JIVE2 –* project\). 

 **iii\)** In collaboration with *Strathclyde Power Engineers*, enabled the specification of a large scale GBP3,000,000 hydrogen and battery testing facility \(LOCATE\) at the *MSIP*. 

 The Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity in the Scottish government said: “ *I’m pleased that we can establish a new Hydrogen Accelerator for Scotland at the University of St Andrews. With their renowned specialism in hydrogen technologies and innovation – this is a perfect match at a time when there is really exciting work in the sector taking place across Scotland*… *I wish Professor John Irvine and his team at St Andrews every success in supporting our flourishing hydrogen sector*.” **\[S8\]**. 

 Of the *H<sub>2</sub>A* and the COP26 hydrogen train project, the Scottish Enterprise Managing Director noted that “ *… this creates quality jobs and supports our national ambitions for a net zero carbon economy*” **\[S9**\]. 

##  4.3. Direct commercialisation of EaStCHEM research for the production of green hydrogen for transportation 

 Since 2017, The *Low Emissions Resources Global Ltd.* \( *LERG*\) has been associated with Irvine and has created 15 research positions \(headcount: 15\) involving the fabrication of electrolysers for H<sub>2</sub> production based on Irvine’s solid\-state electrolytes **\[R3\]**. They have recently relocated to a R&D facility at the *MSIP* in Dundee **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at SOAS on post\-civil war relations between the Tamil diaspora and the Sri Lankan state directly contributed to a ‘radical change’ – according to legal experts – in UK asylum law and policy in 2013: namely, recognition of participants in lawful Tamil diaspora\-based political activity as a key and novel category of persons ‘at risk’ of harm if returned, despite the war’s end. Recognition of this ‘at risk’ category has provided thousands of Tamils who engage in lawful protests and advocacy against the Sri Lankan authorities with new or additional grounds for seeking protection, thus also enabling their continued participation in democratic political life in the UK. The research also directly contributed to positive outcomes in dozens of individual Tamils' asylum claims, and the UK’s recognition of the ‘at risk’ category influenced asylum claims by Tamils in other countries, in particular Australia and France.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Sri Lanka’s civil war ended in 2009 with the total military destruction of the Liberation of Tigers of Tamil Eelam \(LTTE\). In the final year of the war, mass atrocities by the Sri Lankan security forces prompted unprecedented mobilisation by both first\- and second\-generation diaspora Tamils in mass protests and civil society advocacy campaigns. Following the war’s end, the UK sharply reduced eligible ‘at risk’ categories for Tamils seeking asylum and stepped up returns of rejected claimants. The UK’s reasoning, shared by other western governments, was that human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities related to their efforts to defeat the LTTE insurgency. On this view, now the LTTE was no more, Tamils who had participated whilst abroad in lawful campaigns and protests against the Sri Lankan authorities, were not at risk of harm if returned, as any adverse attention from the authorities would relate to suspected support for renewed insurgency. 

 Long\-term ethnographic research conducted at SOAS since 2008 by Dr Suthaharan Nadarajah **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]** on the Tamil diaspora’s evolving transnational political activities and its relations with host\-country governments and the Sri Lankan authorities, has served as basis for consequential country\-related expertise provided in UK asylum procedures from 2013 to date. The Tamil diaspora is a classic ‘conflict generated’ diaspora, expanding through waves of refugee flight from the start of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 1983. For example, by 2011 over 130,000 Tamils from Sri Lanka had claimed asylum in the UK alone. Nadarajah’s research examines the social and political circumstances and state policies in both Sri Lanka and western countries which both influence and are influenced by Tamil diaspora political activism. Outputs include analyses of Sri Lankan security practices **\[3.2\]**, contingent workings of western terrorism proscription regimes **\[3.1\]**, international anti\-terrorism practices’ influence on diaspora agency **\[3.4\]**, and co\-analysis with Mark Laffey \(SOAS\), building on Nadarajah’s research on the Tamil diaspora, of the production of hybrid subjectivities at ‘home’ and ‘abroad’ by the institutions and practices of liberal peace **\[3.3\]**. 

 Against the above assumptions prevailing in UK asylum law and policy, Nadarajah’s research identified and explained key post\-war shifts in Sri Lankan national security policy and practices that were producing new patterns of human rights abuses, especially in relation to Tamil diaspora activism **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Three insights from the research were important for UK asylum law and policy: 

  

 1\) the Sri Lankan authorities’ post\-war adverse attention now also focussed on lawful Tamil diaspora political activities quite distinct from support for renewed armed violence. In other words, ‘support for terrorism’, on the authorities’ view, encompassed diaspora political campaigns such as those advocating for international accountability for war crimes; demilitarisation of \(troop withdrawals from\) Tamil\-majority areas; Tamil self\-determination by non\-violent means \(e.g. referenda\); among other aspects. 

 2\) the Sri Lankan security forces and intelligence agencies were now violently targeting returning Tamils who had, or were suspected to have, participated in lawful activities such as gathering testimony from survivors of and eyewitnesses to war crimes and human rights abuses; assisting the work of international human rights groups, UN investigators.; demonstrating against the Sri Lankan government’s policies; commemorating Tamil victims of ‘genocide’. 

 3\) it was the increasing integration of prominent Tamil diaspora groups into western states’ policy making on Sri Lanka that made them serious threats to national security on the view of the Sri Lankan authorities. Increasingly forceful pressure by the international community led by Tamil diaspora\-hosting western states \(hitherto close allies in the ‘war on terror’\) was placed on the Sri Lankan government to reach a political settlement on Tamil demands for self\-rule, demilitarise Tamil\-majority areas, and, especially, prosecute state perpetrators of wartime mass atrocities. The Sri Lankan government attributed these international demands – all deemed assaults on the country’s sovereignty and independence – primarily to the malign influence of Tamil diaspora activism on western governments’ policy decisions. 

 Taken together, the research showed how and why, on the view of the Sri Lankan authorities, the primary post\-war threat to the country’s national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity is diaspora Tamils’ seemingly growing ability to mobilise international pressure on and action against them, rather than actual or potential support for revived insurgency in Sri Lanka **\[3.1\]**. 

 In 2013, Nadarajah elaborated these insights in an expert report and oral testimony for the UK’s immigration and asylum Upper Tribunal \(high court\) hearing of a designated ‘country guidance’ case on Sri Lanka, resulting in the addition of Tamils involved in diaspora\-based ‘Tamil separatism’ as a key and novel category ‘at risk’ of harm if returned to Sri Lanka **\[3.2\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Nadarajah’s work had wide and significant impact on, first, asylum protection in the UK for Tamils from Sri Lanka, by influencing directly a key change in UK asylum law and Home Office policy guidance in 2013–2014, which influenced the submission, assessment, and Tribunal determinations on claims by thousands of Tamil asylum seekers thereafter. Second, the protection extended by this change in asylum law and policy enabled the continued participation of Tamil asylum seekers and other non\-resident Tamils in lawful political advocacy and democratic life in the UK. The change in UK law and Home Office policy, which remains in place in July 2020, has influenced Sri Lankan Tamils’ asylum claims in other countries, in particular Australia and France. 

####  Influencing changes in asylum law and policy guidance on Sri Lanka 

 Nadarajah’s research, provided as expert evidence in a written report **\[3.2\]** and oral testimony to the UK’s immigration and asylum Upper Tribunal \(UKUT\), directly influenced its landmark determination in July 2013 on a designated Sri Lanka Country Guidance case **\[5.1\]**. To the co\-lead advocate for the appellants at the hearing, it was ‘clear from a comparison of Dr Nadarajah’s evidence with the conclusions reached by the Upper Tribunal . . . that the Tribunal relied heavily on his evidence for many of the key features of its conclusions . . . All of these were key features of the guidance which the Tribunal gave \[in its determination\] and which continue to shape the way in which asylum claims by Sri Lankan Tamils are assessed’ **\[5.3 pp2–3\]**. 

 By identifying and explaining important but hitherto unrecognized shifts in post\-war Sri Lankan national security policy and practices, the analysis presented in Nadarajah’s expert evidence challenged key assumptions underpinning the UK’s asylum policy, and directly influenced the Tribunal’s hugely consequential finding that participation in lawful Tamil diaspora political activism in the UK could put individuals at risk of harm from the Sri Lankan authorities. The UKUT’s recognition of this distinct and novel ‘at risk’ category in its determination, which extensively cited Nadarajah’s expert report and oral testimony **\[3.1, paras 148–164 & Appendix K, paras 22–56\]**, was described by legal experts as producing a ‘radical change’ in the UK Home Office’s and asylum Tribunals’ assessment of risk of return to Sri Lanka **\[5.6 p3\]**. 

 This recognition was of very high significance because a Country Guidance \(CG\) determination by the UKUT becomes the authoritative finding on the ‘country guidance issues’ specified in the determination, unless superseded by a subsequent CG determination. A Tribunal determination that fails to follow the country guidance or to show why it does not apply to the case in question can be appealed on a point of law. The Home Office publishes the CG findings in policy guidance for its decision makers, who are expected to apply them when assessing asylum claims. **\[5.3\]**. 

 The key, and novel, ‘country guidance issue’ identified in the 2013 CG determination was that “individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are, or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post\-conflict Tamil separatism *within the diaspora*” were “at real risk of persecution or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka”, as “the \[Sri Lanka\] government’s present objective is to identify Tamil activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state” **\[5.1 p2, emphasis added\]**. The co\-lead advocate for the appellants considered “Dr Nadarajah’s contribution to \[this finding\] as absolutely crucial in assisting the Tribunal to understand the attitudes of the Sri Lankan government, the dynamics of the Tamil diaspora, and the risks to those perceived as \[Tamil\] separatists in the event of a return to Sri Lanka” **\[5.3 p3\]**. 

 After the 2013 CG determination was upheld by the Court of Appeal, in August 2014, the CG was published by the Home Office in new policy guidance for asylum decision\-makers, titled ‘Sri Lanka: Tamil Separatism’ **\[5.2\]**. Nadarajah’s analysis of the country context in his 2013 expert evidence to the Upper Tribunal proved prescient, as in April 2014 the Sri Lankan authorities proscribed almost all the leading Tamil diaspora advocacy groups as terrorists, invoking UN anti\-terrorism instruments. While these bans were summarily rejected by western states as lacking any evidentiary basis **\[3.1\]**, the most direct protection for politically active non\-resident Tamils in the UK is that provided by the 2013 ‘at risk’ category changes in asylum law and policy **\[5.7 p6\]**. 

 In December 2020, the 2013 CG determination remained the authoritative legal guidance on Sri Lanka for asylum Tribunals, and current Home Office policy guidance, though revised, remained largely consistent with that issued in 2014 **\[5.5, 5.6\]**. In April 2020, Nadarajah was commissioned to provide extensive written and oral evidence to assist the UKUT to update its authoritative guidance on Sri Lanka. The determination of the new Country Guidance case, heard in September, is awaited. Whereas in 2013 a Tribunal\-recognised ‘Interested Party’, Tamils Against Genocide \(TAG\) **\[5.4\]**, instructed Nadarajah’s expert evidence, in 2020 he was jointly instructed by legal representatives of the main parties, the Home Office and the appellants **\[5.5 p3\]**. 

####  Improving access to asylum protection for Tamils in the UK 

 CG determinations directly shape subsequent assessments of asylum claims by the Home Office and the Tribunals. The senior asylum lawyer and barrister who was co\-lead advocate for the appellants at the 2013 CG Sri Lanka hearing stated the determination was “of crucial significance in identifying the categories of Tamil applicants now adjudged entitled to be granted asylum in the UK” **\[5.3 p.2\]**. A senior lawyer specialising in Sri Lankan cases stated “in the past seven years thousands of Tamils who have sought asylum in the UK and Europe and in several common law jurisdictions … have had their claims assessed using \[the 2013 CG\] as the guidance case. Many are among those who have participated in Tamil diaspora political activities. Others have given evidence to international human rights groups and UN investigations,” **\[5.6 p3\]** \(see below\). 

 Given the standing asylum law and policy guidance, Home Office rejections, claimants’ appeals and tribunal decisions since 2013 often centre on whether the applicant meets the standard set \(but not specified\) by the 2013 CG determination of ‘a significant role’ in ‘Tamil separatism’ \(as perceived by the Sri Lankan authorities\) in relation to Tamil diaspora activism **\[5.5\]**. In this regard, Nadarajah was regularly commissioned by lawyers representing Tamil asylum seekers to provide the courts with expert reports explaining how risk to the individual in the country context at the time of the hearing related to that recognised in the 2013 CG determination. From 2014 to July 2020, he provided over 40 expert reports to asylum Tribunals based on his research. Many of his expert reports were relied on by the Tribunal for their decisions. A lawyer specialising in Sri Lankan cases stated “Dr Nadarajah’s reports have not only been central to positive determinations of asylum appeals, but also played a key role in stopping deportations, obtaining rights to appeal negative decisions through judicial review, and immigration bail.” **\[5.5 p2\]**. 

####  Improving capabilities and practices of UK asylum lawyers 

 Nadarajah’s research also directly influenced the work of UK asylum law practitioners representing Tamil asylum seekers from Sri Lanka. One senior asylum lawyer described Nadarajah’s 2018 article **\[3.1\]** as “excellent”, explaining that “legal practitioners would deﬁnitely beneﬁt from this being publicly available. We struggle to get legal aid granted for country expert reports at times and so this would be a great alternative for initial asylum applications relying on the political issues in Sri Lanka” **\[5.9\].** Based on such feedback, the article was published open access with SOAS’s funding in August 2018 and has been downloaded over 3,000 times as of July 2020. The article, along with Nadarajah’s newly commissioned expert report was included in the evidence jointly submitted by the Home Office’s and appellant’s lawyers to the Upper Tribunal hearing of the 2020 Country Guidance \(Sri Lanka\) case. 

 Nadarajah’s research also influenced asylum lawyers’ case preparation and arguments made before Tribunals, both via expert reports he produced \(including for the 2013 and 2020 CG cases, and dozens of individuals’ cases from 2015 to July 2020 **\[5.4, 5.5, 5.6\]**\), and via training courses he conducted for 50 UK immigration lawyers specialising in Tamil cases. A public statement of appreciation by Duncan Lewis, a leading UK law firm, described Nadarajah’s training as ‘much needed and very welcome’ for their staff, and the research he presented as “of the utmost importance to any legal practitioner representing Sri Lankan asylum seekers” **\[5.8 p3\]**. 

####  Widening participation by Tamil asylum seekers in UK political processes and international investigations 

 Through his direct impact on UK asylum law and policy, Nadarajah’s work significantly influenced the ability of non\-resident Tamils in the UK to participate in democratic life here. Recognition of Tamil diaspora political activists as an ‘at risk on return’ category from 2013 to July 2020, has encouraged individuals who previously may have been dissuaded by fear of reprisals from the Sri Lankan authorities after being deported to participate in a range of lawful political activities. 

 A senior editor with Tamil Guardian \(the leading English\-language Tamil diaspora news website\), stated that within a year of the 2013 CG determination “the significant protections from harm by the Sri Lankan authorities provided in \[it\] had far reaching effects on Tamil diaspora political activity by encouraging several hundred Tamils awaiting decisions on their asylum claims to join major Tamil diaspora advocacy groups, and hundreds of others to participate in demonstrations and other public activities,” **\[5.7 p7\]**. This is despite such events routinely being videoed and photographed by Sri Lankan embassy officials, and in 2014 the Sri Lankan government banning these Tamil diaspora groups as terrorists. **\[5.7, 3.1\]**. 

 Similarly, the Director of TAG \(Together Against Genocide, a prominent Tamil human rights and transitional justice NGO\) Janani Jananayagam stated “due to the increased sense of protection provided by \[the 2013 CG determination\]” Tamil asylum seekers who had witnessed war crimes by Sri Lankan security forces and “who previously had been reluctant, were persuaded to now come forward and give evidence” **\[5.4 p9\]**; Dozens of witnesses gave evidence to TAG and many more others to other international human rights groups and the landmark UN investigation \(2014–2015\) by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. **\[5.4, pp8\-10\]**. 

####  Influencing decisions on Tamils’ asylum claims in Australia, France, and Luxembourg 

 The 2013 change in UK asylum law and policy guidance on Sri Lanka has influenced Tamils’ asylum claims in other countries. A senior UK lawyer stated “Dr Nadarajah’s research, which the UKUT relied on for its country guidance in the \[2013 CG\] determination, has also contributed to increasing international protection for politically active individuals in the Tamil diaspora in many countries including Australia, France, and Luxembourg.” **\[5.6 p4\]**. An analysis in 2016 of the influence of the UKUT’s CG determinations on Australia’s asylum courts showed that the 2013 determination on Sri Lanka had been “by far the most frequently\-used country guidance decision in Australia . . . No other decision of the UKUT . . . has enjoyed similar currency” **\[5.10 p5, p8\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Currently approximately 700,000 people have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder \(ASD\) in the UK. However, the complex and interrelated nature of ASD symptoms, compounded by issues associated with assessment practices and protocols, inhibits timely completion of formal diagnostic processes. Research undertaken at Northumbria University has facilitated the first systematic, national exploration of factors influencing ASD assessment waiting times, at individual, service, and policy level, to improve the ASD diagnostic pathway. This research informed strategies that ultimately led to an average reduction in waiting times for ASD assessment in Scotland by 4.3 weeks. The research has directly influenced Scottish government, NHS, and local authority policy and practice through the development of new systems and processes for clinicians working in ASD services. Further, Northumbria’s research is recommended within the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network \(SIGN\) ASD guidelines, which influence clinical practice across Scotland.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Autism Spectrum Disorder \(ASD\) is a lifelong developmental disorder. Symptoms are multidimensional and include social and communication impairments, restricted repetitive activities, and associated features including attention deficits and a range of medical and psychological comorbidities \[ **R1**\]. Despite ASD being a developmental condition, longstanding failure to carry out timely assessments has meant that many diagnoses do not occur until adulthood \[ **R2**\]. Delayed ASD diagnosis can have serious implications for children and adults, including stress, dissatisfaction with the diagnostic process, and the inability to access appropriate support and resources \[ **R2**\]. Research undertaken by Professor Karen McKenzie, since joining Northumbria in 2014, has helped to identify a range of factors that inhibit the timely assessment of those with ASD. The findings have guided ongoing work in this area, and the design of interventions that reduce waiting times and thus help individuals \(including families and carers\) more readily access the support and resources that are available \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. 

  

 McKenzie’s work has sought to address the lack of available evidence, both nationally and internationally, relating to the underlying causes of delays in ASD diagnostic processes, and which models for assessment provide the most optimal results \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. In collaboration with colleagues from the University of Edinburgh and NHS Fife, McKenzie produced an empirical assessment of diagnostic tools such as the Autism\-Spectrum Quotient \(AQ\), a subjective self\-assessment questionnaire designed to measure the expression of Autism\-Spectrum traits in an individual \[ **R1**\]. The study indicated how it can be difficult to capture the multidimensionality of ASD in a single measure, which can lead to difficulties when attempting to estimate an association between a specific symptom measured by the AQ and a resultant diagnosis \[ **R1**\]. 

 McKenzie made similar, vital contributions to this field through her work with the Autism Achieve Alliance \(AAA\), a multidisciplinary partnership of clinicians and clinical researchers investigating child and adult ASD services. This collaboration represents the first, systematic national exploration \(in Scotland\) of factors influencing ASD assessment to improve the ASD diagnostic pathways. McKenzie was lead for the adult aspect of the programme, with specific responsibility for coordinating the research in respect of adult services. McKenzie was also responsible for working collaboratively with \(5 of 11\) participating adult\-specific services, to identify and address specific areas for improvement. McKenzie’s research was relevant to both adult *and* child services and played an important role in shaping methodologies and analysis across the entirety of the AAA project \[ **R2**\- **R6**\]. 

 McKenzie led an analysis of 150 case notes \(80 child and 70 adult cases\) from 16 diagnosing services across Scotland, which demonstrated that, within children's services, increasing the amount of relevant information available pre\-assessment is likely to lower the total duration of the assessment process by reducing the number of contacts required \[ **R2**\]. The study also showed that having a high risk of ASD as an adult appears to result in being seen more quickly following referral, but also increases the number of contacts needed and total assessment duration \[ **R2**\]. The results suggested that comprehensive information about the individual that is directly relevant to the diagnosis of ASD should be routinely sought prior to, or at the point of, referral. These findings were supplemented by research that highlighted a significant difference in the mean age of referral and diagnosis for girls compared to boys, supporting evidence of delayed recognition of ASD in younger girls prior to assessment \[ **R3**\]. 

 A further study drew on focus group interviews with 95 clinicians from 8 child and 8 adult services on the duration and quality of the diagnostic pathway and highlighted the need to develop efficient assessment and communication processes \[ **R4**\]. These findings supported conclusions offered in McKenzie’s earlier study, which had stressed the importance of information collected by non\-specialist services \(such as general psychiatric services\) in relation to the diagnosis of ASD to speed up diagnostic processes \[ **R2**, **R4**\]. Again, these recommendations were bolstered by additional research in which McKenzie recommended that more training in the use of current diagnostic interviews, combined with a systematic use of evidence\-based standardised assessment screening tools and protocols, would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ASD care pathways \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. 

 Based on the preliminary findings, McKenzie and the AAA team proposed a strategy to reduce waiting times for ASD diagnosis. This approach suggested the use of practice development interventions for clinical staff to share best practice and increase their skills and confidence in effective diagnostic pathways \(through mentorship, peer group forums, workshops to drive/sustain change, and validating the roles of practitioners \[ **R6**\]\). McKenzie played a central role in evaluating the implementation of a pilot scheme in 11 adult ASD diagnostic services in Scotland \(across 6 NHS board regions\), using multi\-level statistical analysis to determine if, and to what extent, it effectively reduced waiting times for ASD diagnostic assessment \[ **R6**\]. The results indicated how this approach can successfully reduce the wait time for ASD diagnostic assessment in adult services \(from 21.3 weeks down to 17 weeks on average\), raising the potential for significant improvements to be made at a national level \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 McKenzie’s research on the factors affecting the diagnosis of ASD has led to impact in relation to 1\) policy, strategy, and planning, 2\) practice, and 3\) outcomes regarding waiting times. 

 **4.1 Informed national policy, strategy, and planning** 

 As a result of McKenzie’s research expertise, she was part of the 2016 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \(SIGN\) guidance development group, to update the existing national clinical guidelines and checklist for the ‘Assessment, diagnosis and interventions for ASD’ \[ **E1**\]. SIGN guidelines facilitate the implementation of effective measures to improve the standards of healthcare in ASD services across Scotland. The resulting SIGN 145 guidance document, published in 2016, now incorporates guidance that applies to adults and older people as there was a *‘need for a guideline which reflects the whole age range’* \[ **E1**, p1\]. It now recommends, in line with the research, the need to include *‘all relevant information regarding any concerns, the individual’s current situation and details of any professionals involved’* and the development of protocols to ‘ *gather as much relevant information preassessment as possible, in order to reduce assessment duration’* \[ **E1**, p44\]. 

 McKenzie’s research also informed the development of NHS Education for Scotland Autism Training Framework: Optimising Outcomes Training Plan \[ **E2**\], which sets the standards for all autism\-related clinical training in Scotland’s health services – as part of professional training or as CPD – and provides a framework to enable service leads and individual practitioners to establish the training needs of their staff. The plan recognises that acquiring more information for a person prior to their diagnostic assessment can be key to reducing the wait for diagnosis, as highlighted in the research \[ **R2**\], and highlights the need for training clinical staff to facilitate better identification, screening, assessment, and diagnosis of ASD, particularly within adult services \[ **E2**, p33\]. 

 **4.2 Improved understanding of, and practices involved in, ASD referral and assessment** 

 McKenzie’s research \(and subsequent clinical recommendations listed above\) informed the action plans of health and social care partnerships \(HSCPs\) in Scotland, including: The Autism Strategy in Fife \(2014\-2024\) \[ **E3**\], the East Lothian Strategy \(2015\) \[ **E4**\], and the Perth and Kinross Autism Strategy \(2016\-2021\) \[ **E5**\]; areas serving a combined population of approximately 632,000. Collaboration between these HSCPs and the AAA: *‘worked to upskill the workforce and improve processes to reduce waits and evidence best practice’* for adult services in Fife \[ **E3**, p9\], led to quicker referral to diagnosis times in East Lothian child services \[ **E4**, p6\], and in Perth and Kinross *‘all diagnostic teams have been made aware of…up to date research on reducing waiting times’* \[ **E5**, p8\]. 

 The AAA Autism Knowledge Hub was created to enable Scottish autism diagnostic services and clinicians \(e.g. from Lothian, Fife, Ayrshire and Arran, Borders, Highland, and Glasgow\) to share best practice and collate documentation, protocols, action plans and recommendations from the research, and subsequent practice, in one place. The Scottish Government identified the Knowledge Hub as a key resource to *‘facilitate improvement for autism assessment and diagnosis for all age groups and genders’* \[ **E6**, p10\]. 

 **4.3 Reduced wait for ASD assessment** 

 The research clarified the causes and extent of delays in ASD diagnosis in Scotland and developed a strategy to improve the ASD diagnostic pathway. Once implemented, these strategies introduced more efficient working and communication into services, improving the effectiveness of care pathways in both child and adult services \[ **E7**\]. Mentoring and support were also made available to clinicians involved in diagnosing ASD \[ **E8**\]. Results from the implementation of this strategy in 11 adult diagnostic services across Scotland concluded that waiting times reduced by an average of 29.9 days \(4.3 weeks\) \[ **E8**; **E9**, p16\]. 

 Andy Fleming, Autism Spectrum Disorder Nurse Practitioner, NHS Lanarkshire \(population of 650,000\), acknowledged the benefits of the research and intervention in this area of Scotland, noting an average reduction in wait times of 36 days. He stated that this strategy led Lanarkshire’s ASD diagnostic pathway to become ‘ *more focused, effective, and efficient for both staff and patients’* by: 1\) introducing a clear assessment pathway focused on information gathering and reporting back to patients \(to adhere to good practice guidance specified by SIGN and NICE\), 2\) timely provision of information to potential referrers to ensure the appropriateness of referrals, 3\) introducing systems to pre\-empt, and ultimately prevent, non\-attendance at appointments \(e.g. sending reminders\), and 4\) working to improve information sharing between team members \[ **E10**\]. Fleming identified key benefits of improved post\-diagnostic support and the opportunity to share good practice with, and learn from, the experiences of other services throughout Scotland: 

 ‘*The timely diagnosis of autism and reduced waiting times for assessment and diagnosis…allow those who are diagnosed to receive additional support and resources that they may require and they can be signposted to organisations and support networks that may be of benefit to them, which will help to improve the outcomes for them. The sooner that diagnosis takes place the sooner that such support can be arranged. This might include specialist input from staff to provide interventions to help with social interaction, managing anxiety, and behaviours that challenge, such as aggression. As long waiting times can lead to dissatisfaction with and loss of confidence in services, reduced waits can counter this’* \[ **E10**, p2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Coin Hoards of the Roman Empire \(CHRE\) is a **participatory research and digital conservation** initiative that has enhanced awareness of imperial hoards internationally, contributing to their preservation. In 2015, it launched a web app for the empire\-wide recording and study of imperial hoards, providing a **free international platform** for multiple users and institutional partners. Participation has changed the perception of hoards in Israel and Belgium, facilitated national attempts to **recover smuggled goods** in Romania, influenced changes to the curation of coin by museum professionals in Germany, and led to the creation a new MA course in the Netherlands.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 CHRE is a collaborative project led by Chris Howgego from the Ashmolean Museum and Andrew Wilson from the Oxford Roman Economy Project \(OXREP\) **\[R5\]** with Marguerite Spoerri\-Butcher, and has been generously supported by the Augustus Foundation \(2013\-2023\). It fills a major lacuna in the digital coverage of coin hoards from antiquity. It collects information about hoards of all coinages in use across the expanse of the Roman imperium between c. 30 BCE and 400 CE. The project aims to lay the foundations for a systematic Empire\-wide study of hoarding in order to tackle questions about the nature of the Roman economy, the circulation of coin during the height of the Empire and its decline, and the history of monetary behaviour and hoarding in antiquity **\[R6, R2**\]. In 2019, the scope of the project was extended to cover hoards of Roman coin from regions outside the Empire **\[R6\].** 

 CHRE builds upon the comprehensive online typology of all Roman coinage. Roman Provincial Coinage Online \(RPCO\), founded by Howgego in 2005, supplemented existing online typologies of imperial coinage. The latter were based on standard published works of reference, but RPCO required primary research to identify typologies of Roman civic coinage in an area stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to Dacia and Egypt. RPCO is a continuously updated reference work involving input from the 10 leading international collections. Contributions are crowdsourced from scholars, researchers and collectors, and are rigorously peer reviewed.  Work is still ongoing but RPCO is already the standard digital resource for Roman provincial coin: Google analytics 2019\-2020 records 1,644,812\-page views; 83,112 sessions; and 22,048 users from 115 countries \[ **R4\]**. 

 CHRE has developed the approach to crowdsourcing trialled with RPCO to develop the world’s largest participatory digital conservation initiative in numismatics. The project has expanded the chronological, geographic and conceptual range of the study of Roman imperial hoards, and it offers a state\-of\-the\-art heritage management tool that allows users to compare hoarding and coin circulation in different regions, as well as the reporting of archaeological finds. 

 The CHRE project web app, launched in 2015, records the details, archaeological context, provenance and documentary evidence for Roman hoards with a geographical scope \(from Ireland to India\) that has never previously been attempted. All data are fully searchable, and the results of searches can be exported, or visualized through conventional satellite, Roman imperium, or contemporary street maps and heat maps; furthermore, hoards can be linked to local ancient place names recorded in the Pleiades gazetteer \(https://pleiades.stoa.org\). This has set a new world standard for the online documentation of hoards and has raised awareness of their historical value **\[R3**\]. 

 The database **\[R1\]** currently holds information on 15,300 published hoards and over 5 million individual gold coins from within and outside the Roman Empire. Current work is focused on extending geographical coverage and systematically recording hoards at the level of the individual coin \(including full descriptions and standard references\), where such data are available. Entries are accompanied by 4000 related searchable bibliographical references which contain active links to the hoards in the database. The engagement of the project with Linked Open Data for Numismatics \( [http://nomisma.org/](http://nomisma.org/)\), including providing leadership for the international hoards committee responsible for determining classification, has enhanced its interoperability with related digital projects, e.g. the ‘Framing the Late Antique and Early Medieval Economy’ \(FLAME\) project at Princeton. CHRE hoard and coin web references \(URIs\) are unique and stable and these permanent identifiers are increasingly being used by external projects or in publications.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since its launch in 2015, the CHRE project has supported 48 institutions in 25 different countries to enable them to put this important aspect of their national heritage online **\[E1\].** CHRE created a well\-targeted network of institutional partners, which covers Europe and the US, 7 countries in the Balkans \(Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece\) and 5 in the Levant and North Africa \(Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia\). **17 stakeholders are public bodies outside the HEI sector**, including: **2 antiquities authorities** \(Israel, Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventitives, France\); **10 public museums** \(Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Scotland, Slovenia, Tunisia\); **2 libraries** \(Belgium, France\), **1 national finds scheme** \(Switzerland\) and a **transnational finds scheme** \(The European Finds Network\); **1 national bank** \(Netherlands\); and **1 numismatic society** \(France\). Google Analytics of the project website \(1/9/2016\- \-23/07/2020\) records 12,455 users, and 31,743 searches with an average duration of 17 minutes. The web app has been used extensively in 58 different countries including: US \(3,266\) and the UK \(1,728\) Turkey \(338\) Romania \(261\) Bulgaria \(220\) Russia \(166\) and Switzerland \(160\) **\[E1.1\].** 

 The scale and composition of the CHRE network of collaborators has been integral to its international impact. Specific local impacts have been diverse, and often unexpected. Between 2016 and 2020 CHRE has: 

  

 **1. Helped heritage professionals to promote the recording and documentation of hoards** 

 In Belgium, hoards were seen to be of limited, local historical value, and funding to put documentation online had proved elusive. CHRE offered a platform and technical support from 2016 onwards. As the Keeper of the Cabinet des Médailles, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique notes, ‘Recording these finds online for the general public \[has\] created a more general interest in history, as well as an awareness of the importance of declaring finds…to the authorities,’ and he adds, ‘It is very important for us to be involved in the CHRE initiative as it is a major argument for encouraging local museums to open their holdings to the general public’ **\[E2\]**. 

 **2.  Influenced changes to coin curation** 

 The contents of most recorded imperial hoards have been scattered in collections across the world, dispersed in trade, or even melted down. CHRE allows some to be digitally reconstructed. As the curator from the Münzkabinett der Staatliche Museen zu Berlin notes: ‘CHRE entries…on particular hoards…provide us with a very useful and much appreciated tool enabling us to link coin hoard data to the individual coin entries in our database.’ The web app allows curators to recontextualize historical finds, such as those from Xanten \(found in 1764\), and Aboukir \(Egypt\), parts of which are now in Berlin. As the curator comments, ‘CHRE allow\[s\] us not only to profit from a highly sophisticated presentation of such finds \(and research on those hoards by CHRE\), but also builds unique identifiers \(permalinks\) of those hoards, which allow not only us, but any collection or museum with coins deriving from such hoards…to easily exchange our data internationally.’ This has changed the way coins are curated by staff at the museum: ‘The regulations regarding documentation standards in use here in the Münzkabinett \[now\] make the processing of CHRE\-entries obligatory’ **\[E3\].** 

 **3. Made national heritage available to national and international audiences** 

 Prior to 2016, the Israel Antiquities Authority \(IAA\) lacked the capacity to share their own holdings and detailed paper records of 350 Roman imperial coin hoards from Israel online – an estimated 75 of which were unpublished. The head of the coin department comments: ‘The CHRE team\-member who came to train staff, brought Roman coin hoards to the foreground of the IAAs activity \[by\] publicizing the number of Roman…hoards in its holdings \[and\] expos\[ing\] the numerous unpublished Roman hoards to the public…\[This was the IAA’s\] first international collaboration *.* Since then the IAA has formalized two other international collaborations between its Coin Department and foreign institutions. This is due in no small part to the success of the CHRE Project’. In September 2019, the IAA installed a new display of the most important hoard finds from Israel at the Bank of Israel, revealing two hoards to the public for the first time. The oldest hoard contains coins minted in Jerusalem during the Great Revolt, or Jewish\-Roman War \(66\-73 CE\), and the display features the largest hoard ever found in Israel, dating to c. 220 CE and containing over 10,000 silver coins found in the excavation of the Nabataean city of Mamshit/ Mampsis in the Negev **\[E4\]**. 

 **4. Led to the recovery of looted national heritage and smuggled goods                        ** 

 In Romania, the web app has been used to analyse coin circulation, leading to the recovery of looted coin. The police commissioner of the criminal investigation department of Cluj Napoca, who oversees the protection of cultural heritage from Romania and neighbouring countries notes: **‘**The CHRE website \[was\] used to identify coin types that were characteristic of certain countries in specific chronological segments **.’** Augustin Lazăr, who served as Romania’s Prosecutor General \(2016\-2019\) says that CHRE, ‘was very useful for our team \[for\] checking various coin types distribution – especially those of silver and gold – whether certain coins could have come from Romania or they were common types without a certain model of provenance…in the last years we manage to recover more 1,027 gold coins Koson \(circa 8.62 kilos, 37 gold coins Lysimachos type, 213 silver coin Koson\)’ **\[E6.1\].** 

 In 2018, the project web app was used on the Security Studies training programme at University Babes\-Bolyai, Cluj\-Napoca. The course tutor notes: ‘Owing to the large number of filters offered by this application we track…the distribution of hoards \(of certain metals at certain dates and on specific areas\); the presence of counterfeited coins; the dates of publication and the richness of information; findspot of discovery versus findspot of keeping \(owner\)’ **.** The Institute of Archaeology of the Romanian Academy has created a hoard database of the pre\-Roman and Roman imperial hoards from Romania on the basis of data from the CHRE project supported by the Romanian Academy and the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. The Romanian website describes what happens to hoards after discovery to promote understanding of the historical value of such finds **\[E6\]**. 

 **5. Led to the creation of a new Masters’ course in numismatics** 

 Working in collaboration with CHRE, Leiden University launched a bespoke MA in 2018 to train the next generation of numismatists to research and upload hoard data, in keeping with CHRE standards of documentation. Each student is allocated a region in the Netherlands. Under supervision they make additions and corrections to the CHRE database so that their work becomes permanently useful. In addition, the CHRE project has hosted four summer internships in Oxford for students from the University of Tübingen in support of a numismatics course there. Recently Yale has provided USD20,000 to pay Yale students as interns to learn numismatic skills by entering data into the project’s web application there under the supervision of the Curator of Numismatics at the Yale Art Gallery **\[E7\].** In all cases interns gained experience in working with an online database, an awareness of how a database can benefit from external online resources, and an understanding of Linked Open Data and the semantic web. 

 **7. Linked amateurs and professional archaeologists, community history and transnational history** 

 The Twitter feed, launched 12.8.2019 **\[E9.2\],** links museum professionals, archaeologists, local detectorists, students and other people interested in ancient coinage. It currently has 254 followers. It weaves together threads describing community projects \(such as hoard conservation by volunteers at Worcester Museum\) with an account of the discovery of the Charlbury Hoard from amateur detectorist with posts on a new archaeological hoard find in Bulgaria, and generates discussion, for example on gold hoards from Britain **\[E9.3\]**. A display of Roman hoards found by local detectorists in the Money Gallery for the c. 850,000 annual visitors to the Ashmolean, was supplemented in 2020 by a new display on ‘Lasers, Hoarding and Roman Gold Coinage’. It shows how high\-tech ‘metal detection’ \- laser ablation mass spectrometry \- can be used to analyse trace elements, such as platinum, present in gold coin from the mid\-4<sup>th</sup> century CE, revealing how and where the empire obtained bullion for its coinage as the balance of power shifted east **\[E8\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There are two impacts from Wootton’s research. First, archaeological sites in Libya and Tunisia are better safeguarded and conserved because of changes to the management practices of local heritage professionals in response to research\-led training from Wootton. Second, through initiatives informed by his research, Wootton has boosted the resources and prospects of the craft community of UK mosaicists, by founding the London School of Mosaic, and engaged public interest in ancient making. Both impacts derive from papers published between 2011 and 2020, which propose a new integrated approach to the study, care and appreciation of ancient artefacts and archaeological sites. This longstanding cross\-disciplinary research draws on Wootton’s practical experience and brings together the skills of archaeologists, conservators, craftspeople and heritage professionals. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Wootton’s cross\-disciplinary research into crafts, mosaics and sculpture in particular, has been fundamental to both impacts. Better understanding of the practicalities of ancient production, from art to architecture, has provided, and continues to provide, new insights which have enabled the development of professional training and community\-based strategies for safeguarding archaeological sites, the enhancement of skills and the establishment of resources to support modern professional artists, and novel ways of engaging public interest. 

 Wootton’s 2012 peer\-reviewed article on the newly discovered Hellenistic mosaic from Tel Dor, Israel \[1\] exemplifies how his practitioner’s perspective generates a more sophisticated understanding of art production processes, from practicalities to economics, and of the social context, especially relationships between craftspeople and commissioners. His research collaboration with the contemporary sculptor, Peter Rockwell, similarly delivered new insights into the archaeological evidence for ancient sculptural techniques. This research project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust \(2011–13; GBP209,834\), with Wootton as Principal Investigator, Bradley \(Digital Humanities\) as Co\-Investigator and Russell as postdoctoral researcher, was delivered as a website \[2\], including peer\-reviewed essays, images and videos, which enabled analytical presentation of the tools, materials and techniques of Roman sculptors in a way not possible in traditional publication formats. It thus provides a novel research\-based template for more informed recording of ancient sculpture and large\-scale monuments, with a view to their study and conservation. Since 2017, the website has hosted films on mosaic techniques, extending the research insights on ancient making. 

 In his 2017 peer\-reviewed chapter with Russell \[3\], Wootton draws on his research to demonstrate the value of the maker’s approach across a variety of different media. This approach has generated a more dynamic understanding of making, new documentation strategies and novel insights into conservation and safeguarding through practice and experiment in the field. Since his 2014 publication \[4\], Wootton has advocated and fostered collaborations across disciplines and between stakeholders which had previously not communicated well. His 2015 peer\-reviewed article \[5\] presents the development of two methodologies, one related to capacity\-building and the other to conservation. These result from his project, funded by the Getty Foundation, Conserving and Managing Mosaics in Libya \(CaMMiL; 2011–13; GBP64,000\), carried out with Walda, an archaeologist and contributor to the 2014 Impact Case Study, and two architect\-conservators, El\-Habashi and Stewart, in co\-operation with the Libyan Department of Antiquities \(DoA\). Expanded research through practice in Libya and also Tunisia was reported in Wootton’s 2020 collaborative paper \[6\], co\-authored with Alkhalaf, a postdoctoral researcher at King’s. With members of the DoA and the Tunisian Institut National du Patrimoine \(INP; National Heritage Institute\), it reports on the outcomes from ‘Training in Action: From Documentation to Protection of Cultural Heritage in Libya and Tunisia’, a project with Leone \(Principal Investigator, Durham\) and Fenwick \(UCL\), funded by the British Council \(2017–19; GBP956,135\). These two papers detail how training systems were devised, combining theoretical and practical teaching, appropriate to the different heritage roles of the Libyan and Tunisian participants, aimed at creating shared knowledge and sustainability. They explain the creation of a standardised approach to the management of objects, monuments and sites, integrating recording, assessment, planning and intervention. They stress the value of building relationships with community groups and demonstrate how this was done during the training and the subsequent conservation activities. Co\-authorship of the 2020 paper with Libyan and Tunisian colleagues encapsulates the research perspective which Wootton has developed, of producing knowledge collaboratively between archaeologists, conservators and heritage professionals.

 There are two impacts from Wootton’s research: 1\) improving heritage management in Libya and Tunisia; and 2\) stimulating modern mosaic\-making in the UK. 

#  1. Improving heritage management in Libya and Tunisia 

 Impact from Wootton’s research consists of building capacity among heritage professionals in Libya and Tunisia for effective intervention to preserve archaeological sites. The focus on documentation, assessment and community engagement was identified during research carried out by CaMMiL and put into practice via the project ‘Training in Action’ \(TinA\). The safeguarding outcomes deriving from the enhanced capacity are as follows: 

-  Eleven archaeological sites received new assessments of condition and risk, and plans have been implemented for their future protection \[A\]. This includes World Heritage Sites, such as Sabratha, where TinA’s contribution to conservation and management was highlighted in the DoA’s 2019 submission to UNESCO \[B\], and sites of great significance to local populations but less well known internationally \[Figure 1\]. 

-  New Statement of Significance for the coastal site of Iunca has been co\-produced with local stakeholders as a result of engagement activities, including a Tunisian Heritage Day \[Figure 1\] to encourage local ‘ownership’ of the site \[A\]. 

-  A major awareness\-raising campaign was mounted along the coast of eastern Libya \(Cyrenaica\), including at the site of Cyrene, as well as at two other World Heritage Sites, one in western Libya \(Lepcis Magna\) and another in Tunisia \(El Djem\) \[A\]. 

-  Outreach sessions have been organised in 23 schools in southern Libya \(Fezzan\) \[Figure 1\], attended by around 150 children and 100 adults. Educational packs were co\-created, explaining the local heritage and giving guidelines on custodianship \[A\]. 

-  New signage in local languages has promoted community engagement with the sites of Iunca, Lepcis Magna and the Acacus \[Figure 1\], where the campaign ‘Antiquities: know them, preserve them, live with them’ included an exhibition, the distribution of leaflets explaining how to protect rock art and the first ever bilingual site panels in Arabic and Targia \(the indigenous Berber language\) \[A\]. 

 The principal pathway from Wootton’s research to these outcomes was enabled by the TinA project, in which Leone and Fenwick covered survey, geographic information system \(GIS\) and rapid documentation techniques, while Wootton was responsible for site conservation and management. Wootton’s contribution was informed by his research into art making and archaeological conservation, as well as the research through practice in his and Walda’s previous trial project to improve management of ancient mosaics at Libyan coastal sites \(included as output in REF 2014\). Six TinA workshops were held in Tunisia between 2017 and 2019, attended by over 50 members of Libya’s DoA and Tunisia’s INP who work directly in site protection and conservation \[C\]. The participants then ran ‘mini projects’, mentored by TinA trainers \[cf. 6\], at their own heritage sites which produced the safeguarding achievements listed above, and also transmitted skills to over 50 colleagues. This training was itself an impact as well as pathway, as is demonstrated by feedback from the participants \[A, C.1\]: “\[TinA has\] played a big role in changing our style and our way of dealing with heritage and its management”; “I used to consider that the local community near archaeological sites posed a threat to them, but after the TinA project, I now view the community as an active partner in the protection of cultural heritage and not a threat.” The impact on local communities is demonstrated by the overall reach of the project’s Facebook page at over 400,000 people, with individual posts during King’s events reaching nearly 50,000 and the films being viewed over 2,000 times \[C.2,C.3\]. Feedback from the Iunca Heritage Day exemplifies local impacts: 89% of children said they now understood the site better and 60% of adults said they felt more committed to it \[A\]. The Directors of the DoA and INP have acknowledged TinA’s impact on national practice in the co\-authored report on the project \[6,A\]. Recognising the better management of the sites, the empowerment of local professionals and the sustainability benefits of involving the local population, the Libyan DoA has signed a new partner agreement with Wootton \(only\) for a three\-year project \(‘Managing Libya’s Cultural Heritage’\) from March 2020, funded by the ALIPH Foundation \(USD773,075\). The new project will focus on the removal of three World Heritage Sites from UNESCO’s ‘In Danger’ List using the King’s research methodology \[D\]. 

#  2. Stimulating modern mosaic\-making in the UK 

 Professional mosaicists are a niche group within the UK craft community, estimated at around 200 by the Craft Council in 2012 \( *Craft in an Age of Change*\), with limited public profile and professional support. Wootton has used his research into ancient making as a springboard to enhance the public profile and the professionalism of the mosaicist community, culminating in 2017 when the London School of Mosaic opened \[E.1,E.2; Figure 2\]. Inspired by Wootton’s research, the school was planned collaboratively with David Tootill \(then Director of Southbank Mosaics\) to reinvigorate the mosaic craft in the UK, based on historical understanding, conservation best practice and community engagement. The year\-long diploma, the only one of its kind in the UK, which is accredited by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, is now in its second year, with 15 enrolments \(equivalent to 7.5% of practising UK mosaicists\). Wootton is Chair of the Governing Body and has led on academic matters. He gives research\-led lectures and conducts applied projects reproducing ancient techniques resulting in the public display of re\-made Roman mosaics, such as at Bignor Villa in 2019 \[E.1\]. Francesca Busca, diploma graduate and artist, affirms the success of the research\-led approach: “\[Wootton’s\]own work as a researcher \(such as his publications on the Hellenistic mosaic of Tel Dor …\) and the engagement in the practical activity of making a mosaic using ancient materials and techniques … are a most effective way to deliver a first\-hand approach to ancient mosaic … \[and\] has influenced my own practice … realis\[ing\] how similar and valid the reasoning behind the earliest mosaics still is … which I continue to adopt and master a little more…” \[E.2\]. 



 Figure 2: London School of Mosaic; Masterclass 2017: before/after in general making ability \[F\]; film on traditional cutting techniques; Masterclass 2019: before/after in overall technical ability \[F\] 

 In parallel, Wootton has run masterclasses in 2017 and 2019 attended by 22 professional mosaicists who created contemporary mosaics using Wootton’s exposition of ancient techniques \[F; Figure 2\]. Feedback emphasised that almost all participants improved their knowledge and skills, gained confidence in their practice, and felt that this would improve their business \[F\]. Feedback commented on: “The workshop helped provide more historical context. \[I have\] a much better knowledge and appreciation of traditional techniques, and reassurance I’m doing some things right”; “It has definitely given me more confidence in moving forward with my own large scale project”; “I feel richer in terms of knowledge, experience, and meeting people … It has ‘cemented’ my feeling that I am part of a historical tradition …”; “It has reawakened an interest in Roman methods and I have more respect and admiration for their work”; and “\[I have\] new skill using classical method of andamento and being able to incorporate this into my work. I have a better understanding of the ‘logic’ behind Roman mosaic\-making in terms of their designs and the approach of the economy in making.” Masterclass and diploma graduates have seen the benefits of their enhanced skills, with the latter working on a major commission for a private project to recreate a series of Romano\-British mosaics in 2020 \[E.2\]. 

 Building to these two impacts, Wootton has showcased current research into ancient craft production, principally mosaics, sculpture and textiles, to increase public understanding and appreciation of ancient and modern making \[G\]. Feedback at a 2013 workshop was enthusiastic: “\[I have learnt\] So much\! … \[It has\] added to my appreciation of craft skill, sensory experience, collaboration and community.” The impact of Wootton’s research disseminated online reaches even further \[H\]. The Art of Making website has attracted a global audience since 2013 of over 78,000 visitors. Feedback has highlighted its value for teaching in schools: “Excellent resource for teachers and students especially those doing Cambridge Latin Course 3 and OCR AS/A Level Classical Civilisation”. The short films, including those from the mosaic workshops, have been viewed over 180,000 times; on average 60% of each video was viewed, attesting to very high engagement levels. The digital book on stone\-working has been downloaded over 42,000 times. Thus Wootton’s research into ancient making has generated in the UK a specific professional impact and a general public benefit which are mutually sustaining and productive.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research at the University of Bath on threats to financial stability from inadequate monitoring and risk assessments of the financial system \(led by Dr Giansante\) has informed policy changes in the central banks and regulatory institutions of G20 countries. It has led to the adoption of new processes and the enhancement of strategies for financial stability. A framework for measuring ‘interconnectedness’ was developed to assess the overall risk of a crisis in the financial system and identify which institutions were contributing most to instability. The framework has been operationalised within the Reserve Bank of India. It has also shaped the work of Banque de France and the International Monetary Fund on global stability. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The global financial crisis of 2007/08 highlighted a lack of understanding among economists and financial regulators on the importance of the interconnectedness of financial institutions, both nationally and globally. The deficiencies in regulation that the crisis exposed led \(among other initiatives\) to the Basel III banking standard. This highlighted the issue of excessive interconnectedness among ‘systemically important financial institutions’ \(SIFIs\) as a primary cause of systemic risk. The crisis also raised questions about the transmission channels between the financial and real sides of the economy. Mainstream macroeconomic models envisaged a representative banking sector that did not face problems of illiquidity or insolvency. They were therefore unlikely to predict the domino\-like failures that became a reality during the financial crisis. 

 The issue behind the underpinning research at University of Bath concerned the high concentration of risk among a handful of large US investment banks and the need to develop a policy response to what has become known as ‘macroprudential regulation’. A key research question related to concerns about the dense interconnections through ‘credit default swaps’, a form of debt insurance between banks. To address this question, Giansante \(with Markose and Shaghaghi, University of Essex\) developed a new method to assess systemic risk and forecast financial meltdowns based on a network approach to understanding complex financial linkages among global financial institutions \(R1\). Giansante \(with Markose and Oluwasegun, University of Essex\) used a ‘multi\-agent financial network’ model to quantify the contribution of each institution to financial instability and define the SIFIs that might require targeted intervention by central banks or financial regulators \(R3\). Giansante \(with Krause, University of Bath\) disentangled the complexity of solvency shocks and liquidity shortfalls among financial institutions to fit the new Basel III criteria on banks’ capital adequacy and liquidity \(R2\). 

 A key insight from the research was the importance of central banks and financial regulators collecting detailed data on bilateral contracts among financial institutions in order to assess the extent of interconnectedness and its potential contribution to systemic risk \(R1\). The results also provided evidence of the complex interplay among liquidity and solvency shocks in contributing to the spread of contagion between financial institutions that can lead to a systemic crisis \(R2\). The researchers concluded their analysis by recommending the adoption of an early warning real\-time financial networks approach based on bilateral leverage data that regulators could use to monitor financial institutions, internalise potential threats of systemic risk, and prevent future financial crises.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 This research has directly informed policy changes in central banks and regulatory institutions. The software developed by the research team has been a key mechanism for the adoption of new processes and systems by the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) and in relation to the enhancement of strategy for financial stability \(S1, S2\). The benefits to the Indian financial system, shared with all G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors during the quarterly Financial Stability Board meetings, promoted interest from European banks and financial institutions, including Banque de France and the IMF. The research team contributed to the Financial Stability Review of Banque de France \(S3\) and their influence was publicly acknowledged by the Governor of Banque de France \(S4\). The benefits of this research have also been acknowledged by the IMF and incorporated into the IMF’s auditing and advice to central banks \(S5\). 

 **The Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) \(2013 – 2020\)** 

 The research informed the implementation and operationalisation of 2 new models for policy analysis in RBI: \(1\) A systemic risk network model of interconnectedness to map the entire Indian financial system along with assessment of financial systems in other countries; \(2\) A risk assessment contagion model that investigates both solvency shocks and liquidity shortfalls in accordance with Basel III pillars \(S5\). The models, in the form of bespoke software, provide the means to gather granular information, to assess its implications for systemic risk, and to make targeted interventions \(S2\). Both models were initially developed and implemented between 2011 and 2015. Between August 2013 and December 2020, they have been fully embedded into the current RBI systemic risk monitoring framework \(S1\) and outcomes are published in the RBI semi\-annual Financial Stability Reports \(S2\). 

 The process of this contribution was as follows. First, working with the members of RBI’s Financial Stability Unit \(FSU\), the research team developed a contextually specific conceptual framework and software through which to operationalise a data\-driven model of interconnectedness of the Indian financial system. This allowed the FSU to monitor and manage systemic risk within and across multiple financial sectors. Second, the new models for analysis made it possible to collect data on the bilateral positions of more than 70 leading financial institutions, including public, private and foreign banks, cooperative banks, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies. This dramatically changed the way that the RBI mandated and analysed financial positions among institutions. Dr Giansante provided training for the FSU team in the meticulous gathering of detailed information, and was part of the analysis process with RBI Deputy Governors, Executive Directors and Division Heads. The Assistant General Manager of the RBI stated: 

 “*A multi\-layer financial network software was developed by Dr Giansante …, which is used to assess the interconnectedness, liquidity and solvency of risks of the Indian financial systems. As the project was done over a period of four years … Giansante had interactions with top management and apprised them about the nuances and significance of the model … \[and\] trained RBI personal in the use of the network model*” \(S1\). 

 The software solution has been fully adopted by the RBI as its main risk assessment tool for the interconnectedness and contagion risks of financial institutions. As an example, the new system informed RBI about the decline of the interbank market size with risk of financial contagion in the second semester of 2014, as highlighted in the FSR press release of December 2014: 

 “*Analysis of the interconnectedness indicates that the size of the interbank market in relation to total banking sector assets has been on a steady decline. However, contagion analysis with top five most connected banks reveals that the banking system could potentially lose significant portion of its total Tier\-I capital under the joint solvency\-liquidity condition in the event of a particular bank triggering a contagion*” \(S2\). 

 **Banque de France and the International Monetary Fund \(2016 – 2018\)** 

 As a result of the proven benefits for RBI, the research outcomes and related tools for risk assessment have also been disseminated in Europe, including for central counterparty clearing platforms. The Governor of Banque de France invited the research team to contribute to its 2017 Financial Stability Review \(S3\) and he has directly acknowledged the contribution made to the resilience of the global financial system \(S4\). Specifically, the stability review presents all major models for risk assessment adopted by financial regulators that have made the global financial system more robust since the G20 action plan of 2009. The Governor of Banque De France stated: 

 “*Thank you very much for the high\-quality contribution you make to the Financial Stability Review of Banque de France on the impact of financial reforms. This 21st edition shows that the banking and financial regulations adopted since the crisis constitute a major acquis \[body of knowledge\] to be preserved because they have made the financial system more robust … \[and\] the importance of the regular assessment of their impacts in order to consolidate this acquis*” \(S4\). 

 The achievement of these tools, including the research team models, has been echoed by other policymakers and financial practitioners, including Mark Carney \(Chair, FSB and then Governor, Bank of England\), Axel Weber \(Chairman, UBS\) and Tobias Adrian \(Director, IMF\) during the IMF Spring Meetings in Washington on the 20 April 2017 for the presentation of the review document \(S5\). The benefits of the research have also been acknowledged by the IMF and the models have been included in the IMF’s auditing and advice to central banks \(S5\). 

 In addition to RBI, Banque de France and the IMF, direct support has been provided by Dr Giansante to the Bank of Finland \(2014\) to monitor systemic risk in China and Russia \(S6\), to Banca d’Italia \(2015\) on the development of ‘interbank networks’ \(S7\), and to Banco de Mexico \(2016\) on the implementation of network models, stress testing and financial stability monitoring \(S8\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor King led genetic and statistical analysis that identified skeletal remains discovered by a University of Leicester research team as those of King Richard III. By 2015, this research had boosted Leicester’s economy by GBP79 million, including the construction of the Richard III Visitor Centre, and created 1,012 new jobs. The discovery and identification reached \~one billion people globally by 2017. In 2018 alone, 11.5 million people visited Leicester with an economic impact of GBP650million. The research inspired a wide range of cultural responses, and the team’s educational materials have reached \~100,000 worldwide. The research continues to anchor Leicestershire’s tourism plans 2019\-2025, and Leicester Cathedral’s 2020\-2023 GBP11.3million restoration project, including the construction of a new Heritage Learning Centre. Furthermore, King’s 2009 Y\-chromosome findings have provided the sole research for Ancestry.com’s exclusive DNA\-testing patent \(2017\), with 21 million tests sold by 2019.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 King combines genetics and archaeological research and has a long\-standing interest in the use of sex\-specific DNA markers for identification purposes. King undertook the first large\-scale study of Y chromosomes and hereditary surnames in Britain, developing the first reliable indicator of the false paternity rate in British populations over the past 700 years **\[R2\]**. King demonstrated that rarer surnames were often dominated by a single Y chromosome haplotype, which was likely that of a single male ancestor who bore that name several hundred years ago **\[R2\]**. King applied her methodology focused on surnames as a sampling strategy to investigate the genetic legacy of the Vikings **\[R1\]**. King also established sampling strategies that, combining forensic DNA typing of living individuals, with historical and archaeological data, led to an understanding of aspects of past population structure and population change in ways that simple analysis of modern and ancient DNA does not **\[R1, R2, R4\]**. 

 King established that heritable surnames are highly diverse cultural markers of co\-ancestry in human populations. A patrilineal surname is inherited in the same way as the non\-recombining region of the Y chromosome. Studies of Y haplotypes within surnames, mostly of the British Isles, reveal high levels of co\-ancestry among surname cohorts. Combining molecular genetics and surname analysis illuminates population structure and history, with potential 'genetic genealogy’ applications – an area of rapidly growing public interest **\[R7\].** 

 In 2012, the University of Leicester multidisciplinary research team undertook excavations to locate the remains of King Richard III \(RIII\), d.1485, believed to be interred in the lost church of the Greyfriars in Leicester. Prof Turi King’s forensic, population\-genetics and genetic\-genealogy research **\[R1\-R6\]** methodologies underpinned both the excavation practices and the identification of his remains primarily by comparing the ancient DNA evidence of the remains against the modern DNA of living relatives, incorporating population\-based frequencies of genetic data and conducting a Bayesian statistical analysis of the evidence. 

 Given the constraints of the exhumation licence granted by the Ministry of Justice, only skeletons exhibiting characteristics consistent with what was known about Richard III \(location in friary, age at death, possible spinal abnormality, battle injuries\) would be exhumed during the excavation for subsequent genetic analysis. One such skeleton was uncovered which matched contemporary accounts of RIII’s spinal deformity, burial location and death in battle **\[R3, R6\]** marking this skeleton as suitable for exhumation and King’s genetic investigation. King’s DNA analyses of the skeleton and RIII’s living relatives identified a perfect mitochondrial DNA match between the sequence from the remains and one living relative, and a single\-base substitution when compared with a second relative. The latter is not unexpected due to chromosomal mutations occurring in the generations separating RIII and the relative. The mitochondrial genome was found not to have any matches in any forensic mitochondrial DNA databases in Europe or in the UK, and therefore has been shown to be a very rare type **\[R3, R5, R6\]**. 

 Y\-chromosome haplotypes from male\-line relatives do not match the remains. This could be attributed to a false\-paternity event occurring in any of the intervening generations. DNA\-predicted hair and eye colour are consistent with Richard's appearance in an early portrait. King calculated the likelihood ratios for the non\-genetic and genetic data separately and combined, concluding that the evidence for the remains being those of Richard III is 99.99999% **\[R4, R6\]**. King also carried out sequencing analysis of genes known to determine hair and eye colour to establish probable hair and eye colourings and thereby identify the most closely matching of the early portraits of King Richard III **\[R4, R5\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Triangulation of multidisciplinary applications, underpinned by University of Leicester research, has contributed to the expansion of interest in genealogical heritage. The research has enabled the identification of ancient remains via the historical lineage of their descendants, most famously, those of King Richard III \(RIII\) and opened access to ancestral data for members of the public to explore their own ancestry. 

 **Heritage, tourism and economic impact** 

 Discovery of RIII’s skeleton beneath a Leicester carpark and the identification of his remains significantly contributed to Leicestershire’s transformation into a national and global tourism destination. The Tourism Growth Plan \(2019\) stated *: “The economic potential of Leicester and Leicestershire was significantly enhanced by the discovery of the remains of King Richard III… and his reinterment in Leicester Cathedral in 2015. The value of this remarkable story to the area… provided a spotlight that enabled both the City and the County to showcase the area’s rich heritage and tourism potential”* **\[E1Eii\]**. 

 A 2015 Leicester City Council \(LCiC\) report showed that the discovery and identification of RIII drove significant economic impacts. In the period between the discovery and March 2015, 622,562 additional visitors to RIII\-related events in Leicester spent GBP54,625,048; an additional 1,012 FTE jobs were created; an estimated GBP79,082,740 gross value added to Leicester’s economy; and volunteering valued at GBP118,566 **\[E1A\]**. Although impacts and data relating to the discovery began in the REF2014 census period, the Leicester research has delivered significantly greater impacts since August 2013. 2020 LCiC **\[E1Eii\]** and 2019 Leicestershire County Council \(LCoC\) **\[E1Eiii\]** reports showed that the RIII discovery and identification, along with other regional attractions, contributed to the region’s overall tourism growth. Since 2013, there has been *“an increase of 26.9% in value from the tourism sector, an 18.6% increase in visitors and a 12.6% increase in employment”.* **\[E1Eii\]**. In 2018 alone, 34.9 million people visited Leicestershire **\[E1Eii\]** and 11.5 million people visited the city of Leicester, valued at GBP651 million—significantly driven by the discovery of RIII **\[E1Eiii\]**.LCiC invested GBP4 million in the new **King Richard III Visitor Centre \(RIIIVC\)** at the Greyfriars site which showcases the team’s research, including King’s genetic genealogy work **\[E1A\]**. The RIIIVC’s permanent exhibition is explicitly designed around the team’s research on RIII’s burial **\[R1\];** his Bosworth battle wounds **\[R2\]**; a 3D model of CT scans of his bones to reconstruct his scoliosis **\[R3\]**; and the team’s identification procedures, including King’s DNA testing **\[R4\]** **\[E1B\]**. Between its opening on 26 July 2014 and 31 December 2020, the RIIIVC had 347,155 visitors from the UK and beyond. Overseas visitors came from as far away as the USA, Australia, and China **\[E1C\]**. In 2018, the RIIIVC won the Group Leisure and Travel Awards’ ‘Best Museum or Gallery’ by reader vote, beating the British Museum and Tate Britain **\[E1C\]**. *Lonely Planet* added the RIIIVC to their ‘Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist’ in 2019, stating it *“reveals… one of the world’s greatest archaeological detective stories”* **\[E1Eiii\]**. The discoveries published in **\[R1\]** prompted Historic England to designate the Greyfriars site as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 2017 **\[E1D\]**. In 2014 alone, **Leicester Cathedral** drew 398,500 more visitors than in 2012 \(an increase from 29,500 to 428,000 total, a 14\-fold increase\), and between 2013 and 2018 it attracted 1,223,560 total visitors **\[E1B\]**. In March 2015, approximately 43,000 people attended reinterment events at the Cathedral, and the burial service was viewed by more than 600 million worldwide. In the year following the identification, **Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre** \(BBHC\) ticket sales increased by 62% \(2013: GBP95,375; 2014: GBP154,425\) and retail sales increased by 74% \(2013: GBP74,215; 2014: GBP129,440\), with smaller rises in visitor numbers in subsequent years **\[E1F\]**. .The *“remarkable King Richard III discovery and \[his\] connection with Leicester and Leicestershire”* **\[E1F\]** continues to drive **regional economic and tourism investment and planning**. The Leicester and Leicestershire Tourism Growth Plan 2019 has designed *“a critical mass”* of RIII experiences through 2024 **\[E1Eii\]**. The Leicester Tourism Action Plan 2020\-2025 is *“anchored by the King Richard III story”*. This includes relocating the city’s tourist information centre to the RIIIVC *“for the 130,000\-plus visitors now coming each year, many drawn to see the tomb of RIII*” **\[E1Eiii\]**. LCoC created a Conservation Plan for BBHC to foster *“a local economy that supports . . . protection of the archaeological resources”* stating that the Battle of Bosworth *“has accrued even greater significance following the discovery of the remains of Richard III”* \(August 2013\) **\[E1Ev\]**. Leicester Cathedral’s 2020\-2023 Strategic Plan confirmed that RIII is a core driver for its GBP11.3 million project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund \(2016\), to restore the Cathedral and build a Heritage Learning Centre, stating: *“The Cathedral changed enormously leading up to, during and in the aftermath of March 2015 when King Richard III was reinterred …. This new situation has become increasingly embedded and we are now into the next major redevelopment phase entitled ‘Leicester Cathedral Revealed’”* **\[E1Ei, iv\]**. 

 **Outreach and education impact**A\- and AS\-level *Wars of the Roses* History curricula incorporated the team’s research \(September 2015\). The RIIIVC also incorporated the research into educational and outreach programmes, which, since opening in July 2014, have reached approximately 12,000 learners. In the 2018/2019 academic year alone, they reached 3,324 \(62% KS 1&2; 23% KS 3&4; 15% FE/HE, July 2019\) **\[E2A\]**. The underpinning research was a key feature of the seven\-day RIII exhibit at the Royal Society’s ‘Festival of Science’ \(June 2015\), with 13,000 visitors, where of those responding to the visitor survey 85% strongly agreed or agreed that the exhibition had increased their interest in ‘science’. The replica skeleton and research displays travelled to Birmingham’s ‘Big Bang Fair’ \(2014, c.70,000\); Galway Science and Technology Festival \(2017, c. 20,000\); and Bulgaria’s Sofia Science Festival \(2017, c.17,000\) \[ **E2B\]**. The University of Leicester RIII website and educational materials have had 1,782,871 unique page views from the UK \(39.5%\), the USA \(33.1%\), Australia \(7.1%\), and worldwide \(August 2013 – December 2020\) **\[E2C\]**. By December 2020, more than 83,000 people had enrolled in the research team’s six\-week MOOC, *England in the Time of King Richard III*. Participants’ satisfaction scores averaged a high 4.7 out of 5, with 278 reviews stating, for example: *“\[T\]his course has reignited my passion for history and archaeology and led me to apply to do a Masters Degree in an archaeology discipline”* **\[E2D\]**. In 2015, the Scout and Guiding associations produced a RIII challenge badge drawing on the RIII research and story, with approximately 2,000 challenges completed in Leicestershire alone by May 2020 **\[E3\]**. **Cultural impact** 

 Press and media coverage in March 2015 relating to the reinterment alone totalled 2,071 stories and reached 358 million people. By 2017, press and media coverage of the discovery and reinterment reached an estimated one billion people around the globe **\[E4\]**. In November 2013, the University of Leicester Archaeology Service \(ULAS\) won the Queen’s Anniversary Prize: *“The University of Leicester is recognised for its long record of exceptional research, commercial archaeology and public engagement in history and heritage, highlighted by the work of the team that discovered the remains of King Richard III beneath a car park”* **\[E5A\]**. BBC’s *History Extra* website visitors voted RIII as their number one historical figure of interest in the ‘Top 100’ poll 2015 – 2017, and in July 2020, they voted ‘Did RIII order the murder of the Princes in the Tower?’ as *“history’s greatest mystery”* with 35% of the votes, *“almost three times as many as the building of Stonehenge*” **\[E5B\]**. 

 The RIII story and the research underpinning it **\[R1 – R5\]** stimulated significant cultural responses. It generated new publications and music, largely aimed at general audiences. Books include Mike Pitts’ *Digging for Richard III: How Archaeology Found the King* and David Horspool’s *Richard III: A Ruler and his Reputation,* as well as literature aimed specifically at children, such as former Children’s Laureate Michael Morpurgo’s *The Fox and the Ghost King* \(fiction\) and Rosalind Adams’s *Children’s Book of Richard III* **\[E7\].** It inspired three creative responses for RIII’s 2015 reburial service at Leicester Cathedral: *Ghostly Grace*, a choral piece by Judith Bingham; an anthem by Judith Weir; and *Richard*, a eulogy by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, read by Benedict Cumberbatch, with more than 265,000 views \(December 2020\). Nico Muhly composed the song, ‘Old Bones’, using the words of ULAS lead Richard Buckley and RIII Society’s Philippa Langley, for countertenor Lestyn Davies **\[E8\]**. 

 The project also inspired major dramatic productions and television documentaries **\[E4 – E8\]**. *The Hollow Crown* \(BBC2, 2016\), starring Benedict Cumberbatch, used the team’s analysis of RIII’s skeleton **\[R2\]**, and opened with a shot of his spinal curvature. The production reached 0.84 million viewers in one week, and 0.94 million in 28 days **\[E6A\]**. The Leicester research also inspired Ralph Fiennes’ 2016 portrayal of Shakespeare’s *Richard III* at the Almeida Theatre. Fiennes stated: *“They found the spine and it is very curved, so we tried to base his physicality as close as possible to the evidence that came out of the excavation in Leicester”* **\[E6B\]**. The performance, which featured a reconstruction of the excavation site on stage, sold 21,850 tickets and its live broadcast reached 50,000 additional viewers worldwide **\[E6B\]**. 

 Channel 4’s *Richard III: The New Evidence* \(August 2014\), featured University of Leicester research **\[R1, R3–R5\]**, reaching 1,760,000 viewers in seven days **\[E6C\]**, while PBS \(USA\) ran the director’s cut, *Secrets of the Dead: Resurrecting Richard III* \(September 2014\). Both starred actor Dominic Smee as RIII. Smee, who shares the king’s condition, stated that the analysis of the king’s condition profoundly impacted his confidence and his acceptance of his own body. Removing his shirt during filming *“was a defining point in my life. This was the first time that I had been truly honest and open about a part of me that I had kept hidden for so many years*” **\[E6C\]** *.* Smee stated the experience made him feel like he was reliving RIII’s last moments, and he is now *“confident enough to give lectures about his experiences and the research”* **\[E4\]**. **Patented Ancestry.com DNA test reaches millions worldwide**King established that combining molecular genetics and surname analysis can help identify population structure and history **\[R7\]**, which can be applied to 'genetic genealogy' procedures. Because of the growing popularity of individual DNA testing, this research has indirectly reached 14 million people by 2019. The US\-based Ancestry.com, the world’s largest for\-profit genealogical company, used King’s **\[R7\]** findings as the sole underpinning research for their exclusive DNA\-testing patent \(2017\). The patent applies to the company’s AncestryDNA tests, which are sold to the public for GBP79 each. AncestryDNA sold 14 million DNA test kits worldwide in 2019, doubling their 2018 sales of 7 million **\[E9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact In a world where unsustainable urban development threatens to undermine the future of our cities and the wellbeing of our local societies, research that guides clean transport policy\-making, planning and management, is critical. Huddersfield Business School \(HBS\) research has inspired authorities in Drama, Greece, to prioritise cycling, create its first Bike\-Sharing scheme \(BSS\) and implement the first Walking School Buses \(WSBs\) in Greece. Twelve Greek cities, including Athens, are using the research findings to develop their EU\-funded Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans \(SUMPs\) and more than five million people benefit from the policy changes initiated by this work. The Hellenic Ministry of Environment and Energy \(HMEE\) has adopted the research and its applications as a policy guidance tool and is implementing HBS\-influenced sustainable transport planning interventions in every Greek city. As examples of sustainable travel, the BSS and WSB projects described in the case study, have improved health and wellbeing and reduced traffic congestion \(by 30% from the first week of the WSB scheme\), air pollution, noise nuisance, road accidents and social exclusion. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 According to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals agenda, future urban planning must be underpinned by a new brand of sustainable thinking because the current pace, nature and patterns of economic growth and the strategic policy\-making tied to it are threatening the future of our climate, eco\-systems, cities and livelihoods. Car\-centric urban planning is widely recognised as unsustainable, but non\-motorised mobility initiatives like Bike\-Sharing schemes \(BSSs\) and Walking School Buses \(WSBs – groups of children walking to school along a set route, supervised by adults\), which could replace automobiles for short trips, are still severely understudied. This is particularly true in the context of countries like Greece that have, thus far, never been at the forefront of socio\-technical innovation.The research underpinning the impact presented in this case study was carried out by Dr Alexandros Nikitas, Reader in Smart Transport at HBS, in Greece, the UK and Sweden.A quantitative survey of 640 local road users in the Greek city of Drama \(3.1\) investigated their attitudes to bike\-sharing and its introduction to their city. The results indicated that 87% of the respondents would like to see their city introduce a local BSS and 62.8% would then use it at least once a week. The sample size was more than 1% of the total population of the city \(approx. 59,000\), making the results representative of the local community and potentially generalisable to a wider context, indicating that a BSS can be a publicly acceptable investment for smaller cities interested in shared\-use mobility.Research \(3.2\) was carried out with 25 parents of primary age children in the UK city of Bradford. Four focus groups were used at two schools, and attitudes to WSBs and whether these could be an effective way to introduce sustainable mobility to children were subjected to a thematic analysis. The research revealed six core critical decision\-making factors: logistics; safety; health and wellbeing; emotional needs; trust; and educational opportunities.  Mechanisms that helped WSBs prosper in the longer term included: school and authority engagement; customised schemes that recognised the special characteristics of each school; participant incentives for students and adult supervisors; positive branding; and enhanced road safety initiatives. This work provided a new theoretical acceptance framework and a knowledge exchange platform to support the introduction of WSBs in Greece as well as a template for how WSB interventions could be successfully implemented. 

 Research with the National Technical University of Athens \(NTUA\) \(3.3\) used a mixed\-methods approach, including secondary data analysis, field observations and a quantitative survey completed by 534 BSS users, to study the usage and acceptance patterns of the first dockless \(and biggest electric\) BSS in Greece, Rethymno’s Bikeazy. The findings suggested that the BSS was used primarily for short\-distance trips and very short rentals. The usage of the scheme was adversely affected by traffic safety concerns and limitations in the existing cycling infrastructure.  The majority of both frequent and occasional users of the scheme thought that it was affordable, easy to use and suitable for both tourist and local populations. The study proposed an expansion of the Bikeazy scheme, better bike fleet distribution and ways to improve its attractiveness. 

 Research in Gothenburg, Sweden \(population approx. 571,000\) \(3.4\) used an online questionnaire to survey 558 users and non\-users of the local BSS \(Styr&Ställ\). The results of the paper \(3.4\) showed that the BSS was approved by 92.4% of the respondents even if only 23% of them were actual users. The paper disconnected, for the first time, ‘scheme success’ from a strict usage rate perspective showing that people supported the BSS for sustainability reasons but also provided evidence for a massive, at the time, untapped usage potential. Critically, the research found that further investments in cycling and BSS initiatives \(including BSS expansion\) were approved by 88.6% of the respondents. The study was among the first to indicate the suitability of BSSs beyond the environment of a large city and was used as a template for the BSS research in Drama. This is still the only academic paper written about Styr&Ställ. 

 In 2019 a two\-stage methodology was adopted to generate widely applicable evidence\-based BSS findings \(3.5\). It combined the lessons reported in earlier research \(3.1, 3.4\) and a literature review of BSS successes and failures across the globe to create a systematic roadmap of best BSS practice. The resulting ‘toolkit for policy\-makers’ emphasised the need for city\-specific system design and expansion strategies, more bike\-friendly infrastructure and legislation, pro\-active cultural engagement, anti\-abuse measures, enhanced fleet management and realistic scheme profit expectations. It argued that the key value of a BSS is its ability to yield sustainability benefits by promoting a modal shift in travel and supporting the creation of liveable built environments where humans are actively prioritised over cars.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings have influenced policy and practice at the national, regional and local government levels across Greece and in Gothenburg, Sweden. Local societies and especially school authorities, parents and children have benefitted from the eco\-friendly travel initiatives instigated as a result. Impacts have been generated in three areas: supporting policy and planning; supporting the development of a new sustainable mobility ethos for the young; improving liveability and guiding urban infrastructure investments. 

 **Supporting policy and planning** 

 The research findings \(3.1\-3.5\) directly influenced the policy and planning of the municipality and region of Drama in Greece \(5.3, 5.4\). As an ‘adviser’ to the authorities, Nikitas informed and guided the development of a new EU\-funded Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan \(SUMP\) \(5.7\) and subsequent investments in cycling and walking. The research was a key reference point and inspired the initiation of a new BSS and the launch of the first region\-wide WSB programme in Greece. The success of these initiatives in Drama led the two key players in sustainable transport strategy\-building in Greece to use the research findings to develop their work: the primary national policy\-maker on sustainable transport, the Hellenic Ministry of Environment and Energy \(HMEE\); and the Sustainable Mobility Unit of the National Technical University of Athens \(NTUA SMU\), which designed SUMPs for cities, funded by the European Commission’s budget for local authorities. 

 HMEE, as the Ministry responsible for the nation’s urban planning and sustainable development management, used Nikitas’s research as a policy guidance tool for its transport, land use and built environment strategies. HMEE recognised that planning efforts, enriched by HBS research on cycling, BSSs and WSBs, can contribute greatly in re\-inventing Greece’s mobility culture, building a sustainable city model and crafting an ethos of responsibility and awareness for Greeks \(5.1\). It also stated that the initiatives established as a result of this research are examples of best practice, which it is actively working to replicate in every Greek city \(5.1\). The HMEE Secretary General wrote, on behalf of the Minister, about the impact of the research across Greece. He stated that HBS research “has been a source of inspiration and guidance for the Ministry and for multiple city and regional authorities across Greece”, adding “Nikitas’s studies have an invaluable impact on our policy\-making, strategy\-building and implementation approach when it comes to sustainable mobility initiatives. We now have the research evidence and real\-life proof, the latter based on the success story of Drama, to support, plan, design, implement, manage and sustain BSS and WSB interventions across Greece.  These interventions have positive life\-changing consequences for our societies in multiple cities” \(5.1\). The Secretary also named Nikitas as a valuable collaborator who “actively co\-create\(d\) policy agendas \(with HMEE\) designed to generate real impact for our societies and support positive city transformation \(…\) directly associated with socio\-economic, environmental, health and well\-being benefits for our country” \(5.1\). 

 The NTUA SMU is responsible for designing the majority of SUMPs in Greece. Twelve Greek cities, including Drama and three of the country’s largest cities \(Athens, Piraeus and Heraklion\), are using the policy lessons of HBS research \(3.1 to 3.5\) for the delivery of their SUMPs. The regions affected by and benefitting from these SUMPs cater for a total population of five million people. Rethymno, which used the findings for its SUMP, was one of three finalists in the European Mobility Week Awards 2019. The Director of the NTUA SMU wrote: “Dr Nikitas’s reviewing and evaluating services \(…\) have been of paramount importance for helping us to prepare Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans that are genuine game\-changers for cities all across Greece including Tinos, Nemea, Halandri, Alimos, Athens, Piraeus, Heraklion, Rethymno, Loutraki, Lavrio, Kythera and Drama. Nikitas’s research work has positively influenced our planning and designing of sustainable transport strategies and has been a consistent point of reference for us” \(5.2\). Nikitas acted as an external reviewer for the 12 SUMPs of the cities listed above helping the authorities involved to make better policy and planning decisions especially about their capacity to adopt cycling, BSSs and WSBs. 

 The Deputy Regional Governor of Drama suggested that the immediate policy and planning impact of the featured work on his region was beneficial. He wrote to Nikitas: “Your previous and on\-going research work, your valuable policy intervention impact and the real\-life applications of your strategic recommendations are helping our region and its people prosper. Without your research contributions and interventions our sustainable mobility policy and planning strategy could not have been of the same high quality that it is today”. He added, “Our transport strategy now, based on your policy recommendations, has been significantly reshaped” \(5.4\). 

 **Supporting the creation of new sustainable mobility initiatives and ethos for the young and reducing road traffic around schools** 

 Drama’s Primary Education Directorate joined forces with the Municipal and Regional Authorities of Drama to co\-create with HBS, Greece’s first ever WSB programme with seven participating schools \(2019/20\). The plan was to extend this to 40 schools in the 2020/21 academic year \(5.5\). The level of collaboration made the impact of the programme particularly significant. It was developed, initiated and managed by a broad range of authorities under the scientific guidance and supervision of a University and launched simultaneously in multiple schools \(5.3\). The Director of Primary Education stated that information on the scheme was communicated region\-wide to 100,000 people, with 20,000 engaged \(5.5\). 

 The WSB programme has been monitored and evaluated and has yielded measurable impacts.  According to the Director of Primary Education \(5.5\), “the WSB is an amazing concept that is working brilliantly, the children and the parents really love it and has actually created, from the first week of its adoption already \(16\-20 September 2019\), a massive 30% reduction in numbers in the typical school traffic meaning less air pollution, noise and congestion for our local society”. The headmaster of a participating school reported \(based on a series of one\-to\-one interviews and focus groups with the programme participants \(5.6\)\) that children like to walk more, feel more included, safer, healthier, more energised and are more appreciative of nature. They also actively encourage their families to walk more. Their parents saw the WSB programme as a good alternative to driving children to school that made them more flexible and less likely to pollute the environment \(5.6\). Local drivers were more cautious after the WSB introduction and traffic safety improved. Teachers noticed that students were more engaged in the classroom because of the WSB morning exercise, have bonded more, behaved more responsibly inside and outside the classroom, and worked more effectively together \(5.6\). 

 **Improving liveability and guiding urban infrastructure investments** 

 The adoption of BSSs and WSBs led to a reduction in traffic congestion, environmental degradation, noise nuisance and health\-related problems and to improvements in terms of social inclusion and traffic safety. Commenting on the HBS work’s aftermath, \(i.e. the promotion and adoption of BSSs and WSBs across Greece\), HMEE recognised that this “is directly associated with socio\-economic, environmental, health and well\-being benefits for our country” and that Nikitas’s “efforts, without any doubt, help our transition, as a nation, to more liveable urban futures”. HMEE also stated that the research can “help other countries too” \(5.1\). The Mayor of Drama reported local liveability impact: HBS research “help\(ed\) us to reduce traffic congestion, environmental degradation, noise nuisance \(...\) health\-related problems and battle transport\-related social exclusion” \(5.3\). The Director of Primary Education in Drama stated: “students in participating schools on average missed less school days” and that “WSBs reduced traffic congestion in the region during peak times” \(5.5\). 

 To encourage new, more environmentally friendly behaviours, the Municipality of Drama designated its employees as the first beneficiaries of a new electric BSS. A successful bid for funds was made to the HMEE. The Mayor of Drama confirmed the fundamental role that the HBS research played in obtaining a €50,000 grant stating that this “research has been a driving force behind our successful bid to the Greek government \(HMEE\) that ensured a funding of €50,000 for implementing in Drama an alternative electric BSS” \(5.3, 5.8\). 

 The findings referring to the first dockless and largest electric BSS in Greece, Rethymno’s Bikeazy \(3.3\), helped to inform the 12 listed SUMPs \(5.2\) in terms of how to successfully promote and reinforce bike\-sharing usage and uptake. The results have particularly influenced Rethymno’s SUMP\-related activities \(5.2\). Its BSS is to be recalibrated to fit the policy instructions of \(3.3\) regarding implementation and promotion so that it becomes even more successful and attractive to groups that have not yet adopted it on a frequent basis. 

 The BSS research in Gothenburg, Sweden \(3.4\), is the only focused BSS study conducted in the city. On that basis, it has inspired Gothenburg to deliver a new extended BSS \(in place from summer 2020\) since it provided unique evidence that local tax\-payers were supportive of an investment that could maximise the potential of the original scheme \(5.10\). 

 Finally, the research has been popularised for non\-academic audiences, translated and broadly discussed \(5.9\). Press coverage raised awareness about BSSs and WSBs especially in the cities where the research took place, but beyond them too. In Greece, the findings directly informed the national policy work of HMEE and NTUA SMU. The policy toolkit produced in \(3.5\) is also applicable to BSS implementation and management beyond the Greek context.
