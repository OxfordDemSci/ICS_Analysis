###  1. Summary of the impact 

 QMU’s Marie Reid and Maresa Duffy investigated the behavioural consequences of individuals’ dietary intake of free sugars \(sucrose\). Their findings were included in evidence for the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition’s 2015 report ‘Carbohydrates and Health’. Its recommendations led to the UK Government’s \(2016\) ‘Childhood Obesity: A Plan for Action’, to Public Health England’s 2018 ‘Change4Life campaign’, and to revised Government dietary guidance in Scotland and Wales. Their findings also informed the World Health Organization’s \(2015\) guideline on ‘Sugars intake for adults and children’. Reid and Duffy’s research has impacted on public policy and services at national and international levels. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2006 and 2009, Marie Reid and Maresa Duffy of QMU conducted studies into the behavioural effects of sucrose on appetite, mood, and dietary behaviour of overweight and obese women. Previous findings had been inconclusive as to whether individuals’ consumption of free sugars \(sucrose\) directly affected diet and led to weight gain: some findings indicated that consumption directly resulted in weight gain, while other findings suggested that weight gain was not inevitable as individuals compensated for free sugars by reducing sugar intake elsewhere in the diet. Reid and Duffy’s research was conducted to examine further how individuals responded to the addition of sucrose to their diet. 

 In the 2010 study \(\#1\), Reid and Duffy used a single\-blind, between subjects design to examine the dietary behaviour of overweight women \(BMI 25–30\) in response to the intake of free sugars. They provided two groups of participants with soft drinks, sweetened either with sucrose or aspartame \(sweetener\-substitute\), as a supplement to their usual diet. They measured the dietary intake \(via 7 day food diaries\), BMI, mood, hunger, and activity levels \(via activity diary and pedometer\) of the two groups over a four\-week period \(following baseline\). They found that the participants who consumed sucrose\-sweetened drinks reduced their daily energy intake \(including supplementary drinks\) only marginally, by a mean of 0.14 MJ/d as compared to baseline intake. However, participants receiving aspartame\-sweetened drinks reduced their daily energy intake to a greater extent, by a mean of 0.67 MJ/d over the five\-week period. Thus, over\-weight women consuming sucrose\-sweetened drinks reduced their voluntary intake elsewhere in the diet, but such reduction only partially compensated for the increased daily intake of free sugars. By contrast, participants consuming aspartame\-sweetened drinks showed a markedly greater reduction in daily energy intake. 

 In the 2014 study \(\#2\) Reid, Duffy and colleagues used a similar design to examine the dietary behaviours of obese women \(BMI 30\-35\) in response to intake of free sugars, with similar results. In that study, obese women who consumed sucrose\-sweetened drinks increased their daily energy intake over a four\-week period \(following baseline\) by a mean of 0.21 MJ/d. This reflected partial compensation for sucrose added \(blind\) to the diet at the expense of a reduction in reported voluntary intake of carbohydrate and fat. However, participants who consumed aspartame\-sweetened drinks reduced their energy intake by a mean of 0.92 MJ/d, indicating greater compensation elsewhere in the diet for the additional consumption of sweetened drinks. Over the course of the study, energy intake in the diet increased for participants consuming sucrose\-sweetened drinks but decreased for participants consuming aspartame\-sweetened drinks. 

 Findings from these two studies identified a direct link between individuals’ consumption of free sugar in the diet and increase or decrease in daily energy intake. In view of the established link between excessive energy intake and overweight / obesity, the findings point to the attendant risks of excessive dietary intake of free sugars \(sucrose\). 

 Throughout the period of conducting this research, Marie Reid was Professor of Health Psychology and Maresa Duffy was Research Fellow at QMU.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Reid and Duffy’s research has impacted on public policy and services in the UK and internationally. 

  

 <ins>Impact on public policy and services in the UK</ins> 

 Findings from the \(2010, 2014\) studies by Reid, Duffy, and colleagues formed part of the evidence base for a systematic review of high\-quality studies that investigated the relationship between consumption of dietary carbohydrates and health. This review was commissioned by The Food Standards Agency and the Department of Health \(England\) which asked the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \(SACN\) to examine the relationship between dietary carbohydrates and health and to produce public health recommendations. From analysis of the evidence, SACN \(2015, p.81\) concluded that ‘the direction of effect demonstrates that greater consumption of sugars is detrimental to health’, and that ‘the effect is biologically relevant at a population level in free living individuals not subject to energy restriction’. These conclusions led to two SACN dietary recommendations related to sugar \(2015, p.184\), as follows: 

-  The population average intake of free sugars should not exceed 5% of total dietary energy for age groups from 2 years upwards. 

-  The consumption of sugars\-sweetened beverages should be minimised, in both children and adults. 

 These SACN recommendations \(\#1\) have 

1.  been taken up in the dietary advice provided by all UK health departments; 

1.  been incorporated into the healthy eating advice given to consumers; 

1.  led Public Health England to undertake an appraisal of potential policy responses to implement the recommendations \(\#2\); 

1.  informed debate in the House of Commons Health Committee on measures required to implement them \(\#3\); 

1.  resulted in the UK Government producing ‘A Plan for Action’ designed to take forward the recommendations in practice across the public sector, schools, early years settings, families, and elsewhere to reduce significantly England’s rate of childhood obesity over a ten year period \(\#4; \#5\); 

1.  led to Public Health England launching on 2 January 2018 its ‘Change4Life campaign’ that encourages parents to look for ‘100 calorie snacks, two a day max’ to limit their children’s daily intake of free sugars \(\#6\). 

1.  led to the Scottish Government producing ‘Revised Dietary Goals for Scotland’ \(\#7\) and the Welsh Government producing a best practice guideline ‘Food & Nutrition for Childcare Settings’ \(\#8\), both of which reflect the SACN recommendations. 

 Reid and Duffy’s \(2010, 2014\) studies comprised two of the 11 high\-quality studies that were included in the review for the SACN \(2015\) report. The respective increases and decreases in daily energy intake that Reid and colleagues identified were included in the final review and informed the dietary recommendations that ensued. Reid and Duffy’s research has thereby impacted on \(a\) the health and wellbeing of people, as evidenced by changes to public health guidelines, and \(b\) public policy and services, as evidenced by use in policy debates and citation in policy documents. 

 <ins>Impact on international public policy and services</ins> 

 Findings from Reid, Duffy, and colleagues’ \(2010\) study were included in a systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) Department of Nutrition for Health and Development and conducted by Te Morenga and colleagues \(2013\) \(\#9\). The review was commissioned to ‘assess the effects of increasing or decreasing intake of free sugars on excess weight gain’ and thereby to inform development of a WHO guideline. The subsequent 2015 guideline \(\#10\), ‘Sugars intake for adults and children’, makes three recommendations, namely 

 1. WHO recommends a reduced intake of free sugars throughout the lifecourse. 

 2. In both adults and children, WHO recommends reducing the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. 

 3. WHO suggests a further reduction of the intake of free sugars to below 5% of total energy intake. 

 The WHO envisage that the guideline will inform the development of policy and practice relating to dietary intake across the globe. As they state \(p.6\), ‘the guideline will help Member States and their partners in making informed decisions about nutrition policies, programmes and interventions’. 

 Reid and Duffy’s \(2010\) study was one of 30 high\-quality international studies included in the Te Morenga \(2013\) review \(\#9\). Both that review and Reid, Duffy and colleagues’ 2010 study are cited in the 2015 guideline \(\#10\). Reid and Duffy’s research has thereby impacted internationally on the development of public health guidelines, and public policy and services, as evidenced by use in policy debates and citation in policy documents.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Police\-recorded hate crimes in England and Wales are at their highest levels since records began, and the rise in online hate requires the police to address the problem both offline and online. Cardiff’s ESRC\-funded HateLab is the first to address the problem on both fronts, generating vital evidence to inform policy and operational decisions on prevalence, impact and prevention. This evidence formed the primary source of information for the Welsh Government’s Framework for Action on Tackling Hate Crime \(2014\). Cardiff HateLab technologies were also embedded within the National Cyber Hate Crime Hub \(run by the UK’s National Police Chiefs’ Council\), allowing policymakers and police to address hate crime and speech. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A significant ‘dark figure’ remains in hate crime victimisation estimates. Police recorded hate crime data, which indicate a \~150% increase over the last decade, are inaccurate due in part to volatile changes in reporting and recording practices. The Crime Survey for England and Wales \(CSEW\) provides more reliable hate crime estimates, showing a downward trend over the last decade, but it also suffers from methodological limitations rendering annual and regional \(e.g. Wales\) estimates moot. The disparity between sources and unreliable regional estimates has hindered policy development. The migration of hate crime to the internet also created additional operational and policy needs not currently met by existing sources of information. 

 Williams is Director at Cardiff University’s HateLab, a global hub for data and insight into hate crime and speech. Research within HateLab draws on a range of methods, from conventional surveys to machine learning, and an array of criminological concepts, from moral panics to hierarchies of crime information credibility, to generate a broad evidence base on hate offline and online within Wales, the UK and beyond. 

 The All Wales Hate Crime Project \(AWHCP\) **\[G3.1\]**, the first project of its kind in the UK, was the foundation for the HateLab research programme. It remains the largest, most comprehensive study of hate crime in the UK, surveying \~20,00 members of the public, interviewing \~60 victims and engaging with \~5,000 citizens **\[3.1\]**. This mixed method approach examined the impacts of hate crime across protected characteristics \(race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and transgender identity\), as well as age and gender. 

 Key findings include **\[3.1\]**: 

-  First insight into the psychological and physical impacts of hate crime across the seven victim\-types \(most previous hate crime research had focused on discrete victim\-types in isolation\). Those suffering transgender and disability motivated hate crimes were by far the most likely to suffer multiple types of impact compared to other victim types; 

-  Hate crime can have considerable physical and/or psychological impacts on victims \(and their families\), for example post\-victimisation, 18% of respondents attempted to conceal their identity, 18% had considered moving out of Wales, and one in seven experienced suicidal thoughts; 

-  Evidence on victims’ experiences of the criminal justice process that improved service delivery; 

-  Inconsistencies in reporting and recording mechanisms, as well as issues with independent non\-police reporting systems in Wales – many of these are perceived to be online only which acts as a barrier to victims without access to IT facilities; 

-  A large proportion of victims highlighted considerable challenges to accessing support and, as a result, ‘suffered in silence’; 

-  Evidence of the emerging trend in online hate speech on Facebook and Twitter. 

 The project provided a robust source of survey data on hate crime not previously available to policy\-makers or practitioners in Wales **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.1 Identifying and monitoring online hate speech** 

 Four projects **\[**\~£3M from ESRC and US Department of Justice, **G3.2\]** were funded between 2013\-2020 with extensive policy cooperation. The then Head of the Cross\-Government Hate Crime Programme, and now NPCC National Policing Advisor for Hate Crime, acted as a co\-investigator on two projects. These projects addressed the challenges of identifying, monitoring and stemming online hate speech. Williams combined statistical modeling techniques with collaborator Burnap’s \(Cardiff University\) computer science machine learning approach to cope with the unprecedented scale and speed of social media data that had hitherto been a barrier to social science researchers. This novel interdisciplinary approach generated the first evidence base on online hate in the UK **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. 

 For example, the first criminological analysis of online social reactions to terror attacks in the UK \(2014, 2015\) revealed that anti\-Muslim hate speech spiked in the first 24 hours, and rapidly deescalated, indicating a ‘half\-life’ of ‘cyberhate’. Police online information flows were the second longest lasting within the first 36 hours after these events, indicating these as effective channels to keep the public informed, solicit information, and counter hate speech **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. Subsequent analysis showed online hate speech positively correlates with offline hate crimes on the streets of London \(2019\) **\[3.5\]**. Further key findings and outcomes from these funded projects include: 

-  Survey and social media data showing hate crime and online hate speech spiked in the final weeks of the leave campaigns and following the Brexit vote **\[3.5\]**; 

-  Statistical models that showed online anti\-Muslim and anti\-black hate speech can predict race and religious hate crime offline **\[3.5\]**; 

-  Evidence that counter\-hate narratives delivered by third sector actors are effective in stemming the production of hate speech **\[3.6\]**; 

-  Development of the HateLab Dashboard – the first platform to use Machine Learning \(ML\) to detect online hate speech in real time and at scale – to assist academics, practitioners and policy makers in monitoring the spread of online hate speech **\[3.3\]**.  The development of ML to detect hate speech drew heavily on social science concepts, such as Membership Categorisation Analysis, the process of ‘othering’ in language, perceived threat and dehumanisation; 

-  Analysis of the ethical issues associated with using ML to detect and monitor hate speech in real\-time, which contributed to the ongoing debate on predictive policing **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.5\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Williams’ work provided a more accurate picture of a\) the impacts of hate crime in Wales and b\) hate speech online. The novel evidence provided, unavailable from other sources, underpinned the Welsh Government’s Framework for Action on Hate Crime and provided an effective way for UK police forces to respond to online hate. This allowed policymakers and practitioners to better identify, monitor, and prevent hate. 

 **4.1 Creating a new framework for hate crime in Wales** 

 Prior to Williams’ work, the Welsh Government did not have robust data on hate crime in Wales, as existing data sources – such as the Crime Survey for England and Wales – could not be reliably extrapolated to devolved administrations. Cardiff’s All Wales Hate Crime Project \(AWHCP\) was foundational to the Welsh Government’s hate crime policy through directly informing the national Framework for Action on Tackling Hate Crime **\[5.1\]** – the first of its kind in Wales. The Framework focuses on prevention, supporting victims and improving the multi\-agency approach. Underpinned by Williams’ research, it cites the AWHCP more than any other research source \(25 times\). John Davies, the Welsh Government’s Head of Inclusion and Cohesion, confirmed that the Cardiff team *“directly \[fed\] in robust data and insights from their research”* and that the AWHCP *“provided a much needed novel source of evidence”* **\[5.2\]**. He cited three examples of evidence provided which were *“essential to developing key parts of the Framework”* **\[5.2\]**: 

-  Evidence on the impacts of hate crime on victims living in Wales across protected characteristics; 

-  Victims’ experiences of the criminal justice system; 

-  The emerging trend in online hate speech. 

 An evaluation carried out by the Welsh Government Audit Office \(2015\-16\) stated *“the Framework was…supported by robust evidence from the All Wales Hate Crime Project…. \[it\] helped…the Framework to focus upon areas which will have a significant impact”* **\[5.3**, p.1 **\]**. For example, under\-reporting and the importance of community reporting systems were key findings of the AWHCP that fed into the Framework Delivery Plan. Welsh Government funding was allocated as a result to improve third\-party \(independent non\-police\) systems for victims to report hate crimes. Davies confirmed that *“a major innovation of the Framework, supported by Professor Williams’ evidence that shows significant barriers exist to reporting hate crime in Wales, is the Wales Hate Crime Report and Support Centre”* **\[5.2\]**. This Centre provides a flexible reporting mechanism, enhanced and integrated support for victims, and has a dedicated team of case workers. Davies highlighted an evaluation which found that the Centre contributed to an increase in hate crime reporting of 20%, despite victimisation falling by 28% in the same period **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.2 Supporting delivery of policy actions and influencing practice** 

 Williams is the only academic member of the All Wales Hate Crime Criminal Justice Board that takes forward the Framework’s recommendations. His ongoing work draws on HateLab research **\[3.3, 3.5, 3.6\]** to deliver the following actions from the Framework Delivery Plan \(2015\-6\) **\[5.4\]**: 

-  Pilot a Community Tension Detection System to assess community feeling on social media during high periods of tension \(the HateLab Dashboard\); 

-  Conduct research on: i\) the possible link between online hate speech and offline hate crimes and ii\) identifying and modelling the spread of anti\-Semitic content on Twitter. 

 In addition to informing policy, All Wales Hate Crime Project findings *“have influenced practice and public engagement via Welsh Government outputs for end\-users”* **\[5.2\]**. Outputs developed using the findings include: 

-  Online Hate Speech Guides for use in schools, as well as by youth groups and probation services; these have been accessed 6,120 times **\[5.5a** and **5.5b\]**; 

-  Campaign materials for National Hate Crime Awareness Weeks \(2013\-2017\) featuring films of victims of hate crime surveyed by the AWHCP speaking of their experiences, overlaid with highlights of the research findings **\[5.6\]**; 

-  A Tackling Hate Crime Toolkit, which was distributed to all Housing Associations in Wales, has been used by a range of practitioners \(including housing officers responsible for dealing with hate crime, managers, and contractors\) to support training on estates with high levels of hate crime. The toolkit directly quotes issues highlighted in the AWHCP and also quotes a key project recommendation: *“Social housing providers need to ensure that hate crime offenders are dealt with quickly and effectively and policies do not result in processes that ‘manage’ the victim rather than deal with the perpetrators \(All Wales Hate Crime Research Project\)”* **\[5.7**, p.12 **\]**. 

 At UK level, the project has been widely quoted in national policy documents, including ‘Action Against Hate: The UK Government’s Plan for Tackling Hate Crime’ \(2016\) **\[5.8a\]**. Burnap was also invited, as a HateLab representative, to the **Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry on Hate Crime and its Violent Consequences** in 2016, set\-up in response to the murder of Jo Cox MP and rising levels of hate speech and crimes. HateLab evidence was cited in the committee’s report showing that online hate speech could be detected at scale and in real\-time with the ML developed at Cardiff **\[3.2** \- **3.5\]**. The inquiry’s subsequent criticisms of social media companies for not using such ML to counter the spread of hate influenced the drafting of the White Paper on Online Harms **\[5.8b\]**. 

 **4.3 Tackling online hate speech for the UK’s National Cyber Hate Crime Hub** 

 Police statistics on online hate significantly underestimate the extent of the problem as most incidents go unreported. The HateLab Dashboard, by monitoring in real time and not having to wait for victims to file a report, reflects a direct observation of prevalence. It was designed to facilitate near\-real time responses to cyberhate, including targeting counter\-speech at repeat perpetrators and pre\-empting outbreaks of hate crime on the streets. It is currently used by Welsh Government Community Cohesion Coordinators, the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit, and a London\-based LGBTQ anti\-violence charity **\[5.9\]**. 

 The Dashboard has also been integrated into the UK\-wide National Cyber Hate Crime Hub \(2019\), run by the National Police Chiefs’ Council. The Hub, the point of contact for all victims of online hate crime, uses the Dashboard to produce intelligence reports for police, senior civil servants and MPs. Paul Giannasi, Director of the Hub, is responsible for coordinating policy and operational activity across all Government departments and criminal justice agencies in their response to hate crime. He confirmed that the new data and insights provided by the research *“transformed the way my team of police officers and civilian staff at the National Cyber Hate Crime Hub monitor and tackle online hate crime”* and that the Dashboard has *“fundamentally changed the way we monitor the spread of hate speech during national events”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 Prior to the Dashboard, Hub staff did not have an adequate way of tracking and responding to hate speech around events, such as the Brexit referendum vote. Giannasi stated: *“during live operations, we were quickly inundated with irrelevant information and failed to capture hate speech in a systematic and reliable way”* but the technological solutions provided by HateLab *“ensures the Hub can monitor the production and spread of hate speech around events in a robust and reliable way”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 Dashboard data on the spread of online hate speech allows the police to better understand the dynamics of propagation, leading to improved response times, better support for victims and more effective allocation of resources **\[5.10\]**. Most recently, *“the Dashboard has allowed us to gain valuable insight into how groups and individuals have used the coronavirus outbreak to stir up hatred online”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 Giannasi estimated that HateLab has resulted in economic savings of \~£500,000 via the Dashboard, cloud and data services and an implementation evaluation **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Westminster’s ATM \(Air Traffic Management\) Group, led by Professor Andrew Cook, have designed, computed, and maintained the aviation industry’s standard delay cost values that have been used across Europe by practitioners and policy makers since 2011 and have resulted in the following impacts during this REF period: 

-  Informing ATM business decisions – enabling NATS to avoid significant additional investment and operating costs; securing continuing maintenance cost savings at Australian airports. 

-  Highlighting the need for airport capacity expansion in the UK and informing the Government decision in which airport expansion scheme to invest. 

-  Informing EU airport safety regulations to accommodate value of time penalties that would be incurred by aircraft operations under severe weather conditions. 

-  Changing the strategic and tactical design of aircraft prioritisation rules within the Single European Sky ATM Research \(SESAR\) project to reduce delays for airspace users. 

-  Underpinning binding regulations on all EU states regarding en\-route delays.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The researchers developed, from first principles, a quantitative framework for calculating airline delay costs \[1\]. The core cost components considered in their work are those associated with aircraft maintenance, fleet financing, crew costs, passenger costs to the airline, and fuel burn. The report furnishes a set of **standard reference values relating to the cost of delay**, for use in both the calculation of operational/tactical costs \(e.g. producing a set of quantitative rules for re\-route trade\-offs\) and at the policy/strategic level \(e.g. to inform airspace design\). It formulates costs based on specific aircraft types, for multiple cost elements, under various cost scenarios, for all phases of flight, and as a non\-linear function of delay duration. 

 The objective of report \[2\] is to provide users, including industry, with **updated reference values for the cost of delay** to European airlines. It updates previous reporting, which was based on the reference year of 2010. This new report presents costs for the reference year 2014 and extends the range of aircraft covered from 12 to 15, with the values being generated by a significantly updated model. 

 Journal paper \[3\] presents a model for **the economic value of extra capacity at an airport**. This is based on a series of functional relationships linking the benefits of extra capacity and the associated costs. It takes into account the cost of delay for airlines and its indirect consequences on the airport, through the loss or gain of aeronautical and non\-aeronautical revenues. The model is highly data\-driven and a range of data sources have been used. In particular, special care has been taken to incorporate the full distribution of delay at the airports, rather than average values only. The results from the simplified version of the model show the existence of a unique maximum for the operating profit of the airport in terms of capacity, which is clearly dependent on the airport and exhibits interesting behaviour with respect to the average number of passengers per aircraft and the predictability of the flight departure times. The researchers further show that there exists an important trade\-off between increased predictability and punctuality at the airport. It is demonstrated that a more complex behavioural model for passengers can introduce several local maxima in airport profits that may drive the airport towards suboptimal decisions. 

 In another journal paper, the researchers tackle the lack of a **framework for modelling the cost of resilience during disturbance** in ATM research. There is no universally accepted metric for cost resilience. The design of such a framework is presented and the modelling to date is reported \[4\]. The framework incorporates performance assessment as a function of differential stakeholder uptake of strategic mechanisms designed to mitigate disturbance. Advanced cost\- and non\-cost\-based metrics, disaggregated by stakeholder sub\-types, are described. A new cost resilience metric is proposed and exemplified with early test data. 

 Journal paper \[5\] **presents the model developed within the H2020/SESAR ‘Vista’ project, studying the future evolution of trade\-offs between ATM key performance indicators, such as costs and emissions**. This is a new, holistic model for the European ATM system. It is an agent\-driven simulator, featuring various stakeholders such as the Network Manager and airlines. The model simulates changes that business and regulatory forces drive at a strategic, pre\-tactical and tactical level, comparing future European scenarios for 2035 and 2050, drawing attention to several, future key performance indicator \(KPI\) trade\-offs. The economic components of the model are underpinned by the Westminster team’s cost of delay computations, which are essential for all the airline impact calculations. Future implications are presented and discussed, e.g. at the passenger, flight, and airline level.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  Devising EUROCONTROL’s standard reference documents 

 The March 2011 report \[1\], and its December 2015 update \[2\], were developed for and published by the Performance Review Commission \(PRC\) of EUROCONTROL, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation. EURCONTROL states: “The **University of Westminster \(UoW\) report** ... represents the most **recent and comprehensive appraisal of the cost of delays in the air traffic management system in Europe**. The report is designed as a reference document for European delay direct costs incurred by airlines, both at the strategic \(planning\) and tactical stages” \[a\-i, p.15\]. The Westminster report is a dynamic document, by which the framework is updated with the most recent data and enhanced research methodology every few years, ensuring its accuracy and utility. This is further reflected in several industry reference documents, such as EUROCONTROL’s annual \(‘ACE’\) benchmarking report for ATM cost\-effectiveness, updated 2016 through 2020 \[a\-ii\]. 

 As the central organisation for the coordination and planning of air traffic control for all of Europe, EUROCONTROL’s use and dissemination of Cook and colleagues’ work is such that it reaches a range of aviation stakeholders \(airports and airlines, and, through these, passengers and businesses\) across the continent. Examples of direct impact arising from the applied use of the ATM Group’s delay cost reference values, sometimes via their incorporation in the above EUROCONTROL reports, are described below. 

#  Informing ATM business decisions 

 NATS \(En Route\) plc, NERL, is the UK’s air navigation service provider \(ANSP\) providing air traffic control services over the UK and the eastern North Atlantic. In order to demonstrate how their measures can reduce the cost burden of delays, NERL’s Business Plan 2020\-2024 incorporates EUROCONTROL’s Performance Review Unit’s valuation techniques “to estimate the cost of delay to airlines ... the values used for this analysis are taken from Performance Review Report \(PRR 2015\), which itself draws on the latest University of Westminster report”, i.e. output \[2\] \[b\-i, p. 38\]. The use of these reference values has allowed NERL to make the strategic decision to retain previous targets: “We, and our customers, have a strategic interest in ensuring that there is sufficient air traffic control capacity to cater for traffic growth and changes to demand profiles and routings ... We do not believe that setting more stretching regulatory targets on average delay per flight in RP3 is cost effective” \[b\-i, p.39\]. In this way, the ATM Group’s work has enabled NERL to **avoid “significant additional investment and operating cost”** \[b\-i, p.39\]. 

 In another example, PricewaterhouseCoopers \(PwC\) were commissioned by Airservices Australia \(the Australian ANSP\) to assess the costs and benefits of Metron Traffic Flow \(an air traffic flow management system\) following its implementation at Sydney, Perth, and Brisbane airports in 2012 and at Melbourne Airport in 2014. The analysis featured in a December 2014 report that used the ATM Group’s cost reference values \[1\] in respect to: marginal maintenance costs and marginal crew costs, per minute and by aircraft type \[b\-ii, p.7\-9, and 18\]. The former is important because: “Marginal maintenance costs incurred by aircraft increase with airborne time \(and therefore with airborne delay\)”, while under the latter it was cited that: “Airline stakeholders are all in favour of including the effects of ground delay in the analysis as it is overall delay that has the most significant effect on their metrics and operations” \[b\-ii, p.18\]. PwC state that: “the airborne delay savings contributed to an estimated maintenance **costs savings of $27.3 million** over the appraisal period” \[b\-ii, p.12\], further concluding that the data “provide support for the continued rollout of Metron across domestic airports, in agreement with the positive feedback received from stakeholders” \[b\-ii p.15\]. The evaluation, drawing extensively on the ATM Group’s cost reference values, enabled the Metron software to become fully integrated into Airservices Australia’s ground delay programme \[b\-iii\], a decision driven by the cost savings cited \[b\-ii, b\-iv, p.51\]. 

 <ins> **Informing policy decisions on airport capacity in the UK**</ins> 

 The ATM Group’s work has also played a role in setting the agenda for the expansion of airport capacity in the UK, by **highlighting the need for airport expansion and informing the Government decision on which airport expansion scheme should be invested in**. The Airports Commission \(AC\) was set up by the coalition government in 2012 and undertook “one of the most comprehensive assessments of any infrastructure project ever undertaken in the UK” \[c\-i\]. In their 2014 *Business Case and Sustainability Assessment* of the Heathrow Airport North West Runway scheme, the AC conducted an analysis of delay costs on five specific demand scenarios using output \[1\], the 2011 version of the ATM Group’s reference values \[c\-ii, p.37\-38\]. The AC found that: “The benefits of reduced delays from the scheme range from £0.8 billion to £2.2 billion, depending on the demand scenario under consideration. Under the *global growth* scenario, benefits experienced by airlines account for 56% of the total benefits” \[c\-ii, p.38\]. On the basis of the AC data, which included an *Economy: Final Delay Impacts Assessment* that also used the ATM Group’s cost reference values \[c\-iii, p.43\], the Department for Transport \(DfT\) chose the Heathrow Airport North West Runway scheme in Oct 2016 \[c\-i\]. The DfT augmented support for this option by using the ATM Group’s updated cost reference values \(output \[2\]\) “to produce estimates for the annual and total costs to airlines of delays” in their *Upgrading UK Airspace: Strategic Rationale* document of Feb 2017 \[c\-iv, p.67\-69\]. The results, as seen in the table below \[c\-iv, p.68\], demonstrated the need to expand the capacity of UK airports. This Heathrow expansion plan has gained legal approval, thus allowing a planning application, subject to its alignment with climate commitments \[c\-v\]. 

#  Changing EU Airport Safety Regulations 

 In 2018, the Møreforsking Molde AS research group was commissioned by Avinor AS, a state\-owned, limited company that operates most of the civil airports in Norway, to conduct an economic impact assessment of implementing the International Civil Aviation Organization’s \(ICAO\) regulations of minimum friction on contaminated runways \[d\-i\]. These regulations were likely to affect aircraft operations under specific weather conditions – such as those in Norway that are severely exposed to snow and ice – and were anticipated to “entail a larger number of cancelled or diverted flights because of reduced aircraft maximum landing weight” \[d\-i, p.9\]. As such, the March 2018 report analyses, in particular, the economic costs of reduced regularity for the passengers at four Norwegian airports, and makes its calculations by using the ATM Group’s updated delay cost reference values \(output \[2\]\), with particular reference to its value of time calculations \[d\-i, p.15\]. The findings were that the economic costs of the delays that would be incurred from implementation of the aforementioned ICAO regulations would be significant, “rais\[ing\] the question of whether the winter services will remain sustainable under the new regulations” \[d\-i, p.21\]. Avinor AS provided this case study to ICAO as part of their submission on potential impacts of the new regulations to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency \(EASA\) Rulemaking Group RMT.0704. **EASA issued a proposed amendment to the aforementioned ICAO regulation, “as regards runway surface condition assessment and reporting which will be applicable worldwide by November 2020”,** which specifies “the introduction of new requirements for runway surface condition assessment and reporting, aerodrome snow plan \[…\] as well as performance standards for runway surface friction measurement devices” \[d\-ii, p.1\]. It is notable that this proposed amendment document features a case study summary of the Møreforsking report across several of its pages, demonstrating its contextual importance in informing the EASA regulation amendment \[d\-ii, p.197\-200\]. The corresponding Implementing Regulation \(EU\) 2020/469, of 14 February 2020, was adopted in July 2020, explicitly citing the foregoing stakeholder consultation \[d\-iii\]. 

#  Changing the strategic and tactical design of aircraft prioritisation rules in SESAR: 

 SESAR’s role is to define, develop, and deploy applied research needed to increase ATM performance and build Europe’s intelligent air transport system \[e\-i\]. The size of this undertaking is such that the current \(2016 to 2024\) programme budget is EUR 1.6 billion. By explicitly quantifying the non\-linear relationship between delay duration and delay cost \(e.g. two 15\-minute delays will usually cost less than one 30\-minute delay\) in their delay cost reference values, the ATM Group has **changed the strategic and tactical design of aircraft prioritisation rules within SESAR**. 

 This has occurred, for instance, through the User Driven Prioritisation Process \(UDPP\), a SESAR project led by EUROCONTROL, which minimises the impact of delay in capacity\-constrained situations by attributing ground delays based on airspace user preferences \[e\-ii\]. As the former leader of the UDPP project writes: “Prof Cook input into the early, general design of UDPP through mutual project collaborations, especially during the ‘UDPP Credits’ project \(for SESAR Project 07.06.02\), in the period 2014 – 2016, and in collaborations on subsequent papers. Of particular value was establishing the important principle of the non\-linear relationship between delay duration and delay cost, expressed, for example, through the concept of step cost functions, as reflected in the standard reference values published by the University of Westminster: an important concept common to both the UDPP and Westminster cost models” \[e\-iii\]. 

 On the basis of UDPP validation simulation data, researchers at EUROCONTROL and Think Research Ltd estimate that **UDPP can reduce the impact of delays on airspace users on the additional cost by more than 40%, and on passengers’ connections, whilst not reducing the performance of the airport** \[e\-iv\]. A shadow\-mode trial at Zurich Airport in Oct. 2019, marked the project’s phase\-1 implementation \[e\-ii; e\-v, p.94\] and full rollout across Europe is being evaluated \[e\-v\]. This work is being pursued in the H2020/SESAR project ‘BEACON’, led by the University of Westminster, with EUROCONTROL as a partner. 

#  Directly driving binding regulations on all EU states regarding ATC service provision: 

 The European Commission’s Implementing Regulation \(EU\) No 390/2013, of 3 May 2013, laid down a performance scheme for air navigation services and network functions. These regulations applied until 31 Dec. 2019 \(since  [<ins>updated</ins>](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.056.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2019:056:TOC)\) and imposed **binding targets on European states** regarding, *inter alia*, average en\-route delays \[f\-i\]. Citing \[f\-i\], each functional airspace block across Europe has its own targets, and for ‘reference period 2’ \(2015\-2019\), the Single European Sky area \(European\) network average target was set at no more than 0.5 minutes/flight, on 11 March 2014 \[f\-ii\]. This value was determined as a trade\-off between the cost of capacity and the cost of delay, the latter being “estimated based on a study commissioned by the EUROCONTROL PRU by the University of Westminster, UK” \(referring to output \[1\]\) within the methodology developed by EUROCONTROL \[f\-iii, p.20\]. 

 The use of the dynamic Westminster report across the applicable period of the regulations is evidenced, for example, in the *PRB Annual Monitoring Report 2015* \[f\-iv\]. Explaining how the “KPI used for Union\-wide en\-route capacity is the average minutes of en\-route ATFM delay per flight”, as per Implementing Regulation \(EU\) No 390/2013, the PRB cites output \[2\] \(2015\) to calculate the cost impact of the average value of 0.76 achieved that year: “additional delay of 0.26 minutes per flight equates to an additional cost to airspace users of an estimated 240M€ per annum of indirect cost exposure \(Delay Calculation 25,321 flights/day x 365 x €100\)” \[f\-iv, p.32\]. On the basis of this cost of an additional 0.26 minutes of delay, on average, it is recommended that “the European Commission should consider interventions under Article 18 \(2\) of the Performance Regulation”, i.e. **to ensure that delays are limited to 0.5 minutes/flight** **and additional cost to airspace users is avoided** \[f\-iv, p.32\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Ramanathan has enabled the preservation of and enhanced access to Indic classical texts and Indic scripts, by providing typographic frameworks and design guidelines for publication of a bilingual book series, the Murty Classical Library of India. This series preserves two millennia of Indian literary works and makes them accessible to new generations of readers. Harvard University Press have used Ramanathan’s research and resulting guidelines in the design of 29 books in this series to date \(2015\-2020\). Her research has also developed an approach to typography that empowers marginalised communities of readers as well as expanding readership in inclusive and decolonial ways, by informing practice at the Indian publisher Tara Books. Ramanathan developed a new approach to typography which was adopted by authors and design practitioners, enhancing reading and improving access to texts for children.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Rathna Ramanathan’s research uses publishing as a platform to bring together intercultural communication, decolonial approaches, graphic design and typography through engaged and situated design research, working with local communities and international networks of editors, translators, designers, illustrators, publishers and readers. It explores spaces in which new kinds of documents can be created, and, conversely, considers how the production of new texts and images creates spaces that enable emancipatory, temporary or subversive practices to occur \[3.1\]. 

 The chapter ‘London’s Little Presses’ investigates non\-mainstream approaches to book design, illustration and publishing in post\-World War 2 Britain. This research explores design history and practice focussing on forms of typography that are associated with movement, sound and texture, particularly in relation to poetry, that were produced by little presses. Typographic approaches introduced by European emigres to England after WW2 are given voice over English approaches to setting poetry during that time, and reveal approaches to book design and production that differ significantly from mass industrial processes \[3.1\]. 

 This research led to a collaboration with Harvard University Press \(HUP\) to create an accessible library of modern translations of important classical Indian texts, *The Murty Classical Library of India* \(MCLI\) \[3.2\]. For example, in the Indian subcontinent, where lithography preceded letterpress and letterpress was introduced with colonial intent, the form of the book was not the codex. The page was visual and spatial rather than linear and chronological, and the reader rather than the author was given prominence. The colonial roots of printing meant that ‘non\-Latin’ scripts were synthesised with a Latin page, rather than the printing being informed by the requirements of the Indic scripts, languages or texts. As a result, many important classical texts in Indian literature have never reached a global audience; others are becoming unavailable even to Indian readers<ins>.</ins> Ramanathan’s research has developed the first framework to pay attention to typography specially for Indian languages \[3.3\]. 

 Ramanathan’s research for the MCLI book series included examining historical archives, current linguistic data and non\-western modes of design practice, with two main results: 1\) Adaptation of historical, non\-western, design approaches to the book for contemporary audiences. The research investigated how classical texts presented as bilingual translations \(original text and translated to English\) could be designed for contemporary and global audiences, taking into account the needs of diverse readers \(i.e. levels of fluency and bilingualism; diverse interests and engagements\). 2\) Development of typographic and graphic design guidelines for books in Indic scripts and languages. A framework was created for the design of the printed book interiors, digital texts and Indic typography for jacket designs \[3.2\]. The book designs and typesetting were created by Ramanathan using bespoke typefaces designed by Henrik Kubel, John Hudson, Fiona Ross and others. 

 The typesetting and design of bilingual Indic texts of such range and complexity was unprecedented in modern book design practice and posed many challenges, which were addressed through three lines of enquiry. First, to establish a systematic bilingual book design for English translations of texts in ten different Indic languages and scripts. Second, to accommodate two genres in the template design: poetry and prose. Third, as Indian texts do not use italics or bold, it was imperative to establish an Indic hierarchy and grammar through the application of typographic rules \[3.2, 3.3\]. 

 There is a lack of attention to printing and typographic conventions in India, and a lack of standards for typesetting modern Indian languages. In addition, existing bilingual design frameworks account for 3 or 4 different languages at most; here the task was to accommodate at least 13 different languages and relevant scripts. The research addressed the challenges of emphasis and hierarchy in texts by providing solutions more relevant to the roots of Indian scripts, for example, by employing colour, size and location. The typographic and book interior designs also recognised that some readers would be fluent in the language, while others might be second\- or third\-language speakers or not know English at all. Typographic solutions were developed to resolve problems in bilingual reading, including layout that improves dual language facing\-page reading, and binding that allows the book to open flat, facilitating cross referencing and margin notes. The results are presented as 29 individual volumes \[3.2\] designed according to Ramanathan's guidelines \[3.3\]. 

 Ramanathan's research and expertise in new approaches to typography as well as non\-standard ways of designing and producing books from her ‘Little Presses’ work \[3.1\] informed a collaboration with Tara Books and the publication of an experimental picture book, *I Want to Be* \[3.4\]. This children’s picture book employs typography as illustration. Ramanathan is recognised for pioneering this associative approach to typography in children's books in India. Imaginative type\-play in this co\-authored book illustrates absurd nonsense verse, as letters change shape and texture to create the word and tell a story. An ideal early reader, the book helps children decipher words as puzzles. Research for the book drew from Ramanathan’s understanding of how typography in children's books is based primarily on a conventional Global North understanding, with text and image separated. This is counter to the understanding that children experience word and image as equally visual, particularly in India where reading is a visual act. *I Want to Be* explores the potential of a word\-image visuality in typography. Ramanathan used design\-led conversations and participatory reading sessions with children as well as archival research which led to analysis of secondary and primary sources of ephemera from India \(posters, murals, street signs\) and from European and Russian archives \(catalogues, publicity material, original artwork\). The research established visual examples of associative typography, wherein typography is concerned with the meaning and interpretation of the text and representing it using visual, verbal and spatial aspects of typography.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Ramanathan’s research has been twofold. It has enabled the preservation of and access to Indic classical texts and Indic scripts by providing typographic frameworks and design guidelines for publication of bilingual books in Indic and Latin scripts by the Murty Classical Library of India. And it developed for Tara Books an approach to typography that empowers marginalised communities of readers as well as expanding readership in inclusive and decolonial ways. 

 **4.1. Impact on preserving and expanding access and readership of content from India and/or in Indic scripts**The Murty Classical Library of India aims to make available the great literary works of India from the past two millennia, reintroducing them to a new generation of readers. Many classic Indic texts have never reached a global audience, while others are becoming increasingly inaccessible even to Indian readers. HUP used Ramanathan’s research and resulting guidelines in the design of 29 books to date \(2015\-2020\) \[5.1\] supporting the preservation of content in 10 different languages. The Director of Design and Production at HUP described the collaboration with Ramanathan as essential to the publication of the series: ‘The Murty Classical Library of India is the most challenging project that Harvard University Press has undertaken, and without Dr Ramanathan’s outstanding work I cannot imagine that we could have achieved such success’ \[5.2\], He noted Ramanathan’s research contribution as ‘addressing everything from the historical design traditions across myriad cultures and formats to addressing the critical need for a unified design approach for the series that could encompass a wide array of variation and many disparate requirements' \[5.2\]. 

 Ramanathan’s research on the complex challenges underpinning the Murty Classical Library project changed HUP’s approach to book design. In this respect, the Director of Design and Production at HUP stated: ‘One rewarding aspect of the collaboration with Dr Ramanathan came from the certainty that the work we were doing would have an impact in a long timescale, probably after our careers. We were looking at scripts that historically did not belong in a book whilst creating a framework robust enough to address design questions that will come up in the future. The books of the Murty Library are themselves the documentation of the design choices we are making today, trying to answer the questions for designers who will work on the series a hundred years from now’ \[5.3\]. 

 The research insights also had an impact on translators, requiring them to move beyond seeing the non\-Latin scripts as dictated by metal type. ‘This is a battle that we might not win every time but there is now an openness and flexibility to that embedded in the design about the way the original scripts should look’ \[5.3\]. 

 Making the books available in a form and design that will work well into the future enables the press to meet its fundamental aim of expanding readership of the texts and widening accessibility \[5.3\]. The detail of how Ramanathan’s design work supports this is elucidated in a review of one of the books, *The Epic of Ram*:  the reviewer noted that the ‘question of layout is probably the first aspect of these books to hit the eye \(and then the mind and heart\)’ \[5.4\]. He describes the traditional setting out of the text and compares it with the new layout, as directed by Ramanathan’s guidelines, concluding: ‘This reviewer huffed and puffed for a while at the sight of such a radical change, but was mollified when the reason for it became apparent: the new arrangement allows for an exact match between the layout of the Awadhi on the left\-hand page and that of the English translation on the right\-hand page, where the translator has, in most cases, artfully maximized this connection in his deployment of the English phrasing. This foot\-for\-foot equivalence greatly facilitates the dual reading of <ins>mūla</ins> \[original text\] and translation, and turns out to be one of the most successful and attractive aspects of the translator’s approach’ \[5.4\]. 

 The series has prompted positive reactions from critical reviewers, including recognition of the contribution of the research to social impact \[5.5\], and in the media, acknowledging the ambition and cultural impact of the project: ‘One of the great benefits of this kind of project is that it illuminates lost things, brings back to recognition texts that were once crucial’ \[5.6\].  The *Guardian* review stated that: ‘It is worth noting that some of these texts are not only unknown to western readers; very few Indians have read them either. This makes for a signiﬁcant opportunity for rediscovery; it also points to the millennial silence from which some of these authors emerge’ \[5.7\]. 

 The series prompted a debate in the public realm on issues of cultural appropriation, voice and identity in Indian culture. The Director of Design and Production at HUP stated that ‘In terms of immediate impacts—apart from how much Harvard University Press learned from it and the straightforward effect it has had in the preservation and accessibility to classical Indian text in Indic scripts—the series opened up, in the public realm, pressing discussions about diverse approaches to designing, translating and publishing classical Indian texts. Our model should be one of many other possible models and we are fortunate to be part of this constructive debate’ \[5.3\]. 

 **4.2. Impact on changing attitudes to typography and to design research, and publishing practices**Ramanathan worked with the Indian publisher Tara Books, applying her research in intercultural communication, decoloniality, graphic design and typography, encompassed in *I Want to Be*. Tara Books has employed Ramanathan’s approach to typography in several titles including *Hic*, *Mother Steals a Bicycle*, *Tail Tale*, *Brer Rabbit Retold* and *Tree Matters* \[5.10\]. The publisher has sold books produced in India to a global audience, as well as featuring in international exhibitions and the press. The company’s founder and publisher confirmed that Ramanathan's contribution was paramount in supporting the publisher to expand readership: ‘Rathna was responsible for using typography and communication design to expand readership, bridging social divides such as class and caste, and that is how her approach was taken up, not as a progression, but as an ongoing conversation. It’s about a commitment to building and expanding a community of readers around the globe, and bringing more people to the conversation whilst also building our own communities and livelihoods’ \[5.11\]. 

 An article in the *Hindu* newspaper reviewing Tara Books’ social and cultural achievements described Ramanathan as having ‘revolutionised’ \[5.12\] Tara’s work. The company’s founder explained that: ’What we have done in focusing on the visual as a language is to bring access into people’s lives who don't speak or read or write the same language, or who don't read and write at all. This has an impact on both sides of the book as a process: the side of the readership, and the side of the story\-tellers’ \[5.11\]. 

 Ramanathan’s research is recognised as having changed attitudes to typography within Tara Books with the result that other practitioners have taken up her framework and applied it, including through Ramanathan’s mentoring \[5.11\] **.** The company’s founder concluded that: ‘Rathna's legacy can be seen in terms of the strength she brought to typography as a process, an ongoing conversation in which typography is a voice’ \[5.11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy \(DMD\), is a rare genetic impairment, affecting one in 3,500 male births worldwide, with 2,500 patients in the UK. The mean age of death has recently increased to 30 years, yet current research focuses almost exclusively on medical treatments, ignoring broader wellbeing dimensions. Hoskin’s research has focused on the educational and related psycho\-social issues faced by disabled young men with DMD. The research has resulted in 1\) improved parental and professionals’ knowledge of the educational needs of people with DMD and how to access appropriate resources 2\) reducing social exclusion through personal and community empowerment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hoskin’s pioneering research into the lesser\-known co\-occurring educational and related psycho\-social risks that are associated with DMD such as dyslexia, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder and Anxiety \( **R1**\) further develops her earlier ground\-breaking work on DMD and reading difficulties prior to 2014. This is particularly timely now that children with DMD are reaching adulthood for the first time due to improved medical interventions such as ventilation and cardiac care. Hoskin’s work highlights the need for early educational intervention and high expectations to ensure young people with DMD have better life choices, and the same opportunities as any other young person as they grow into adulthood \( **R1**, **R2**, **R4**\). 

 Hoskin’s body of work has been instrumental in supporting clinicians, parents, young people and professionals in the UK and internationally to understand: a\) the importance of early educational and psycho\-social intervention for children with DMD and b\) the need for appropriate support and aspirations particularly when transitioning to adulthood \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\).  This research has resulted in work being carried out in UK schools to support the learning and behavioural needs of children with DMD through assessment and specialist advice, and the training of educational professionals and parents. 

 Hoskin’s research explored for the first time the impact of the 2014 Special Educational Needs and Disability \(SEND\) policy in England on young people with DMD \( **R3**\). Her findings demonstrate that although the new Education Health and Care plan process enables young people with DMD to have aspirational goals for the future, funding cuts and the lack of appropriate professional training has made these goals difficult to achieve. This highlights the need for guidance as parents and professionals navigate new policies to gain appropriate educational and social care resources. 

 Her research in ‘Transition to Adulthood’ in DMD shows both young people and parents are keen to reach normative educational and life goals such as employment or living independently, and as a consequence illustrates the need for schools and services to offer appropriate support in order for this to happen \( **R2**, **R4**\). This research is highly original in that it utilises qualitative and co\-produced approaches and foregrounds the voices of young people and their families \( **R2**, **R4**\). 

  

 Her research has found the role of adults with DMD in the UK to be central in raising aspirations through sharing their lived experiences \( **R2**\). Furthermore, Hoskin’s comparison of life with DMD in Denmark and England \( **R4**\), found men in Demark are supported to have ‘normalised goals’ such as getting a job, living independently and having sexual relationships, whereas young people in England often experience a lack of support and aspirations \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\). Hoskin’s work in collaboration with adults with DMD led to the establishment of the first user\-led charity in the UK for adults with Neuro\-muscular conditions called Pathfinders Neuro\-muscular Alliance. This has led to increased visibility, empowerment and social inclusion of adults with DMD who can now access peer support for the first time and gain relevant advice to achieve their life goals.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Improved parental and professionals’ knowledge of the educational needs of people with DMD** 

 In 2018, Hoskin edited the Guide to DMD for Teachers and Parents bringing together international experts from the United States and the UK, as well as adults with DMD, to focus for the first time exclusively on educational and well\-being issues in DMD \( **S1**\). This accessible textbook is informed by Hoskin’s research that has shown increased educational needs in DMD, families struggling to gain necessary resources through their Education Health and Care Plans, and lack of support and expectations during Transition to Adulthood \( **R1, R2**, **R3**, **R4**\).  This book has internationally sold over 1,170 copies, which accounts for nearly half of all people with DMD in the UK, and has helped professionals and families to be more skilled in how they support the learning and behaviour needs of their children. It offers information and support strategies about lesser\-known educational and behavioural risks associated with DMD such as reading difficulties, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder.  The charity Duchenne UK buys a copy for every family that is diagnosed in the UK. Therefore, families and teachers are better advised and children with DMD have improved support, intervention and life chances.  In 2019 Hoskin was invited to the European Neuromuscular Centre Workshop on ‘Dystrophin and the Brain’ where she presented to DMD clinicians and scientists on learning difficulties in DMD. The paper produced from this workshop \( **S2**\) links scientific research in the brain with real\-world impact on learning for children with DMD and is for an audience of Neuro\-muscular clinicians enabling them to address learning and behaviour difficulties in their patients appropriately. 

  

 **Improved psychosocial wellbeing and mental health needs** 

 Hoskin was invited to join the Psycho\-social Working Group for the International Care Considerations for DMD published in 2018 which informs clinicians globally on all aspects of care for DMD \( **S3**\), and a ‘lay version’ has been produced for families. This means that all doctors treating boys with DMD, and families, are now aware of best practice psycho\-social care and can ensure boys are referred to mental health or specialist education teams where appropriate. 

  

 **Accessing Education support services** 

 Hoskin’s research directly informs the work of the Special Educational Needs \(SEND\) Community Interest Company \(CIC\) Decipha CIC of which Hoskin is a director. Hoskin’s research found that families struggle to gain appropriate support at school \( **R3**, **R4**\) and Decipha CIC has been funded by Duchenne UK since 2017 to help families to navigate SEND legislation and produce relevant and appropriate Education Health and Care plans to support learning and behaviour \( **S4**\). Decipha CIC has worked with 199 children with DMD, 13 local authority officers, 40 Special Educational Needs Co\-ordinators, 38 teachers and 7 head teachers attending 2 tribunals, 4 appeal meetings and running local workshops for professionals.  Hoskin and  Decipha CIC have presented to parents at Parent Information Days at Liverpool Alderhay Children’s \(92 participants\), Great Ormond Street \(75 participants\), and Guys and St Thomas hospitals \(66 participants\) \( **S5**\). This means that children with DMD now have more appropriate support at school, and therefore more opportunities for the future. Hoskin presented at a user\-led conference in Switzerland about Education and Transition to Adulthood where 100 delegates were parents and professionals. \( **S6**\) 

  

 **Support for DMD during Covid 19** 

 Decipha CIC ran two ‘Support Through Lockdown’ webinars for families with 500 views collectively \( **S7**\). Hoskin helped Duchenne UK to write Advice to a Parliamentary Inquiry on the impact of Covid 19 on children and education \( **S8**\). 

  

 **Increasing social inclusion** 

 Hoskin’s ground breaking research has highlighted the role adults with DMD play in inspiring and advising young people and parents about adulthood \( **R2**\). Her research supported the establishment of the first user\-led organisation for adults with neuro\-muscular conditions, DMD Pathfinders, \(now Pathfinders Neuro\-muscular Alliance\) and continues to inform their activities. The Alliance runs leadership and mentoring projects for young people with DMD, produces a range of support guides for example managing care, work and education \( **S9**\) and has hosted annual conferences from 2016 – 2019 in parallel with the Action Duchenne international conference, attracting 500 delegates of men with DMD, families and clinicians. This has resulted in reduced social isolation for adults with DMD, increased friendship and peer support networks that are in person or on\-line as well as increased expectations for life. Hoskin’s work has directly informed the creation of a film co\-produced with members of Pathfinders highlighting the need for raised aspirations for those living with DMD with 721 views \( **S10**\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a novel detection technique, known as Mass Photometry, which is capable of weighing molecules with light. It enables the accurate mass measurement of proteins and other molecules in solution, in their native state and without the need for labels – a simple yet powerful capability that is useful across the life sciences, in research and in industry. In June 2018, the University of Oxford spin\-out company Refeyn was formed to commercialise the research. Following formation, Refeyn **\[text removed for publication\]** has since sold and installed **\[text removed for publication\]** of its first generation Refeyn OneMP mass photometers to pharma companies, research laboratories and facilities worldwide, accelerating and enabling new science for working with and studying biomolecules in both the academic and pharmaceutical space. **\[Text removed for publication\]**

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professors Philipp Kukura and Justin Benesch from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford have pioneered a new technique known as Mass Photometry \(MP\). MP relies on the accurate determination of scattering contrast for single molecules as they approach a refractive index interface, for example between a solution and a glass slide. The scattering contrast of biomolecules is closely related to its mass and therefore simply by imaging a molecule as it binds to a microscope slide, the mass can be accurately calculated \[ **R1**\]. 

 This discovery follows a significant period of foundational research. Professor Kukura’s group has been working the related technique, interferometric scattering microscopy \(iSCAT\), for more than 10 years. The group had previously shown the utility of iSCAT for studying molecular motors, such as Myosin 5a \[ **R2**\]. Arguably, the group’s most important breakthrough was the 2014 demonstration that iSCAT is sufficiently sensitive to detect and image individual proteins without any labels \[ **R3**\]. Additional advances in detection sensitivity by an order of magnitude \[ **R4**\] led to the further demonstration that light scattering can be used not only to visualise single molecules, which has intrinsic advantages over ensemble\-based methods, but also – by careful quantification of the detected signals – to measure their mass with high accuracy, precision, resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range \[ **R1**\]. 

 In recognition of its potential to become an indispensable tool for researchers working across the life sciences, two grants were awarded to further develop the technology and bring it to market: an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account award \(2017\) and an ERC Proof of Concept Award \(2018\). 

 In Professor Benesch’s group, research over the previous decade focussed on developing, enhancing and demonstrating the value of measurements of mass and mass distributions for quantitatively characterising biomolecules and their interactions. In the growing field of native mass spectrometry \(MS\), his group has led efforts to bring both the experimental approach and its analysis onto a quantitative footing. Advances made by the group have been key in driving mass measurement to the forefront of biophysical investigation, showing that it is the best way to quantify the assembly states of biomolecules and the strengths of their interactions. This work is paving the way to a new era of molecular biology understanding, grounded in the fundamental quantities of physical chemistry \[ **R5**\]. 

 The success and potential of MP comes from the confluence of advances in the Kukura and Benesch groups: the Kukura group’s development of a fundamentally new method of measuring mass and the Benesch group’s work advancing mass itself as a valuable measure for the life sciences.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Pathway to impact: from research to commercialisation 

 The research and development of mass photometry \(MP\) in Kukura and Benesch’s research groups attracted attention after publication in Science in 2018 \[ **R1, E1**\- **2**\]. The combination of experimental power and feasibility led many academic institutions and commercial enterprises to express an interest in obtaining the technology to analyse their own samples. In the 18 months following publication of MP, an enormous variety of samples and scientific questions were brought to the Kukura lab by more than 30 international collaborators from a variety of scientific backgrounds. The interests of these groups ranged from developing and interrogating antibody\-based pharmaceuticals to the manufacture and quality control of inorganic nanoparticles. 

 Throughout MP’s development, the researchers worked closely with Oxford University Innovation \(OUI\), the technology transfer company for the University of Oxford, to protect the new IP being developed. Recognising the potential impact of this technology, OUI filed 2 patents, with one covering the key aspects of the MP device, *Interferometric scattering microscopy* \[ **E3**\], and another a key implementation of the technology, *Method of determining lipoprotein concentration in solution using light scattering* \[ **E4**\]. The former has been granted in the US and in Europe. 

 OUI and the academic team identified the formation of a spin\-out company as the most appropriate route to maximise the impact from this platform technology. In June 2018, University of Oxford spin\-out company Refeyn \(initially known as Arago Biosciences\) successfully raised **\[text removed for publication\]** from several sources, including Oxford Sciences Innovation, to further develop the technology and make it widely available as an instrument accessible to non\-expert users. Within months, the company had made its first sales to academic institutions and continued to expand the capabilities of the microscope. The founding of the company was extremely rapid: an EPSRC IAA award in October 2017 enabled construction of a first commercial prototype, which was presented at an international conference in February 2018, 2 months before the original manuscript was published, which in turn was 4 months before Refeyn was founded. \[ **E5**\] 

 Following a highly successful first 8 months in operation, Refeyn raised a further **\[text removed for publication\]** led by Foresight Williams and Oxford Sciences Innovation with the aim of expanding its development pipeline and scaling up production of its existing product, the Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup>. Subsequently, Refeyn raised another **\[text removed for publication\]** during the COVID\-19 pandemic, led by high profile US investors Northpond Ventures \[ **E5**\]. 

###  Innovative new technology 

 The ability to observe the often\-subtle interactions between proteins is crucial for studying the processes that underpin life itself. Only through a deep understanding of these processes can we begin to develop the next generation of biopharmaceuticals to tackle previously untreatable diseases. The MP approach ‘weighs molecules with light’, providing immediate insight into the state of proteins and other molecules. 

 In mass photometry, the light scattered by a molecule attached to the measurement interface interferes with light reflected at that interface. The interference scales linearly with object mass. The Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> detects this scattered light, using the signal to count molecules and measure their mass. This is possible in a wide range of native buffer solutions, without the need for labels. 


 Figure 1. Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> benchtop mass photometry device \(above\). 

 Figure 2. The principle of mass photometry \(right\). 






 The Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> featured in The Scientist’s \(a professional magazine for life scientists\) Top 10 Innovations of 2019. The Boris Magasanik Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology **\[text removed for publication\]** was quoted as saying “ *The most valuable thing with this instrument is that we can look at complex proteins\-macromolecular complexes and figure out what are the components in that mixture, and do we detect any issue with stability. It’s a very time\-consuming process in typical workflow*.” \[ **E6**\] 

 In 2019 Refeyn went on to win the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Emerging Technologies Competition Award and an R&D 100 award in the analytical/test category \[ **E11**\]. 

###  Commercial sales and use 

 **\[Text removed for publication\]** 

 The instruments are being used across vaccine development, cell and gene therapy production, Quality Assurance/Quality Control of biologics, and next generation drug discovery \[ **E5**\]. More than 20 academic publications have explicitly used the instrument in the broader and more specific bioanalytical context \[ **E7**\]. For example, AstraZeneca have used Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> in COVID\-19 research to study the spike protein of the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus and its interaction with the ACE2 receptor \[ **E8**\], and for drug discovery to explore the characterization of star polymers for future biophysical targeting of tumours \[ **E9**\]. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health \(USA\) used MP to measure the affinity of protein\-protein interactions on a single\-molecule level, concluding ‘ *The quality and information content of the MP data, combined with simple and fast measurements and low sample consumption makes MP a new preferred method for measuring strong protein\-protein interactions*.’ \[ **E10**\] 

 In just 2 years the uptake and variety of uses seen across the scientific community show that mass photometry is a transformative technology enabling a new way to analyze molecules. It has opened up new possibilities for bioanalytics and research into the functions of biomolecules across the life sciences.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The impacts submitted stem from The York Centre for Writing \(YCW\) and include permanent changes to the York St John Estate and ongoing University estates policy to further promote wildlife \(via the Pollination Project\). The generation of new published writing stemming from this project this has supported regional writing and publishing businesses. Impact is then through the connection of a natural eco\-system with an artistic one. This is through the creative practice\-based research of the staff in the form of novels and poetry collections published with independent northern presses. The production and promotion of this work has a direct impact on the sustainability of these presses. The impact of research and practice into independent publishing has led to curriculum development which in turn has led to the establishment of a new publisher by YCW graduates. 

 The YCW was established to further represent and facilitate the work of the Creative Writing staff. It functions as a hub for diverse work with shared core principles. All projects across YCW, is further evidenced by the support provided to partnerships to develop and disseminate research, including the York Literature Festival, publication, community engagement and media presence. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case study relates to a number of practice\-based, creative outputs and literary\-critical research papers that have been enabled, developed and amplified by the York Centre for Writing. 

 Booth’s practice\-based work speculates on climate change in a near future and ranging as far afield as Australia and resulted in the publication of her novel *Sealed* \(2017\) **\[3.1\]** with independent publisher Dead Ink. This in turn led to further research into publishing and particular northern independent presses. Curtis’ speculative novel *Water & Glass* \(2017\) **\[3.4\]** developed from her practice\-based research interest in the human\-animal relation and the possibility of climate catastrophe. She has spoken about the work on national radio, and been invited to interdisciplinary symposia on animal studies, conservation, literature and design. This interest led to the development of a public, cross\-disciplinary, conservation, writing and design project, The Pollination Project, with wide\-ranging impacts both in terms of the environment and participant creativity and well\-being, and an ongoing online archive. Interdisciplinarity and forging connections between the regional community and national and international communities are key to the YCW. 

 Booth’s research into on the female body, maternity and climate change takes the form of both critical articles and award\-winning fiction works through her novel *Sealed \(*2017\) **\[3.1\]** *.* Tamás’ poetry collection *WITCH* **\[3.5\]** and her *White Review* article on the language of the Occult explore the connections between feminism, the occult, witchcraft and ecology, and her work around these themes is creating a cultural discussion about how feminist, political ideas might be expressed and explored through occult thinking. Tamás’ has extended this further into a collection of essays, *Strangers* **\[3.6\]**. These texts are produced through small publishers \(Penned in the Margins and Makina\) and by virtue of this symbiotic relationship help sustain this publishing environment. The research and practice of publishing in the YCW has led to undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum development and in turn the support for a new publisher, Greenteeth Press, developed and run by graduates. 

 The research that is informed by the remit of the YCW encourages the critique of critical\-creative boundaries as a foundation to all projects. The examples submitted focus on gender and social diversity and interact with speculative fiction to debate the future of the environment whilst encouraging its protection, as well as championing the important work in literature and publishing that is happening in the North of England. The centre unifies the approach of the practitioners within the YCW, ensuring impact, theory/practice praxis, pedagogy and community are central to all projects at the point of conception. Location is central to the work undertaken, and the North as a site of cultural production and reception is an intrinsic part of this. This links to the theme of the environment in its broadest sense. Through the practice of interdisciplinary there is an emphasis on diversity and in particular gender diversity.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The Pollination Project, established in 2016, was an environmental sustainability project with an Arts and Humanities focus. This project, originated and led by Professor Abi Curtis, included UG and PGR students, academic staff and external partners. The York St John campus was used as a site of environmental conservation by encouraging pollinating insects, and resulting in an archive of critical and creative work based on and to promote the themes of the project. 

  

 This project is a key example of the creative\-critical praxis inherent in the YCW, and of its commitment to the advantages of an interdisciplinary approach to research. The project attracted both internal and external funding, including from conservation organisation, Bug Life. The Pollination Project was based primarily on the York St John Lord Mayor’s Walk city centre campus and used this location to create a new wildlife habitat. With this environmental idea at the centre the project also time engaging students, staff and local residents in an interdisciplinary creative/critical project. Wolfgang Buttress was a guest speaker on campus, inspiring students to engage with science, music, architecture and visual art as he had when embarking on his million\-pound commission. Artist Amy Shelton has had work exhibited at the Wellcome Trust and uses various natural materials to represent the pollinator cycle, and another collaborator, award\-winning poet John Burnside, has written extensively on bees. 

  

 The research environment went beyond the campus to Kew and the Wellcome Trust, and the campus grounds became central to the research environment. Original creative work in the form of poetry, prose, art and critical writing were produced and remain part of an ongoing archive. In addition, the living environment remains positively impacted by the activities of the project **.** The senior grounds staff at York St John University have seen a significant increase in biodiversity over the last couple of years as a result of the project, which, whilst being intellectually grounded and encouraging new creative work, has seen environmental benefits including the inhabitance of species of bee not hitherto seen in the area: “The Pollination Project by Abi Curtis kickstarted a change in working practice for the York St John University gardening team. Prior to the project’s initiation the university supported a token, small scale wildlife area not connected to the space allocated for the Pollination Project. Over the past year the Pollination Project has helped attract an increasing amount of wildlife to the area – birds, hedgehogs, bats and all manner of insects. The highlight, being, witnessing the appearance of Tawny Mining bees \(andrena fluva\) in one corner of the site. This sighting led to the decision by University Head Gardener Robert Scott to link both projects to create a \(circa\) 1/3\-acre city Centre breathing space for local flora and fauna. Plants including Birds Foot Trefoil, Knapweed, Teasel, Loosestrife, Oxeye Daisy and Speedwell to name a few have lay dormant or never been noticed. Included in the scheme are habitat log piles for invertebrates and insect hotels in the trees, along with bat boxes close by. The university gardening team are looking forward to witnessing the area evolving into a nature rich environment” \(Senior Gardener at York St John University. Here the project has benefits to both research and the wider context of the research ‘environment’. The resulting physical wildflower space has drawn a particular species of mining bee to central York, that was not there before, and produced a number of new artistic works, archived here:  [https://yorkstjohnpollinationproject.com/](https://yorkstjohnpollinationproject.com/). **\[5.1\]** 

 In embracing the themes of the YCW other staff members contributed to the publication and engaged in projects with similar environmental themes. Curtis’ novel was published by  [Cloud Lodge Books](https://cloudlodgebooks.com/about/), whose mission statement is to feature ‘writers \(and characters\) of every race, religion, nationality, gender and sexual orientation’. This was one of the first books produced by Cloud Lodge Books thus informing their development as an independent publisher Curtis’ research interest in the human/animal relationship and the speculative possibilities of climate change, the principles that underpin the Pollination Project. 

 The Pollination Project therefore stands as an exemplar of emergent YCW projects in form and reach: 

-  There is a printed publication and online archive of creative and critical work with 30 academics, writers and members of the public being represented.

 The Pollination Project stands as the example for collaborative interdisciplinary YCW projects such as the Fabric Project, Music, Memory and Memoir, Terra 2 and Horrifying Children which draw on the experience and process of the Pollination Project. The impact is cyclical within the YCW by pollinating other projects. 

 The work above comes out of the remit of the Centre for Writing to encourage critical\-creative boundaries to be challenged and over\-turned, to focus on diversity and to speculate on the future of environment/s, as well as championing the important work in literature that is happening specifically in the North of England. Further impact has been achieved through Booth’s work on the female body, maternity and climate change and Tamás’ work on the environment in *WITCH* and *Strangers.* This impact takes the form of both critical articles and award\-winning fiction texts. The fictions have had important impacts on the Northern fiction landscapes. Publisher Dead Ink Books credits Booth’s novel *Sealed* \(2017\) as a ‘a pivotal moment for Dead Ink Books as a small press’ ensuring its ‘long\-term survival’ and ‘growth’ and forming a key part of its funding strategy via popular success and promotion of Dead Ink as a site of unique literary production. “The publication of Naomi Booth's *Sealed* has become a pivotal moment for Dead Ink Books as a small press. To date, it is our best\-selling fiction title and one that continues to generate demand. Because of this, *Sealed* was fundamental to the strategic planning that went into our subsequent Arts Council England Project Grant application. *Sealed* combined literary quality with genre appeal whilst also being capable of generating distinct talking points with readers. This combination of qualities made the book a clear commercial success for Dead Ink and our analysis of its reception was integral to our grant application. This came at an important time for us as the application in question was focused upon moving Dead Ink from a grant\-funded business to a commercially viable one that was capable of maintaining itself through trade sales. This objective is designed to ensure the long\-term survival and growth of the press and *Sealed* was central to the strategy behind it and our subsequent commissioning decisions. We have already seen a marked increase in the reception of the titles we commissioned after *Sealed* with this strategy in mind—an increase in publicity, trade sales, and reader reception all stems from Naomi's book.’ Nathan Connelly, Dead Ink. **\[5.3\]** 

 Building on Booth’s practice, the work of innovative small presses has pollinated the curriculum and has led to the creation of a nationally unique Northern Independent Press Collection as part of the Writing Centre which has meant the recognition and development of a range of Northern presses. Booth and Tamás have published with Penned in the Margins \( *The Lost Art of Sinking* and *WITCH*\) aiding these publishers and Tamás has most recently worked with Makina Press on her recent essay collection *Strangers*. 

 The YCW works with Scarborough\-based Valley Press on the production of anthologies and in turn has helped the press sustain their business. **\[5.4\]** This in turn has informed the development of new postgraduate curricula in Publishing with a specific focus on the support of new and independent presses. This includes a partnership with Lendal Press, York’s new independent publisher \[2019\]. This is most evident in the work of Greenteeth Press, a graduate enterprise which developed in 2018 from the YCW and have subsequently been sustained as a business through ongoing collaboration with the YCW on projects. The YCW has achieved success in supporting new writing activity **\[5.5\].** “After starting my own publishing business … the Creative Writing department have been incredibly supportive. Collaborating … has improved the financial security of my business and provided experience for a community of writers and publishers."" Owner Greenteeth Press. The Northern Fiction Alliance stresses the range of audience members benefitting from the Centre’s outward focus on the national place of Northern writing talent in supporting new talent and providing new opportunities for study \(MAs and MFAs\). To date 15 students have benefitted from the MFA and the ability to focus on the production of a full\-length piece of work. 

 This in turn has continued the University’s work with the York Literature Festival, extending the reach of critical work. The takes the work of students to a public audience but also provides an audience and market for new writers and small presses thus aiding sustainability.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 UoH research supported prisoner reintegration through the use of new interventions in prison education, emphasizing the potential of *hope* as a corrective pedagogical tool. Former prisoners and current prisoners, policy advisors, prison staff, related professional practitioners and members of the public had their social and political horizons broadened by reconsidering the role of \(prison\) education in the processes of reintegration. The researchers engaged 64 participants – both in and out of prison – in study groups across 60 weeks to encourage debate about US prison narratives \(memoir, film, poetry\). The discussions then underpinned creative and reflective writing activities. The outputs have been exhibited in publications and at events that have attracted 100s of participants in the Humber region, encouraged social inclusivity and supported \(ex\) prisoners’ learning. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research programme is inherently interdisciplinary – drawing on American Studies, Critical Prison Studies, Criminology, and Creative Writing – and was inspired by fieldwork undertaken by Metcalf for her 2012 monograph \(R6\) about gang memoirs. Since then the UoH has produced significant research exploring prison narratives, desistance \(stopping reoffending\), and ultimately creative writings. The research was supported by Arts Council England \(£12,255\) and Hull City Council Arts grants \(£1,350\) awarded in 2018; a Ferens Education Trust grant \(£1,000\) awarded in 2015; and a British Academy Small Grant \(£5,070.39\) awarded in 2013. The three key research themes / insights are as follows: 

 **a\) That US \(prison\) culture fascinates participants as a discussion topic.** 

 The impetus of this work partly came from Metcalf’s research \(R4\) that studied memoirs of Shaun Attwood. The significance of Attwood’s books arguably lies in their ""Americanness""; as an Englishman entangled in the ""exceptional"" US system his narrative provides a crucial \(transatlantic\) perspective. Such cross\-cultural reflections reveal a fascination with US prison culture. For example, the depiction of prison and life *post\-*prison in *The Shawshank Redemption* constituted an accessible and useful way to enter into critical reflection and writing \(R1\). Cultural awareness arguably serves as a foundation of communication, and consequently transformation \(R3, R4\). Calverley \(R3, R5\) has similarly investigated the ways in which cultural engagement may impact prisoner behaviour post\-release. 

 **b\) That we should attend to the views of \(ex\) prisoners as cultural consumers.** 

 Metcalf has previously conducted interviews with US memoirists \(both in and out of prison\) and extensive audience research with a variety of readers who consume such books \(R6\). This revealed that while for some an incarcerated author was somehow “exciting”, many readers were ostensibly more interested in the narrative arc where ex\-offenders were reintegrated back into society \(i.e. that redemption was possible\). The research found that to understand texts that deal with “real\-world” issues, we should ask “real\-world” readers what they do with them. This corroborates Calverley’s findings that we should attend to the views and experiences of ex\-prisoners \(R5\) in formulating desistance supportive social context and policy. Furthermore, the research \(R1, R2, R5\) verifies that this specific form of co\-creative production, sparked and stimulated by apposite texts, has the potential to support reintegration. 

 **c\) That prisoners’ engagement with hopeful narratives can help make sense of their lives.** 

 Narrative Criminology considers how offenders engage with narrative to “make sense of their lives”. This research argues that in the case of Attwood and others like him, we should consider not just what they say about violence but how they say it \(R1, R2, R4\); this can hold particular meaning for ex\-prisoners who are working hard to desist from crime. The act of writing can be particularly meaningful in the desistance process, especially when combined with hope as both Calverley and Metcalf have noted \(R5, R2\) and as underpinned over half of the study groups. The co\-produced output, *Hope Walks By Me; Justice and Liberty in the Lands of the Free – Poetry & Prose by Ex\-Offenders* \(R1\), was incorporated as a teaching tool into the next phase of the project.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact has several dimensions: a\) individual learning transformations of \(ex\) prisoners to support their reintegration \(both emotionally and practically\); b\) innovations in \(ex\) prisoners’ education and increased productivity for professional practitioners in the field; and, c\) improved public understanding of the challenges facing \(ex\) prisoners when released. The evidence collection is case\-based and qualitative analysis, as well as creative and participatory. 

 **a\) Individual Learning Transformations to Support Reintegration into Society** 

 Researcher Metcalf partnered with ex\-prisoner resettlement organisations in Hull between 2015 and 2019 where she offered “courses” for service users alongside a former writer\-in\-residence for HMPPS. In the fall of 2020, another module was run at HMP Hull though by distance as part of the Learning Together \(LT\) national network. Originating at the University of Cambridge, LT is a prison education initiative which unites university and prison learners. It provided in\-cell education documents \(“Thinklets”\) for prisoners across the UK during the first Covid lockdown in 2020 \(R13\). At the in\-person meetings and also remotely, participants studied a different US prison text \(e.g. poems from Guantanamo Bay *, The Shawshank Redemption,* memoirs by Shaun Attwood and former street gang members, or Martin Luther King’s Letter from  Birmingham Jail\) to discuss issues such as race / class / gender / immigration / citizenship / human rights / economy, both in the US and UK. UoH research informed the fieldwork practices \(i.e. the choice of text for study – R2, R4, R6\) and the tutors then used these critical discussions to spark creative and reflective writings. 

 The emotional confidence of participants was significantly enhanced, especially through becoming published authors. One of the ex\-prisoners’ key\-workers stated that the groups and being published in *Hope Walks By Me; Justice and Liberty in the Lands of the Free – Poetry & Prose by Ex\-Offenders* \(2019\) gave the participant “ *such a boost to his confidence, outlook, and general attitude that I had not seen in the three years that I had known him*” \(E5\). Changing opinion about oneself was regularly flagged in the poems, revealing a “new” sense of identity and self\-worth in contemporary society: “ *Stay confident, see things through / Do the best things for you*” \(R1\). Participants \(mostly unemployed and seeking work\) were equipped with beneficial and eye\-catching experiences / skills that could be put into a CV or job application \(E4, E8, E11\). 

 Several of the chosen texts for study deliberately addressed questions around re\-offending and desistance from crime drawing on Calverley’s research \(R3, R5\) and the struggles that Attwood faced \(R4\). Not all desistance research revolves around longitudinal sociological studies \(i.e. tracking prisoner behaviour long after release\); the study and ensuing writings encouraged participants to think about desistance and its counterpart, re\-offending. Evidence suggests that for some this “real\-world” research initiated a reflection on their goals, and encouraged them to rethink who they wanted to be. As one participant wrote, “ *Keep strong, be a fighter / One day you / Could be a creative writer*” \(R1\). Learners at HMP Hull also articulated how the study helped them confront and resist temptations to re\-offend. As another noted, “ *the Shaun Attwood session seemed to hit a nerve with me, because, I'm currently in the same kind of situation Shaun was in, and eventually \[he had\] the outcome of desistance. It really gives me the hope that I can accomplish those things*” \(E3, 11\). 

 While encouraging the group discussions about reflecting on one’s own identity, and coming to terms with a change in lifestyle, the tutors guided participants to explicitly consider the ways in which, as Calverley’s research highlights, hope has a key role to play in daily life both in and out of prison \(R5\). This was then seen in feedback on the sessions: “ *I'm finding that in some way or another, the word hope can be used in every session I've taken, it's a very powerful thing is hope and broken down, the word can be interpreted in many ways*” \(E3\). Meanwhile, the poems suggested that hope became a useful way for participants to humanise themselves and hence a leveller of sorts with others in the community upon release: “ *Hope is what makes us human*” and though “ *Hope is different for me than it is for you*” “\[It\] *is something that we all own from birth right through to heaven*” \(R1\). 

 **b\) Innovations in Prison Learning & Increased Productivity for Practitioners** 

 Money from the sales of *Hope Walks by Me* was ploughed back into Litten’s fees to run similarly\-structured sessions by himself. This happened at two further centres for “at\-risk” populations in Hull in late 2019 and early 2020 where the majority of service users are ex\-prisoners \(E1, E5\). These two centres had attended a community morning run by Litten and Metcalf in October 2019 where their lesson plans and content had been showcased, as well as the resultant publication. The book generated interest in such a fashion that it was hailed a “book of the year” by noted writer and critic Bonnie Greer in 2019 in *The Financial Times* who described the writings as “powerful” and “true” \(E13\). Joe Hakim, presenter of the prime time “Culture Night” show on BBC Humberside called the book an “amazing project” and invited Litten, Metcalf and the Director of Barbican Press \(the publisher of *Hope Walks*\) to record an extended segment for his show discussing the role of art in the reintegration process of ex\-prisoners \(E2\). 

 *Hope Walks by Me* \(R1\) was thereafter used to underpin a Thinklet document on *The Shawshank Redemption* in April 2020 \(R13\) which helped transform prison education nationally during the Covid pandemic. Three further Thinklets were then produced, informed by Metcalf and Calverley’s research \(R2\-R5\) to use US prison culture as prompts to explore key \(“life skill”\) themes of Hope, Desistance, Persuasiveness and Humanity on  a LT module run in the fall of 2020. This LT module, with learners from both UoH and HMP Hull, was the first of its kind in the UK to encourage connectivity through written correspondence; university learners peer reviewed the prison learners’ assessment portfolios \(which included both critical and creative materials\) and vice versa. The creative component of this module, was a distinctive new development of a LT network that was already established by Calverley in Hull in 2018. Many of the prisoner learners on this course were nearing their release date. 

 The Directors of the national LT network note that “ *Through this work Jo has made an outstanding contribution to Learning Together’s aim to be at the forefront of developing and implementing innovation and excellence in a higher education which explicitly includes people who are under criminal justice supervision*” \(E10\). The Directors have already shared learning from Metcalf’s pilot at Hull across the LT Network and with HMPPS which has reached “ *hundreds of colleagues working in relevant areas of policy and practice in HMPPS*, *the Ministry of Justice, national and international universities and beyond*” \(E10\). They reported on Metcalf’s work to the Policy Lead for Prison Education at the Ministry of Justice who contacted Metcalf thereafter to find out more about her pedagogical ambitions and experiences. LT are currently using Metcalf’s course as an example for other partnerships, not merely as they adapt to current circumstances as a result of Covid\-19, but also as they advance their collective strategy for extending digital innovation across the Network \(E10\). 

 Metcalf’s four Thinklets have also been identified as useful pedagogical tools by other practitioners working with \(ex\-\) prisoners, as they encourage their clients to think about their reintegration. The Community Rehabilitation Company \(CRC\) have made the four Thinklets available as to probation officers to use in 1\-on\-1 situations across Humberside, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. Indeed, court orders issue “Rehabilitation Requirement Days” and as part of that ex\-offenders have to do “meaningful activity”. An Education, Training and Employment regional lead for the CRC deemed them “ *an interesting and creative way of exploring themes that may relate to our service user’s offending behaviour”, adding, “I was keen to find a way to include them in our ETE package*” \(E8\). The Thinklets are also distributed at Humbercare \(one of the resettlement organisations that originally partnered with Metcalf\), where one of the Managers, is “ *regularly seeking ways to engage our service users in productive and engaging activities, which has been a challenge in lockdown*” \(E4\). Wagner took part in the *Shawshank* event and believes that the significance of *Hope Walks* lies not merely with individual contributors, but in the way it serves as strong evidence to the Humbercare Commissioners that the facility could improve service users’ lives through such groups \(E4\). 

 Working with Metcalf and Calverley has changed Litten’s choice of subject matter for his tutoring work in creative writing. He continues to teach at various HMPs in the North\-East and across Yorkshire, YOIs and also “First Story” \(with marginalised young people\) using similar texts as inspiration and thus mainstreaming the approach originally suggested by Metcalf: “ *Using American history and culture as a prism through which to view the concepts of justice and freedom was a master\-stroke*” \(E1\). Throughout his work, Litten now incorporates concepts of hope throughout all such work more explicitly than he had ever done prior: “ *I now see hope itself as a learning outcome in much of my tutoring work, rather than merely as a philosophical discussion point*” \(E1\). The research also shaped the vision of the Director of Barbican Press \(publisher of *Hope Walks*\): “ *In publishing terms, what was new for me was allowing a rawness to come through, and political statements and sentiments that to me were abrasive but I knew not to censor, because I saw that these views came from a rawness of life that was genuine and not usually explored in published works*” \(E2\). 

 **c\) Change of Attitudes towards \(Ex\) Prisoners & their Reintegration** 

 Attwood delivered talks to participants at two of the ex\-prisoner resettlement projects where Metcalf worked \(R&R, Humbercare\), and was a guest speaker at a 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary screening of *Shawshank* at the UoH \(May 2019\). Before the film Metcalf delivered a talk, followed by Attwood, and then chaired a Q&A panel consisting of a Wagner, Attwood, Litten, and two group participants \(ex\-prisoners\). This was followed two months later by a book launch of the creative writings produced by the groups \(July 2019\), featuring a panel discussion with Calverley and Metcalf, Litten, a service user and two Humbercare community practitioners. Approximately 200 members of the public attended the events in total, with evaluative questionnaires pointing towards a real appetite for believing in the possibility of change, rather than just people attending out of curiosity \(E6\). 

 At the May 2019 event, Wagner spoke of the challenges Humbercare have faced in housing ex\-prisoners in the local community \(E4\). Early in the focus groups, it became apparent that some participants were struggling with negative attitudes from members of the public in a variety of ways \(e.g. stereotyping at job interviews, in housing applications, from family members etc\). The events, as well as *Hope Walks*, aimed to raise awareness among individuals in the community / society more widely of the difficulties facing prisoners upon release. The audiences at the events included students \(though no one under 18\) and local citizens from a range of ages and backgrounds. If social inclusion is key to reintegration, the two events sought to challenge stereotyping, create more empathy, and remind the public that prisoners have a right to reintegrate. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from the events suggests that this was certainly achieved on some level. For example, at the Shawshank event, 96.1% of the respondents \(strongly\) agreed that their understanding of \(ex\-\) prisoners and their social problems had been increased, while at the book launch with 18 respondents this figure was 87.5% \(E6\). 

 An attendee at both the *Shawshank* talk and the book launch, was inspired to apply for – and secure – a weekend job in the library at HMP Hull and volunteer work with ex\-offenders at Humbercare \(E7\), stressing that both events served to challenge her preconceptions of \(ex\-\) prisoners \(E7\). Horrex, as well as staff from HMP Hull, have spoken about the importance of Metcalf’s work in disseminating such views with a range of age groups including young people \(E7, E11\). An adapted version of the LT module has been rolled out by Metcalf at the sixth form where Horrex works, as well as two others \(a public college in Lincolnshire and a private school in Newcastle\). This provides “Extended Opportunities” for 17 and 18 year\-olds seeking enrichment opportunities for UCAS applications, while simultaneously these Thinklets, as the head of training at Horrex’s institution explains, provide “ *an opportunity that is urgently required within sixth form establishments due to the complexities surrounding prisoners both inside prison and once released”* \(E7\). 

 Such changes in attitude were also evident among university students who undertook the LT module at HMP Hull \(E3\). The Directors of the national LT network assert that Metcalf’s “ *clever mix of creative and critical exercises in the course as a whole gave prison\-based learners ways to think about how they may support themselves upon release, <ins>and</ins> university learners the opportunity to think about the responsibility we all have to support reintegration after prison*” \(E10\). For example, while one university learner commented in their assessment portfolio that, “ *I now realise we need to work to de\-stigmatise ex\-convicts and reintegrate them back into society \- I wholeheartedly believe that change and reform are possible*” \(E3\). The specific choice of texts studied, and exercises deployed on the module, enabled this. Having been required to write a letter to Boris Johnson to persuade him to put more funding into prison education, another university learner noted “ *The letter made me change the way I view prisoners, I have more empathy now*” \(E3, E9\). In their letter to the Prime Minister, one of the students even went so far as to suggest a new association called LILAC – *Living Inspirational Lives after Conviction* whose aim is to “ *offer real world education and training packages that take into account people’s current psychological well\-being, their educational attainment and their hopes and dreams*” \(E9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lincoln Conservation, a unit that conducts applied research, has taken part in a series of collaborations with heritage organizations that have resulted in enhancements to heritage preservation, interpretation and understanding. Contributions to a European working group have helped to develop a new professional standard, while new data about decorative schemes have contributed to processes of commemoration and memorialization. Research on the Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster \(Big Ben\) determined the reinstated colour scheme of the iconic clock face. At Yr Ysgwrn, research enhanced audience perception of the home of Hedd Wyn, a Welsh poet later killed at Passchendaele. At HMS Caroline, research enhanced visitor engagement with an important WW1 cruiser. The methodology used to generate this research has been disseminated through a series of RIBA events thus contributing to continuing personal and professional development within the architectural profession. Projects described below are representative of the kind of projects Lincoln Conservation have carried out since 2014. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Lincoln Conservation \(known as ‘Crick\-Smith Conservation’ 1997\-2017\) is a research unit specializing in the recovery of lost historic decorative schemes, a pivotal process in the preservation of heritage sites. Their methodology is grounded in architectural paint research \(APR\) and Lincoln Conservation have been instrumental in reflecting upon, disseminating and formalising this methodology. APR involves site analysis, the removal and mounting of samples, microscopic analysis and cross comparison of results. Samples are mounted in cross section in polyester resin and examined using optical microscopy under both simulated daylight and ultra\-violet fluorescence. Successful analysis results in the identification of historic colour schemes, thus allowing heritage partners to recreate or retrieve historic schemes based on material evidence. 

 At the Palace of Westminster, London – Lincoln Conservation used APR to investigate the original colours of Elizabeth Tower \(‘Big Ben’\): they were commissioned to undertake research by Cliveden Conservation to analyse the decorative finishes to the exterior of the clock tower designed by Charles Barry and constructed between 1843 and 1859. Since construction, the numerals, dials and elements of the stonework have been painted: the more recent solemn appearance being markedly different to that seen in the watercolour sketches by Barry c.1856. Our heritage partner wanted to revert the clock face to its original appearance, but given its national and international importance, it was imperative that there was concrete evidence to underpin the reconstruction. Clarricoates and McDonnell analysed multiple paint samples from the site and from this developed a profile of the original scheme. The research identified six schemes of decoration, culminating in new visual representations of the decorative history of the Palace. 

 Yr Ysgwrn is a traditional Welsh farmhouse in the Snowdonia National Park believed to date to the 1830’s and listed Grade II\*. This was the home of the poet Ellis Humphrey Evans, better known by his bardic name, Hedd Wyn, a famous Welsh language poet who was posthumously awarded the National Eisteddfod chair following his death in the battle of Passchendaele 1917. Lincoln Conservation researched the original appearance of the ‘cegin’ \(main living room\). Analysis of material evidence allowed Croft and McDonnell to identify the original, and subsequent decorative schemes: material\-based evidence of Welsh middleclass interior decoration at the beginning of the 20th century. Over 26 layers of wallpaper were found in the cegin, and through a combination of material and documentary evidence, the paper pertaining to c.1917 was identified. In collaboration with Purcell architects, Snowdonia National Park Authority, Hedd Wyn’s nephew Gerald Williams, and Bruce’s Fine Papers, the original wallpaper was recreated: Lincoln Conservation specified which wallpaper should be conserved, worked directly with the wallpaper printers to authenticate finishes and colour values. Combined with the results of APR undertaken by Croft, Yr Ysgwrn was re\-presented as it would have appeared c.1917 when Hedd Wyn last saw the property. The research was completed ready for the official opening of the site on 6 September 2017. 

 Lincoln Conservation was commissioned to undertake research by the National Museum of the Royal Navy to research the paint colours used on HMS Caroline \(both externally and internally\) at the time of the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Detailed analysis of the ship led to the retrieval of previously undetected paint samples. When combined with archival research, this analysis contributed towards an accurate restoration of the ship as she would have appeared at the Battle of Jutland. Caroline was opened as a unique visitor attraction in June 2016.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 At the Elizabeth Tower \(‘Big Ben’\), the research led to the reinstatement of a historic scheme: in total, six schemes of decoration were identified, and visual representations of each scheme were produced to allow our partner to decide how best to accurately re\-present the clock face \(3.1, 5.1 & 5.2\). This is being implemented by the main contractor and \(to date\) has been partially revealed to the public \(5.2 & 5.3\). The dramatic change from the well\-known black and gold scheme to the new blue and gold design was the subject of intense public scrutiny and worldwide media coverage, including *BBC News, ITV News, Sky News, The Guardian, Express, Independent, Metro, Mirror, The Sun, The Times, Telegraph, Evening Standard, 7news.com.au, The Indian Express, Asia One* \(5.3\). Changing the appearance of one of the most iconic buildings in the UK was potentially controversial, so it was important that accurate material analysis and robust archival research underpinned any decision taken. Lincoln Conservation’s compelling analysis, based on archival and material evidence, gave confidence to the client to make this radical decision \(5.4\) Documentaries on the restoration such as C4’s ‘Big Ben: Countdown to New Year 2018’ included an interview with Rhiannon Clarricoates on the research behind the colour change \(5.3\). B1M’s ‘Inside Big Ben’s Makeover’ also highlighted the colour change and has had over 1.5 million views and 2,000 comments from members of the public such as ‘‘This is going to look sublime and just to think it’s been generations since last renovated. We are going to see what the Victorians \[sic\] laid their eyes upon.’, ‘I had no idea it was so colorful.’, ‘Love the blue colour too, looks fantastic\!’, ‘Would love to hear more about how they tracked the color blue down to historical colors. Thank you for this\!\! The Blue and Gold look exquisite\!’ \(5.3\). The attention it has received in the media has helped prompt widespread public discussion/debate on the colour change, with comments made such as ‘Glorious\! I had no idea of its true colours. Thank you.’, ‘A subtle yet classy change back.’, ‘Sensational. The cobalt blue is electrifying’, ‘Researchers from @UniLincoln revealed that the Big Ben’s clock metalwork was a deep blue until the 1930s. When the scaffolding is removed following two more years of restoration, the icon will be back to its original shade.’ \(5.3\). 

 At Yr Ysgwrn Lincoln Conservation’s research uncovered and analysed the decorative history of the cegin and thus helped heritage professionals understand local traditions, described by the Head of Cultural Heritage at the Snowdonia National Park Authority \(SNPA\) as contributing to ‘a change in the way people understand tastes and lifestyles in a rural Welsh farmhouse in the early 20th century…’ and helping to ‘provide a sense of place and heightened sensory awareness of Hedd Wyn’s environment when he left his home for the last time’ \(3.2, 5.5, 5.1 & 5.2\). This led to enhanced cultural preservation of a specific cultural site through improved conservation and interpretation. Identifying the original decorative schemes \(paint and wallpaper\) allowed an authentic recreation of the room. After the analytical phase, SNPA decided, in consultation with the architect and Hedd Wyns’s surviving nephew, to commission research from Lincoln Conservation that resulted in the faithful reproduction of a “cleaned” wallpaper \(5.2\). The SNPA also accepted Croft’s proposal to have a full chronology of the historic papers bound in a large book that is now in the public exhibition space at Yr Ysgwrn, with the bi\-lingual title “Haenau o Hanes Papur Wal Yr Ysgwrn” \(Layers of History Yr Ysgwrn Wallpaper\), in this instance the conservation research methodology \(wallpaper stratigraphy\) was in a book that functioned as a heritage interpretation device. The Layers of History book allows visitors to physically engage with the chronology of the site thus enhancing their understanding of the history and heritage value of the site \(5.5\). The wider site serves as a memorial to those who were killed during World War One and the project as a whole contributes to processes of commemoration and memorialization. Positive responses to the restoration include testimony from Hedd Wyn’s nephew: ""Well, things have changed altogether here, in a way. On the whole, things are starting to settle. The wallpaper is new… now it's up, the place seems more homely and there's a fire in the hearth. It's like it's saying ‘welcome’.” \(5.6, p.26\). Snowdonia National Park’s chief executive expressed the significance of the research in unveiling previously hidden heritage: “Visitors have always been fascinated by the layers upon layers of wallpaper at the cegin \(kitchen\). Wallpaper specialists Crick\-Smith \[Lincoln Conservation’s former name\] from the University of Lincoln, visited Yr Ysgwrn and took wallpaper and paint samples from around the house. We were all shocked when the report arrived – there was 26 layers of wallpaper in the cegin.” \(5.6\). Croft and McDonnell were invited to the opening event, other attendees included the First Minister of Wales, the National Poet of Wales, and members of Hedd Wyn’s surviving family, and many others. 

 HMS Caroline is one of only two extant Royal Naval vessels from World War One and the only survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the conflict. With the help of a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant, the ship was opened as a visitor attraction in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter in time for the centenary celebration of the Battle of Jutland, in June 2016. Croft’s research demonstrated that the term ‘Battleship Grey’ was used much earlier than previously thought and showed that the grey paint used on Royal Navy World War One vessels was not standardised \(as suggested in current literature\), but varied considerably \(3.3, 3.4 and 5.1\). The research defined the precise shade of grey used on HMS Caroline at the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and to the ship’s repainting in this colour in 2015 \(5.2\). The contemporaneous appearance of the interior spaces was redefined as a result of the research. The ship is now open as a visitor attraction and the public are able to experience the authentic atmosphere on board. HMS Caroline now serves as a thought provoking and tangible reminder of the sacrifices made by sailors during the First World War. A testimonial from the Deputy Executive Director of Museum Operations stated that the research ‘helped to create a truly authentic immersive experience of life on board a warship’ which in turn ‘enhanced the learning experience and enquiring minds of visiting school children and provided much thought and reflection for all visitors’ \(5.7\). Captain John Rees OBE, Chief of Staff and Chairman of HMS Caroline Project Board stated that: ‘Thanks to what we have found on HMS Caroline, we are able to review the entire colour history of the ship and accurately depict the paint schemes Caroline was painted in over 100 years.’ \(5.8, Royal Navy Website\). Positive responses from visitors include the comments: ‘The boat is completely unrecognizable from the last time I visited her about 10 years ago, and the company behind her restoration work has done a marvelous \[sic\] job’; ‘Truly amazing restoration of this 100 year old war cruiser. It’s an actual piece of living history, something you can touch and feel today’; ‘Having lived nearby, I had often seen Caroline before the restoration and it looked more like it would end its days were \[sic\] so many Royal Navy ships do, in the scrap yard. Arriving at the free car park beside the ship on the quayside, it looked magnificent\!’ \(5.8\). 

 **Delivery of Continued Professional Development** 

 Between January 2019 and March 2020, Lincoln Conservation delivered seminars based on their research to architects authorized by the Royal Institute of British Architects \(RIBA\), which aimed to improve architects’ understanding of the value of conservation research \(5.9\). This was stimulated by the professional experience of Lincoln Conservation staff which demonstrated that conservation can be perceived as a hindrance. They aimed to demonstrate that, if incorporated early in a project, conservation research and analysis can open up new possibilities for heritage architects. 28 seminars were delivered Pre\-Covid. Feedback from the seminars \(provided and sampled by RIBA\) contains ample evidence that architects found the seminars ‘interesting’, ‘useful’ and ‘relevant’ and would consider using conservation research services in the future \(5.9\). 

 Post Covid\-19, Lincoln Conservation delivered a series of online CPD webinars based on their research. These were conducted independent of RIBA and saw 175 delegates attend from a range of sectors including conservation, heritage, historic buildings and museums, architecture, archaeology, building surveyors and construction firms \(5.9\). 73% of those who provided feedback said that their participation in the CPD had changed their awareness of, or attitude towards, the importance of the process of conservation and/or digital applications in planning and carrying out their future work \(5.9\). Of those 40% said that because of what they had learnt in the webinars they would now consult with conservation experts earlier in the project, 36% said they would now budget for conservation work from the start of the project, and 23% said they now consider conservation as a key part of the process \(5.9\). In their feedback participants made comments such as ‘I now have a greater awareness of the requirements during conservation work, which will help me when consulting with experts and also considering what should go into a budget for such work.’, ‘\[I now have a\] Better understanding about toxic detection devices and wall papers and historic fabric hidden behind later cladding.’, ‘I am now considering the use of digital scanning with some of the properties where access is not possible.’ \(5.9\) 

 Lincoln Conservation have also been instrumental in the formalization of APR through participation in Working Group 13 of the Technical Committee of the European Committee for Standardization. This group is in the final stages of writing a European Standard for ‘Finishes of Built Heritage – Investigation and Documentation’ which once ratified, will automatically become the British Standard. McDonnell is one of four UK members of this group and the professional standard is in final draft stage \(5.10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The sustainability of local food systems has global economic and environmental implications. UofG research finds that community growing initiatives improve sustainable production and healthy consumption of food. Through engagement with local stakeholders from 2014 onwards, the research has: \(i\) supported the development of a new management and policy environment to enable community food production through the establishment of Glasgow Food Policy Partnership. In turn, this has: \(ii\) shaped the co\-production of Glasgow City Food Plan under the auspices of the local authority *.* The same research has: \(iii\) underpinned the establishment of a Community Food Hub in Dalmarnock, an area of multiple deprivation, which now supports sustainable local food production and healthy consumption \(e.g. 15,000 meals served in 2019\). Associated benefits include: \(iv\) enhanced food knowledge and improved community cohesion. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Context** 

 The Community Empowerment \(Scotland\) Act \(2015\) requires local authorities to produce a Food Growing Strategy for their area—including identifying land that may be used for allotments and community growing initiatives. The legislation also requires local authorities to include members of the public in the decisions and activities of the authority, including in the allocation of its resources. Glasgow City Council \(Scotland’s largest local authority\) was originally scheduled to deliver its strategy, Glasgow City Food Plan, in 2020. However, this activity was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 **2.2. Investigating the sustainable production of food in urban areas** 

 Against the backdrop of this community empowerment legislation, stimulated by increased public interest in community gardening and sustainable food production, a programme of UofG research investigated issues of sustainability management through the development of community gardens and local food spaces **\[3.1**, **3.4\]**. From 2013 onwards, the research examined the effects of community gardening on participants and local communities and analysed the contribution of such initiatives to the promotion of more sustainable forms of ‘prosumption’ \(production and consumption\) of food in urban areas **\[3.1**, **3.2**, **3.3\]**. The research consisted of observations via site visits to 11 community gardens, participant observation through volunteering days at a further 7 community gardens and 20 semi\-structured interviews \(with garden employees, volunteers and representatives from stakeholder organisations\). 

 Since 2015, the underpinning research has sought to place localised studies on community gardens within the context of wider social, economic and environmental issues. For example, output **\[3.3\]** argues that community gardening cannot be divorced from the economic and social processes accompanying neoliberal austerity policies. Further research **\[3.5\]** \(with Katherine Trebeck, Oxfam UK, and Iain Black, Heriot\-Watt University\) explored the progressive potential of prosumption and extended the debate beyond the commercially\-focused marketing discourse. The research offers additional understandings on how community gardens and **‘**DIY citizenship’ and self\-management can play important roles in creating and sustaining thriving communities **\[3.3\]** and examines how localised action might be scaled up to tackle climate change **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.3. Key findings** 

 Key findings from this body of research indicate that community gardens and local food growing initiatives demonstrate benefits including: \(i\) skills acquisition over a range of activities \(e.g. from horticulture to managing meetings\); \(ii\) enhanced community cohesion; \(iii\) improved wellbeing; \(iv\) increased knowledge of food; \(v\) healthy consumption and sustainable production **\[3.1**, **3.2**, **3.3**, **3.4\]**. The research finds that many community gardens are precarious in terms of key management issues, including: reliable funding streams, their knowledge of similar initiatives beyond the local area and their legal rights with respect to the changing \(and more amenable\) legal environment. The research **\[3.1**, **3.4\]** also highlights the imperative for a food policy partnership at the city level, as a means of developing a holistic approach to the pressing social, economic and environmental issues of the day. 

 **2.4. Establishing the need for community food provision in Dalmarnock** 

 The underpinning research also highlighted the proximity between the most disadvantaged communities in Glasgow and derelict land. This led to two EU/Scottish Government Social Innovation Fund projects on community food hubs. In Stage 1 \(2017\) UofG researchers conducted interviews with local residents and identified the need for enhanced community food provision in Dalmarnock, an area of multiple deprivation in Glasgow’s East End. This led to the Stage 2 project \(2018–2019\) **\[3.6\]**, which involved piloting a Community Food Hub in partnership with Baltic Street Adventure Playground, a community organisation based in Dalmarnock. This ongoing project promotes informal learning through community food production, communal cooking and the provision of nutritious meals \(as outlined in further detail in section **4** below\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Pathways to impact** 

 Inspired by the early findings of the research **\[3.4\]**, a series of  [<ins>workshop</ins>](https://www.gsen.org.uk/content/events/127-making-local-food-happen-community-gardening-in-glasgow/)<ins>s</ins> led and attended by UofG researchers facilitated the formation of Glasgow Food Policy Partnership \(GFPP\), with key local stakeholders agreeing to join under a shared commitment to healthier, more sustainable and resilient food systems. The establishment of GFPP underpinned a new policy environment within the city \(as outlined in section **4.2** below\), which has since shaped the co\-production by researchers and stakeholders of the Glasgow City Food Plan \(as outlined in section **4.3** below\). This city\-wide approach is augmented by a community\-level initiative in Dalmarnock, which supports increased food production and healthy consumption \(as outlined in section **4.4** below\); enhanced food knowledge and community cohesion \(as outlined in section **4.5** below\). 

 **4.2. Informing the development of a new policy environment** 

 The establishment of GFPP marked the beginnings of a new and more inclusive policy environment within the city, designed to drive sustainable change based upon multiple\-stakeholder perspectives. The Sustainable Glasgow Manager and Chief Resilience Officer at Glasgow City Council confirms that, *‘Professors Shaw, McMaster and Cumbers’ research played a central role in the establishment of Glasgow Food Policy Partnership \(GFPP\) in 2014 \[…\] The formation of GFPP is a significant step for the city,* as *it ensures a place for community representatives on its committee, alongside public officials and representatives of NGOs \- thus enabling members of the public to feed into local authority decisions and activities, as required by the Community Empowerment \(Scotland\) Act \(2015\).’* \(confirmed by statement **\[5A\]**\) 

 This partnership now includes Glasgow City Council, Scottish Government, NHS Scotland, Soil Association Scotland and FareShare—the UK’s largest anti\-food\-waste charity. The resultant GFPP Charter ‘Good Food for All’ **\[5B\]** has been signed by 115 businesses, third sector organisations and local food growers to date. The Sustainable Glasgow Manager and Chief Resilience Officer at Glasgow City Council notes that, *‘a key research recommendation was that an overarching partnership could act as a focus for informing food policy within the city’*. **\[5A\]** 

 On the recommendation of its Council representative, GFPP has become Glasgow’s primary link to the Sustainable Food Cities Network. This network facilitates practical guidance based upon the experiences of towns and cities across the UK \(an imperative originally outlined by the underpinning research **\[3.1**, **3.4\]**\). Reporting on Sustainable Food Cities in 2016, Glasgow City Council’s Sustainability and Environment Policy and Development Committee stated that, *‘The principal means by which the Council has engaged in the development of this work has been through the Glasgow Food Policy Partnership \[…\] GFPP is helping to deliver on the city’s anti\-poverty agenda through its own work on tackling food poverty **.**’* **\[5C\]** 

 **4.3. The co\-production of Glasgow City Food Plan** 

 The creation of Glasgow City Food Plan is a legal requirement of the Community Empowerment \(Scotland\) Act \(2015\). Statement **\[5A\]** confirms that, ** **‘**GFPP is now the main organisation tasked with leading the consultation and development of Glasgow City Food Plan’*. GFPP acts as a conduit to key local stakeholders and as a means of engaging with likeminded organisations throughout the UK through the Sustainable Food Cities Network. UofG researchers have been active members of two of the six workstreams that have drafted sections of the Plan \(i.e. Food Procurement and Food Waste and Environment\). The underpinning research **\[3.2**, **3.4\]** is directly cited in the official Glasgow City Food Plan consultation document **\[5D\]**, which was launched on 8 October 2020. Following a public consultation which ran until 31 December 2020, Glasgow City Food Plan will be finalised in 2021. 

 Reflecting upon this collaborative policy development, the Public Health Programme Manager at Glasgow Centre for Population Health confirmed, *‘The research of Shaw, McMaster, Cumbers and Anderson \[…\] has provided additional understandings of the links between localised food growing initiatives and the wider social, economic and environmental issues of the day \[…\] The research has highlighted the inequitable distribution of community food projects across the city and demonstrated a need for more secure and sustainable funding to support the sector’s intrinsic value, as well as its net benefits to Glasgow.’* She continued, *‘The contribution of UofG research and engagement activity is highly\-significant as the Glasgow City Food Plan is an ambitious project that supports the delivery of a number of other strategies and plans at citywide and national levels. The researchers’ community\-level knowledge and evidence from the underpinning research has played a vitally\-important role in supporting this intensive period of policy development.’*  \(confirmed by statement **\[5E\]**\) 

 **4.4. Increased food production and healthy consumption** 

 Based upon two EU/Scottish Government\-funded Social Innovation Fund projects, UofG researchers and Baltic Street Adventure Playground \(BSAP\) have pioneered an award\-winning Community Food Hub in Dalmarnock—one of the city’s most disadvantaged areas \(confirmed by award **\[5F\]** and project report **\[3.6\]**\). As a result, an area of once\-derelict land has been transformed into a thriving community space, which now sustains an array of fresh produce to support communal cooking experiences and the provision of nutritious meals \(confirmed by  [<ins>short film</ins>](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13Kvfor0SPkAJGjoBrrQwktTfkXPjv9L8) **\[5G\]**\). BSAP is used throughout the year, particularly over school holidays, with 7,409 visits and approximately 15,000 meal portions served over the summer of 2019. The annual attendance for 2019 was approximately 21,000 visits \(numbers confirmed by email **\[5H\]**\). 

 This child\-focused project brings parents and guardians together with experienced growers in an area where fresh, affordable food is not always readily available. BSAP’s raised beds, renovated prior to the project’s start, were combined with a project\-funded polytunnel to produce a range of fruit and vegetables \(e.g. onions, carrots, potatoes, alpine strawberries, peas, tomatoes, rhubarb, broccoli and kale\) from a growing area of approximately 250 square metres. The team of local growers at BSAP estimate that between 80–100 kilograms of produce has been grown since the project began in 2017. They added that, *‘carrots proved particularly popular with the children, who liked to pull them directly from the ground, wash them and eat them straight away’* \(confirmed in statement from local growers **\[5I\]**\). 



 The produce grown on site is integrated into the daily menu in salads, pasta sauces and curries. It also supports informal learning experiences to develop participants’ knowledge of the food system and healthy eating \(e.g. tomatoes are used in workshops to make relish, courgettes to make fritters in cooking classes\). The produce grown locally is supplemented with food deliveries twice a week from the UK’s largest anti\-food\-waste charity, FareShare. A statement from local growers confirms that the UofG project funding, *‘allowed the Community Food Hub to move from one to two deliveries per week, doubling its capacity to support the local community through local meals and food surplus’*. **\[5I\]** 

 **4.5. Enhanced knowledge of food and improved community cohesion** 

 Local residents who visit the Community Food Hub have demonstrated a range of benefits, with two key themes identified in the research report **\[3.6\]**. Firstly, BSAP provides a space for experimentation with food that may be unfamiliar, or might otherwise be too expensive. For instance, Participant A said: *‘there is all different things you can try \[…\] gluten free things \[…\] there’s always so much variety that you can choose from and there’s people coming in and saying, “Oh my goodness, that will do me for three days, at least I’m going to have dinners for my kids for three days”’.* Participant B added, *‘Usually, I wouldn’t eat anything like that \[cabbage\], but I just thought I will, just let me try, and I actually enjoyed it.’* Secondly, the Food Hub provides a much\-needed focal point for the community in an area with very few local amenities. Participant A added *: ‘the community’s starting to get back together, we’re starting to see each other again \[…\] because we don’t have shops, you don’t really see anybody, but coming to the park \[BSAP\], you bump into people that you’ve not seen for a long time. I’ve seen people come in I’ve not seen maybe in ten years’* \(quotes confirmed by participant interviews **\[5J\]**\). 

 **4.6. Next steps** 

 Through this innovative research\-based intervention, co\-produced by researchers and the communities of policy and practice, UofG research is contributing to the alleviation of food poverty through embedded engagement and deep local impact \(as outlined above\). This work supports social welfare within the city, through sustainable self\-managing programmes, which make essential connections between local food growing and the global environmental, social and economic challenges of the day. Both at community and policy levels, this work looks set to underpin significant impact activity beyond the REF2021 period.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Sam George’s research on the ‘ethical Gothic’ has sought to shift away from horror, cultivating a sense of moral agency, employing gothic narratives to create empathy for the marginalised, monstrous or othered, including the natural world. Through extensive public engagement, pedagogical innovation and outreach activities, she has i\) increased public awareness of how Gothic narratives can challenge perceptions of otherness and difference, helping to combat prejudice and hate crime through her work with the Sophie Lancaster Foundation; ii\) used her research into folklore and myth to promote ecological conservation, working with the UK Wolf Conservation Trust to help inform public perceptions of wolves; iii\) worked with and inspired the Young Adult Fiction of the novelist Marcus Sedgwick. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning the case study is George’s work on Gothic studies, primarily vampire literature and culture, the representation of shapeshifters and other magical beings \(particularly werewolves\) and the relationship between folklore and fiction \(e.g. wolf myths, folktales of children raised by wolves etc.\). This research has been central to the ongoing Open Graves, Open Minds project \(OGOM\). The project has prospered through collaboration with Drs Bill Hughes and Kaja Franck. OGOM was established by George and Hughes in 2010 to lead and foster research, nationally and internationally, into how representations of the undead, the supernatural and the fantastical in literature and myth relate to, and can influence, contemporary attitudes on issues ranging from sexuality and social change, to otherness, hybridity or difference. Originally focusing on vampire fiction, film and television, OGOM has expanded its scope to embrace a range of Gothic genres and tropes examining such areas as the physical body and animal studies, including the extinction and conservation of seemingly ‘monstrous’ creatures \(such as wolves\). 

 OGOM has hosted three major international conferences: ‘Open Graves, Open Minds’ in 2010; ‘The Company of Wolves’ in 2015; and ‘The Urban Weird’ in 2018 \(a collaboration with the Supernatural Cities project hosted at the University of Portsmouth\). It has also hosted two smaller\-scale symposia, to commemorate the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Bram Stoker’s death in 2012, and the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of Polidori’s *The Vampyre* in 2019. These events have resulted in numerous publications, some of which have become staple texts for the vampire\-studies courses which have emerged in the wake of OGOM’s success. 

 George’s work with OGOM has increasingly focused on the power of contemporary Gothic fiction to speak to, and influence, a young readership; she has argued consistently that Gothic writing both enthuses young adult readers for literary studies, and provides a medium for them to explore complex questions of identity and ethical behaviour on both a personal and societal level. In particular, her research has explored how the study of the Gothic can shape the ethical thinking of young readers, particularly around two of the most pressing issues facing contemporary society: tolerance for difference in the face of rising instances of hate\-crime against BAME communities and minority subcultures, and the looming threat of ecological crisis. A selection of outputs relating to the ‘ethical Gothic’ are listed below \(3.1\-3.5\). Two distinct strands of publication have emerged: on Young Adult Gothic fiction, exploring questions of subculture, otherness and difference; and on wolves, exploring questions of human\-animal relations, monstrosity, wildness, extinction, habitat\-loss and rewilding. 

 These outputs are the result of a decade of sustained effort to rethink the way in which people conceptualise Gothic studies, both inside and outside the academy, and to demonstrate that the study of popular fiction can, by challenging prejudices and preconceptions, have transformative social impact.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 George has used the OGOM project to reconfigure attitudes towards the sorts of otherness commonly depicted and explored in Gothic fiction. By challenging prevailing conceptions of the meaning and significance of popular Gothic fiction, both in the academy and in broader public discourse, she has used Gothic fiction as a means of intervening directly in pressing contemporary ethical debates about social attitudes towards minority groups, and environmental degradation; this work has also directly affected the practice of an award\-winning creative writer working in the genre, who has collaborated in the project. 

 This impact has been achieved through a programme of public engagement, academic conferences which also attracted a non\-academic audience, dissemination through the mainstream media, and wide use of social media. George collaborated with two charities, the Sophie Lancaster Foundation and the UK Wolf Conservation Trust, has developed and implemented educational toolkits for sixth\-formers in schools and colleges. 

 **Public engagement with gothic narratives** 

 A key feature of the OGOM project has been its continuous engagement with interested members of public, as well as scholars and students. The OGOM conferences have sought to attract interested members of the public as well as an academic audience. The project website  [www.opengravesopenminds.com](http://www.opengravesopenminds.com/) had received 165,084 visitors by 31 December 2020. Social media includes Twitter \(@OGOMproject 7,303 followers and 315,000 impressions over a three\-month period; @DrSamGeorge1, c. 12,500 followers; OGOM Facebook group 920 members\). George has discussed the work of OGOM at literary festivals and public events including: 

-  ‘Books of Blood: objects lost and found’, *Being Human Festival* \(23 November 2017\) 

-  The Manchester Gothic Festival \(24\-29 October 2017\) 

-  Living Frankenstein event at SOAS and Bath Literary Festival \(23 and 25 May 2018\) 

-  Battle of the Books at Edinburgh Festival and London Conway Hall in collaboration with novelist Marcus Sedgwick \(20 August and 4 September 2018\) 

-  Supernatural St Albans Halloween Tour \(31 October 2018\) 

-  ‘The Black Vampyre: Gothic Visions of New Worlds’, online, *Being Human Festival* \(14 November 2020\) 

 This approach has established her as a leading public\-facing scholar of Gothic fiction, providing a platform to challenge conventional thinking about Gothic subcultures and pressing social and environmental issues. 

 **Ecological conservation: challenging perceptions of wolves** 

 The charity Rewilding Britain has argued that the UK should respond to the global climate crisis by rewilding a quarter of the nation’s land. One of the key obstacles, however, is widespread misunderstanding of or hostility towards the concept of rewilding. Much of this is rooted in negative associations with some of the wildlife which might be reintroduced in such a plan, such as the wolf. The portrayal of werewolves in literature has, George argues, influenced negative public perceptions of wolves. George has worked with OGOM to challenge negative stereotypes of wolves, by looking at werewolves in a more nuanced, positive light. Two events initially disseminated the work: the Company of Wolves conference \(2015\), an academic conference that attracted a non\-academic audience, and included a visit to see wolves at the UK Wolf Trust; and the ‘Redeeming the Wolf’ event at the AHRC’s 2017 Being Human festival. 

 Extensive media coverage of the Company of Wolves conference, showing high levels of readership and reciprocal engagement, demonstrates how George’s work has influenced public discourse on the issue. A Guardian article, *The howl truth: scholars get packing for UK werewolf conference* \(21 August 2015\), discussed initial interest in the conference. This inspired a further comment piece that argued it was time for the resurgence of the werewolf in the public imagination, drawing a connection between werewolves and modern society’s problems \(‘ *In our dog\-eat\-dog world, it’s time for werewolves*’ 30 August, 2015\). This piece attracted 96 comments of its own, e.g.: *“*Surprisingly insightful and frankly quite excellent article… I've been sensing the return of the Werewolf archetype in popular culture for some time now”. A further article on the conference in *The Independent* was shared widely on social media \(2,000 shares, 10,300 Facebook shares, 1,600 comments, 6,700 reactions\) while BBC Local Live \(Beds, Herts and Bucks\) excitedly live blogged the first day of the conference. Day two saw them publish a feature article on their interviews with visitors to the conference \[ **5.6**\]. 

 Public engagement on the subject continued with an article by George in *The Conversation* on the Hull werewolf, *Why We Should Welcome the Return of Old Stinker the English Werewolf* \(30 October, 2016\). It gained 16,879 reads, was shared 202 times on Twitter and 2,220 times on Facebook and attracted 63 comments, significant metrics for the site. George actively engaged with the people who commented, thereby stimulating debate on the topic \[ **5.2**\]. Elsewhere, she collaborated with Mike Collins, chief keeper at UK Wolf Trust, on a BBC article exploring the public perception of wolves and their conservation \(‘ *Little Red Riding Hood tale hampers wolf debate, says academic*’, 4 November 2017\). Cementing the relationship between George’s literary research and the wider re\-wilding debate, the article highlights George’s belief that negative perceptions of wolves arise from the “demonising folklore and fairytale around the animal”, with Collins confirming that there are “almost no wolf attacks on humans”, and that he would “welcome a debate about bringing the wolf back to British shores” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 
On arrival at the Redeeming the Wolf event \(18 November 2017\), audience members were asked to write three words they associate with the wolf, and then to perform this task again after attending the talks, film and panel. As Professor Garry Marvin, education and research committee at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust stated, this “thoughtful and active engagement with the public” gave a “snapshot of their attitudes to wolves, \[indicating\] what views they had come with and how they felt at the end of the day” \[ **5.7**\]. As shown, responses demonstrated how attitudes towards the wolf shifted significantly through engaging with this research. The audience response cards were then displayed at the UK Wolf Trust, playing a part in their educational outreach and public engagement. The Trust is now directing educational queries to the OGOM project. 

 OGOM’s Redeeming the Wolf educational pack incorporates the response cards alongside a collection of benevolent wolf myths, with a programme of interactive workshops, lectures and seminars. Educational outreach work was undertaken by George with 16 local schools, using these packs to engage students with both the ethical issues surrounding wolves and the nature of literary study through their textual representations. The recorded responses show significant shifts in attitudes – with almost all moving from a negative to a positive view of wolves – and increased ethical awareness, e.g. “I'd like to be more involved with environmental conservation” \[ **5.4**\]. The pack has been made available online. 

 **Perceptions of ‘otherness’ and hate crime** 

 George’s work on otherness and hate\-crime, approached through the study of Young Adult fiction, has pressing social relevance in the wake of Brexit, at a time when the Home Office has reported a spike in reported hate\-crimes. George is working with Poet Laureate Simon Armitage and the Sophie Lancaster Foundation, the charity set up in the wake of the murder of the Goth teenager Sophie in 2007 to encourage tolerance of subcultures through education and outreach, and to campaign for the inclusion of subcultures within the legal definition of hate crime. George’s research, disseminated in her keynote ‘Black Roses: The Representation and Appropriation of Sophie Lancaster from Broken Britain to Brexit \(2007–17\)’ at the Manchester Gothic Festival \(2017, 200\+ attendees\) “spoke directly to the work of the Foundation…She made people aware that hate crime is not restricted to issues of race or sexuality, that it can extend to subcultures and all those who are perceived as different within their own communities” \(Education Officer, Sophie Lancaster Foundation \[ **5.5**\]\). Over 50 people approached the Foundation’s stall after the talk to offer donations and request further information. Her work “had a lasting impact on the audience of festival goers. It has helped to cement and shape Sophie’s legacy … through increased donations to the Foundation; through an increased number of young people wanting to become involved in the work of the foundation; through changing people’s understanding of what a hate crime is” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Understanding Otherness educational packs, incorporating material from Armitage, were trialled in empathy workshops with students on the “Generation Dead” undergraduate module, where Armitage’s ‘Black Roses’ is tied to the themes of subculture, otherness and adolescence. Responses to evaluation after the workshops demonstrate a change from stereotyped attitudes to the Goth subculture, with positive descriptions including “gentle, enthusiastic, misunderstood”. They also show how the research fostered active commitment to work against hate crime, e.g. “I would personally look into volunteering at a charity or company that helps to rehabilitate victims of hate crime back into society and obviously spread word of the Sophie Lancaster foundation” \[ **5.10**\]. The Foundation were “struck by the level of impact” and the “strong shift in opinions about Sophie as a result of Sam’s work in the workshops”. They plan to use the exercises with their own live audiences and will direct teachers to the OGOM packs. Collaboration with the Foundation continues, with an event with Simon Armitage and Sylvia Lancaster in 2021 \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **The Black Vampyre** and ‘otherness’** 

 Research into the 1819 American Gothic slavery text ‘The Black Vampyre’ began with a social media campaign to celebrate this text: the first black vampire, the first vampire story by an American writer and the first vampire anti\-slavery narrative. It inspired 130,000 impressions on Twitter, 34 comments, 654 retweets and 1,780 likes. George’s article in *The Conversation* ‘America’s first vampire was Black and revolutionary’ \(30 October 2020\) received significant public attention: 38,171 reads; 14,600 Facebook shares; 405 Twitter retweets \[ **5.2**\]. A public event was held as part of the Being Human Festival \(November 2020\), focusing on how humanities research into Gothic narratives engages with people’s aspirations and dreams, especially when facing crises—such as plague, war, and racial oppression. The event had 159 attendees including participants from the US, Australia, South America and throughout Europe. The audience was asked what three words they would use to describe Gothic narratives after engaging with the discussion and there was a very strong shift away from horror and sensationalism; instead, the responses showed an understanding of how empathic and revolutionary the Gothic can be: “Humane, questioning and clever”; “Progressive, connecting, revolutionary”. Reponses to further questions demonstrated that attendees gained a new perspective on contemporary issues and understanding of Gothic narratives through exploring otherness: “The links to the BLM movement seemed particularly poignant”; “this event definitely opened a new perspective on the Gothic for me” \[ **5.9**\]. 

 **Inspiring and informing creative writing** 

 The author Marcus Sedgwick has been involved with OGOM since its inception. His fiction for young adults shows deep concern with ethical issues, often dramatised through the Gothic. He states that his writing has been influenced by his cooperation with OGOM: “working with OGOM and the team around Dr Sam George has encouraged me to voyage more deeply into the relationship between folklore and fiction, and I can see the result in all my work. It has been consistently inspired, enriched and informed by it…I strongly see a connection between this work with OGOM and a book I wrote some time later, *Midwinterblood*, perhaps the book for which I am best known… *The Monsters We Deserve* was very influenced by our discussions and my thinking about gothic monsters. One of the central questions…was inspired by OGOM\!\!” \[ **5.8**\]. *Midwinterblood* won the Michael L Printz Award, America’s most prestigious prize for writing for Young Adults.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Weight management is critical for survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease \(ALS/MND\). Gastrostomy feeding directly into the stomach is recommended to support patients with ALS/MND that develop severe dysphagia. Notwithstanding, there was a lack of evidence of optimal timing and method for gastrostomy insertion. Furthermore, the lack of authoritative lay information meant that patients tended to put off having the procedure until it was too late despite the opposite advice by health professionals. The ProGas study led by Sheffield researchers determined that gastrostomy should be done at 5% weight loss rather than 10% as was in the guidelines at the time, and that radiologically inserted gastrostomy \(RIG\) tubes should not be used. This has led to updated national and international clinical guidelines on nutritional support and the increased use of gastrostomy in ALS/MND disease patients. This research has also informed the creation of a unique online resource \(MyTube,  [https://mytube.mymnd.org.uk/](https://mytube.mymnd.org.uk/)\) for patients, carers, health professionals and the general public to inform and assist decision making for patients. As a direct result the lives of patients and carers were improved. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \(ALS\), known in the UK as motor neuron disease \(MND\) is a progressive degenerative fatal neuromuscular disease that is caused by degeneration of motor neurones. ALS/MND sufferers typically die within 2\-3 years from diagnosis due to respiratory arrest. As the disease is incurable, the efforts to support patients are heavily focused on sustaining a maximum quality of life \(QoL\). Worldwide an estimated 450,000 patients are living with ALS/MND at any given time. Dysphagia \(swallowing difficulties\) is a common problem in patients with ALS/MND. Patients with severe swallowing difficulty experience malnutrition, dehydration, choking and an increased risk of chest infections. Traditional use of nasogastric tubes for feeding is problematic for ALS/MND patients and is not compatible with using non\-invasive ventilation \(NIV\), the current standard therapy to manage respiratory insufficiency. 

 Long\-term nutritional support of patients with severe swallowing difficulty can be achieved by placing a feeding tube, known as a gastrostomy, directly into the stomach; both the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies recommend gastrostomy feeding in ALS/MND patients who develop severe dysphagia. 

 A meta\-analysis and survey of the practice of gastronomy use in ALS/MND conducted by the Sheffield team, in which they reviewed the three main methods of gastrostomy insertion \(percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy \(PEG\); radiologically inserted gastrostomy \(RIG\);  per\-oral image\-guided gastrostomy \(PIG\)\) and conducted a meta\-analysis of mortality data following gastrostomy, revealed a lack of high\-quality evidence to indicate the optimal method and timing for gastrostomy insertion in patients with ALS/MND and indicated that RIG and PIG methods may be safer than PEG \[R1\]. 

 A retrospective, qualitative exploration using semi\-structured interviews was conducted with 27 paired patients and carers, out of which 23 underwent gastrostomy, in order to elicit their perceptions in relation to gastrostomy timing. It concluded that the advice for early insertion does not outweigh the personal perceptions and psychosocial factors for patients and their carers. It also found that understanding the factors that influence decision\-making on an individual basis is important for information and care provision by healthcare professionals in aiding patients and their carers, to make informed decisions in relation to gastrostomy timing \[R2, R3\]. 

 Following on from these studies, the Sheffield team initiated a world\-first large, longitudinal, prospective cohort study \(ProGas\) that aimed to compare gastrostomy insertion approaches in terms of safety and clinical outcomes in ALS/MND. The ProGas study team worked with the Sheffield Motor Neurone Disorders Research Advisory Group to enable the public, patients and carers the opportunity to provide feedback on all aspects of ProGas and to contribute to shaping the final ProGas protocol. The membership of this group includes patients and carers who have experience of motor system disorders including ALS/MND. Between Nov 2, 2010, and Jan 31, 2014, 345 patients were recruited in 24 participating UK ALS/MND care centres and clinics of whom 330 had gastrostomy. 163 \(49%\) patients underwent PEG, 121 \(37%\) underwent RIG, 43 \(13%\) underwent PIG, and three \(1%\) underwent surgical gastrostomy. The study showed that while the three methods of gastrostomy seemed to be as safe as each other in relation to survival and procedural complications, the hazard of death after gastrostomy insertion was significantly affected by the percentage of weight loss from diagnosis to gastrostomy, and patients who received RIG had a significantly higher rate of tube\-related complications, leakage and replacement. Accordingly, the ProGas Study recommended that gastrostomy should be done at 5% weight loss rather than 10% as was in the guidelines at the time, and that RIG tubes should not be used \[R4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and services, practitioners and services, commercial. 

 Main beneficiaries include: patients, carers, practitioners, NHS, NICE, general public, industry. 

 Gastrostomy feeding directly into the stomach is recommended to support patients with ALS/MND that develop severe dysphagia. These patients struggle to maintain weight, and without a tube they essentially cannot take in enough calories to survive. Prior to the ProGas study the practice of gastrostomy feeding was largely based on consensus and expert opinion rather than robust evidence. Furthermore, the lack of accessible information meant that patients tended to put off having the procedure until it was too late despite the opposite advice by health professionals. The ProGas study was stimulated by the research priorities identified by both the Dementias and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network \(DeNDRoN\) Clinical Studies Group for MND and the MND Association. ProGas has provided scientific underpinning for the practice of gastronomy in ALS/MND and provided an award\-winning online information resource which have directly improved the lives of patients and carers. 

 Impact on UK and international guidelines 

 The ProGas Study has led to updated national and international guidelines on nutrition support and the use of gastrostomy in patients with ALS/MND. 

 In the UK, the British Medical Journal used the results from the ProGas study as evidence that gastrostomy before substantial weight loss might be beneficial as part of ongoing treatment options, in its BMJ Best Practice on ALS/MND publication \[S1\]. The Motor Neurone Disease Association, the only national ALS/MND charity in the UK and founding member of the international Alliance of ALS/MND associations, which has 40 members, included the recommendations of the ProGas study in its Guide for GPs and primary care teams \[S2\]. 

 The results have been reflected in current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines for MND, which state that the role of gastrostomy feeding should be discussed at an early stage but that it must be recognised that not all individuals will wish to proceed \[S3\]. Internationally, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism \(ESPEN\) has used the recommendations from the ProGas study in its guidelines on clinical nutrition in *Neurology* \[S4\]. 

 Impact by public participation, involvement, and engagement: direct impact on the lives of MND/ALS patients 

 As a result of the ProGas study findings the MyTube website \( [https://mytube.mymnd.org.uk/](https://mytube.mymnd.org.uk/)\) was created in collaboration with the NHS and the Sheffield MND Care Centre and with support from the MND Association. Built for and by patients, the site offers insights into living with a tube or alternatives available through the use of short videos and information about tube feeding for people living with ALS/MND with the clearly stated objective to use patient stories to encourage change; myTube was launched in March 2017 \[S5\]. The myTube website has become the go to information resource for patients and carers: it has become the recommended information source by patient organisations such as the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Group \(PENG\) and the British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition \(BAPEN\) \[S6\]. Its influence and impact have further been recognised by several awards, including two British Medical Association \(BMA\) Patient Information Awards \[S7a\] describing it as “ *a perfect medium for instructional information*” and the Nutrition Resource of the Year Award from Complete Nutrition Magazine, the UK’s number one clinical, medical and health nutrition publication \[S7b\]. 

 The myTube resource has helped patients and carers worldwide to make informed decisions; one patient commented “ *I have just been diagnosed with MND and have been asked to start considering getting a PEG. This is fantastic information and very timely. I've already watched the first two 'videos' and they're great. Thanks to all participants...you're already helping someone in Australia*.” While a carer said “ *I'm sure this will help put people's minds at ease regarding PEGs and other things. Wish \[husband’s name\] could have seen this early on. He might not have resisted having his fitted till it was desperate*” \[S8\]. 

 Feedback was also received from clinics around the UK that the website is used regularly in their clinics to support patients \[S8\]. The use of myTube, in patient decision making, has been suggested as a reason for the increase in patients in Scotland undergoing gastrostomy *‘More people could be undergoing gastrostomy because of the increasing amounts of readily accessible information via social media and the internet for example https://mytube.mymnd. org.uk/.’* \[S9\]. 

 Commercial impact 

 The myTube resource was designed by Ammba Digital architects \( [<ins>http://ammba.co.uk/</ins>](http://ammba.co.uk/)\), a consultancy and digital product development company, in collaboration with Optical Jukebox \(the film makers for myTube\), the Sheffield team and ALS/MND patients and carers. Ammba’s involvement in the project team that delivered myTube has led to ongoing work for the company in the digital healthcare space. The myTube project allowed the company to take their specialism and skills from the education learning sector into the health sector. Ongoing collaboration with Optical Jukebox led to securing a £50K funding award from the Ufi VocTech programme to develop a digital learning resource to support carers working with those living with a neurological condition; a first for this sector \[S10\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 In Colombia, millions of people displaced by violent conflict over the past fifty years face new risks in the areas where they have resettled, such as flooding, landslides and fire. Our team worked alongside resettled people to get their stories, in their own voices and artistic styles, to wider audiences, thereby strengthening awareness of displaced people’s experiences, abilities and needs. Our collaborative, arts\-based approach to knowledge\-exchange built relations of trust with Indigenous and traditionally marginalised groups and helped generate new support networks and community\-driven initiatives. The success of this work also influenced government policy, informing the development of inclusive institutional programmes aimed at strengthening local capacity to manage and reduce risk in marginalised settlements. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Over five decades of armed conflict in Colombia have resulted in one of the world’s largest populations of internally displaced people. As of February 2020, the Unit for Attention and Reparation of Victims \(UARIV\) had recorded almost eight million people internally displaced by violence, 16% of the country’s current population \( [unidadvictimas.gov.co](http://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co/)\). The 2016 agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC \(The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\) was an important step towards attaining peace, but many Colombians displaced by violence from their predominantly rural homes and livelihoods now face new forms of risk, such as flooding, landslides and fire, in the urban spaces where they have mostly resettled. 

 Our research analysed how people displaced by armed conflict become exposed to greater risk from environmental hazards. Colombia is highly vulnerable to earthquakes and volcanic eruption, and flooding and landslides caused by intense rainfall are an annual occurrence. According to the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management \(UNGRD\), around twenty million people were affected by disasters in Colombia between 2000 and 2019 \( [portal.gestiondelriesgo.gov.co](http://portal.gestiondelriesgo.gov.co/)\), many of them in areas inhabited by internally displaced people. 

 The research project ‘Moving with Risk’, funded by the ESRC, and the follow\-on project ‘The Art of Disaster Risk Reduction’, funded by the AHRC, were a continuous interdisciplinary collaboration between; humanities, social science and natural science scholars at the University of East Anglia \(UEA\); psychologists and community\-arts practitioners from the Psychosocial Institute for Disaster Risk Management at the Universidad de Manizales, Colombia; the Colombian Red Cross; the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management \(UNGRD\) of the government of Colombia; the disaster risk management units of three local government departments in Colombia, and; Colombian Human Rights organisation,  [DeJusticia](https://www.dejusticia.org/en/). Co\-creation and collaboration with local communities were at the heart of both projects. Our team engaged directly with 429 individuals which gave us a much wider reach across all four case study sites, located in marginalised settlements in Cazucá, Soacha, an urban working\-class district of the Metropolitan Area of Bogotá, in the city of Manizales, Caldas, some 300 kilometres west of Bogotá, and in two sites adjacent to Pereira, Risaralda, 35km south\-west of Manizales. With populations of approximately four million, 400,000 and 500,000 respectively, these are regions where 30−60% of land is prone to flooding and landslide, and where overcrowding creates fire hazards. 

 **Findings:** For people facing the immediate risk of violence, displacement was the primary survival strategy, but it allowed for little consideration of environmental hazards \(3.5\). People resettled in ‘at\-risk’ areas often prefer to remain in their new spaces rather than move yet again \(3.5 and  [teocripsi.com/ojs/index.php/TCP/article/view/308](http://teocripsi.com/ojs/index.php/TCP/article/view/308)\). Despite not having effective formal channels for communal disaster risk reduction actions, displaced people are keen to work in broader coalitions mediated by academics to manage risk in their places of resettlement \(3.2, 3.3\). Our interdisciplinary research demonstrated the potential to further strengthen existing capacity through arts\-based approaches, which helped break down issues of distrust and stigma for Indigenous and marginalised communities \(3.1, 3.3, 3.4\). 

 The following **outputs** were co\-designed and co\-produced with participating communities: 

1.  Resumen de Actividades Investigativas 2017−2018 \(Summary of Research Activities 2017−2018\). This booklet details the arts\-based methodologies and artistic outputs in each case study site. It includes a DVD containing a film of all the artistic outputs of ‘Moving with Risk’: three theatrical plays written and performed by communities in Cazucá and Pereira, two dances created and performed by Indigenous women in two sites in Pereira, a story book written and illustrated by communities in Pereira, and a mural co\-designed and painted by community in Manizales, now on public display in the library of Universidad de Manizales.

 4. Details of the impact 

 Our projects, and the methodologies used to ensure the widest ownership of them, have played a key role in shifting perceptions, practices and policies both inside and outside of resettled marginalised communities in Colombia. The progression of work from impact\-oriented research and engagement in ‘Moving with Risk’ to research\-informed engagement for impact in ‘The Art of Disaster Risk Reduction’ has enabled us to build collaboratively a momentum of change in communities and in the institutions that represent them, and make policies that affect them. First, by creating spaces that enable healing from trauma, the projects have enhanced the psychosocial wellbeing of some of the most disadvantaged social groups in the country. Second, our facilitation of cultural expression in communities facing major ongoing risks has strengthened solidarity and directly enabled the emergence of new networks of neighbour\-to\-neighbour organisation, which have provided crucial support during the COVID\-19 pandemic. Third, our project opened up mechanisms for the participation of hitherto marginalised groups in decision\-making on disaster risk reduction. Fourth, the project has demonstrated how government agencies can recognise, respect and work with the capacities of marginalised social groups. Finally, our project is having direct influence on the design of policies and practices affecting at\-risk communities, thus contributing to the creation of safer environments for disadvantaged social groups. 

 **Impact on community practice**. For socially and politically marginalised people who have suffered enormous loss and trauma as well as the disempowering effects of violence and displacement, traditional social science interviews can re\-open wounds and cause extreme distress. In our research, conversations about music chosen by participants for its personal significance, and subsequent arts\-based workshops, produced channels of community\-led expression which generated trust, created new social networks, and opened spaces for communities in twenty\-eight neighbourhoods across four municipalities to articulate their capacities, experiences, priorities, feelings and needs to us, to each other and to key stakeholders. We also used the arts to raise community members’ awareness of state services available to them, leading to changes in practice at the community level. Testimonies from participating communities were collected in four case study sites: the city of Manizales in Caldas; the settlements of Caimalito and Esperanza Galicia near the city of Pereira in Risaralda; and Cazucá in the municipality of Soacha, Cundinamarca, just south of Bogotá. All quotations are translated into English from the original Spanish and to ensure anonymity pseudonyms have been used. Testimonies from participating communities indicate that our research: 

1.  Enabled healing from trauma: ‘\[The music conversation\] helped me a lot, after you came here … I went to \[the hospital\] … and asked for an appointment and then spoke to a doctor and he told me, “You have this and that” … I felt a lot better afterwards … if you hadn’t come, I don’t know, I’d just be here depressed’ \(‘Elena’, Caimalito, S1, p. 2\). 

1.  Increased confidence and self\-esteem: ‘The project … allowed me to recognise … my capacities and talents’ \(‘Dolores’, Esperanza Galicia, S2, p. 6\). 

1.  Built trust and collaboration between neighbourhoods, communities and institutions, strengthening community capacity to take ownership of disaster risk management: ‘relationships \[with the institutions\] improved’ \(‘Juan’, Pereira, S3a, p.5\). ‘\[The project\] brought together a good team of leaders from the neighbourhoods. With this group we’re incentivised to do a lot more work’ \(‘Pedro’, Cazucá, S3b, p.16\). This has helped communities to deal with the current pandemic: ‘Living through the pandemic … we’re applying everything we’ve learned through \[the project\]’ \(‘Antonio’, Manizales, S3c, p.20\). 

1.  Raised awareness of legal aspects of disaster risk reduction in informal settlements: ‘now we know exactly which institutions to go to according to the requirements we may have, we’re not so lost’ \(‘Susana’, Manizales, S4, p.7\). 

 **Impact on government policy and practice**. For the Colombian Red Cross and government at regional and national levels, the community\-led artistic outputs, presentations and performances touched the emotions profoundly and prompted change. The arts enabled stakeholders to view people displaced by violence beyond the legal category of ‘victim’ and allowed them to access the human stories behind the statistics. This produced new and inclusive institutional initiatives designed to bring community voices into decision\-making. In the quotations below, all names are pseudonyms. The letters ‘CRC’ indicate representative of the Colombian Red Cross, ‘NG’ national government representative, and ‘LG’ local government. Testimonies from government and the Colombian Red Cross evidence our institutional impact through: 

 **Transformed perceptions and understandings**. Civil servants were moved to new understandings of the lived experiences and human consequences of displacement, leading to greater recognition of local non\-technical forms of knowledge and a commitment to deepen and extend collaborations with affected communities: ‘now we have a different perception … and it’s <ins>not</ins> going to be difficult to be able to work together and carry on doing activities’ \(Miguel, LG, Pereira, S5a, p.4\). Civil servants also stated that the projects enabled them to see how, through art, ‘you can reach the communities better’ \(Cristina, CRC, Pereira, S5b, p.8\). This is significant because institutions usually find access to ‘vulnerable’ communities is ‘complicated’: ‘I discovered that doing these kinds of \[arts\-based\] activities, the community gets closer and “gives” more, believes \[in the institutions\] more, there’s more empathy and more trust in what \[we do\]’ \(Cristina, CRC, Pereira, S5b, p.8\). Art, a specialised professional from the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management \(UNGRD\) of the government of Colombia stated, ‘offers the possibility of people not only enjoying themselves but of learning things, and not only learning but identifying their own potential … \[their potential\] perhaps hasn’t been identified before’ \(S6b\). 

 **Raised status of local knowledge**. As a result of our work, the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management \(UNGRD\) of the government of Colombia has paid community members to formally present their artistic outputs at official events, raising the status of previously marginalised forms of local knowledge. UNGRD has indicated that community activities will now be a formal part of the government’s annual disaster risk reduction month every year. Community\-led theatrical performances created and produced for our research were included in the national government’s ‘Month of Disaster Risk Reduction’ formal activities in Bogotá, 19 October 2018 \(S7a\). 

 Translated extract: ‘‘Innovative Tools to Strengthen Community Resilience’, in which the UNGRD, the Universidad de Manizales and the UEA, UK, generated space for discussion about the importance of, and ways to, advance and strengthen processes of community ownership of disaster risk management … communities … had the opportunity to show, through theatre, how they are taking ownership of disaster risk management in order to create community resilience’. 

 **Helped shape a more inclusive approach**. As a direct result of our research, the government has recognised the need to include community voices in ongoing policy debates. Our research has stimulated new government initiatives: ours is one of three projects \(and the only non\-governmental project\) that the Colombian government has selected to incorporate into a new ‘National Strategy for Community Resilience \(COMUNGERD\)’. UNGRD has asked the project team to provide input on diversity and inclusion, which is being used for the development of new policy on disaster risk reduction to better target Indigenous and other marginalised social groups including low\-income households, women and disabled and older people. In a letter dated 1 November 2019, the subdirector of UNGRD of the government of Colombia stated: ‘Your ideas … are a significant contribution for different public, private and community bodies that are part of the National System for Disaster Risk Management to join efforts for the strengthening of the community aspects of disaster risk management, which is vital for our country’ \(S7b\). 

 **Changed institutional practice**. Representatives of the UNGRD of the Colombian government have stated that our projects have influenced their approach to working with internally displaced people who face environmental hazards in their places of resettlement and helped civil servants to recognise and value the knowledge of marginalised communities. A specialised professional from UNGRD wrote on 13 March 2019: ‘In Colombia, apart from what you have done, I am not aware of any other studies that explore how displaced communities have developed their own capacities and measures to improve their safety’ \(S6a\). Government representatives stated that, as a result of our projects, their focus has become more collaborative and horizontal: ‘we started saying … let’s work with the community, build with them and let them tell us what they want, let them start telling us what disaster risk management is … let’s learn from them’ \(Sofía, LG, Manizales, S8b, p.4\). Civil servants recognised that the projects’ arts\-based approach generates ‘greater impact’: ‘as professionals, we assume when we go into the communities to build capacity that \[they\] have no knowledge of the topic … the \[projects\] … started from the premise that the communities do know, they just don’t know the technical language’ \(Anita, CRC, Cazucá, S8a, p.1\). Civil servants have started ‘building together’ with the communities and state that changing their methods has resulted in ‘more participation’ \(Sofía, LG, Manizales, S8b, pp. 4\-5\). A specialised professional from UNGRD stated that the national government aims to make these changes permanent: ‘we have to look for mechanisms to make these processes sustainable … that’s why at the UNGRD we’re trying to implement the Strategy for Community Resilience \[COMUNGERD\], which aims to recognise \[processes started via the project\]’ and ‘seeks to recognise processes, give them visibility and integrate them into a network so that \[the project work\] continues’ \(S6a\). 

 **Media reporting that has raised awareness more generally**. Government support for the project stated in a newspaper article reporting on community arts presentations, 3 October 2018. Translated extract: ‘\[Through the arts activities\] The government and municipality of Pereira want to approach all communities about the mitigation of risk … to get to know them, to reach out to them … this allows … a means of promoting equality, inclusivity and respect for the other within an increasingly diverse society. Activities of this type allow risk mitigation throughout the length and breadth of the municipality. On this occasion \[Indigenous communities performed\], and through these processes the strategy will grow and expand to more communities and will keep reaching for the objective of guaranteeing safety and saving lives’ \(S9\). 

 **Impact on teaching and scholarship**. The Psychosocial Institute for Disaster Risk Management at the Universidad de Manizales, Colombia, is incorporating our arts\-based methodologies in the institute’s post\-graduate courses. The director of the institute states ‘Without doubt, these … projects allow the strengthening of the scientific community in the area of education’ \(S10\).

 Our leading edge research has triggered a step change in the sphere of cyberstalking. We have designed innovative digital platforms that successfully identify cases of cyber harassment and perpetrators, including developing the first app to log evidence from victims. Our influential work has led to a change in the law, new national guidelines for police forces across the UK and the rollout of a national programme of awareness training for frontline staff. Our pioneering research has achieved further impact by freeing up police time \(through the introduction of automated processes\), boosting public safety and extending public access to the criminal justice system.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The aim of our research is to identify the impact of online abuse on victims, to understand attitudes associated with those examples of abuse and to design effective, preventative measures. Key features include: 

-  A national survey of all police officers working as a single point of contact \(SPOC\) for reported incidents of stalking and harassment led by the University of Bedfordshire’s Dr Emma Short, to gain a broader understanding of the scope of managing cyberstalking incidents. The survey was undertaken with SPOCs in each police region and interviews were constructed with victims of cybercrime drawn from our previous work with case analysis. The survey was completed by 36 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Responses identified training needs and the importance of a clearer definition of the SPOC role. Victims also reported a lack of support from authorities and a misunderstanding regarding the impact on victims. These findings were instrumental in the development of an awareness training course for frontline staff working with victims of cyberstalking. The programme has been delivered to Paladin \- the National Stalking Advisory Service \- for the past three years \( **3.2 to 3.5**\) 

 Bedfordshire Cyber Awareness Programme \(BCAP\), led by Dr Emma Short, aimed to: 

-  Challenge anti\-social attitudes; 

-  Educate staff and students to differentiate acceptable and unacceptable online behaviours; 

-  Signpost support services; 

-  Offer guidance on how to take self\-protective actions and make appropriate bystander interventions in online settings. 

 Evaluation of this course was conducted via pre\- and post\-intervention questionnaires and showed that 63% of individuals changed their opinion on their readiness/willingness to take action if they witnessed harmful online interactions \( **3.2**\) 

-  Cyberstalking identification from metadata, led by Dr Marc Conrad and Ingo Frommholz, was initiated with the creation of an Anti\-Cyberstalking Email System framework \(ACES\) to filter, detect and document email\-based cyberstalking. ACES comprises two major components: a detector that analyses an email’s header and content based on a supervised neural network, and a cyberstalker identifier that uses Principal Component Analysis to identify the author of the email. Results from these two modules were combined and weighted to flag an email as ‘legitimate’, ‘grey’ or ‘cyberstalking’. The approach and algorithm were then further enhanced and expanded to produce an Anti\-Cyberstalking Text\-based System \(ACTS\) \( **3.1**\) to include other text\-based media, such as chat messages, tweets, social media updates and instant messages. ACTS has an additional personalisation module that consists of rules defined by the user to link to the personal, individual situation of the victim. The findings from this research therefore provide digital investigators with reliable information to determine the integrity and value of a reported incident, and the identity of the perpetrator. They led to the development and production of CybHAPP \(Cyberharassment Mobile Application\) and DRASH \(Digital Risk Assessment of Stalking and Harassment\) systems.

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our innovative research has directly influenced UK domestic policy by contributing to a change in the law, shaping national guidelines for police forces, creating a nationwide programme of training for frontline police staff and significantly influencing society by boosting awareness of the impact and severity of cyberstalking. 

 **Contributing to UK law change** 

-  Our research on cyberstalking contributed to Harmful Online Communications: The Criminal Offences, Law Commissions, Consultation Paper, 11 September 2020, pp. 75, 79, 84, 85, 88 and 89. Our contribution is acknowledged on p 7 \( **5.1**\) 

-  Our presentation of ‘The Lived Experience of Cyberstalking’ to the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for Stalking and Harassment \( **5.2**\) allowed our research to contribute to the Stalking \(Sentencing\) Bill, passed in January 2017, as well as the briefing from The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, POSTNOTE Number 592 December 2018 Stalking and Harassment. 

-  We were invited by the Law Commission for consultation in 2017 and 2020 and contributed to the law review on online harm and revenge porn. 

 **Contributing to policies and procedures** 

-  The national SPOCs survey \( **5.3**\) led Chief Constable Paul Hill to circulate clear national guidelines to all police forces about the role, and a national training conference is now part of practice. 

-  CybHAPP \( **5.4**\) is thought to be the first mobile application available to log evidence from victims of cyber harassment. It has a range of potential impacts, including: 

    -  Increasing public confidence due to the encryption and data authentication processes applied to meta\-data submitted to police; 

    -  Freeing up police time due to automated and instantaneous transfer of cyber\-evidence; 

    -  Increasing clarity for the public in the reporting of cyber harassment; 

    -  Raising public safety and wellbeing; 

    -  Extending access to the criminal justice system by encouraging members of the public to report crimes. 

-  DRASH \( **5.4**\) will divert cases of low\-level offending away from the criminal justice system and avoid the unnecessary criminalisation of people on the fringes of criminal activity. This will ensure that formal justice processes are focused on relatively serious offences, allowing the police to resolve these cases more quickly and effectively. Measurable values and impact for the REF will be in the areas of: 

    -  Rapid identification of risk with appropriate interventions to address public protection needs; 

    -  Improved public confidence of decision\-making between the Police, the CPS and the Probation Service. 

 **Contributing to policy and guidance in HE sector** 

-  Our collaboration research with Universities UK \(UUK\) involved presenting and providing expert evidence for its AGM \( **5.5\-5.7**\). The collaboration also developed the BCAP training programme, which was piloted with the University of Bedfordshire. Evaluation was conducted via pre\- and post\-intervention questionnaires. Approximately 63% of \(n = 60\) respondents changed their opinion on their readiness/willingness to take action if they witnessed harmful online interactions. 

-  The responses showed a statistically significant \(rising from p= 0.0036 to p= 0.00074\) difference in the variance of answers to the questions about their willingness and readiness to take action if they witnessed a stranger suffering a harmful online interaction. These findings were distributed widely across the HE sector and led to the co\-authorship of the national policy guidelines, ‘Changing the Culture Tackling Online Harassment and promoting Online Welfare’ \( **5.10**\). 

 **Public awareness** 

-  National Stalking Awareness Week 2019 featured our work on the health impacts of stalking and made recommendations to the health sector about appropriate referral and support for traumatised victims of cyberstalking \( **5.8**\). 

-  Home Office social media platforms circulated a short video about cyberstalking awareness in 2020 \( **5.9**\), based on our findings. 

-  The cyber awareness course will offer improved resource allocation within the service and allow increased public access to the criminal justice system. Impacts include: 

    -  Changing attitudes of offenders, thereby reducing the likelihood of reoffending; 

    -  Restoration for victims, providing assurance that perpetrators understand their actions online and the harm and distress it can cause to others; 

    -  Reducing police officers’ current caseload of low\-level offences to enable resources to be re\-allocated to more serious public concerns;

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 There is a lack of research focussing on the lived experiences of people with dementia, their friends and their families. By exploring this through research, and subsequently through iteratively co\-produced theatre and film productions based on the findings, researchers from Northumbria University have exposed the need to become ‘ready for ageing’ and highlighted challenges to, and opportunities for, this within local communities. Public and professional audience members provided a knowledge exchange of their experiences of dementia and subsequently of later life housing needs. This informed and enriched future theatre and film iterations and improved public and professional understanding. The work has led to 1\) improved health promotion strategies of public health bodies and local authorities; 2\) the adoption of new engagement initiatives and policies by housing providers; and 3\) the creation of a network of 34 dementia\-friendly organisations. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dementia is a degenerative disease, characterised by a decline in memory and cognitive skills, affecting around 850,000 people in the UK. Alzheimer’s Research UK predicts that the number of people living with dementia in the North East will rise to 40,000 in 2021. Building on prior research into older people’s perceptions of everyday risks and taken\-for\-granted activities that shape their interaction with community life \(Bailey et al. 2011, *Ageing & Society*\), Northumbria researchers identified an absence of lived experience studies of people with dementia and their support networks \[ **R1**\]. Bailey and colleagues \(including PI Prof Charlotte Clarke, who left Northumbria in 2011 but remained a collaborator on the project\) undertook NHS\-funded research \[ **G1**\] to uncover the experiences of people with dementia and communicate these to public and professional audiences. A critical review of the research literature and policy documents underpinned an in\-depth qualitative study investigating the changed perceptions of risk and resilience for people living with dementia and their support networks \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Northumbria’s approach expanded how lived experience was defined by considering how people living with dementia includes not just the individual with the disease, but their support network, and how this has implications for the community around them \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. This new approach then informed research into diverse lived experiences of home and community in later life \[ **R3**, **R4**\]. 

 Between 2011 and 2013, Bailey and colleagues’ research demonstrated that although there was a will among researchers and policy makers to develop positive responses to dementia, the absence of accessible channels for people living with dementia to give voice to their experiences limited these responses to narratives of vulnerability and protection, rather than empowerment and enablement \[ **R2**\]. In addition, Bailey and colleagues determined that top\-down policy responses alone do not have the nuance and flexibility to meet the complex and diverse needs of people living with dementia. Meaningful change requires disrupting the perception of managing dementia as being down to individual capability or family responsibility \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. If people with dementia and their families are to be independent from ties of caring obligation and involved in social life, then their communities must become ‘ready for ageing’ in ways that see dementia\-friendly and enabling practices as a community responsibility, supported by well\-funded, local initiatives \[ **R2**\]. An understanding of local context, and the physical and infrastructural challenges and opportunities within local communities, is offered by having the lived experiences of people with dementia, and their families and friends, communicated in powerful and effecting ways \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 As a result of this new understanding, and to tackle these challenges, Bailey and colleagues, worked with Skimstone Arts \(a company that creates collaborative theatre to reflect challenges in society\) to develop a creative participatory approach to give voice to the experiences of people living with dementia through theatre and film productions. The findings of the original 2011\-2013 NHS\-funded research \[ **R2**\] were used to create a fictionalised theatre production informed by the words and experiences of the study participants, called ‘Jack and Jill and the Red Post\-box’ \(hereafter *Jack & Jill;*  [https://www.skimstone.org.uk/jack\-jill\-and\-the](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skimstone.org.uk%2Fjack-jill-and-the&data=04%7C01%7Cmonique.lhussier%40northumbria.ac.uk%7Ce569a246b0284767944308d8d9aa3adc%7Ce757cfdd1f354457af8f7c9c6b1437e3%7C0%7C0%7C637498672442099095%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=BruUo%2BGWrr8IxaBpT41Ouk13f8owjK6XYF5EPj8RaVE%3D&reserved=0)\). This method formed the basis of a subsequent project led by Bailey with Skimstone Arts and new partners – the Elders Council Newcastle \(ECoN\) and Care and Repair England \(CRE\) – exploring diverse lived experiences of home and community in later life and how the physical environment can improve physical safety and enhance socialisation and wellbeing \[ **R3**\]. This research led to the creation of a new theatre production and film entitled *Doorbells of Delight* \(hereafter *Doorbells*\) \[ **R4**\]. 

 Knowledge exchange between researchers and the audiences of *Jack & Jill* and *Doorbells* while exploring and developing the performances demonstrated that these creative productions communicated the nuanced and complex needs of people living with dementia. The process identified those with unmet housing needs in powerful, emotive ways that expanded public and professional awareness and changed perceptions of the potential of community\-responsiveness in ways that medical\-based information did not \[ **R2**\- **R4**\]. Facilitated audience feedback informed and helped re\-shape future productions, including solo performances. These drew on the facilitated discussion of audience members’ reflections on their own experiences, creating a dynamic and iterative research process emphasising the biography of the person living with dementia and giving greater voice to family members and to diverse lived experiences of home and community in later life \[ **R3**, **R4**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Between August 2013\-2017, over twenty\-five performances of three iterations of *Jack & Jill* were given across the North East and nationally, including Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the Economic Social Research Council Social Science Festival, to over 1,500 participants including those living with dementia, carers, practitioners, policymakers and service providers \[ **E1**, p29\-31, p51\-56\]. A film was also made freely available. Similarly, between 2014 and 2020 three iterations of *Doorbells* toured nationally, the film version premiered in 2018 and a COVID\-19 film short was produced in 2020. These performances have: 1\) raised public and professional dementia\-awareness, leading to changes in health promotion in Scottish Palliative Care and Stockton\-on\-Tees public health directorate; 2\) led housing providers in England and older person advocacy groups to change their engagement strategies with older people, and 3\) shaped the action plan and subsequent development of a new community dementia network of 34 local organisations in Newcastle, leading to new dementia\-friendly practices and policies to create a more inclusive and enabling community environment for people living with dementia. 

 **4.1 Increasing public and practitioner understanding of the lived experiences of dementia** 

 Post\-performance discussions and feedback revealed that audience members found *Jack & Jill* to be a powerful, poignant experience that changed their perceptions of dementia in the community \[ **E2**, p10\-16\]. Comments not only highlighted the emotional nature of the work, with some noting they were ‘ *emotionally wrung out*’ or ‘ *completely overwhelm\[ed\]*’, but also demonstrated that individuals living with, or caring for, someone with dementia found the performance to be reflective of their experience and thus comforting. One individual noted *‘\[it was\]* *a relief to see your work and to hear others in the audience. I used to think this was only happening in our house*’ \[ **E2**, p10\]. 

 Persuaded by the power of the performance and its ability to increase public awareness of and response to dementia, public health bodies and local authorities commissioned *Jack & Jill* performances in order to improve their public health outreach and awareness raising strategies regarding dementia. Following one commission by Stockton\-on\-Tees Borough Council, Peter Kelly, Director of Public Health North East, noted that he would formerly have been ‘ *giving a presentation, probably with PowerPoint slides perhaps even alongside a local carer talking about their personal experience and a local GP or mental health professional giving their perspective and insight. What a mistake that would have been\!*’ \[ **E3**, p1\]. Kelly explained how he would pursue ways to use ‘ *the subject matter and also on other opportunities to use this, and other, forms of art in my work’* \[ **E3**, p1\]. 

 This work included cooperation with Dementia Friendly Stockton, a community organisation working with local people and businesses to raise awareness about dementia. Gayle Tweed, the CEO, working with the local council commissioned a performance of *Jack & Jill* in 2014 to support ‘ *businesses and organisations in each town to take low cost, easily achievable steps*’ to become dementia friendly \[ **E4**\]. Notable successes include securing ‘ *funding to upgrade their large day centre to become more dementia friendly*’ and the creation of the LiveWell Dementia Hub, a ’one stop shop’ for people living with dementia and their carers to receive dementia advice from trained professionals and memory specialists \[ **E4**\]. She concluded that the performances had ‘ *contributed to ensuring people have a better appreciation of the disease so the day\-to\-day challenges faced by families affected by dementia are made that little bit easier’* \[ **E4**\]. 

 Mark Hazelwood, Chief Executive of Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care, saw the performance in 2014 and spoke of its powerful effect on him, confirming in 2020 that it gave him insights into dementia as a condition as well as showing the value of theatre in terms of public engagement, awareness raising and education: *‘Jack & Jill was really outstanding in its ability to convey powerfully something of the personal experience of dementia in a way which policy reports and even documentary films simply cannot*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.2 Improving later life housing policy in the North East and across England** 

 Northumbria’s creative co\-productions have been effective in guiding dementia\-aware policies with housing providers in England. In 2014, North Tyneside Homes convened dementia\-friendly sessions with both Skimstone Arts and Northumbria staff. Linda Herman, North Tyneside Living Service Manager, confirms that *Jack & Jill* changed her ‘ *awareness of the implications of dementia*’ for both those living with it and the families, and: 

 *‘North Tyneside Living Service has now become an enabling service that is proactive and focused on assisting older people and those living with Dementia… \[a\]ll Local Authority Sheltered Housing Schemes in North Tyneside have now become Dementia Friendly Communities through the joint work with our University Colleagues \[* … *and\]* *support \[for\] Housing Officers has been introduced providing them with information and skills needed for them to carry out information sessions with tenants, families, friends, local shops and business’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 This work continued with ECoN, an advocacy and policy group funded by Newcastle City Council and Newcastle’s Clinical Commissioning Groups to place older persons’ issues and views at the heart of local policy. Inspired by attending a *Jack & Jill* performance in 2014, ECoN began using creative arts to deliver public engagement events and develop policy \[ **E7**\]. As Barbara Douglas, Executive Officer of ECoN, explains, ‘ *our engagement with using the arts \(in particular drama\) stems from our participation as audience in the inaugural performance of “Jack and Jill and the Red Postbox*”’ \[ **E7**\]. In 2014, ECoN acted on this to ‘ *develop a new project around later life housing decisions… using the engagement with the arts at its core*’ \[ **E7**\]. This new method was ‘ *the missing piece of the jigsaw*’ in their engagement and policy development approach and led to them commissioning participatory creative workshops through which older people were able to share their experiences, and to support two artist residencies working with older people’s health concerns and communication skills \[ **E7**\]. This led to ECoN’s participation in *Doorbells*, which is already having an impact at a strategic level. Douglas explains, ‘ *this project activity is enabling the Elders Council to use the evidence we are gathering as the basis of discussions with Newcastle City Council and housing providers… to challenge the current housing offer and its appropriateness for an ageing demographic*’ \[ **E7**\]. 

 CRE, an independent charity operating nationally since 1986 to improve housing and related services for older people to live independently, have also directly benefitted from Northumbria’s performance\-led engagement method \[ **E8**\]. Sue Adams, Chief Executive Officer of CRE, says that the value of *Doorbells* was that it ‘ *set out to particularly engage with groups of people that may be left out of later life housing and ageing discussions, such as those ageing without children, living alone and/or having primary caring responsibilities, but then, interestingly, the production also attracted intergenerational* audiences’ \[ **E8**\]. As a result, working on *Doorbells* is ‘ *opening up a conversation with the Local Authority around their policies and thinking about housing for a diverse ageing population. A group of older people who have worked in the creative sector all their lives, hence have low pensions who were more likely to live in private rented sector \[PRS\] homes are now working with a Housing Association, and they are looking at sites where it might be possible to build an innovative, new later life community of older artists, many ageing without children’* \[ **E8**\]. 

 **4.3 Creating a more dementia\-friendly community by forming the Jesmond Dementia Action Alliance** 

 The research and co\-production\-driven insights of *Jack & Jill* inspired the Jesmond Dementia Action Alliance \(JDAA\) and shaped the development of the action plan for a Jesmond Dementia Friendly community and its subsequent expansion into a network of 34 local organisations and businesses committed to raising awareness and creating a dementia\-friendly environment \[ **E9**\]. Felicity Mendelson, Newcastle City Counsellor and Chair of the JDAA, explained, ‘ *seeing this performance and understanding its powerful impact on the audience was a catalyst for the group to formally work towards a Jesmond Dementia Friendly community*’ \[ **E9**, p1\]. This new Jesmond\-based franchise of a national organisation, the Dementia Action Alliance, used *‘audience feedback from the Jack and Jill performance to begin to form and agree \[an\] action plan*’ \[ **E9**, p1\]. Mendelson credits the performance as the basis for their operations by demonstrating ‘ *how we could reach out to individuals, organisations and business in the area to increase understanding of dementia and take positive steps/ action that enables people living with dementia to continue to be active and independent citizens*’ \[ **E9**, p1\]. Between 2015 and 2019, the JDAA have been able to support dementia friendly training for approximately 600 Jesmond residents and workforces located in the area, including retail, dental, health, leisure, solicitors, and other local services and businesses.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Significant increases in the efficiency and effectiveness of patient selection for randomised clinical trials have been achieved through the development and successful deployment of TrialViz, a Big Data analytic platform, on the largest Primary Care Electronic Healthcare Records \(EHR\) Database in the world, CPRD Gold. Underpinned by a breakthrough rapid search engine and innovative visualisation tools developed by the University of Sussex in collaboration with industrial partners Dataline and CPRD, TrialViz allows for an unprecedented near\-real\-time identification and visualisation of patient cohorts suitable for any given clinical trial. This reduces cohort identification time from 2\-3 weeks to 1\-6 minutes, resulting in significantly reduced costs, greater efficiency in clinical trial recruitment and improved patient outcomes. 

 TrialViz is now a core component of the IQVIA E360™ Cohort Builder. As of January 2021, E360™ had over 600 million unique recorded patient journeys with over 150 billion medical events across nearly 30 distinct datasets, with numbers growing rapidly. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Randomised Clinical Trials \(RCTs\) are one of the key elements of the drug discovery and adoption process. Prior to this research project, the routine procedure for RCT\-suitable cohort identification was time\-consuming and often a semi\-manual process, carried out by highly\-trained clinical professionals in order to satisfy multiple and complex inclusion / exclusion criteria matching a particular study protocol. According to research collaborator Tim Williams, Head of Interventional Research at CPRD, 50% of clinical trials were failing to recruit to time, resulting in significant cost implications and delays **\[S6\].** 

 In 2010, Beloff and colleagues in the Department of Informatics at Sussex \(INF Sussex\) proposed to combine their academic expertise in Big Data analytics and Data Quality assessment with the skills of industrial software developers from Dataline Software Ltd \(Dataline\), and Electronic Healthcare Records experts / commercial data providers from Clinical Practice Research Datalink UK \(CPRD\), to investigate and address the need for a robust and efficient patient selection procedure for clinical trials. 

 This resulted in an Innovate UK\-funded project **\[G1\],** with the aim to develop a system \(now known as TrialViz\) for automatically generating RCT\-suitable cohorts, thus maximising the UK’s participation in international drug discovery efforts and speeding up the adoption process of newly available treatments. Research by INF Sussex in collaboration with project partners focused on three main themes: 

 **\(1\) Data abstraction / extraction:** the design of the complex protocols needed to create cohorts of patients that match all of the clinical trials’ multiple criteria. The key innovation was to leverage the high input/output speed of solid\-state drives to create an optimised SQL\-based query\-processing tool to operate on each of the 3 databases making up TrialViz. The optimization was based on a divide\-and\-execute approach, which, in conjunction with the database model and underlying architecture, reduced the search time by several orders of magnitude **\[R1\]**. Additional speed gains were obtained through judicious use of caches and the development of data quality procedures **\[R2, R3\]** that allowed for the timely elimination of possible errors in patient selection. Implemented using the emerging HADOOP framework, the resulting system allowed a fully automated search through over 6 million patient records in a matter of minutes, compared to the 2\-3 weeks required by the previously used semi\-manual procedures **\[S1, S6\].** The work published in **\[R1\]** was the basis of the patent by Dataline \(Patent Number: US\-9672268\-B2\), as stated on p. 295 \(penultimate paragraph\) of **\[R1\].** 

 **\(2\) Data visualisation**: A novel visualisation approach was pioneered based on an intuitive “card selection” interface, with special “card stacks” to help define inclusion/exclusion criteria \(fig. 2 from **\[R1\]** below\). This allowed for clear geographical representations of available patient cohorts, together with their density and suitability levels **.** In the words of Tim Williams, CPRD, the practical importance of such visualisation was “ground\-breaking” **\[S6\].** This same visualisation interface is still in use in the current IQVIA E360™ Cohort Builder **\[S2\].** 



 Figure 2 from **\[R1\]**: Stack and card interface showing the results of a search. 

 **\(3\) User testing**. Extensive user\-testing sessions for the TrialViz prototype were designed and run with end\-user focus groups comprising key stakeholders: \(i\) pharmaceutical industry representatives from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKleine, and Novo Nordisk, \(ii\) Primary Care Research Network representatives \(iii\) General Practitioners as primary generators of Electronic Health Records and as the first contacts for patient recruitment for clinical trials, and \(iv\) patient interest groups **\[R1\-R3\].** 

 Finally, INF Sussex was instrumental in garnering peer\-review recognition in this highly competitive field **\[R1\-R5\],** stipulating the technical innovation of TrialViz in algorithmic search and in visualisation mechanisms, as well as demonstrating its applicability in a number of settings for RCTs and epidemiological studies.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **1. Improved efficiency of patient identification in Randomised Clinical Trials worldwide** 

 Following the success of the TrialViz prototype, significant subsequent funding from CPRD was obtained by INF Sussex to continue its development **\[G2\-G4\]**. Tim Williams \(CPRD\) emphasises that the immediate success and potential of the prototype delivered by the INF Sussex\-Dataline\-CPRD collaboration was self\-evident, and explicitly recognises the importance of the contributions by INF Sussex within this collaborative effort: 

 ”Whilst the implementation of the technology was being undertaken by Dataline, a lot of the innovative thinking and the ideas behind this were being generated through Natasha \[Beloff, INF Sussex\] who has a good understanding and capability in data management and is familiar with CPRD data … along with Adrian Bleach who was also keen on innovation, I would say that together they brought about the technological innovation which led to the success of the project.” **\[S6\]** 

 TrialViz became a core component of the patient cohort selection process for RCTs in the IQVIA E360™ Cohort Builder **\[S1\-S2\].** This happened in two stages; firstly in 2013 through the acquisition of Dataline by IMS Health Holdings Inc. \(a multinational US company specialising in providing and analysing medical data from many different countries including France, Germany, UK and the USA\), and secondly in 2016 with the merger of IMS Health with Quintiles, forming IQVIA \(a leading global company, providing information, services and technology for the healthcare industry worldwide\) **\[S1\]**. Importantly, the same basic algorithm and architecture from the original prototype are still being used by the E360™ Cohort Builder to deploy and research multi\-national datasets, accommodating a variety of coding systems whilst still fulfilling the promise of near real\-time performance **\[S6, S1\].** Through E360™, the impact of the INF Sussex\-industry collaboration has achieved global reach. It supports multiple geographies \(including Europe, America, Canada and Australia\) and allows research and pharmaceutical organisations access to the world’s largest single source of pseudo\-anonymised longitudinal medical records, claims and registry data in a single accessible application. According to Joss Wickson \(Senior Principal, Technology\) at IQVIA, at time of writing \(January 2021\), “E360™ has over 600 million unique recorded patient journeys with over 150 billion medical events across nearly 50 distinct datasets, and this number is growing rapidly” **\[S1\-S5\].** Commenting on the significance of the E360™ suite for IQVIA, he states: 

 “The positive impact to IQVIA’s internal research teams is overwhelming, it has cut patient population identification for Recruitment, HEOR, Commercial, R&D and Data science teams from weeks to hours, saving hundreds of millions of pounds. External use of the tools has grown rapidly amongst the major pharmaceuticals and the tools have found a market in government organisation use with the FDA, CDC, MHRA and EMA all active members of the user base. 26 research and pharmaceutical organisations globally use the platform, and this number is steadily growing” **\[S1\].** 

 **2. Building up** **capability for** **pragmatic epidemiological studies in CPRD ** 

 The project also had a significant impact on CPRD by prompting and enabling new uses for the UK medical data it holds as part of the UK Department for Health. Previously, CPRD data were used solely for observational studies and not for feasibility in clinical trials. The development of Trialviz prompted new directions for CPRD: 

 “TrialViz as a tool was essentially a ‘first in class’ development. Subsequent development and work around it has enabled CPRD to run data enabled clinical trials within a Primary Care setting …the work undertaken was original and it set a precedent in terms of use of this data in clinical trials…the groundswell of understanding that this is the way forward for clinical trials is very much in the wake of Trivalviz’s success” **\[S6\]**. 

 The TrialViz research project enabled CPRD to build its capacity for conducting pragmatic epidemiological studies i.e. using existing Primary Care patient records rather than RCT setups. Because CPRD retained a licence to use Trialviz within the NHS for UK\-based data sets, they have been able to run longitudinal epidemiological studies in realistic settings **\[S6\]**. 

 Another direct benefit from the Trialviz research project has been the development of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink \(CPRD\) Assisted Patient Recruitment tool \(as part of the UK Government’s  [Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway \(ILAP\) for medicines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/innovative-licensing-and-access-pathway-ilap-for-medicines), launched December 2020\) **\[S7\]**. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency promotes the tool as a “fast, targeted and efficient approach to patient recruitment across the UK”, attesting that the “quality of CPRD’s data is globally renown\[ed\] and is used extensively by industry, regulators and academia worldwide” **\[S7\].** Williams confirms that “this capability is predicated upon use of the CPRD primary care EHRs for clinical trial feasibility which directly relates to the project we did with Natasha several years ago” **\[S6\].** 

 In his assessment of the significance of the TrialViz research project, Tim Williams, CPRD, stated: “the tool itself is a number of years old and enhanced and revised versions are now in place as part of the clinical trial capability but there is a direct link back to the TrialViz research project.  From an academic perspective I see the work we did as an original and innovative piece of research with real world application” **\[S6\]**. Indeed, the Trialviz project has had both national and international impact through the deployment of E360™ and its legacy continues through innovation and development initiatives within CPRD that are directly inspired by it.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Manchester \(UoM\) research has led to fundamental treatment changes in Hodgkin lymphoma \(HL\): 

-  Individualising treatment, leading to fewer treatment\-related second cancers and less heart disease for early stage HL patients, and less lung damage in advanced HL. 

-  Changing clinical guidelines on radiotherapy treatment, reducing dose and field size, decreasing patient risk. 

-  Introduction of Brentuximab Vedotin in Europe and US for advanced HL, the first new treatment option and change to clinical practice in over 40 years. 

-  Creation of national Breast Screening after Radiotherapy \(BARD\) dataset, which identifies women at risk of radiotherapy\-induced breast cancer following HL treatment, and its introduction into Public Health England policy. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

##  Context 

 Hodgkin Lymphoma \(HL\), typically a young adult disease, is usually curable. However, undesirable late treatment consequences \(second cancers, lung and heart disease\) are a major cause of future illness and premature death. UoM research has focused on maximising cure and minimising negative treatment impacts as follows: 

###  1. PET Imaging Research 

 From 2003 to 2010, the UK RAPID trial for patients with early stage HL designed and led by Radford, performed positron emission tomography \(PET\) scans after 3 chemotherapy cycles. PET\-negative patients were randomly allocated to “no further treatment” or “standard radiotherapy”. 3\-year, disease\-free survival was similar in both groups, showing that the 70% of patients who become PET\-negative after chemotherapy could be spared the risks of radiotherapy\-induced second cancers and heart disease \[1\]. 

 The international phase III RATHL trial \(2008 to 2012\) in advanced stage HL \(Radford senior Trial Management Group member\) showed that for the 75% of patients with a “negative” PET scan after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, Bleomycin could be dropped from subsequent cycles without any reduction in survival rates. This reduced Bleomycin exposure by approximately 66%, minimising Bleomycin\-related lung damage \[2\]. Together, RAPID and RATHL confirmed the value of PET\-adapted therapy in HL treatment, and identified the UK as international leader in this field. 

###  2. Reducing radiotherapy fields 

 Radiotherapy is an important component of curative lymphoma treatment. Late side\-effects \(e.g. second cancers\) result in premature death. Illidge, with members of the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group \(ILROG\), contributed to modernising radiotherapy by defining smaller yet still effective radiation fields \(Involved Field, then Involved Site Radiotherapy\), reducing late radiation toxicity. Smaller radiotherapy volumes are now administered in fewer fractions and doses are better shaped to the tumour resulting in reduced side\-effects and improved patient outcomes \[3\]. 

###  3. Brentuximab Vedotin \(BV\): Evaluating an effective new drug for HL 

 In 2010\-11, an investigator\-led study initiated by Radford showed that BV was effective in patients with recurrent HL \[4\] \(overall response rate 72%, complete response rate 17%\). Results showed BV could provide a bridge to allogeneic transplantation in 25% of patients unresponsive to other treatments \[4\]. Subsequently, from 2012 to 2016, the ECHELON\-1 trial \(Radford chief investigator outside North America\) compared chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus BV in untreated advanced HL \[5\]. The addition of BV improved the proportion of patients alive and disease\-free at two years. Two year modified progression free survival with treatment was 82.1%, a 4.9% lower risk of progression, death or non\-complete response at 2 years \[5\]. \( *NB 5\-year results presented to American Society of Hematology \(December 2020\) confirm BV efficacy with improved disease\-free survival p=0.002 over chemotherapy alone, with the same low rate of secondary malignancies and no impact on successful pregnancies/births*.\) 

###  4. Establishment of national Breast screening after Radiotherapy Dataset \(BARD\) 

 Women who receive chest radiotherapy for HL under age 36 run a one\-in\-seven chance of developing breast cancer and national breast screening guidelines are in place to facilitate its early detection. UoM research showed that this screening detects breast cancer at an early and highly curable stage, but population take\-up was poor and many women missed opportunities for curative treatment \[6\]. The UoM established the Breast Screening after Radiotherapy Dataset \(BARD\), a national English database of 6,500 women at high risk of breast cancer after radiotherapy below age 36, and devised a mechanism for timely screening using Cancer Registry and Radiotherapy Centre data, without the need for individual referrals by their oncologist or GP.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Approximately 2,100 people, mostly young adults, develop HL annually in the UK. Long\-term chemotherapy and radiotherapy toxicities causing ill health and premature death are of particular concern. A more individualised approach to treatment maximises cure and minimises late treatment toxicities. 

###  Reduced risk of second cancers and heart disease for Early Stage HL 

 Previously, everyone with early stage HL received chemotherapy and radiotherapy and was at risk of radiotherapy\-induced second cancers and heart disease.  As a result of UoM research \(RAPID\), the European Society for Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) guidelines now state that for Early Stage HL, radiotherapy may be omitted following an interim PET scan for “ *individual patients when the late risk of delivering RT* \(radiotherapy\) *is thought to outweigh the short\-term benefit of improved disease control*” \[A,1\]. 

 National Comprehensive Cancer Network<sup>®</sup> \(NCCN<sup>®</sup>\) is an alliance of 30 leading US cancer centres. There are >1,200,000 registered users of NCCN Guidelines<sup>®</sup> globally and they have been downloaded in >180 countries. NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines In Oncology \(NCCN Guidelines<sup>®</sup>\) for Hodgkin Lymphoma cite the RAPID trial and state interim PET scans “ *may also be useful to identify a subgroup of patients with early…stage disease that can be treated with chemotherapy alone*” \[B,1\]. 

###  Reduced risk of lung damage in Advanced Stage HL 

 Standard treatment for advanced HL includes Bleomycin, a drug causing lung damage and, in 1\-2%, death due to respiratory failure. The RATHL treatment approach \[2\] reduces Bleomycin exposure by 75%. For advanced HL treatment, NCCN Guidelines<sup>®</sup> now state, “ *If reduced exposure to Bleomycin is desired, the panel recommends omitting Bleomycin from ABVD \(chemotherapy\) per the RATHL trial*” \[B\]. 

###  Changing radiotherapy fields to reduce patient risk 

 
Illidge, with ILROG partners, led the introduction of smaller doses of radiotherapy given to smaller areas \(fields\) of the body. ILROG international guidelines \[3\] have profoundly affected clinical practice and changed radiotherapy delivery in lymphoma \(see illustration\). These changes \(now employed routinely in international HL treatment\) have fewer late consequences without a reduction in disease control. Their importance is demonstrated by adoption of involved\-site radiotherapy \(ISRT\) in clinical guidelines. NCCN Guidelines<sup>®</sup> confirm ISRT as an alternative to involved\-field radiotherapy \(IFRT\) *“in an effort to restrict the size of the RT fields and to further minimize the radiation exposure to adjacent uninvolved organs and the potential long term toxicities associate with radiation exposure*” \[B,3\] and states “ *ISRT is recommended as the appropriate field for Hodgkin Lymphoma*” \[B\]. European ESMO HL Clinical Guidelines recommend ISRT instead of IFRT after chemotherapy in limited and intermediate disease stages \[A,3\]. 

###  New drug treatment \- patient health benefits and impact on clinical guidance 

 For the 10\-15% of patients with recurrent and refractory HL, there were previously few therapeutic options and little prospect of cure. In 2016, Radford provided ‘real world’ evidence to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) committee from an analysis of Manchester patients: “ *8 of 25 patients eligible for allogeneic transplantation proceeded to transplant after BV alone and 5 \(20%\) are alive and disease\-free after a median follow\-up of 25.3 months”* \[Ci\]. In 2017, NICE recommended BV for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for recurrent HL after two previous therapies \[Cii\]. A Public Health England \(PHE\) report, based on a questionnaire created with input from Radford, formed part of NICE's review. The report assessed 219 ‘real life’ patients treated between 2013 and 2016: 36% who received BV to bridge to stem cell transplant were able to have the transplant without needing salvage chemotherapy \[Ciii\]. In June 2018, NICE recommended routine BV commissioning \[Civ,4\]. Takeda who market BV as Adcetris, estimate it is now prescribed to 190\-200 patients per year in the UK for this indication \[D\]. 

 In advanced HL, the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) approved first line BV treatment in combination with chemotherapy in March 2018, based on ECHELON\-1 \[E,5\]. The FDA said BV approval represented “ *an improvement in the initial treatment regimens of advanced HL that were introduced into clinical practice more than 40 years ago*” \[E\]. In February 2019, EMA approved this indication based on ECHELON\-1 \[F,5\]. Treatment with BV and chemotherapy is also recommended in NCCN Guidelines<sup>®</sup> for stage III\-IV disease \[B\]. 

###  Policy impact of new nationwide breast screening 

 Before BARD, screening of patients at high risk of breast cancer following radiotherapy for HL depended on individual patient referral. National guidelines existed but referrals were sporadic. Radford initiated and established BARD in collaboration with PHE to optimise screening and ensure those at risk were informed of screening options at the appropriate time. BARD has been implemented nationwide as a method of referral for women eligible for very high risk screening, and is included in PHE’s guidelines \[Gi\] and NHS service specifications for the Breast Screening programme 2019\-20 \[Gii\]. BARD’s impact was highlighted in PHE Cancer Blogs \[Hi\] and Cancer Stories \[Hii\], which Radford was asked to contribute to, as part of PHE public dissemination. At the BARD Launch Meeting in September 2018, PHE’s Director of Screening described BARD as, “ *the model for cancer surveillance in high risk populations*” \[I\] and recently confirmed “ *UK CMOs* \(Chief Medical Officers\) *are currently exploring policy making in relation to a broader range of screening programmes*” and confirmed Radford’s work on BARD “ *has been very useful to guide this new policy direction*” \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ulster research has driven legislative and societal transformation in relation to language in Northern Ireland \(NI\). First, experts at Ulster played a direct role in the transformation of legislation to recognise Irish language rights in NI, leading to the language occupying a central role in the development of the New Decade, New Approach programme for NI government. Second, our work has strengthened the profile of non\-indigenous minority languages in post\-conflict NI. Key impacts: 

  

 **I1**: Influencing government policy on language of indigenous communities. 

 **I2**: Driving the change of local council policies for minority languages. 

 **I3**: Enhancing community relations through language. 

 **I4**: Informing policy provision for Irish speakers. 

 **I5**: Enhancing understanding of the benefit of bilingualism to communities, policy makers, practitioners. 

 **I6**: Reducing the academic attainment gap of young multilingual speakers leading to their increased integration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Two strands exist within our research underpinning impact work in transforming views on languages in NI. 

  

 \(1\) *Language identities in post\-conflict NI: Official recognition and reconciliation* 

 Language is fundamentally connected to the politics and culture of a place. In Nl, people’s affiliations to the Irish language or Ulster\-Scots are often considered as markers of Irish or British identity respectively. This is challenging in the context of recent conflict and is vastly different from other UK indigenous language communities \(e.g. Scottish Gaelic and Welsh\). 

  

 Work by McDermott \( **R2, R3, R4**\) and Comer \( **R1**\) has explored these sensitivities in detail and found that the improvement of language legislation and recognition for indigenous linguistic culture in public services, while challenging, is crucial in advocating reconciliation and raising awareness. Drawing on the European legislative framework, McDermott situates minority language policy internationally, finding that the relationship between the ‘local’ and the ‘global’ is crucial in providing pathways to recognition \( **R3, R4**\). While local authorities/national governments are often viewed as responsible for implementing change, powerful impetus for improvement comes from international treaties, conventions and human rights organisations. Comer’s work \( **R1**\) furthers this ‘global’/‘local’ dynamic by identifying shortcomings in Irish language provision at public level in the light of international law. 

  

 \(2\) *The Benefits of Multilingualism: Supporting Speakers, Informing Policy Makers.* 

 A second theme in our research has been multilingualism for migrant populations. Folli, Sevdali, Kennedy and Rhys \( **R5, R6**\) demonstrated its substantial individual and societal benefits. Focusing on cases of transfer of linguistic features between the weak and dominant language of a multilingual child, they found that the weaker language can appear to affect the more dominant language in certain grammatical features in a predictable way. This indicates that innovative approaches are required to assist in supporting bilingual and/or multilingual ability. 

  

 Ulster’s sociological research by McDermott \( **R2, R3, R4**\) has involved scoping linguistic environments through statistics, policy analysis and ethnography and has evidenced the multilingual reality of Northern Ireland and shortcomings in education, health and cultural policy where multilingual abilities are often ignored. McDermott demonstrated that a promotion of language policy for migrants by authorities requires an understanding of how languages are used in different places, e.g., educational environment, public, home or recreational spaces \(such as museums and libraries\). 

  

 Ulster researchers’ work has found that migrants with higher levels of multilingual ability have higher socio\-economic status and higher social and cultural capital which brings huge benefit to speakers and society generally \( **R2**\). Simply put, migrant community language maintenance alongside dominant language acquisition is central to integration, individual wellbeing and access to services.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Historically, the topic of language generally, and of the minority languages \(Irish and Ulster\-Scots in particular\) is a vested one in Northern Ireland. Legacy left by the conflicts and by the social and political processes of the past \(e.g., The Troubles; the Good Friday Agreement\) can obstruct and hinder any constructive development of such issues with members of the general public, various communities, social groups and cultural organisations, as well as government stakeholders. Notwithstanding these social and cultural barriers, the Ulster team succeeded in achieving impact during the census period in the six key areas listed below. 

 **I1** *: Influencing government policy on language of indigenous communities* 

 The leading all\-Ireland democratic NGO for the Irish\-speaking community \(Conradh na Gaeilge\) has confirmed that Ulster research \( **R1\-4**\) has directly informed its strategic direction from 2013 to 2020, notably influencing the policy change adopted by the NI Assembly’s New Decade, New Approach programme for NI government. 

 *“The research and advocacy work of Comer has had a significant and vital impact on the establishment of the provisions for the Irish Language in the New Decade, New Approach deal*” \( **C8**\). It was instrumental in forming Conradh na Gaeilge’s *“advocacy policy in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and has ultimately led to significant policy changes at local government and national level”* \( **C1**\). Comer’s leadership of the Conradh na Gaeilge and input into the development of discussion documents and working papers led to: 

-  *“the creation of the post of an Irish Language Commissioner;* 

-  *the provision of the official recognition of the status of the Irish language in Northern Ireland;* 

-  *the repeal of the Administration of Justice \(Language\) Act \(Ireland\) 1737;* 

-  *the creation and implementation of best practice standards for the use of the Irish language by public authorities;* 

-  *the creation of an Irish Language translation hub;* 

-  *support for the Irish Language Broadcasting Fund \(ILBF\)”* \( **C1**\) 

  

 Active engagement with civic and political representatives led to public consultation with the following results: 13,000 responses \- the highest level of response from NI community on the issue of Irish language compared with other initiatives recording the public perception of the Irish Language in the past: 94% strongly in favour of the Irish language official status. Ulster researchers have continually advocated for best practice policy development collaborating with statutory bodies, government officials and elected Members of the NI Assembly \(Department of Culture, Department of Education, Minister for Culture, Minister for Finance, Minister for Education\). Following the NI Executive collapse in 2017 and its subsequent reformation as a result of the international treaty signed by two governments and major political parties in NI, concrete pathways for the establishment of Irish language legislation was realised. Ulster initiated effective brokerage of this major step forward in Irish language policy development. Brought forward by DCAL \(Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure; Department for Communities\) in 2015, the draft Irish Language Bill was developed in consultation with Comer between 2017 and 2020 \( **C8**\). 

 Mounting significant pressure on the NI government, and equally shifting the public opinion on the dependence between NI’s economic growth and the status of the language so that more positive thinking in relation to Irish was achieved, the support for the Irish Language Act and the establishment of the Irish Language Commissioner grew from 40% in 2016 to 51% in 2018 and was at 58% in 2020 \( **C5**\). Public opinion agreeing that support for the Irish language should be provided by the government shifted from 47% in 2015 to 48% in 2018 and grew to 54% in 2020 \( **C5**\). A similar shift in public opinion was registered in relation to bilingual signage, which was at 37% in 2017 and rose to 46% in 2020 \( **C5**\). 

 From January 2017 until the establishment of the New Decade, New Approach in January 2020, Comer led approximately 40 delegations from Conradh na Gaeilge to meet with the leadership of the main political parties in NI and the Republic of Ireland to present the case for Irish language legislation in Northern Ireland. These included presentations to the leadership of the DUP and First Minister \(27/04/2017\); the leadership of Sinn Féin and the Deputy First Minister, \(03/04/2017\); the UUP leadership \(10/08/2017\), the SDLP leadership \(06/04/2017\) and the Alliance Party leadership \(24/01/2018\). Comer also led representations to the Irish Government, with Irish Prime Minister \(Taoiseach\) \(25/06/2018, Dáil Éireann\) and Deputy Prime Minister \(Tanáiste\) \(12/12/2019\) and presented to successive British Secretaries of State \(01/02/2018 and 05/01/2019\) and to the Head of the Civil Service \(21/06/2018\) and especially on 20 Jan 2020 when the New Decade, New Approach government programme to restore the NI Executive was finalised between the UK and ROI governments. 

 In 2017 alone, Comer featured in 78 invited appearances in media outlets, including national newspapers \(among others, Irish Independent, 20/10; Irish Times 22/07; Belfast Telegraph 02/11\), radio programmes \(BBC News, 14/01, 03/03; Irish National broadcasters – RTÉ News 10/03 and Radió na Gaeltachta 03/03; 17/11\), blogs and podcasts. Comer’s research directly influenced the creation and the rolling out of the Irish Language Translation Hub which has been established within the NI Assembly as of 2021 and he has been appointed to form and lead an advisory group to establish linguistic standards within the NI Assembly. 

  

 **I2** *: Driving the change of local council policies for minority languages* 

 As a result of Comer and McDermott’s research \( **R1, R2, R3, R4**\) on connection between international law and local practice, we directly impacted on strengthening the rights of linguistic communities. This research informed key aspects of Conradh na Gaeilge’s successful legal challenge against Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council to remove its single language policy \( **C3**\). Legal firm KRW Law, representing Conradh na Gaelige, began judicial review proceedings following the Council’s introduction of a ban on bilingual street signs in 2018. The challenge was that the Council was discriminating on the grounds of religion, political opinion and cultural identity. KRW Law *“referred extensively”* \( **C3**\) to Comer’s report \( **R1**\) in preparation for the case. The result was that *“the Council had to rescind their planned implementation of a single language policy”* \( **C3**\). The solicitor involved in the case stated that **R1** is *“now considered as the main source of research into the legal framework and requirement of bilingual place\-naming policy in NI”* \( **C3**\). 

 **I3** *: Enhancing community relations through language* 

 Comer and McDermott have worked with language advocacy agencies to nurture positive attitudes toward Irish such as the Irish language cultural centre \(Cultúrlann Uí Chanáin Irish language cultural centre, Derry\) and the Irish language heritage project in East Belfast \(Turas\) \( **C4**\). Outreach events introduced political and community representatives from the Protestant/Unionist/Loyalist populations to our international research on language rights \( **R1\-R3**\). In 2017, Ulster led the community relations initiative entitled ‘Our Shared Language/Ár dTeanga Chomhroinnte’ funded by NI Executive Office \(Good Relations\) in collaboration with Conradh na Gaeilge \( **C1**\). Ulster researchers developed a handbook for the project which was disseminated to 1,000 participants, highlighting common areas of heritage \(topography, shared names, genealogical history\) and was adopted by 40 state schools not traditionally associated with the Irish language. 

 **I4** *: Informing policy provision for Irish speakers* 

 Ulster’s research **\(R3; R4\)** on policy for minority languages stipulates language planning on an all\-island basis, as established under the 1998 Belfast Agreement. Our research informed Government policy in the Republic of Ireland \(the Department of the Prime Minister and the Office of the President\). Seminars in the Gaeltacht \(native Irish\-speaking areas\) informed the government of the linguistic crisis in rural Ireland for Irish, and influenced budgetary announcements by the Irish government **\(C9\)**: e.g., the 2021 budget had the biggest year on year increase for funding for The Gaeltacht Authority \(Údarás na Gaeltachta, from EUR10,000,000 in 2020 year budget to EUR14,500,000 in 2021 year budget, announced 13.10.2020\) since its foundation and an increase of EUR1,300,000 in funding for Foras na Gaeilge and The Board of Ulster\-Scots for 2021 \(announced 13.10.2020\). 

 **I5** *: Enhancing understanding of the benefit of bilingualism to communities, policy makers, practitioners* 

 **R2** highlights the benefits of multilingualism to individuals, communities, speech and language therapists, policy makers and NGOs by normalizing the idea of multilingualism. This knowledge has been used to inform talks and workshops to local and EU as well as migrant non\-EU parents, including Black Asian Minority Ethnic refugee multilingual speakers, educators, speech and language therapists, and schoolchildren. The North West Migrants Forum \(NWMF\) Programmes Director stated that *“recommendations from this research have clearly resulted in positive change to the ways in which our members use their languages publicly, pass on their language to their children”* and has led to migrants *“… valuing their own language skills”*. NWMF designed *“several projects that promote minority languages in public spaces”* and developed its linguistic intervention plan based on McDermott’s recommendations regarding the provision of a sense of safety for multilingual speakers. It also played *“a key role in the development of the NWMF community hub which provided a much\-needed safe space for members and service users to meet and speak / teach their children their indigenous languages”*. McDermott’s **R2** was included in the Forum’s successful funding application to the National Lottery Community Fund for GBP500,000 to support social and linguistic and cultural needs of its members. NWMF developed a series of events and workshops based on **R2**, which has helped promote and sustain minority languages. *“Every year we witness members, young and old, building confidence in using their own languages at these events; a strong indication that they no longer feel the need to hide their languages for fear of discrimination”* \( **C7**\). 

 **I6** *: Reducing the academic attainment gap of young multilingual speakers leading to their increased integration* 

 Language Made Fun \(LMF\) was established in 2013 as a collaborative project between Barnardo’s NI Family Learning and Integration Project \(FLIP\) service and Ulster. It is a play\-based intervention to support the language development of multilingual migrant children in NI, for whom English is not their first language, while promoting the maintenance of their home language in a one\-to\-one setting \( **R6**\). The programme is part of a wider Big Lottery\-funded Family Learning Integration Hub which saw Ulster collaborate with Bernardo’s and Belfast Fane Street and Holy Rosary primary schools. These schools report record numbers of Newcomer pupils \(a pupil who has enrolled in a school but who does not have satisfactory language skills to participate fully in the school curriculum and does not have a language in common with the teacher\); Fane Street: 80% and Holy Rosary approx. 50%, and were enthusiastic to take part in a project that would be tailored to the needs of these children. LMF assisted migrant children \(their first languages ranging from Sudanese and Syrian Arabic, Romani and Hungarian, to Polish, Mandarin Chinese, Mexican Spanish and Farsi\) with their English language skills through play. LMF has assisted over 40 Newcomers in Northern Ireland. During the project, Ulster Centre of Multilingualism \(UCoM\) was asked to develop a group play\-based intervention, Language Together, to assist children who could not commit to the intensity of a one\-to\-one programme but needed urgent language support. Through Language Together, UCoM has assisted a further 30 pupils. The Barnardo’s LMF report \( **C2**\) shows that 22 children \(out of 35\) who took part in the quantitative analysis benefitted substantially from their participation. They improved their linguistic ability \(sentence structure, word structure, understanding and expressive vocabulary\), confirmed by their scores using standardised language assessment tools. Their overall confidence and participation in class activities equally improved as evidenced by the schools’ feedback. **C2** and **C6** confirm that other stakeholders \(teachers, vice\-principals, parents\) have also benefitted.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research on ancient Stoicism is improving the psychological wellbeing of individuals around the world. Dr John Sellars is a founding member of Modern Stoicism, a small group of academics and psychotherapists who run Stoic Week and associated public events, Stoicon and Stoicon\-x. Between 2017 and 2020, over 25,000 people from around the world participated in Stoic Week. Data from 3 years of detailed questionnaires completed before and after Stoic Week, report participants achieve, on average, a 14% reduction in negative emotions and a 13% increase in overall life satisfaction. Narrative feedback from the live events also reported a positive and sustained impact on attendees’ outlook. Dr Sellars has contributed to the wider public debate on wellbeing via print, broadcast media, and a popular book on Stoicism. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Stoic philosophy argues that an individual’s wellbeing depends solely their internal mental state and advocates the cultivation of a calm and rational character embodying the virtues of courage, justice, and moderation. The surviving texts of the Roman Stoics contain a variety of practical techniques designed to help achieve this. Sellars is an established expert on this topic. The research that underpins this case study builds upon earlier work dating back to his 2003 monograph *The Art of Living: The Stoics on the Nature and Function of Philosophy* and focuses on the practical aspects of Stoicism in the Hellenistic period \(R.3\) and in the later Roman Stoic authors \(R.1, R.2, R.6\). His work also engages critically with modern philosophers who have advocated a revival of ancient Stoic practices, such as Pierre Hadot \(R.4\) and Michel Foucault \(R.5\). 

 His recent work on Roman Stoicism has continued to focus both on the practical framework they employed and specific techniques they used, paying particular attention to Marcus Aurelius’ *Meditations* \(R.1, R.6\). It includes work on the ancient idea of ‘taking care of oneself’ that dates back to Socrates, the virtue of self\-control, and the role of written exercises in efforts at self\-transformation \(R.1\). The latter in particular has fed into the Stoic Week training programme. 

 Sellars has also highlighted the practical aspects of earlier, Athenian Stoicism as part of a wider study of Hellenistic philosophy \(R.3\). While many modern admirers of ancient Stoicism tend to focus on the practical exercises found in the writings of the Roman Stoics, neglecting their foundation in the ethical theory of the Athenian Stoics, Sellars has drawn out practical material from the earlier Stoics that is more explicitly integrated with wider Stoic ethical theory and might be useful for people today. One example is Antipater’s analogy between virtuous action and archery, where it is suggested that focus ought to be placed on performing as best as one can rather than fixating on outcomes. This has fed into his impact activities and a summary was published online for a wider audience at the Modern Stoicism website. 

 He has also undertaken a comparative study of Stoic attitudes of attention with modern mindfulness techniques inspired by Buddhism \(R.2\). Although popular discourse has often assumed a natural affinity between Stoicism and modern mindfulness, Sellars has shown that in fact their attitudes and approaches are quite different. Whereas modern mindfulness tends to focus on the benefits of letting go of unwanted thoughts, focusing attention instead on perceptual experience such as breathing, what Sellars has called ‘Stoic mindfulness’ advocates paying close and constant attention to key philosophical ideas, keeping them always ready to hand. This makes it quite different from modern mindfulness in terms of both its goal and its techniques. The aim is not merely to avoid negative rumination but, more importantly, to embed Stoic principles via repetition so that they can shape one’s everyday interactions with the world.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Can Stoic philosophy contribute to an individual’s mental wellbeing? Do the practical techniques aimed at achieving this reported by the Roman Stoics actually work? In the context of an ongoing mental health crisis, can Stoicism offer solutions to the demands and pressures of modern life? Through a series of activities, it has been shown that Stoicism does indeed improve mental health. 

 **4.1.** **Stoic Week.** 

 Sellars is one of the founding members \(and currently Chair\) of Modern Stoicism, an organization \(incorporated as a non\-profit company\) that runs Stoic Week, a global online training programme based on ideas and exercises drawn from ancient Stoic philosophy. It invites participants to ‘live like a Stoic for a week’ in order to test the claims of both ancient Stoics and modern admirers that Stoicism offers a therapy for mental disturbances and a guide to living well. First run in Autumn 2012, over the years 2017 to 2019, approximately 25,000 members of the public registered for Stoic Week from all over the world. In 2018, for instance, participants were from the USA \(37%\), UK \(22%\), Europe \(15%\), Canada \(8%\), Australia \(4%\), and elsewhere \(14%\) \(E1\). 

 Participants complete a set of online questionnaires at the beginning of the week to assess their subjective sense of wellbeing. Over the next seven days they follow a series of practices and exercises outlined in the Stoic Week Handbook, all drawn from ancient Stoic texts. These include analysing the value judgements behind one’s emotional responses to situations and reflecting on potential future adversities. At the end of the week, participants complete the same set of questionnaires in order to determine the impact of following Stoic life guidance. Sellars was the co\-author of the Stoic Week Handbook in 2013, collaborating with psychotherapist and author Donald Robertson. That version has been the basis for subsequent versions, which have undergone annual revisions by Sellars and other members of the Modern Stoicism team, enabling the most recent research to be incorporated. 

 The Stoic Week training programme drawing on Sellars’ research has directly affected participants’ subjective sense of wellbeing. Over the 2017 and 2018 iterations of Stoic Week approximately 1,500 participants completed a questionnaire \(a 25% completion rate\) and reported an average 14% reduction in negative emotions, an average 10% increase in positive emotions and an average 13% increase in life satisfaction after a single week of following the programme. These results were correlated with a 10% increase in Stoic attitudes \(E1, E2\). More specifically, after the particular training session undertaken on using Stoic exercises to enhance feelings of purpose and meaning, there was \(according to the ‘Diener Flourishing scale’ \(E2\)\) a remarkable 12\-point increase in feelings of purpose and meaning among users: one wrote, “It really helped me deal with my emotions in a healthy way, which is something I struggle with greatly”, and another remarked, “\[I am\] slightly awed about just how much has changed for me.” 

 A variety of groups have independently taken up Stoic Week resources, including groups in schools and prisons. Andrew Small, a Senior Officer at HM Prison Huntercombe, has used Stoic Week with inmates as part of their rehabilitation training. In his own words, “Four years ago we started teaching Stoic Philosophy to the men in our care. The results of our interventions have been remarkable. From the outset we have used materials created by Dr John Sellars. Prisoners at Huntercombe have taken part in Stoic Week and used the booklets as a daily meditation; there are many well\-read, dog\-eared copies in cells months after the event. The Gym at Huntercombe has a Stoic Philosophy Library; we have several copies of \[Sellars’ book\] *Lessons in Stoicism* which are continuously booked out to prisoners and staff” \(E3\) 

 The findings from Stoic Week have been confirmed by a longer, four\-week online course, Stoic Mindfulness and Resilience Training \(SMRT\). The latest iteration in May 2020, funded via Royal Holloway and attracting 5,017 participants, found a 12% increase in resilience, a 13% increase in flourishing, and a 15% increase in life satisfaction. 

 **4.2. Enhancing lives via Stoicon events.** 

 In conjunction with Stoic Week, Sellars has organized a number of parallel public events, enabling participants and other interested parties to discuss face\-to\-face the benefits of adopting Stoic life guidance. These events combined public talks and practical training sessions aimed at showing ways in which participants might embed Stoic principles into their daily lives. The largest of these was Stoicon, held in London in September 2018, attracting a sell\-out audience of approximately 350 people \(E5\). Two smaller events \(Stoicon\-x\) took place in October 2017 and October 2019, each attracting over 80 participants. With financial support from Royal Holloway, the talks from Stoicon 2018 were made freely available online via the Modern Stoicism YouTube channel \(14,300 subscribers\) and, to date, have been viewed over 29,000 times \(E4\). 

 The qualitative feedback from participants at these events makes clear the changes in individual well\-being that was brought about. Attendees reported the following changes in attitudes: “There’s a different way to view, live and behave in this world. And that I have more control over my life than I think”; “life can be improved by putting these ideas into practice”; “I want to rethink my strategies in life and be more courageous about some changes I want to make”; “\[I will\] work to make it part of my daily life and practice”; “I will endeavour to be more open\-minded and thoughtful on a daily basis”; “I will try to manage my anger better”; “I will try and practice more self\-reflection and try to avoid quick judgements”; “it will make me reflect more on the things I value and care about”; “trying to integrate Stoic ways of thinking into daily life”. Of participants who completed post\-event questionnaires, 94% reported that they would recommend Stoicism to others as useful life guidance \(E5\). 

 A follow\-up survey of participants at Stoicon 2018 undertaken nine months after the event demonstrated its ongoing impact. Respondents had by no means forgotten the event, still describing it as “fantastic”, “excellent”, “a great experience”, “inspirational”, “an invaluable experience”, and “extremely rewarding and informative”. One person commented that “Stocion 2018 has impacted my life profoundly”. Others reported that they “have tried to incorporate the principles into \[…\] day to day interactions with other people” and that “attending Stoicon 2018 has contributed to my \[…\] being able to apply it \[Stoicism\] to my daily life and improve my general well\-being”. In the wake of the event one respondent commented that encountering Stoicism via Stoicon 2018 “has been a life\-changing experience \[…\] It continues to be a source of daily inspiration”. Others reported specific benefits: “my contentment in life has increased substantially”; “I have found the methods have a calming effects when troubles arise”; “I am more able to accept areas that are not within my control and focus on those that I have influence over. As I supervise staff, I have been able to utilise this in work with colleagues and this has had evident benefits”. Another participant reported that they had “benefited greatly from Stoicon 2018” and were becoming “a convert to this mode of thinking”. The event had “encouraged me to research and read more on the topic and most importantly to take action” \(E5\). 

 **4.3. Informing Public Debate.** 

 Extensive media engagement has seen Sellars’ research reach an even wider audience, introducing readers and listeners to the psychological benefits of Stoicism. He has been interviewed by journalists for pieces in *The Daily Mail* \(14 January, 2019, circulation: *c*. 1,200,000\) and *The Daily Telegraph* \(20 March 2019, circulation: *c*. 363,000\) about the Stoic Week training programme, and its implementation led to a news article in *The Times* \(21 September 2018, circulation: *c*. 417,000\) \(E6\). It also featured in BBC Radio 4’s *‘*Hacking Happiness’ broadcast. He has also been interviewed for *The New Statesman*, the BBC World Service, the BBC Culture website, and the Norwegian newspaper *Dagens Naeringsliv* \(4 October 2019\) \(E6\). He has written a popular article, ‘Want to be happy? Then live like a Stoic for a week’, first commissioned by *The* Conversation and subsequently re\-published by *Newsweek*, *The Independent,* *Metro*, and *World Economic Forum*; to date it has been read over 350,000 times \(E7\). In 2019 Sellars published a short book with Penguin aimed at a wide audience, based on his research: *Lessons in Stoicism*. This sold 10,000 copies in the first nine months after publication. The book was reported in *The Daily Mail*, where it prompted a piece in Liz Jones’s Diary \(8 September 2019\), and was reviewed in *The Guardian, The Scotsman*, and London’s *Evening Standard* \(E8\). Foreign rights have been sold for North America, Greece, Italy, Spain, Russia, Poland, Taiwan, and Korea; the Greek and Korean editions are now published. He also spoke about the book and its themes at the Ilkley Literature Festival \(October 2019\). 

 As well as providing a pathway to impact, these media activities have also led to a change in practice among journalists working in the health and well\-being sector, who have not only made use of Sellars’ research findings but have also had their professional understanding of mindfulness changed considerably by them. For example, journalist Victoria Lambert, who interviewed Sellars for *The Daily Mail*, remarks that, on the basis of his findings, “I was immediately taken by the idea that we can use the wisdom of the ancient Greeks and Romans to help us live our lives with more meaning and peace”, and continues, “It was interesting to see that the online comments \[for the article\]—which are often meaningless or irrelevant to whatever is written—were supportive and interested.” In fact, she remarks that she found Sellars’ training programme “incredibly interesting and effective as a mindfulness tool personally”: she and her family “are still practising” the exercises \(E9\). 

 **4.4. Influencing Careers and leadership training.** 

 Sellars is also a founder member of The Aurelius Foundation, a collaboration between himself and a number of leading business figures who draw on Stoic ideas in their own business and personal lives. The aim of the foundation is to provide young adults \(target age group: 18 to 25\) with advice and guidance in their future careers based on Stoic principles. 

 The Aurelius Foundation’s inaugural public event took place in March 2020 and was attended by both senior business leaders and younger people working in the corporate sector. The talks were recorded and are feely available online at the Foundation’s website, including Sellars’ two\-hour keynote session. Unsolicited feedback received after the event was overwhelmingly positive: “I can quite honestly say it’s been life changing\!”; “It really has been an incredible day and for me I honestly think a turning point in my life”; “I don’t believe I would have heard of Stoicism if it weren’t for your foundation and now that I’ve had an introduction to it I’m looking forward to implementing it into my lifestyle”; “After listening to your speakers about how practically applicable it is to everyday life, I left ready to use those lessons both in my professional and personal lives. And I must admit, I already feel happier” \(E10\) Since then, during lockdown, Sellars has participated in two webinars run by the Foundation \(May 2020, July 2020\), discussing central ideas in Stoicism and their application today. These were recorded and are freely available online \(E10\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The on\-going energy frontier programme of the Large Hadron Collider \(LHC\), and the discovery of the Higgs boson in particular, have stimulated interest in physics on a scale unprecedented by any other single experiment. Since 2013, UCL physics researchers who participated in the discovery of the Higgs boson and the ATLAS experiment have contributed to media features, written articles, blog posts, public and school talks, panel discussions and published books on the topic. These efforts have reached millions of audiences worldwide \(including in the UK, US, China, France and Italy\) and have continued to spark interest in physics and improve public understanding of the nature and purpose of scientific research. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The ATLAS detector, one of two general\-purpose particle detectors at the CERN LHC, aims to understand electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass; in the Standard Model the Higgs boson is responsible for these phenomena. The LHC began physics operation in late 2009, and on 4 July 2012 the ATLAS collaboration announced the discovery of a new particle, since shown to be a Higgs boson and consistent with the Standard Model \( **R1**\). As a result, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the theorists, Englert and Higgs, in 2013. 

 The High Energy Physics \(HEP\) group, part of UCL’s Department of Physics & Astronomy, played a major role in the discovery of the Higgs boson. HEP researchers were involved in constructing ATLAS’s detector \( **R2**\). They built electronics for the data acquisition and trigger systems; wrote simulation, trigger and visualisation code for the experiment; and worked on the mechanical engineering of the Semiconductor Tracker \(an essential component of the detector\), including cable layout and thermal properties. Other major UCL research outputs contributing directly to the impact included the measurement of several key processes for the first time at the unprecedented LHC energies, including “minimum bias” collisions, high energy jet production and the production of electroweak bosons, \(for example \( **R3**\). As conveners of the ATLAS Standard Model group, several ATLAS subgroups, and lead authors on papers, developed a new way of finding Higgs bosons using the boost and jet substructure, overcoming the challenges of high backgrounds and high particle densities in this key channel \( **R4**\). This has since been essential to the observation of high momentum Higgs production \( **R5**\) and played a role in the first observation of the Higgs in the decay channel to bottom quarks \( **R6**\), all of which were UCL\-led publications. UCL also made major contributions to work on jet calibration and event simulation \(leading the subgroups responsible\), and aspects of the discovery analysis, including simulation. 

 Key UCL researchers responsible for this research were Jonathan Butterworth \(Professor, ATLAS UK PI 2007\-2009, ATLAS Standard Model Convener 2010\-2012\), Emily Nurse \(Lecturer and RS URF, convener of soft QCD subgroup 2010\), Mario Campanelli \(Lecturer, jet subgroup convener 2011\), Nikos Konstantinidis \(Professor, ATLAS UK PI 2016\-2019\), Tim  Scanlon \(Lecturer and Royal Society URF, leader of Higgs to bb analysis group\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 There is a clear appetite from the public for accessible information about cutting\-edge physics, which helps inform and raise the quality of public discourse around science and research in general; this is perhaps more obviously crucial now than ever before given the challenges we face. UCL contributions to the physics programme of the CERN Large Hadron Collider and related public engagement activities have both met and further stimulated this appetite. This research addresses fundamental questions about the nature of the universe via experiments, deploying advanced technology and engineering. It has led to improved understanding of particle physics concepts and, more widely, of the nature of scientific evidence among the public and pupils, which has changed attitudes, influenced public discourse, and encouraged uptake of opportunities in STEM, as evidenced below.

 Professor Butterworth’s *Life & Physics* blog began as a record of the research behind the Higgs boson discovery in an effort to present science and discoveries in a more accessible way. The blog was hosted by *The Guardian* website between August 2010 and August 2018. Subsequently, the blog moved onto Wordpress with associated articles on the Cosmic Shambles network, a platform for people who want to find out more about our universe through science, art, history, philosophy, music and literature. From August 2013 to December 2020, *Life & Physics* posts discussing UCL research have been published weekly attracting 3,700,000 unique visitors \(with peaks of approximately 20,000 per day\) from many countries, including the UK, USA, Germany, France and Australia \( **S1**\). 

 Readers acknowledged the value of the research on particle physics discussed on the blog and the technological advancement it led to: “The physics is important from a fundamental understanding of the nature of matter in our universe and the technological advances have been monumental in the collider and detectors structure”, one comment read, “It's knowledge for the sake of knowing things. I think that's worthwhile. In some ways it's what makes us human” \( **S2**\). Although the benefits of fundamental research on particle physics are not immediate, these blog posts improved readers’ understanding of particle physics and its potential: “Learning how to manipulate the Higgs field may also bring about technologies we can't even dream of today,” read one comment, while another said, “Explain why we need to prove Higgs boson exists as at all, why not just believe the theory and move on and start to take advantage of whatever it can be used for? If it has some uses, let’s start applying the science to develop the uses” \( **S2**\). Furthermore, UCL’s research described in the *Life & Physics* blog provided a resource for physics teachers to engage students with STEM subjects and led to changes in teaching practice. A secondary school teacher commented: “These posts \[on the *Life & Physics* blog\] were not only the perfect source for being up to date with new discoveries in particle physics, but also an inspiration and a great resource for teaching physics. Indeed, I have used Professor Butterworth’s articles during physics classes on many occasions” \( **S3**\). 

 Butterworth’s other public engagements with broadcast media in response to public interest included television and radio appearances where he discussed his underpinning research. These include Infinite Monkey Cage \(BBC4; 04/07/2017\), Today Programme \(04/01/2017, 16/01/2018, 27/03/2019\), BBC Inside Science \(03/09/2015, 29/04/2016, 17/05/2018, 21/06/2018, 28/06/2018\). Each episode of Infinite Monkey Cage featuring Butterworth gathered approximately 2,000,000 listeners and 400,000 podcast downloads \( **S4**\). 

 The large readership of the blog and the positive feedback evidenced a clear public interest in physics. Consequently, Butterworth wrote two books – *Smashing Physics* \(published on 7<sup>th</sup> May 2015\) and *A Map of the Invisible* \(published on 6<sup>th</sup> September 2018\) – that provided a systematic explanation of his research in particle physics to the public in an accessible way. *Smashing Physics* and *A Map of The Invisible* have been published in the UK, the US, China, Germany, Taiwan, France, Italy and Russia, with over 36,800 copies and 22,000 copies respectively sold \( **S5**\). The Royal Society acknowledged *Smashing Physics* for making *“*the most advanced science around seem within our grasp” and shortlisted it for the Winton Prize \( **S6**\). Reviews of *A Map of the Invisible* evidence improved understanding of particle physics concepts by its readers: “It \[ *A Map of the Invisible*\] has lots of information regarding particle physics put in a way that's easy to understand for anyone who is new to the field”, and “I've been teaching myself about the quantum world for two years and the analogies used in this book provided more than a handful of a\-ha moments” \( **S7**\). 

 Additionally, in response to demands from schools internationally for accessible content on physics research, ATLAS and TED created the animation lecture *What’s the smallest thing in the universe,* detailing Higgs research conducted at UCL and ATLAS *.* Between its publication on 18<sup>th</sup> November 2018 and 15<sup>th</sup> November 2020, the video reached a viewership of approximately 678,000 and received 904 comments. The animation increased viewers’ understanding of matter and fundamental particles and inspired them to learn more about the subject as evidenced by viewers’ comments: “I've always wondered what the particles that are smaller than subatomic particles were. I also really love how you can explain complex concepts in a really simple way that people can understand and that can be easily accessed,” one said. Another noted, “I have known about the elementary particles for years but this quick video just gave me more info about the interactions of the particles then I ever knew. Now it's time for more advanced vids” \( **S8**\). 

 <ins> **Inspiring</ins> <ins>public and</ins> <ins>school children</ins> <ins></ins><ins>through talks about</ins> <ins>particle physics**</ins> 

 Approximately 15,000 people attended talks at which Butterworth and his team discussed the Higgs and related research, including Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless/Curious People \(2017 and 2018\), End of the World Show \(2017\), New Scientist Live \(2018\), British Science Festival \(2018\), and Royal Institution public lecture \(2018\). Butterworth also took part in *Sceptics in the Pub* events between 2014 and 2019 \(9 events; 40\-50 participants each\), where the audience engaged in discussion of his research on the Higgs boson. The organisers for New Scientist Live \(2018\) highlighted the contribution from Butterworth to the event: “We had 40,000 attendees this year... and the Cosmos stage had 10,595 attendees over the course of the event\! \[…\] It was incredible to observe the festival come to life and watch visitors engage so fully with all the talks and exhibits. We want to thank you for taking the time to prepare and present a talk that was both engaging and informative” \( **S9**\). 

 Members of the UCL High Energy Physics group, including Professor Butterworth and his team, delivered at least 20 ATLAS\-related school talks since January 2015, reaching approximately 1,200 Year 9\-13 students in total. Students were interested and engaged in lectures that covered particle physics and aspects of researchers’ work as evidenced by a teacher’s testimonial: “Approximately 50 of them \[students\] from year 9\-13 attended the lecture that covered not only principles of physics and insights about the ATLAS experiments, but also aspects of the day\-to\-day life of a researcher. Students were very interested and engaged in the lecture as evidenced by a lively question session after the lecture and a positive feedback. This was an excellent preparation for our trip to LHC and an inspiration for our students. Out of the students in year 12 and 13 during that academic year \(2015\), 4 of them decided to read physics and 9 chose engineering at university” \( **S3**\). Another teacher confirmed that students found “the lecture of the professor as very informative and that \[the lecture\] had given them a better understanding of the particle word” \( **S10**\). Such engagement effort has contributed to an 66% upsurge of applications to UCL undergraduate Physics courses from the schools that Butterworth and his team have given talks to between 2012/2013 and 2019/2020.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The climate and biodiversity crisis shows that people’s relationships with nature are breaking down. Researchers at the University of Derby \(UoD\) have transformed the way people interact with nature to improve wellbeing and promote pro\-nature behaviour, by developing the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’, a behaviour change framework that focuses on experiencing rather than mastering nature. The National Trust, Wildlife Trust, European Forest Therapy Institute, and the New Zealand Government Department of Conservation \(DOC\) have all made improvements to their policy and practice by adopting the framework, which has improved the wellbeing of the public. The creation of the Nature Connection Index \(NCI\) allowed Natural England to gain a population measure of the UK’s relationship with nature. The United Nations \(UN\) reviewed the framework, and it has influenced the development of the UN’s post\-2020 Biodiversity Framework.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Nature Connectedness Research Group \(NCRG\) was established at UoD in 2013 and has produced over 30 peer\-reviewed journal articles and received over £300,000 in external research funding \[G3.1, G3.2\]. In 2018, Universities UK recognised their work as one of the UK’s best 100 breakthroughs for research impact. The group is led by M. Richardson, core researchers include D. Sheffield, R. Lumber and K. McEwan. The group conducts behavioural research including: 

 ● A multi\-study project \(2013–16\) on the development of the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’, has identified and operationalised five types of activity and relationships that improve people’s nature connectedness \[3.1\]. The foundational idea took Kellert’s nine values of biophillia from 1993 and identified those that improve nature connectedness through cross\-sectional research and final empirical testing. The pathways provide a unique framework for designing nature connectedness interventions, from visitor programming to green infrastructure design. 

 ● Development and evaluations of interventions to improve mental wellbeing and pro\-environmental behaviours by increasing nature connectedness. The research group worked with the Wildlife Trust to use the pathways in the design of the annual ‘30 Days Wild campaign’ \(2015–20\). Yearly evaluations have shown significant improvements in nature connection, health, happiness and conservation behaviours sustained for two months. An evaluation of 273 people who took part in the campaign identified specific groups within the population that benefitted most \[3.2\]. The clear rationale, theoretical basis, delivery, content and focus on defined outcomes, met criteria for public health interventions. 

 ● In 2016, a low\-cost intervention to improve nature connectedness was trialled with 92 participants; approximately half had to note three good things in nature every day \(intervention\) and were compared with the remainder who noted three factual things every day \(control\) \[3.3\]. The intervention group showed sustained and significant increases in nature connectedness compared to the control group. Increases in nature connectedness were associated with psychological health improvement in the intervention group. This research provided evidence that paying attention and noting the good things in nature each day can deliver sustained increases in people’s connection with nature. 

 ● An RCT \(n=582\) of a nature connectedness green prescription app \[3.4, G3.1\] based on noticing the good things in urban nature delivered clinically significant improvements in mental health. Providing everyday opportunities to improve wellbeing through engaging with urban nature using a brief, portable, widely accessible and cost\-effective smartphone app intervention is valuable new knowledge. 

 ● A key benefit of nature connectedness is pro\-nature behaviours. Although there are several measures of pro\-environmental behaviours \(broadly carbon/resource use\) related to climate warming, there were no psychometric scales to measure pro\-nature conservation behaviours \(broadly habitat creation or protection\) related to the crisis of biodiversity loss. Therefore, the NCRG developed the first scale to measure these behaviours \[3.5\] which subsequent research showed were increased by improved nature connectedness. 

 ● Psychometric scale development with the Nature Connection Index \(NCI\): a new population measure of nature connectedness developed for national statistical research \[3.6\]. To establish the reliability of the new Nature Connection Index \(NCI\) three factor analyses were conducted. One was based on a large Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment \(MENE\) dataset for adults \(n=3568\) with replication using datasets collected online \(n=553\), and a third used MENE data from children \(n=351\). MENE \(now called the People and Nature Survey\) was part of the UK’s national statistics and uses the robust protocols required when collecting data to inform policy. The results showed that the NCI was a reliable and valid scale for both children and adults, and they gave insights into the links between nature connectedness and pro\-nature behaviours.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Nature Connectedness is a recent psychological construct that benefits mental wellbeing and pro\-environmental behaviours. Researchers at UoD, led by Richardson, have discovered ways to improve nature connectedness that have changed the practices of UK \[5.1, 5.2, 5.3\] and European organisations \[5.4\] and the New Zealand government \[5.5\]. The research has also informed the implementation and evaluation of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ \(DEFRA’s\) 25 Year Environment Plan and Natural England’s 5\-year policy in the UK \[5.6, 5.7\]. It also influenced approaches to mental wellbeing in the UK and Europe \[5.8, 5.9\], and has been adopted by the UN \[5.10\]. 

 **Using the pathways framework to engage people, improve wellbeing and increase pro\-nature behaviours** 

 Research by Lumber *et al*. \[3.1\] identified the types of activity that led to improved nature connectedness in the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’. The Wildlife Trust used the pathways to design and organise the ‘Random Acts of Wildness’ activities as part of their innovative ‘30 Days Wild’ national programme \[5.1\] which has run from 2015 to the present. Evaluations evidenced sustained improvements in happiness, health, nature connectedness and pro\-environmental behaviours \[5.1\] and over one million people have taken part over 5 years \[5.1\]. The greatest impact was among people who began the programme with lower nature connectedness \[5.1\]. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Following the success of the Wildlife Trust’s campaign, in 2018, the National Trust asked Richardson to produce an internal report introducing the evidence base for the benefits of nature connectedness. This resulted in the organisation embedding NCRG pathways into their practice and strategic vision for outdoor experience programming, which was available to the National Trust’s 6 million members and 25 million visitors from 2018 \[5.2\]. The Trust organised a series of workshops with staff who were responsible for the visitor experience, facilitated by videos and guidance on the pathways by UoD. One part of this work was a refresh of the national campaign ‘50 things to do before you’re 11<sup>3/4</sup>’ launched in Spring 2019, which activated the pathways to nature connectedness amongst children. The pathways approach will also form the basis of the new Easter 2021 programming. 

 The new ‘50 Things’ campaign was implemented in at least 270 properties and led to a 405% increase in web traffic and engagement and has shown a positive impact on visitors’ nature connection as well as enrichment of the visitor experience overall \[5.2\]. A National Trust Project Manager remarked: <sup>“</sup> *The \[UoD\] research has really helped the National Trust find ways to encourage visitors to connect to nature and therefore our places in new and more meaningful ways. For the staff it has given a clear framework for how to shape activities to provide richer and more immersive experiences, transforming garden tours, ranger days, dawn chorus events, season long programs, national campaigns \(like ‘50 things’\) and everything else in\-between. For some this has been a considerable shift from a knowledge\-based approach to a more personal one, but many have adopted it with enthusiasm and the emerging results have been transformational. For visitors, the change in approach to these activities has helped them to see our places in a new way, develop much deeper appreciation and connection, and ultimately inspiring them to want to care for nature in a better way”* \[5.2\]. The National Trust Head of Insight remarked: “ *The work on Pathways, translated into practical guidance for our teams, has resulted in a transformation in how we design nature experiences, as well as our ‘on property programming…’*” It has been, “ *a positive cultural change*”. Furthermore, the approach: “… *had a dramatic impact into our wider communications…* \[We\] *…have translated the principles of the pathways into operational guidance, as well as a language guide on nature communications.*” Additionally, it: “… *significantly shifted the focus of our marketing and communications teams … inspiring creativity for our in\-house marketing teams to deliver a more profound and purpose\-led approach to engaging people with nature at a time of crisis. We took this further through a high\-profile TV advertising campaign, which again, founded on principles and evidence we established through our work with the team at Derby”* \[5.2\]. 

 More organisations across the UK are now using UoD research to inform their work, including: the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \(RSPB\), to inform their evaluation and engagement work \[5.3\] and their ‘nature prescription’ offer in Scotland \[5.3\]; the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust are using the Pathways as a guiding principle to establish the Trust as a fore\-runner in promoting nature connectedness \[5.3\]; and the Derby Museum, who experienced a 100% increase in exhibit dwell times after UoD research informed new exhibit design \[5.3\]. Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust are using the pathways research to inform organisational guidelines for visitor experience. The Durrell Director of Conservation Science stated: *“In 2017, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust launched its new 2018*– *2025 organisational strategy which put nature connection front and centre of what we do… The Pathways to Nature Connectedness research provides a really useful framework for reframing and designing many of the ways we interact with…people…The Pathways research feeds directly into a set of organisational guidelines”* \[5.3\]. 

 Internationally, the pathways form a key part of the ‘5x5’ Forest Bathing training provided by the European Forest Therapy Institute to influence the practice of 180 practitioners from 30 countries including Turkey, Ireland, UK, USA, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Spain, Portugal, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia and Costa Rica \[5.4\]. The pathways framework changed the practice of the New Zealand Department for Conservation \(DOC\) who collaborated with the UK National Trust and implemented their own version of the ‘50 things’ campaign \[5.5\]. In an emergency response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, the international charity, SOS Children’s Villages International \(SOS CVI\), used UoD’s ‘good things in nature’ intervention \[3.3, 3.4\] as part of the resources provided to improve the psychological health of their staff, children and community during the lockdown in Italy \[5.8\]. 

 **Influencing policy change in the UK and Internationally** 

 Research conducted by the NCRG has influenced a number of national and international policies for nature, environments and wellbeing. The NCRG worked closely with Natural England to inform the development and evaluation of DEFRA’s 25 Year Environment Plan \[5.6\], published in 2018, which included policy on ‘connecting people with the environment to improve health and wellbeing’. Richardson is an invited member of Natural England’s Strategic Research Committee leading projects such as the validation of the Nature Connections Index \(NCI\) \[3.6\], used for population survey work \[5.7\].  In 2020, nature connectedness was included in Natural England’s new online People and Nature Survey \(formerly the MENE Survey\), the world’s largest survey of people’s interaction with outdoor green spaces, using the UoD\-developed NCI measure \[5.7\]. The UoD\-developed Pro\-nature Conservation Behaviours Scale was also included \[3.5, 5.7\]. The results from this survey provided information on how COVID\-19 affected the population’s relationship with nature. The group’s research is also cited in the September 2019 DEFRA review of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Beauty and is the only research evidence cited in Natural England’s new 5\-year plan in relation to the aim to connect people with nature \[5.6\]. Nature connectedness now forms a key part of Natural England’s 5\-year plan and is one of the four strategic areas of focus. Richardson also chairs the expert advisory group on the UK Government 25YEP Nature Friendly Schools programme to create nature\-friendly schools. 

 Natural England’s Principal Adviser stated: “ *The insight provided through research led by Derby University into the relationship between nature connection and wellbeing and a range of pro\-environmental and pro\-nature behaviours has made a profound impact on Natural England’s approach to public engagement and the means of evaluating the impact of that engagement work”* \[5.7\]. The impact is further illustrated by the fact that applicants to the Connecting People with Nature stream of the Government’s GBP40,000,000 Green Recovery Challenge Fund \(GRCF\) were directed to work on the pathways to nature connectedness framework in a key part of the funding guidance administered by the National Heritage Lottery Fund \[5.7\]. 

 The charity, Student Minds, used NCRG research \[3.3, 3.4\] to develop the ‘University Mental Health Charter’, launched in 2019 with the support of the Universities Minister, and is currently using the University of Derby as a pilot site to implement the Charter Award Scheme \[5.9\]. A consumer version of the mental health smartphone intervention developed during G3.1 and found to be effective \[3.4\], was released as part of the Go Jauntly App in May 2020. Between launch and 14 August 2020, the app had 30,701 downloads; a 300% increase compared with the 3 months pre\-launch \[5.9\]. Internationally, the DOC implemented NCRG research into their national teacher training course to improve nature connectedness among New Zealand children \[5.5\]. The Outreach and Education Coordinator commented: “ *Since the introduction of the Pathways to Nature Connectedness research into the team, there has been a shift in focus on how we develop and promote nature\-based learning. The research has been a key factor in shaping the strategic direction of DOC’s education engagement from development of resources to promotion campaigns.* *The marketing and social media teams have identified the pathways as a key tool for engaging new and old audiences in national conservation campaigns”* \[5.5\]. 

 Richardson was invited to co\-author the ‘Connecting People with Nature’ \[5.10\] report by the Children & Nature Network, a US non\-profit organisation aimed at improving children’s access and interaction with nature globally. The report was presented at the November 2018 UN Convention on Biological Diversity. This led to a call for the pathways model to be included in the post\-2020 Biodiversity Framework \[5.10\] in order to achieve the UN’s Strategic Plan and Aichi Biodiversity Targets to promote pro\-nature behaviours and improve mental wellbeing.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Attribution:** Research carried out at The University of Edinburgh led by Professor Mutapi, in close collaboration with The University of Zimbabwe, led to a reduction in schistosomiasis \(Bilharzia\) and has influenced national control policies. 

 **Impact on health and welfare:** The treatment program has reached 100% of the target population, and reduced infection and disease level from a national level of 32% to 0% for Schistosomiasis and Soil Transmitted Helminthiasis \(STH\) in Zimbabwe. 

 **Impact on public policy:** Professor Mutapi implemented a mapping strategy for Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\) in Zimbabwe, which then informed appropriate treatment policies. As a result of the mapping strategy conducted by Mutapi, treatment and resources were focussed on endemic areas. This strategy was subsequently adopted by many other African countries. Preschool aged children are now included in the ongoing 2012 Zimbabwe NTD control policy. 

 **Beneficiaries:** 5,000,000 Zimbabwean school and preschool aged children at risk of disease by NTDs in Africa; cost savings through safe and integrated Mass Drug Administration \(MDA\) programmes. 

 **Significance and reach:** Decrease in infection and disease from Schistosomiasis and STH in Zimbabwe. Mapping of NTDs has been completed in approximately 87% of countries in Africa encompassing an estimated 620,000,000 people at risk of disease by NTDs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Schistosomiasis \( *S. haematobium* and *S. mansoni*\) and soil transmitted helminthiasis \(STH\) are among the most widely distributed neglected tropical diseases \(NTDs\) that affect people living in vulnerable communities with poor and limited access to safe water, sanitary facilities and inadequate health facilities. Approximately 200,000,000 people are affected by schistosomes worldwide, with over 90% of the cases occurring in Africa. 

 Professor Francisca Mutapi, a leading researcher in the field of schistosomiasis and Global Health, has run a collaborative research program in Zimbabwe for the past 20 years. She collaborated with colleagues from the University of Zimbabwe to carry out a nationwide cross\-sectional survey to map schistosomiasis and STH in 2010 and 2011, among 13,195 primary school children in 280 primary schools from 68 rural and urban districts in Zimbabwe to represent infection in the country’s >5 million children exposed to schistosomiasis \[3.1\].The team used the gold standard parasitology diagnostics techniques available at the time to determine schistosome and STH infection prevalence and intensity. 

 Professor Mutapi and her group have shown the detrimental health impact of schistosomiasis in children \[3.2\] and demonstrated that treatment with praziquantel, the drug of choice, is safe and efficacious not only in treating primary school children, but also preschool children \[3.3\]. Prior to the work, there was no schistosome control program in Zimbabwe. Following the recommendations of the World Health Assembly \(WHA\), resolution 54.19 advocated for the control of schistosomiasis morbidity in highly endemic areas, and urged countries to attain a target of regular treatment of “at least 75% and up to 100% of all school\-age children at risk of morbidity by 2010”. Zimbabwe needed a national control programme, however, WHO indicated that countries needed to know their baseline infection levels in order to implement the appropriate control strategy. 

 Overall, the national schistosomiasis prevalence was 22.7% \(range 0%–62%\) and that of STH was 5.5% \(range 0%–45%\). Based on the results of this study that confirm nationwide predominance in distribution of schistosomiasis and STH, the team contributed to the development of preventive chemotherapy strategies and implementation in the country \[3.4\]. In addition to the population impact based on this mapping study, the national control program, which targets individuals, also had a significant positive impact on reducing infection and improving health.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

####  Background and pathway to impact 

 The World Health Organisation has a roadmap \(2020 Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Disease\) for member states to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030. 

 Based on the results of Professor Mutapi’s research that confirmed nationwide predominance in distribution of schistosomiasis and a lesser extent of STH, preventive chemotherapy strategies were determined and recommended for the elimination of these two specific NTDs in Zimbabwe. 

 “On a national scale, Professor Mutapi has been involved in the genesis, planning and implementation of Zimbabwe’s helminth control programme started in 2012.”  \[5.1\] 

 In September 2012, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health formulated a national NTD control policy, 5\-year action plan and implemented school\-based mass drug administration, including schistosomiasis treatment, targeting primary and secondary school children across the country based on this mapping exercise. Five of the six annual **m**ass **d**rug **a**dministrations \(MDAs\) occurred within the REF2021 impact period \[5.1\]. 

 Crucially, Zimbabwe’s control programme recommended **treating all children annually irrespective of the regional prevalence of infection**. This is in contrast to the WHO preventive chemotherapy guidelines that recommend the frequency of treatment based on community/regional infection level, *i.e.* high risk communities should be treated annually, whereas those at lower risk should be treated every two years or twice within a child’s school career. 

 “This work provided the evidence base leading to the WHO recommendations, thus correcting a significant and long\-standing health inequity, and making \~50 million pre\-school African children eligible for schistosomiasis treatment.” \[5.1\]. 

####  Impact on health and welfare 

 **Disease:** The treatment program has not only reached 100% of the target population, but has reduced infection and disease level in school children from a national level of 32% to 0% \[5.1\]. 

 **Figure 1 Changes in prevalence at national level from MDA 1 to MDA 6.** 



Annual MDAs were carried out in Zimbabwe from September 2012. Five of the six annual MDAs occurred within the REF2021 impact period \(10/2013, 01/2015, 11/2015, 11/2016, 11/2017\). For the six years of annual MDA, monitoring and evaluation of the treatments were conducted \[3.4\]. After six rounds of annual MDA, Zimbabwe surpassed the WHO recommended 75% coverage to over 90% coverage and decreased national prevalence of schistosomiasis \(infection and disease\) from 32% to <1% in school children \[5.1\]. The treatment coverage increased each year peaking at 90% in 2016, well above the 75% coverage for schoolchildren set by the WHO for the “2020 Roadmap” for schistosomiasis \[5.2\]. Annual assessment in sentinel sites throughout the country showed that schistosome infection and disease level decreased significantly after each round of treatment from the pre\-treatment levels in the same year. Most notably, both urogenital schistosomiasis infection and morbidity prevalence reduced from 32% at baseline in 2012 to 0% in 2017, and infection intensity reduced and 28.75 eggs/10ml urine to 0 in the same time period. Intestinal schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity reduced from 4.6% and 0.28 eggs/25mg of stool to 0% and 0 eggs respectively \[3.4\], \[all the treatment coverage data are publicly available on the ESPEN database 5.3, 5.4 & 5.5\]. Thus, the control programme significantly reduced schistosome infection and morbidity in the school children, illustrated in Figure 1 \[3.4\], moving the national schistosome prevalence in school\-aged children from moderate to low by WHO classification. 

 In 2018, Zimbabwe spent USD15,392,840.14, on drugs to treat NTDs \(intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and trachoma\) as part of the MDA programmes \[5.6, pg14\], placing Zimbabwe in the top 8 African countries based on the value of treatments. In 2018, 95,300,000 people received preventative chemotherapy for schistosomiasis, 76,200,000 million were school\-aged children and the remaining 19,100,000 were adults \[5.7 i\-iii\]. 

 Due to the success of the MDAs, the need for an integrated strategy for eliminating schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe involving treatment, sanitation and education was highlighted in The End Fund, “Breaking the Cycle of neglect” review. 

 “To develop robust elimination strategies it is vital for Zimbabwe to gain a better understanding of the distribution of these diseases in adults and preschool\-age children.” \[5.8\] 

 “There is also an urgent need to improve education on NTDs within the primary school curriculum on hygiene and sanitation practices.” \[5.8\] 

 **Daily life:** To capture impact at the individual child level as well as overall impact in schools, a community impact evaluation \[5.9\] was carried out in late October 2019. Perception of the MDA programmes for helminth control by the affected populations influences compliance and future designs of the programmes. Public perception of Zimbabwe’s National Helminth Control Program \(2012\-2017\) was determined with a specific focus on schistosomiasis in the school children treated with praziquantel, school teachers and village health workers \(VHW\). 

 The study enrolled 409 children from Grades 6 and 7 who had the full benefit of the 6 years of MDA from 2012 to 2017. 36 schoolteachers and 22 VHW serving the schools were also recruited. The evaluation focused on the perceived impact on heath, school attendance and performance and Knowledge Attitudes and Practice \(KAP\).  Overall, 84% of the children responded that their awareness of schistosomiasis \(transmission, disease, treatment and infection avoidance\) had improved because of participating in the MDAs. Of the 151 children self\-diagnosed with schistosomiasis, 74% reported that their health had improved following treatment with praziquantel. This included resolution of haematuria, painful urination, sore stomach, tiredness and falling asleep during class lessons. The children and teachers reported improvements in both pupil school attendance and performance at school as well as an increase in health seeking behaviour for schistosomiasis treatment in\-between MDAs. 

 The majority of VHW \(96%\) reported improvement in handwashing behaviour, schistosomiasis awareness \(96%\) and treatment uptake \(91%\) within the community. However, only 59% and 50% of the VHW reported improvement in toilet use and clean water use respectively, within their communities. 

 This study indicated that the community perceived that the MDA programme had improved the health of children, their school attendance, school performance and awareness of schistosomiasis. The VHW also perceived that the MDA program had improved the community KAP. Perception of helminth MDA programs by the affected populations influences compliance and therefore, affects the success of the programme. This evaluation determined the perception of Zimbabwe’s National Helminth Control Program with a specific focus on schistosomiasis in the school children treated with praziquantel, schoolteachers and village health workers \(VHWs\) \[5.9\]. 

 **NTD Mapping in Zimbabwe and elsewhere:** Due to the success of the Zimbabwe National NTD programme, other countries in Africa have adopted the mapping strategy \[3.3\] and subsequent implementation of control programmes for schistosomiasis, STH and other NTDs \[5.1\]. 

 “We conducted a national survey to map the current distribution of schistosomiasis and for the first time, to map the  distribution of STH in Zimbabwe” \[3.3\]. 

 Mapping of NTDs is now complete in 41 \(87%\) countries in the African region \[5.7, pg 5\]. In the REF impact period \(2014 & 2015\), 22 African countries including Mauritiana, Liberia, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Benin, Namibia, Madagascar & DR Congo were mapped for NTDs by the WHO\-AFRO mapping project. 

 “A total of 75 million school aged children \(SAC\) were treated in 2017, representing an unprecedented coverage of 69.4% from 29 countries that reported data in a timely manner.” \[5.10, pg 5\]. 

 Mapping was ongoing in Ethiopia and Angola and was soon to start in South Africa, South Sudan and Algeria. The AFRO Mapping project, a joint effort of WHO's African Regional Office and NTD Support Centre, is nearing completion of Phase I: the district\-wide assessments for preventative chemotherapy against NTDs \(lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil\-transmitted helminthiasis, schistosomiasis and trachoma\). Building on countries' earlier mapping efforts, 85% of districts in the AFRO region now are fully mapped for these diseases. 

 This impact covers over 87% of countries in Africa and an estimated 620 Million people at risk of disease by NTDs in Africa. The mapping of NTDs across Africa has allowed countries to works towards effective regional elimination programmes and improve accuracy of the incidence of NTDs. There will be cost savings through safe and integrated mass drug administration, and through ending of unnecessary treatments. 

 More recently, Professor Mutapi’s group extended the findings of the mapping exercise to develop a strategy for mapping schistosome infection in preschool children, a current knowledge gap identified by the WHO. The strategy developed by Professor Mutapi and her group uses data from the surveys in school age children such as that highlighted here for an inexpensive approach applicable in poor resource settings obviating the need for surveying young children \[3.6\]. 

####  Impact on public policy: 

 As a direct result of the Mutapi group’s research \[3.2\], preschool aged children are included in the 2012 Zimbabwe NTD control policy. Zimbabwe implemented this policy throughout the REF period, and consequently these children have been treated annually in local clinics out with the MDAs \[3.5\] \[5.1\]. 

 “Professor Mutapi and her team showed that pre\-school children are exposed, infected and suffer from schistosome morbidity. She also showed that treatment with praziquantel was safe and efficacious in this age group. This work provided the evidence base leading to the WHO recommendations, thus correcting a significant and long\-standing health inequity, and making \~50 million pre\-school African children eligible for schistosomiasis treatment.” Director Epidemiology and Disease Control, Ministry for Health and Child Welfare, Zimbabwe \[5.1\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Aston research led to product improvements in adult and paediatric healthcare after novel algorithms developed through two industrially\-funded projects – the ECG\-Derived Biosignals Project and RAPID – were implemented into a commercial system developed by world\-leading digital healthcare company, Isansys. The algorithms work by collecting, processing and analysing real\-time data from cardiac activity. The algorithms have led to innovation in Isansys’s products. Specifically, they have: 

-  Improved Isansys’ method of deriving respiration rate. 

-  Led to FDA certification of Isansys’ PSE monitoring system for commercial exploitation in the US. 

 Led to pending clinical trials, which could lead to the wider international uptake of this capability and improved patient care. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Aston’s research into control algorithms \[ **R1,R2**\] enables one set of sensors to extract important physiological parameters which otherwise would be measured using invasive methods and large amounts of equipment and wires attached to the patient. Instead of this more invasive technique, the algorithms use advanced signal processing and filtering techniques to analyse signals routinely monitored on hospital wards, such as Electrocardiograms \(ECG\), Photoplethysmograms \(PPG\) and Seismocardiograms \(SCG\), to extract the required physiological data. 

 The complex algorithms that enabled this were developed as part of the ECG\-Derived Biosignals project, a collaborative venture between Aston University and Isansys, a world\-leading digital healthcare company. These algorithms are now embedded in Isansys’s wireless Patient Status Engine \(PSE\) – “the most complete, scalable and simple\-to\-use advanced patient monitoring platform”, which monitors patients automatically and in real time. 

 Embedded in Isansys’s PSE, the algorithms help enable the PSE to extract physiological indicators including respiratory rate \[ **R3,R4**\], heart rate, and key R, Q and T peaks \[ **R3,R5**\]. The PSE can then alert healthcare professionals to potential problems, enabling them to intervene quickly and potentially save lives. 

 The research has also developed a novel measure of breathing distress – Work of Breathing \(WoB\).  While existing methods for measuring breathing distress are invasive and require multiple measurements, the ECG\-Biosignals project’s unique technique is non\-invasive and utilises routine ECG recordings. While this measure has yet to be included in the Isansys PSE, it will be the subject of forthcoming clinical trials. 

 Aston’s research – through the RAPID project with Birmingham Children’s Hospital – also developed a Paediatric Early Warning Score \(PEWS\). Also embedded in Isansys’s PSE, this assesses the correlation between extracted physiological indicators, and alerts clinicians to potential problems. This facilitates early intervention and aims to save the lives of children and young people \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research led to the development of novel algorithms for the non\-invasive extraction of physiological indicators to help clinicians and nurses intervene swiftly and save lives. All Aston algorithms are now embedded in Isansys’s Patient Status Engine \(PSE\) – the WoB algorithm is subject of forthcoming clinical trials. 

 The methods and techniques Aston developed were tested on real data from 982 patients provided by Birmingham Children’s Hospital \(BCH\) in 2018/19. All data were provided with reference values against which the extracted measures were checked. 

 The results \[ **R4, R5**\] proved to be more accurate and reliable than those previously recorded by Isansys’s devices, achieving 99.8% accuracy in QRS detection, 81% accuracy in the WOB estimation and a mean absolute error \(the mean error between the actual and estimated values\) estimation of just 0.4 in the breathing rate. 

 A Consultant from Birmingham Children’s Hospital’s Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, said: “This technology is truly transformational. For the first time it allows us to analyse patients’ data in real time in the same way that various other high risk industries have done for years.” \[ **S1, S2**\] 

 Because the algorithms obtain the measures non\-invasively by analysing a hospital patient’s routinely monitored ECG signals \[ **R3, R5**\], they reduce patient discomfort and the number of sensors required. Through the Paediatric Early Warning Score \(PEWS\) they also enable health professionals to be alerted quickly to potential issues. 

 The Consultant said: “The ability to track and identify deterioration towards a cardiac arrest will give doctors the chance to save the patient’s life.” \[ **S3**\] 

 The algorithms have had the following impacts: 

-  The algorithms have been embedded in Isansys’s PSE, improving the quality of the company’s medical devices \[ **S3**\] and particularly their ability to measure respiration rate. The Isansys Chief Executive, said: “Respiration rate is a difficult vital sign to measure accurately. We are therefore very pleased to report that one of the early outputs from the ECG\-Derived Biosignals project was an improvement to our current method of deriving respiration rate… Feedback from other users has been very positive and no issues about the accuracy of the respiration rate functionality have subsequently been recorded in our post market surveillance reports.” 

-  The algorithms have also led to the Isansys PSE’s FDA certification for commercial exploitation in the US \[ **S4**\]. The CEO of Isansys said: “Since the inclusion of these Aston developed improvements to the algorithm in the PSE, we have been able to meet the rigorous requirements of the US FDA 510\(k\) procedure and as a result the PSE is now certified for commercial exploitation in the USA.” 

-  The algorithms have now led to pending clinical trials of Aston’s novel Work of Breathing \(WOB\) measure \(currently on hold due to the COVID\-19 pandemic\). Monitoring breathing distress is currently invasive and expensive, so a clinically\-proven, automatic WoB measure derived from ECG signals would reduce treatment costs and the number of staff required to monitor patients. The CEO of Isansys said: “We expect the new automatic WOB \(Work of Breathing\) measure … to yield very promising results. Trials were envisaged to commence at Birmingham Children’s Hospital to enable the earlier detection of potential life\-threatening adverse events using real\-time data, instead of relying on post processing of lab test and other data held in the patient’s electronic medical record… Isansys intends to undertake these trials with existing hospital customers both in the UK and overseas. However, all planned studies are now on hold as a result of the Covid\-19 pandemic.” \[ **S4**\] 

-  The algorithms and their incorporation into Isansys’s devices could have huge commercial implications. The CEO of Isansys said: “Ideally, every patient in hospital would be continuously and automatically monitored. In practice hospitals deem around 60% of their patients need to be monitored in this way. For the UK alone, this figure is around 12 million patients annually and globally hundreds of millions. The total patient monitoring market is therefore many £billions and the market leaders will be those companies whose systems and devices provide the most accurate and trustworthy data. The ECG\-Derived Biosignals project with Aston University will stand us in very good stead to maintain a leading position.” 

 Aston’s algorithms and alarm system are also integrated into Isansys’s wireless Lifetouch device, which connects to the PSE. This wearable device can be attached to the chest and ankle to measure and analyse vital signs in real time. This kind of non\-invasive, individual monitoring provides real\-time accurate information about the patient, potentially leading to faster treatment, lives saved and reduced hospital stays. The mother of one of the patients said: “I’m so pleased that \[my child\] was able to take part in the study. I think the wireless technology is great, I can pick him up more easily and he is constantly monitored \[ **S1**\].”

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prior to the Aberdeen research being carried out, the devastating impact of growing up in a family with Huntington’s disease \(HD\) upon children and young people was largely unknown. Research by the team at Aberdeen explored different aspects related to the experiences of children and young people in families with HD, including conversations with parents, caring responsibilities and predictive genetic testing, demonstrating the need for specialised, age\-appropriate services to provide young people with education and support. Research findings have informed the development of new support services and educational materials for children and young people in Scotland and around the world, as well as influencing the practice and training of healthcare professionals.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Huntington’s disease \(HD\) is an incurable hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, affecting approximately 3/100,000 individuals worldwide, and between 1/5000\-1/6000 individuals in Scotland. The age of onset is usually between 30 and45 – often coinciding with parenthood – with symptoms including involuntary movements, changes in behaviour and personality, cognitive impairment, and increasingly debilitating symptoms. Because HD is due to an autosomal dominant gene, every child of an affected parent has a 50% risk of developing the illness in their adulthood. For children living in a family with HD, many witness the loss of a parent whilst also finding out that they are at high risk themselves. They may also face considerable stigma associated with the disease, higher rates of family breakdown, and secrecy within affected families about its existence. However, prior to 2001 little was known about children and young people’s experiences of HD, and there were no services nor evidence\-based educational materials specifically for children or young people impacted by this devastating disease. 

 The team of researchers at Aberdeen – initially led by Dr Sheila Simpson \(Clinical Genetics\) and later by Professor Miedzybrodzka \(Medical Genetics\) – sought to rectify this gap by creating an evidence base in five core areas. 

 First, they explored the difficulties patients had telling their children about the hereditary aspect of Huntington’s disease. The research generated data about actual conversations using in\-depth qualitative interviews with affected families in Scotland. The findings revealed that communication within a family about genetic risk is a complex issue and is influenced by both pre\-existing familial and cultural factors and individuals' responses to risk information \[ **R1**\]. 

 The team used this knowledge to explore the trauma that children and young people can experience when growing up with an affected parent addressing – for the first time – how living within a family with HD was experienced from the perspective of the young person. Drawing on in\-depth qualitative interviews, the research examined different types of disclosure experiences, along with the timing and style of disclosure and the subsequent impact on young people. Findings identified the extent to which living in a family with HD profoundly affects children and young people, evidencing that children worry about their own high risk, undertake caring roles, live with prolonged anxiety, experience multiple losses, and may be in need of child protection. A crucial finding was that young people who grow up knowing about the disease had been empowered to cope better, highlighting the importance of communication and the provision of age\-appropriate information \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. Findings have since been replicated by studies in other parts of the world \(USA, Australia, Canada and Europe\). 

 HD was one of the first conditions where predictive genetic testing for over 18s became available and as such is a paradigm for wider genetic testing guidelines and evaluation of how testing programmes impact upon individuals and families. The team’s research on young people’s experiences of predictive testing for HD provided much needed evidence and was the first to examine both prospective and retrospective accounts. The research demonstrated a need for additional support for young people around isolation, grief and loss, the waiting period, and particularly if the result contradicted what they had felt deep down \[ **R4**\]. 

 A further area of interest was related to understanding familial communications, specifically how individuals communicate with their partners about HD and the potential risks they face. Using qualitative interviews with partners of an individual at risk for HD, enabled the research team to identify and examine the efficacy of different disclosure experiences and develop recommendations based on the responses. Findings indicated that there could be significant benefit to the relationship if partners were encouraged to attend at least one separate appointment in pre‐test counselling \[ **R5**\]. 

 Finally, the team sought to understand the variation in professional practice of genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists in Scotland shepherding patients through the process of communication with their family members. Through interviews with genetic health professionals, the research team was able to consider the efficacy of the different approaches that were taken – from a limited role to professional intervention, concluding that this remains a challenging and sensitive area, and one in which genetics professionals express a need for more resources and the clinical time to undertake this work \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Young people in families living with HD face unique challenges: the burden of being a young carer; social isolation; learning about their own high risk and deciding whether to seek genetic testing. The research by the team at the University of Aberdeen has been instrumental in identifying a need for age\-appropriate information and resources about HD, professional and peer support, as well as parental guidance about disclosure to children. The research built an evidence base that has been used to inform support services for young people in Scotland and around the world, and to influence training for health and social care professionals. 

 **Informing the development of new support services for young people in Scotland** 

 Early in the research, the Aberdeen team was able to develop a collaboration with the Scottish Huntington’s Association \(SHA\). As well as a crucial avenue for recruiting research participants, the collaboration has informed the development of the SHA youth service \(known as SHAYP\), a dedicated service providing support to children and young people aged 8\-25 in Scotland living in a family with HD. The CEO of SHA highlighted the Aberdeen research as key to SHAYP: “ *A key element of the work is to support parents around the disclosure of HD in the family. The practice basis for this work is the research conducted by Keenan et al*” \[ **S1**\]. Since August 2013, SHAYP has supported 163 young people and passed on the study findings to over 300 HD families, with four specialist youth advisors now employed to cover the whole of Scotland. Families attending a genetic clinic with children aged 8\-25 in NHS Grampian and other Clinical Genetic Services in Scotland are told about the youth service, another route to reaching this vulnerable group. The SHA have also cited the research to access grant funding to support SHAYP to the value of GBP1,000,000 \(Children in Need; Big Lottery\) \[ **S1**\]. 

 SHA staff have drawn directly on the research to inform their professional practice and to support parents to start early conversations with children about HD \[ **S2**\]. Aspects of the SHAYP approach that have been developed based upon the research include educational resources; one\-to\-one support; age\-tailored group sessions; activity days; and residential breaks. Another key area of activity involves supporting young people through the predictive testing process. SHAYP has also reformulated its approach to working with partners of young people living with HD. Following publication of the research on disclosure to partners, SHA Specialist Youth Advisors included relationships and disclosure as part of their comprehensive assessment of needs, resulting in 70% of young people who have entered into serious relationships requesting at least one joint session with their partner and enabling them both to be able to plan better for the future. The SHAYP Children Services Manager said: “ *The research… has positively influenced professionals’ knowledge and understanding of living in families impacted by HD, whilst also affording organisational change in how services are tailored and delivered to this vulnerable client group*.” \[ **S2**\]. 

 **Informing the development of new support services for young people around the world** 

 As well as informing support within Scotland, the research has also been pivotal in the services offered by the Huntington’s Disease Youth Organisation \(HDYO\). HDYO was founded in 2011 by Matt Ellison, who first heard about the Aberdeen research through Dr Keenan at the European Huntington’s Disease Network meeting in Prague, 2010 \[ **S3**\]. Matt grew up with an HD parent and wanted to change the landscape for other children and young people. He founded HDYO in 2012, as a non\-profit organisation providing online support and education for young people around the world aged up to 35 \(HDYO.org\). The organisation provides age\-appropriate educational content including a genetic testing section for teens and young adults, an information pack for schools highlighting the needs of young carers, and information for parents about disclosure to children, all of which draw directly upon the Aberdeen research \[ **S3**\]. For example, the genetic testing section specifically draws on findings about ‘the waiting period,’ the potential for isolation and the feelings young people may have when going through the testing process. 

 Since 2013, the website has had over 7,000,000 views, content has been translated into 13 languages and direct support has been provided to over 4,500 young people \[ **S4**\]. Founder Ellison had said that the Aberdeen research “ *provides an evidence base to underscore the important work of HDYO and to continue to obtain funding and support from partners.*” HYDO has secured approximately GBP500,000 in the REF impact period. Aberdeen researcher Keenan also served on the HYDO Board from 2012\-2017 and is a member of the Feedback Team \(hdyo.org/eve/about/105\), supporting HYDO to use the research to understand the needs of young people and provide much needed support \[ **S3**\]. 

 **Influencing practice, training and support for health and social care professionals** 

 As well as providing support for young people directly, SHA also works with genetic professionals to improve their practice. Aberdeen’s research on the variation in professional practice of genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists in Scotland, whose role is to facilitate communication within families about genetic risk, has directly influenced the development of a new strategic approach to supporting genetic professionals to hold such conversations. While this is a new development for the service, they have already received positive results, including one practitioner who said, “ *My practice has been improved dramatically and I believe the benefit is to all family members now and not just the person receiving the genetic test. Had I not read the journal article, I would have continued with my old methods and would have been missing fully supporting families*” \[ **S2**\]. 

  

 Professional training has used the Aberdeen research to provide an evidence base. The Genetic & Genomic Counselling MSc at Cardiff University cites the Aberdeen research for subtopics in family matters and in predictive testing in their ethics module. This course has been delivered to 80 genetic counselling students since Aug 2013 all of whom have had the benefit of learning about the Aberdeen research \[ **S5**\]. Manchester University also provides clinical training in genetic counselling citing the Aberdeen research in their counselling and communication skills module \[ **S6**\]. 

 The first\-of\-its\-kind professional development course at Stirling University, ‘Huntington’s Disease: An Enabling Approach to Supporting Families’ developed in conjunction with the SHA, cites the Aberdeen research 12 times in the 200\-hour, SCQF level 10 course. Since its launch in 2015, 82 professionals from across the four nations of the UK have completed the CPD module \[ **S7**\]. The CEO of SHA said of the Stirling course in relation to the Aberdeen research “ *a key theme of the course is the impact of HD on the whole family, and recognition of the issues for young people and young adults is largely possible because of this body of work*” \[ **S1**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Coach education at all levels of sport has been underpinned by rational and dispassionate models of practice, which fail to provide coaches with the intra\- and inter\-personal skills required to navigate the complex social reality of coaching. Northumbria University’s novel research into the social, relational and emotional dimensions of coaching has enhanced learning and practice of coaches across the UK, most notably elite rugby union player development pathways in England and Ireland, as well as in other sports. Northumbria’s research informed new training approaches for UK\-wide sporting bodies and supported mechanisms to cascade novel approaches across the community of practice, improving individual coach performance and the coaching experiences of athletes. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Rational and dispassionate models of practice that underpin coach education and development initiatives have been increasingly questioned by practitioners and governing bodies in recent years, including the International Council of Coaching Excellence and England Rugby \[ **R1**\]. Indeed, the growing importance attached to developing coaches’ intra\- and inter\-personal knowledge and skills by national and international organisations reflects increasing evidence that coaches feel under\-prepared for the social, emotional, and pedagogical challenges of everyday practice \[ **R2**\]. By addressing the interactive, emotionally engaging, and dynamic nature of coaches’ work, research from Northumbria has contributed to better social understanding of coaching that coincided with priority areas identified by coaching and sport leadership bodies. These priorities included: \(a\) building, sustaining, and, where necessary, repairing relationships across a variety of interconnected stakeholders, including athletes, support staff, administrators, and athletes’ parents/guardians; and \(b\) experiencing and managing emotions in everyday practice. 

 This research was undertaken within the *Informing Practice and Policy* research group at Northumbria University. Its empirical focus on the relational and emotional dimensions of sport coaching blended qualitative fieldwork and sociological theory. The former included field observations, in\-depth semi\-structured and stimulated recall interviews, and collaborative inquiry, while the latter comprised relational and dramaturgical theorising. The research challenged orthodox representations of sports coaching by revealing it to be a fundamentally more relational and emotionally demanding undertaking than previously understood. Specifically, this body of research provided insights into the individual and collective meaning\-making that is generated in the intricate networks of sport organisations, and the emergent consequences of the face\-to\-face interactions that occurred between coaching’s principal actors – coaches, athletes, coach educators, administrators, and parents. The research has examined these issues in the context of community sport \[ **R3**, **R4**\], coach education \[ **R2**, **R5**\], and elite\-development pathways \[ **R1**, **R6**\]. The insights generated have shed new light on the essential \(but informally developed\) political astuteness of the participants and have supported the development of tools and mechanisms that have helped coaches and coach educators to manage their interactions and relationships in the coaching context \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. 

 Importantly, the research indicated that the development of political astuteness is an iterative process that entails responding \(both proactively and reactively\) to situational demands, as well as critically reflecting upon them \[ **R2**\]. It requires the development of skills that have traditionally not been a part of formal coach education provision. These include: i\) being able to map the relationships and interests that comprise the social terrain of organisational life \[ **R1**, **R4**, **R5**\]; ii\) engaging in disciplined and situationally sensitive noticing \[ **R3**, **R5**, **R6**\]; iii\) using these insights to develop and enact plans that positively influence others \[ **R1**\]; and iv\) carefully managing the impression of the coach in the eyes of various organisational stakeholders \[ **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\]. Overall, this knowledge challenged the continued use of homogenous, rational, off\-the\-peg solutions to coaching challenges. Instead, it highlighted how critical reflection can be used to help coaches recognise how they are simultaneously tacticians and targets of influence within a network of social relations and, subsequently, to develop intra\- and inter\-personal strategies that can help them to productively navigate the dilemmas, opportunities, and challenges of their respective organisational settings.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Edward Hall used the underpinning research from Northumbria’s *Informing Practice and Policy* research group to support coaches and coach educators across the UK through a mix of long\-term, practice\-based support, training, mentoring, and Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\), with sometimes weekly support sessions. As a result, coaches and coach educators improved their practice, resulting in better coaching experiences for athletes. 

 **4.1 Enhancing coach education and coaching practice across elite rugby union** 

 England Rugby \(ER\) is the largest governing body of rugby union in the world. ER manages an elite Player Development Pathway, which seeks to identify and support future professional and national team players to achieve their potential. Hall designed and delivered a bespoke workshop at the week\-long Wellington Festival, the largest academy festival in English Rugby, which is attended by members of all 14 professional academies and aims to develop both academy players and coaches on and off the field. The workshop \(based upon **R1**\- **R6**\) was attended by an audience of over 100 key ER, academy, and national team leaders, including almost all the managers, head coaches, and coach educators connected to the Player Development Pathway \[ **E1**\]. The event organiser, Russell Earnshaw, ER Pathway Coach Developer and High\-Performance Coach of England U18s, highlighted the direct impact of the research: *‘As a result of Dr Hall’s workshop ... I know that many coaches changed their coaching practice to become more reflective and sensitive to the emotions and politics of coaching ... these coaches have also improved their ability to notice appropriate opportunities to interact with players \(e.g. feedback, scaffolding\), which I know has had positive impacts on players’ learning and performance across the pathway’* \[ **E1**\]. Following this intervention, Hall was asked to use the research \[ **R1**\- **R6**\] to support national level curriculum change and new learning for coaches taking ER’s highest level coaching qualification \(Level 4\). 

 As a result, Hall designed and delivered bespoke new coach learning and development provision to organisations in elite rugby player development pathways in England and Ireland. These included Newcastle Falcons \[ **E2**\], Ulster Rugby \[ **E3**\], London Irish, and Leicester Tigers \[ **E4**\]. This material was further tailored to support the learning and development of coaches involved in England Men U20s, England Men Students, and England Women rugby teams \[ **E2**\] through CPD and mentoring work on the pitch. 

 Aiden McNulty, Elite Player Development Officer from Ulster Rugby identified the beneficial changes to his practice and the learning and performance of the players in his charge: *‘I have no doubt that the enhancements to my coaching practice, based on this research, has positively impacted my players’ learning, development and performance’* \[ **E3**\]. ‘ *As a result of this improvement, 17 players have gained professional playing contracts and a further 21 players were selected to represent national teams’* \[ **E3**\]. McNulty has also been responsible for organising coach support and professional development opportunities for hundreds of coaches and states Hall’s work with this group generated *‘positive change in the attending coaches’ practice including improvements in session planning, coaches’ ability to recognise and respond to individual player needs and collaborating and co\-ordinating activity with co\-coaches’* \[ **E3**\]. In 2019\-2020, Hall and McNulty created a unique coach development opportunity that allowed the 50 best elite pathway coaches connected to the academy to access a bespoke CPD package, based exclusively on research at Northumbria. This led to *‘players exploring the boundaries of their capabilities and being more confident to make decisions under real\-world performance conditions, and … other coaches who have been exposed to the research being more confident and influential in their social interactions to achieve better outcomes for themselves and others’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 Since 2015, delivery of training and mentoring based on the research to the Newcastle Falcons has led to changes in coaching practice across all of the club’s teams, from ages 13 to 23. They now *‘plan in more depth, to be more strategic in the specific interactions different coaches have with players during sessions, achieving a clearer shared purpose as a coaching team’* \[ **E2**\]. In summary, the Newcastle Falcons now have a *‘more athlete\-centred, democratic, group leadership approach*’ \[ **E2**\] which is seen as translating to *‘improved performance and increasing success on the pitch’* \[ **E2**\]. Similar benefits were reported by coaches at Ulster \[ **E3**\], London Irish and Leicester Tigers \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.2 Enhancing approaches to coaching in other sports around the world** 

 The research has informed coach education in other sports, including British Canoeing’s Level 4 Coaching Programme, the Youth Sport Trust Young Coach Academy, GB Hockey’s Advanced Coach Programme, England Athletics Coach Development, and Newcastle United Football Academy. For instance, \[ **R2**\] served as the catalyst for new coach CPD provision focused on reflection in coaching practice that was delivered by UK Coaching \(the governing body for coaching across different sports\) to over 400 coaches \[ **E5**\]. 

 Based on the research, British Athletics has changed how it monitors coach development and defines good coaching practice, which continues to shape its *‘long\-term planning for strategic youth talent development coaching for hundreds of British Athletics coaches until the 2028 summer Olympics’* \[ **E6**\]. Specifically, entry into the Talent Programme was originally for athletes only but, following the research’s emphasis on relations and interactions, now coach\-athlete partnerships must apply together to the Youth Talent Pathway, Junior Talent Programme, and Futures Programme \[ **E6**\]. Similarly, where previously only selected athletes had an individual development plan this has now been added as an element to their coach’s development programme \[ **E6**\]. In addition, the England Athletics Coach Tracker – designed to track coach development and inform educational interventions – was adapted to incorporate enhanced language to frame questions that promote critical reflection on experiences and practice. For example, coaches are now prompted to focus more critically on their interactions with stakeholders, critical thinking skills, ability to influence others, and how they build, maintain and repair relationships \[ **E6**\]. *‘Importantly, these changes have helped us to generate a more holistic and authentic representation of the complex work coaches are engaged in with their athletes’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 These changes have led to a beneficial impact on coaches’ progress. One cohort of 18 coaches saw significant progress over a single year connected to the skills introduced, thanks to Northumbria’s research. The coaches showed up to 20% improvement across several factors, from perceptions of interactions and critical thinking to influencing skills and inter\-personal relationships. This compares with an average growth across these factors among all participants of 9.3% by the end of the programme \[ **E6**\]. 

 Having worked with Hall, in 2018 Russell Earnshaw set up an independent coach development company called The Magic Academy. This organisation provides coaching resources, coach education, and a platform where coaches share best practice. More than 7,000 coaches in numerous different sports use Magic Academy globally. Northumbria’s research on reflective practice and social, emotional and political astuteness has been incorporated into the development of content on the platform, which has the widest reach of any independent coaching professional development initiative \[ **E1**\]. 

 In total, 800 coaches and coach educators, in rugby union and other sports, have attended workshops based on this research between 2015 and 2020. Secondary impact was also achieved from this \- 148 of the participants reported coaching 13,341 players, and they also manage, lead, and support the learning and development of a further 1,276 coaches \[ **E4**, p2\]. Surveys completed immediately following the workshops and webinars showed 94% agreed or strongly agreed that the research had increased their understanding of coaching \[ **E4**, p2\], and 80% agreed or strongly agreed that they had learned how to integrate the research findings into their everyday practice \[ **E4**, p2\]. In\-depth follow\-up feedback was also sought more than six months after workshops. Participants included schoolteachers, coaches, and coach educators. They worked in cricket, soccer, hockey and rugby union, in Canada, England, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. This analysis confirmed that the workshops had led to positive changes in the respondents’ knowledge, skills, and practice \(100%\), with positive changes in their beliefs about and approaches to coaching practice \(91%\) \[ **E4**, p6\]. Participants identified areas they intended to address differently as a result of the workshops, including: *‘Being aware of what implications my interactions can have to others through their perception’* \[ **E4**, p3\] and *‘Look at the implications around planning and how I can plan players interactions between peers and constraints within environment’* \[ **E4** *,* p3\]. They also noted beneficial changes to practice: *‘The questioning I am now using and the specific planning surrounding practice is having positive effects on all interact\[ions\] I have with stakeholders’* \[ **E4**, p7\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Despite being party to international Conventions on economic, social, and cultural human rights \(ESCR\), the United Kingdom has failed to make these rights real by embedding them into domestic law. Boyle’s research has **underpinned major processes within Scotland** that are reversing this accountability gap in devolved areas. Her work has specifically: 

 **Impact 1:** Given key bodies, such as Together \(the Scottish Alliance for Children’s Rights\), the expert knowledge needed to carry forward the ESCR incorporation agenda. 

 **Impact 2:** Underpinned the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Incorporation \(Scotland\) Bill. 

 **Impact 3:** Contributed to the creation of a watershed new human rights framework for Scotland. 

 **Impact 4:** Resonated further afield, underpinning ESCR reform in other parts of the UK and internationally. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research contributes to the discourse and practice in three ways. First it highlights that economic, social, and cultural rights \(ESCR\) are inadequately protected because of an erroneous understanding of international law. Second, it proposes that addressing the accountability gap emerging from this error requires that the rights are incorporated and embedded across the work of Parliament, the Executive, and the Judiciary. Third it concludes that the key enabler to a successful model of incorporation ensures that a remedy for a violation is available and that this remedy must be an effective one. This research has been applied in practice in a devolved context as the ‘maximalist’ approach to incorporation. 

 Historically, ESCR as defined in international law were considered by legal experts to be aspirational in nature within the UK context. Boyle’s research finds this assumption was based on a misunderstanding of the legal status of the rights and as a result there is an **accountability gap \(R1, R5\)** for many international human rights that are not adequately protected despite the UK agreeing to comply with them. Boyle’s research has proposed **models of incorporation** for embedding these rights into domestic law – a necessary requirement to make the rights enforceable at the domestic level. The **research concludes that democracy benefits** from an approach to ESCR that allows **individuals and communities to enjoy access to these rights** and **to hold governments to account** when the rights are violated \( **R1**, **R2**\). 

 **R1** and **R5** find that making these rights legally enforceable is difficult but not impossible. Democratic safeguards can help support a multi\-institutional framework where Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary must each act as important guarantors of international human rights \( **R1**, **R5**\). Boyle’s monograph sets out the **means of incorporating ESCR** \(embedding the rights into domestic law\); the ways through which the rights can be made **justiciable** \(adjudicated upon in court\); and how to do this in a **democratically legitimate** way, **using principles of adjudication** derived from deliberative democracy theory \( **R1**, see also **R2**, **R5**\). The research proposes that the most appropriate model of incorporation requires states to **embed compliance and accountability mechanisms across the Parliament, Executive and Judiciary** and that an **effective judicial remedy must be made available for a violation as a means of last resort** \( **R1**\- **R6**\). 

 Boyle was commissioned by the Scottish Human Rights Commission \(SHRC\) to undertake **research into the feasibility of making these rights real as legally enforceable rights** in Scotland \( **R5**\). This commissioned work was supported by years of rigorous legal scholarship on the justiciability \(adjudication by court\) of ESCR in the UK and comparatively \( **R1**\- **R6**\). 

 The research examines other countries where ESCR are constitutionalised and legally enforceable, such as in Finland, Germany, South Africa, Colombia, and Argentina \( **R1**, **R5**\). The research also sets out **existing pathways to remedies** for violations of the rights as well **as future mechanisms for reform** \( **R1**, **R3**, **R6**\). The fact that remedies already existed in the UK made it clear that the long\-held misunderstanding about the aspirational nature of ESCR was erroneous. The rights are indeed legally enforceable by courts, as is already the case, albeit in a limited way meaning an accountability gap emerged. Boyle’s research addresses this gap \( **R1**, **R3**, **R5**\). 

 Following the publication of a 2015 SHRC Report by Boyle, the First Minister committed to consider the ways in which Scotland could incorporate international human rights into Scots law. Boyle was then appointed to advise the Scottish First Minister on models of incorporation as a member of the First Minister’s Advisory Group on Human Rights Leadership in 2018 \( **R4**\). **Boyle’s research in this role explored the different models of incorporation for international human rights in Scotland** \(drawing from **R1**\- **R5**\). Boyle’s research proposed the best means of achieving this was through an overarching constitutional Act for the Scottish Parliament with specific roles for the Parliament, Executive and Judiciary in ensuring accountability for human rights compliance \( **R1**, **R5**, **R6**\). The research also indicated the importance of facilitating collective complaints and innovative structural remedies to address systemic human rights abuses \( **R1**, **R4**, **R5, R6**\). These findings fed into the 2018 Advisory Group report \( **R4**\), which also cites the 2018 SHRC report authored by Boyle \( **R5**\). In **R6** Boyle articulated how to achieve a ‘maximalist’ approach to incorporation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child across the Parliament, Executive and Judiciary, including ensuring access to effective remedies for violations as well as accountability in the privatisation of public services. 

 Boyle is now funded by  [Nuffield](https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/project/access-to-justice-for-social-rights-addressing-the-accountability-gap) \(2019\-2022\) to delve deeper into understanding the barriers in access to justice for violations of social rights across the UK.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Despite signing and ratifying a number of international treaties including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \(‘ICESCR’ in 1968 and 1976, respectively\) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \(‘UNCRC’ 1990 and 1991 respectively\) the UK has mostly failed to incorporate ESCR into domestic law. There is therefore an accountability gap, as the lack of actual legal rights has limited the ability of people to effect real change. Boyle’s research and impact activities have been critical to the bridging of this gap in Scotland. 

##  Impact 1. Providing key players within the human rights reform process the knowledge on which to build ESCR rights into Scottish/UK law. 

 Boyle’s research informed and advanced the knowledge base and debate surrounding the incorporation of ESCR in Scotland, allowing key players within the public sphere to proceed with that incorporation. Together \(the Scottish Alliance for Children’s Rights\) is the umbrella organisation for Scottish children’s charities working toward implementation of the UNCRC \(an international treaty engaging with ESCR of the child\). Juliet Harris, Director of Together, states: 

 “Dr Boyle’s research, and the support she has provided to me, has been **key to informing our advocacy work to progress UNCRC incorporation**. Her detailed technical knowledge on the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights has **changed and developed my understanding of incorporation**, and has **empowered Together to influence the debate on UNCRC incorporation in Scotland**. Dr Boyle’s research provided an authoritative tool for Together to challenge some of the myths around ESC rights that emerged during the passage of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014 and persuade Scottish Government that many concerns raised were unfounded.” \( **S1**\) 

 The SHRC report **R5** therefore **progressed the policy positions of grass roots organisations** on better embedding rights. Scotland’s Judith Robertson, Chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, states that **R5** “has been influential in both understanding the international context for strengthening rights in Scotland and informing the final recommendations of a report to the First Minister on strengthening human rights leadership in Scotland” \( **S3**\). As stated by the Social Care Alliance, **R5** progresses the discourse in Scotland on how Scotland should incorporate these rights \( **S4\(d\)**\). In their *Housing is a Human Right* \( **S4\(a\)**\) Shelter refers to Boyle’s SHRC report **R5** making the case for a right to housing with regards to the different models for incorporating ESCR in Scotland. Judith Robertson, chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, said of Boyle’s research: 

 “There is the political will in Scotland to look at \[taking action to better protect people’s rights by incorporating these international standards into domestic law\]. \[Boyle’s\] research shows there is a wealth of international experience and practice – in court rooms and parliaments – for Scotland to replicate and build on when it comes to protecting all of our economic, social and environmental rights.” \( **S2\(a\)**\) 

 Equalities Minister and then Convenor of the Scottish Parliament’s Equalities and Human Rights Committee Christina McKelvie welcomed **R5**, stating it furthered the debate on “how to make rights real for every member of society” \( **S2\(a\)**\). She elaborated: “\[t\]his report is a welcome contribution to a much bigger debate about how we work together as a nation in order to make rights real for every member of society” \( **S2\(b\)**\). 

##  Impact 2. Underpinning the UNCRC Incorporation \(Scotland\) Bill \(now Act\) 

 The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child \(Incorporation\) \(Scotland\)  [Bill](https://www.gov.scot/policies/human-rights/childrens-rights/) was introduced to the Scottish Parliament on 1 September 2020 and “will provide proactive as well as remedial mechanisms to ensure children’s rights are respected, protected and fulfilled” \(Bruce Adamson, Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland, **S6**\). John Swinney, Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, states this bill “is one of the most significant pieces of legislation to be introduced to the Scottish Parliament since devolution” \(John Swinney, **S7**\). Boyle’s **research and expertise were essential** to the model of incorporation adopted in the bill. The bill was  [unanimously voted into law](https://www.gov.scot/news/landmark-for-childrens-rights/) by the Scottish Parliament in March 2021, with its protections for the rights of the child taking effect later in 2021. 

 In 2019 Boyle was appointed to advise Bruce Adamson, Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland, on a bill for incorporation of the UNCRC and appointed to advise the Scottish Government on incorporation as a member of the UNCRC Incorporation Working Advisory Group. Adamson states that Boyle’s 

 “… research and analysis provided the basis for numerous written briefings, oral presentations and contributions to meetings and was core to the proposed bill submitted to Scottish Ministers on 20 November 2018. Her work was highly influential throughout the long negotiations with Scottish Government between our proposed bill and the eventual introduction of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child \(Incorporation\) \(Scotland\) Bill on 1 September 2020.” \(Bruce Adamson, **S6**\) 

 Juliet Harris, Director of Together, further states that Boyle’s contributions were 

 “**hugely significant in informing the model of incorporation put forward by the Scottish Government**. Dr Boyle brought a depth of experience on both justiciability of ESC rights and the constitutional implications of full and direct incorporation that was of great benefit to the Expert Advisory Group. Her specific expertise supported the international members of the group \[to\] apply their learning to the Scottish context.” 

 And this meant that the members’ conclusions 

 “were underpinned by a human rights\-focussed evidence\-base which would have otherwise been lacking. I believe **Dr Boyle’s work has played a central role influencing Scottish Government’s commitment to UNCRC incorporation, and ultimately in informing the Bill** that has just been laid before the Scottish Parliament” \( **S1**\). 

 As Adamson confirms: “Dr Katie **Boyle’s work has been essential in securing the commitment from the Scottish Government** to take a maximalist approach to incorporation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child within this session of the Scottish Parliament” \( **S6**\). John Swinney, Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, further thanked Boyle for her “valuable contribution” to the process of creating the bill, and stated that the 

 “Scottish Government is committed to implementing all of the majority views expressed by the \[Working Advisory\] Group either through the Bill itself, within the context of the implementation programme in support of the Bill, or through other policy and legislation” \(John Swinney, **S7**\). 

 Additionally, Boyle’s research and input has continued to play a role in the development of the Bill. As a Scottish Government representative \[redacted from publication to preserve anonymity\] \( **S8\(a\)**\) 

 This is also represented in the Equality and Human Rights Committee’s Stage 1 report \( **S8\(b\)**\) on the Bill, which references Boyle’s written evidence \( **R6**\) 24 times; this is also cited in the SPICe Summary of Evidence for the Bill \( **S8\(c\)**\). 

##  Impact 3. Creating a New Human Rights Framework for Scotland 

 Boyle’s research and expertise **has been, and continues to be, essential in Scotland’s on\-going development of a new statutory framework for the inclusion of ESCR into Scots law**. In early 2018, Boyle was appointed to the First Minister’s Advisory Group on Human Rights Leadership to advise on models of incorporation for ESCR. The Advisory Group \(comprising Boyle, Busby, Hunt, Lock, McCall, Morgera, Miller \[chair\], Nolan\) reported in December 2018 and recommended a new constitutional human rights Act of the Scottish Parliament that embeds ESCR and environmental rights into Scottish law \( **R4**\). 

 The chair of the Advisory Group, Professor Alan Miller, describes Boyle’s contribution as fundamental to the recommendations of the group. He comments: 

 “The central recommendation we \[the Advisory Group, including Boyle\] made was that there should be a bill prepared to be presented to the Scottish Parliament to establish a new human rights framework for Scotland… Katie \[Boyle\]'s work was very helpful in that regard, in terms of international practice and models and what might be best adapted to the Scottish context… She was a mine of information and knowledge that we could take advantage of… She was influential…in shaping the model that we presented as being a recommendation for a new human rights framework in Scotland”. \( **S9\(a\)**\) 

 Boyle’s research directly shaped the framework recommended by the Advisory Group in its final report. These recommendations directly let the Scottish Government to establish a  [National Task Force](https://www.gov.scot/groups/national-taskforce-for-human-rights-leadership/) in 2019, which continues to take the recommendations forward to create a new statutory framework. Boyle sits on the five\-member Academic Advisory Panel of this Task Force specifically in her capacity as an expert on models of incorporation of ESCR, access to justice and effective remedies. 

 Miller, co\-chair of the National Task Force, sees Boyle’s work as **“instrumentally influential in engineering”** the recommendation of the Task Force: to develop a model that “enables everyone to take a share of responsibility of making \[rights protection\] work, with an enhanced role for the Parliament, for the Judiciary, and for the Government” \( **S9\(a\)**\). Judith Robertson, Chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission and member of the Task Force, explains how Boyle’s research and expertise impacted on this ground\-breaking process: 

 “This work \[e.g. R5\] has been further built on through Dr Boyle’s membership of the Academic Advisory Group to the National Taskforce on Human Rights Leadership. This group is the follow up process to the Independent Advisory Group and Dr Boyle has further developed her analysis on effective implementation of ESC Rights and the most progressive legal frameworks required for that.” \( **S3**\) 

 She concludes that, “Dr Boyle’s knowledge, expertise and her willingness and ability to both inform and inspire **has made a significant impact on both the National Taskforce and wider civil society and public sector audiences engaging with that process**” \( **S3**\). The National Taskforce’s final report, published March 2021, contains numerous references to Boyle’s contributions to this process. The report will now form the basis of Scotland’s new human rights framework \( **S9\(b\)**\). 

##  Impact 4. Underpinning ESCR developments in other parts of the UK and internationally. 

 Boyle’s research has been adopted by civil society in other parts of the UK based on the success of legislative reform commencing in Scotland. The Bevan Foundation cite Boyle’s research in support of the right to housing in Wales \( **S4\(b\)**\). Just Fair, an organisation that monitors and campaigns for ESCR across the UK has also explicitly based its work on Boyle’s SHRC research \( **S4\(c\)**\). In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Assembly has relied on Boyle’s research in the Ad Hoc Committee on a Bill of Rights inquiry established in 2020 \( **S5\(a\)** & **\(b\)**\). Boyle is now funded by the  [Nuffield Foundation](https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/project/access-to-justice-for-social-rights-addressing-the-accountability-gap) to further examine the pathways to justice for violations of ESCR across the UK. The Global Initiative for ESCR is translating Boyle’s work into Spanish to inform the Chilean constitutional reform process. The United Nations Special Rapporteur cited Boyle’s 2018 report as an example of best practice in developing effective remedies for ESCR \( **S5\(c\)**\). The impact of Boyle’s research in Scotland therefore continues to permeate and resonate in developments further afield as providing a theoretical and practical framework for ESCR reform.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Each year >500,000 women worldwide die of the disease. Aggressive treatment strategies have doubled breast cancer survival rates since the 1970s; however, it is now recognised that many of these patients are over\-treated, resulting in unnecessary long\-term side effects and healthcare costs. Cambridge\-led clinical trials involving >6,000 patients in >150 UK Centres have identified those breast cancer patients who can be treated with reduced\-volume radiation and reduced\-duration anti\-HER2 antibody \(trastuzumab\) therapy. This research has directly changed practice in the UK, Canada, USA, Europe and India, underpinning a global de\-escalation in breast cancer therapy that spares qualifying patients from unnecessary side effects, preserves excellent survival rates, and reduces NHS treatment cost by up to GBP46,000,000 each year. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women: 55,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK, and over 2,000,000 are diagnosed worldwide. The increased use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies e.g. trastuzumab which targets the HER2 receptor on breast cancer cells, have increased patient survival rates from 40% in the 1970s to >80% today. However, it is now recognised that many patients are over\-treated, causing serious unwarranted side effects and unnecessary healthcare costs. To address these issues, Cambridge researchers led a series of UK\-wide clinical trials to test if treatment can be reduced safely in women with certain forms of breast cancer. 

 **Reducing radiotherapy:** Whole breast radiotherapy is a highly effective treatment of breast cancer. But this treatment causes significant, long\-term physical and psychological side effects in up to one third of patients \[Coles CE *et al.*, Clinical Oncology 2005\]. A further 0.5 to 1% of patients suffer life\-threatening radiation\-induced secondary malignancies and cardiac toxicities. The 2007\-2010 **IMPORT Low** randomised controlled trial \(Coles was Chief Investigator\) recruited 2,018 breast cancer patients, across 72 UK centres. After surgical removal of the tumour, patients received either: standard full dose, whole\-breast radiotherapy \(control\); reduced dose, whole\-breast radiotherapy \(reduced\-dose group\); or radiotherapy to the affected area only \(partial\-breast group\). All three treatments produced equally excellent disease control, with 5\-year ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rates of only 1.1% \(95% CI 0.5–2.3; control group\), 0.2% \(0.02–1.2; reduced\-dose group\) and 0.5% \(0.2–1.4; partial\-breast group\) \[1\]. Women receiving partial breast treatment also experienced significantly fewer side effects, with half as many women reporting moderate/marked changes in breast appearance compared with whole\-breast radiotherapy \(15% vs 27%\) \[1,2\]. Partial\-breast radiotherapy also halved exposure of the heart to radiation – a validated predictor of major, long\-term, cardiac side effects – in patients with left\-sided breast cancer \[Darby S *et al.*, NEJM 2013\]. 

 The 2011\-2014 UK **FAST Forward** trial \(Coles is a senior member of the Trial Management Group \[TMG\]\) demonstrated that 1\-week of whole\-breast radiotherapy is as effective in achieving local breast cancer control as 3 weeks of treatment \[3\]. By leading both the IMPORT Low and serving on the TMG of UK FAST Forward, Coles ensured that the control groups in both trials received identical radiation schedules enabling rapid and robust comparability between the studies. NHS England has invited Coles to work with them to implement 1\-week partial\-breast radiotherapy as standard of care for patients with low risk breast cancer. This represents a sea change in treatment and patient experience by reducing radiotherapy from 15 to just 5 treatments. 

 **Reducing targeted therapy:** Trastuzumab, given as a 12\-month course of treatment, has increased ten\-year survival rates for women with HER2\+ breast cancer from 75% to 84% \[Perez EA, JClinOncol, 2014\]. With funding from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme, Earl led the PERSEPHONE randomised trial to test whether trastuzumab treatment could be reduced safely from 12 to 6 months among patients with HER2\+ breast cancer. 4,088 patients across 153 UK centres were enrolled. Four\-year disease\-free survival rates were equally excellent among patients receiving 6 months \(89.4%\) or 12 months \(89.8%\) trastuzumab \(hazard ratio 1.07 \[90% CI 0·93–1·24\]; non\-inferiority p=0·011\). These results were reflected in similar overall survival. Importantly, patients receiving 6 months of treatment experienced significantly fewer severe adverse side effects \(19% *vs* 24%, p=0·0002\) and significantly fewer of these patients stopped trastuzumab early because of cardiac toxicities \(3% *vs* 8%, p<0·0001\) \[4,5\]. Together, the research of Coles and Earl has validated the notion that breast cancer treatment can be safely reduced to decrease side\-effects and unnecessary healthcare costs \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Coles and Earl’s research has directly informed clinical practice, sparing major side effects for patients while markedly reducing healthcare costs. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners and the delivery of professional services**</ins> 

 **Changing national guidelines and practice for breast cancer therapy:** Cambridge research has had a direct impact on national and international clinical practice for the treatment of Stage I\-II breast cancer: 

-  As a result of IMPORT Low, NICE 2018 guidance for early and locally advanced breast cancer: diagnosis and management \[A\] states: *‘Consider partial breast radiotherapy \(as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy\) for women who have had breast conserving surgery for invasive cancer \(excluding lobular type\) with clear margins and low absolute risk of local recurrence’.* 

-  UK Royal College of Radiologists breast radiotherapy consensus guidelines recommends partial breast radiotherapy for low risk patients \(patients 50 years with grade 1\-2, 30mm, oestrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative with minimum 1mm surgical resection margins and no lymphovascular invasion\) \[B\]. 

-  As a direct result of IMPORT LOW, regional NHS guidelines have been introduced by the North East Yorkshire and Humber Clinical Alliance and the West Midlands Expert Advisory Group for Breast Cancer, recommending the use of surgical clips on the wall of the tumour bed to enable partial radiotherapy as a standard approach, via increased accuracy of radiotherapy \[C\]. 

-  As a direct consequence of the PERSEPHONE trial, UK recommendations have been developed by an optimal duration of trastuzumab working group. In a 2020 survey of breast specialists, the majority \(78%\) agreed with 6 months as a standard option for those receiving single agent trastuzumab \[C\]. In addition, the 3,200 breast cancer patients treated with single agent trastuzumab each year in the UK could now benefit from reduced\-duration 6\-month treatment \[D\]. 

 **Changing international breast cancer therapy practice:** Internationally, the results of IMPORT Low have motivated numerous countries to change standard practice, implementing partial breast radiotherapy for low risk breast cancer patients. These include the Netherlands and Denmark, where national breast cancer guidelines have been changed to incorporate these new radiotherapy parameters \[E\]. IMPORT Low partial breast radiotherapy is now being used routinely in some of the largest and most technologically advanced cancer centres worldwide including: Australasia, Canada \(Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\), Canada Cancer Centres, and USA \(Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\) \[E\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on health and wellbeing of people**</ins> 

 **Reducing side effects for woman receiving radiotherapy:** The IMPORT Low trial demonstrated that women with low risk breast cancer can be treated safely and effectively with reduced\-dose or partial breast radiotherapy, causing fewer side effects than standard treatment. Importantly, this includes halving the number of women reporting marked changes in breast appearance or hardness that are associated with significant psychological sequelae. In the UK alone, 10,000 women per year are eligible for partial breast radiotherapy \[F\], which annually equates to 1,200 women spared physical changes in breast appearance and 500 patients spared breast hardness because of treatment \[1,2\]. Partial breast radiotherapy halves the mean heart dose for patients with left\-sided cancer, which reduces the predicted absolute lifetime risk of life\-threatening cardiac events to less than 0.5%, i.e. reducing from 50 to 25 such events per year \(DarbyS *et al.*NEJM 2013\). The reduction from 15 to 5 radiotherapy treatments will also have a positive effect on the patient experience, by minimising hospital visits and treatment\-associated side\-effects. 

 **Reducing side effects for women receiving targeted therapy:** The PERSEPHONE trial provides evidence for safe reduction of single agent trastuzumab therapy from 12 to 6 months. This reduced therapy, provides the same excellent survival benefit, but 5% \(365/1929 vs 460/1935\) fewer patients treated now suffer severe side effects and only 3% \(61/1977\) of women who receive 6 months of trastuzumab are likely to have to stop treatment because of heart problems, compared with 8% \(146/1941\) who receive 12 months \[D\]. Patients on trastuzumab most frequently report severe aches and pains \(9.3% \- 524/5610\) and fatigue \(8.2% \- 461/5610\), which can be minimised by reduced treatment \[D\]. 

 **Establishing therapy\-reduction research for patient benefit**:** Both IMPORT Low and PERSEPHONE were completed within the NHS Clinical Research Network with active patient advocate partnership throughout design, recruitment, analysis and dissemination \[G\]. The success of these two trials with non\-inferiority design, has been pivotal in establishing a priority theme of treatment reduction in National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) breast cancer trials and has received consistent and positive feedback from doctors and patients \[G\]. Benjamin Smith, Professor of Radiation Oncology and Health Services Research at The University of Texas MD Anderson, said regarding IMPORT Low: “ *In my opinion, this is one of the most important articles on early breast cancer to be published in this decade*.” Maggie Wilcox, who is the patient lead for the PERSEPHONE trial, said “ *I am delighted to have been part of this landmark trial which is an important step to reduce the length of treatment whilst not changing effectiveness.”* Professor Hywel Williams, Director of the NIHR HTA Programme that funded the PERSEPHONE study said: “ *This is a hugely important clinical trial that shows that more is not always better. Women will now have the potential to avoid unnecessary side effects of longer treatment without losing any benefit. In turn, this should help save vital funds for the NHS and prompt more studies in other situations where the optimum duration of treatment is not known. It is unlikely that research like this would ever be done by industry, so I am delighted that the NIHR are able to fund valuable research that has a direct impact on patients*.” \[H\]. 

 **Extending excellence in care to Low\- and Middle\-Income Countries \(LMICs\):** Trastuzumab has had World Health Organisation Essential Medicine designation since November 2015. However, the cost associated with 12 months of treatment precludes its widespread use in LMICs where it is estimated that over 1,000,000 people are diagnosed with breast cancer; \~120,000 of these patients have HER2\+ disease. Demonstration by PERSEPHONE that 6 months of treatment are as effective as 12 months has increased directly the use of the drug in several LMICs, resulting in improvement in the uptake of this curative treatment \[I\]. IMPORT Low uses a simple technique and conventional, widely available radiotherapy equipment, so can be implemented in any centre worldwide. 

 <ins> **Impact on commerce and the economy**</ins> 

 Standard whole breast radiotherapy consists of 25 fractions over 5 weeks in many countries worldwide. Based on UK tariffs \(GBP159 per fraction\), a reduction to 15 fractions of partial breast radiotherapy saves GBP1,590 per patient. The 2020 publication of the FAST Forward trial has enabled seamless adoption of just 5 radiation fractions for partial breast radiotherapy in the UK and in countries where 15 fractions are standard of care. Around 10,000 women are eligible for partial breast radiotherapy per year in the UK where the standard of care is 15 fractions: this saves 100,000 fractions of radiotherapy per patient and a saving of \~GBP16,000,000 per year for the NHS. Each year the NHS treats \~3,200 women with 12 months of single agent trastuzumab \(GBP22,000/patient\) total \~GBP70,000,000\). The Health Economic Analysis in PERSEPHONE showed within\-trial cost savings of GBP9,793 per patient by reducing treatment to 6\-months of trastuzumab \[J\]. Patients receiving single agent trastuzumab, which accounts for approximately half of all HER2\+ cases, equates to an annual cost\-saving of \~GBP30,000,000 to the NHS.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Internationally leading Open University research on local health\-related manufacturing in Africa and its implications for inclusive health care has had wide impacts on national, multilateral and philanthropic policy and professional practice by the following categories of stakeholder, with type of impact: 

-  *Local health sector manufacturers and manufacturing associations*: provision of evidence to strengthen their arguments for policy support for manufacturing development in East Africa; 

-  *East African health and industrial policy makers*: evidence cited, from project policy briefs, to support pharmaceutical manufacturing policy in the Tanzanian *Second Five\-Year Development Plan* \(2016\), and Tanzanian Ministerial interventions at East African Community \(EAC\) level; 

-  UN bodies: UNIDO, UNCTAD, Unitaid and WHO: policy influence through UN consultancies, invitations to present evidence for policy, expert evidence for UNIDO manufacturing consultations and policy advice, citations in UN policy documents; 

-  *European development aid*: influenced thinking of German Ministry for Development Cooperation on industrial influence on inclusive health care, including their support for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan of Action for East Africa; 

-  *International NGOs:\-* contributions by invitation to policy shaping by *Médicins sans Frontières* and the Access to Medicines Index; citations in NGO policy documents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A series of externally funded research projects and consultancies since 2006 **\[G1\-G4\]** have cumulatively built up an influential body of evidence on the benefits of local manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and other health supplies for health care quality and access to medicines and care in East Africa, in synergy with local industrial development. The ongoing policy\-focused research programme uniquely combines analysis of low\-income country health care systems with a corresponding investigation into local manufacturing capacity and the scope for synergies in linking industrialisation and development. The findings link huge unmet needs for essential medicines and supplies to the scope for locally based manufacturers to serve domestic health markets much more effectively **\[O1\]**, a topic which is now high profile because of the current pandemic. 

 The Open University \(OU\) team is led by **Mackintosh**, and includes Simonetti, Kale, Santos, **Papaioannou** and Cross \(all current OU staff\) as well as **Banda**, **Mugwagwa** and **Clark** \(previous OU staff\), and long\-term Visiting OU Fellows: Paula Tibandebage and Smita Srinivas. The research has traced, both internationally and locally in East Africa, manufacturing capabilities, supply chains, procurement processes, market structures and availability, price and access to supplies for health care. The projects, in Tanzania and Kenya with strong Indian collaboration, have cumulatively built up an international network of African, Indian and other scholars with policy influence, who are working to strengthen industrial\-health synergies in Africa. A widely read book **\[O1\]** drew on this network to bring together wider evidence on the developmental impact of health\-industrial synergies. 

 This research underpins the impacts listed below by providing evidence of: 

-  Locally produced medicines reaching rural and remote areas in East Africa more effectively than imports **\[O4\]**; 

-  Extensive opportunities to combine better health care with industrial development **\[O1, O2\]**; 

-  The key strengths and weaknesses of domestic supply chain linkages, and external pressures that tend to disaggregate them **\[O3\]**; 

-  The core challenges faced by locally based firms in upgrading production systems to achieve and sustain international competitiveness **\[O1\]**; 

-  Which existing policies support or undermine health\-industrial synergies **\[O2\]**; 

-  The health security dangers for Africa from very heavy reliance on Indian suppliers **\[O2, O6\]**; 

-  The crucial role of industry associations in shaping regulatory environments **\[O5\]**; 

-  How local health and procurement systems can reshape themselves to use local suppliers effectively to address population needs **\[O1, O3\]**. 

 Working with manufacturers and health policy actors, the OU team has analysed the scope for increasing local pharmaceutical production in Africa through national, regional and international policy changes, and identified conditions for synergies between local manufacturing and health sector improvement and access. Internationally, they have contributed strongly to a shift from questioning ‘whether’ local production of pharmaceuticals and related supplies was desirable in Africa to a concentration on ‘how’ this can be done in such a way as to benefit both industrial growth and the move towards Universal Health Coverage \(UHC\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of research addresses the problem of access to supplies and medicines in Africa and the extent to which local manufacturing improvement can assist. The issue is now very high profile, as the Covid\-19 pandemic generates nationally protective responses across the globe. The OU research group and its international network were early leaders in researching and shaping this policy field, in a manner now recognised as prescient, resulting in the following policy and practitioner impacts \(organised by type of stakeholder and influence\). 

 **\(i\) Local health sector manufacturers and manufacturing associations \(practitioner impact\)** 

 In Eastern and Southern Africa, the OU research was utilised “ *to really fill the gaps*” in advocacy papers concerning incentives for local manufacturing, and that expertise has been “ *practically very useful*” in “ *meetings where we had manufacturers and politicians together*”, as an African pharmaceutical manufacturer and head of a regional manufacturers association **\[C1\]** confirmed in 2020. He further commented that without that expertise, “ *the quality of our arguments would be less \[…\] we really would not have picked up the policy coherence*” requirement “ *because we don’t think that way*”. Two EAC officials supported by German development cooperation **\[C1\]** also confirmed in 2020 that the research “ *inspired the justification which we wrote for the EAC pharmaceutical bill*”. This justification was requested by “ *many high level decisionmakers \[...\] secretary generals of the EAC*” and was written “ *based very strongly*” on this research. The officials also confirmed that the research has “ *inspired the lobby and advocacy work of FEAPAM \[Federation of East African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations\]*”; the *“strong impact \[…\] provided a coherent narrative on local production of pharmaceuticals*” in relation to work on the East African *Regional Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan of Action* **\[C1\]**. Routes to these policy impacts have centrally involved the local research teams, for example, a presentation by Wangwe to the 1st East Africa Manufacturing Business Summit \(Uganda 2015\), where participants indicated messages were taken seriously because they came from independent research **\[C1\]**. The project book *Making Medicines in Africa,* launched by invitation at the Africa Pharmaceutical Summit East, March 2016, has been very widely downloaded \(now over 79,000 downloads\) and is “ *extensively quoted by authors across Africa regarding local production*” **\[C1\]**. 

 **\(ii\) East African health and industrial policy makers \(national policy influence\)** 

 National policy impact in Tanzania is evidenced by the use of text and findings from our Policy Briefs on reversing manufacturing decline in the Tanzanian *Second Five\-Year Development Plan \(2016\)* **\[C2\]** in support of a decision to prioritise pharmaceutical manufacturing development; that commitment was followed by a sharp increase in budgeted government funding for purchase of medicines, recognising the local synergies identified. Government members requested summary findings from the research team to feed into that document **\[C2\]**. The route to this striking national impact was through the close involvement of Tanzanian research team members in policy\-oriented research design; involving policy makers in research question identification; and through workshops for mutual feedback between senior policy makers and the research team leading, for example to citation of the team’s findings by the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in Tanzania at an EAC workshop in September 2015 **\[C2\]**. The research team also contributed on request detailed policy recommendations in June 2015 to a high\-level task force chaired by COSTECH  \(which manages scientific research in Tanzania\); while a 3\-day UNCTAD\-COSTECH workshop in Tanzania November 2015 on industry\-health links included an invited presentation from the team. At EAC level, the “ *justification*” for an EAC Pharmaceutical Bill, discussed in the Ugandan parliament in May 2020 was “ *inspired*” by the research evidence **\[C1\]**. 

 **\(iii\) International UN bodies and donor governments \(international policy influence\)** 

 This body of research has influenced UNIDO policy work since 2009. Two UNIDO officials **\[C3\]** reported that guidance from **Mackintosh** and **Banda**, research team members, “ *formed the backbone of the policy advice disseminated in the UNIDO guide*” on incentives for pharmaceutical production in Africa, published in 2019 \(no date on text\) **\[C3\]**.  In particular, **Mackintosh** “ *persuaded \[the official\] that market protection is a very important tool*”, when previously he “ *was quite opposed*”. The research “ *has certainly influenced what we \[UNIDO\] say*”. Without the research UNIDO “ *would not have the evidence base we have*”; the research is “ *cited on regular occasions”* and “ *has had quite a profound influence on our thinking and the way forward*”. “ *The international community is now aligned*” behind the local production agenda, and this research “ *certainly contributed a lot to that*” culminating in the joint agencies’ declaration at the World Health Assembly \(WHA\) in 2019 **\[C3\]**. UN and other multilateral  policy documents that have cited our work include UNRISD 2016 Flagship report on *Policy Innovations for Transformative Change* **\[C3\]**; the World Bank on *Creating Markets in Kenya* **\[C3\]**; and the UNDP Access and Delivery Partnership report on local pharmaceutical production in Tanzania **\[C3\]**. The unique research impact in the field is attested by the invitation to **Mackintosh** as the only academic presenting at the Ministerial\-level UNCTAD\-UNAIDS\-African Union side\-event at the World Investment Forum 2016 on pharmaceutical manufacturing. Additionally, a UNIDO official **\[C3\]** stated that the OU research programme is still “ *ahead of the curve*” on research and policy. 

 A German development cooperation official **\[C4\]** stated in 2020 that she commissioned an evidence brief **\[C4\]** from the team that was “ *able to show that it \[local manufacture of pharmaceuticals\] has spin\-off effects into the wider health context*”, including regulatory improvement and emergency preparedness. The report was presented at a WHO consultation, and the official stated that this was “ *very helpful*” in providing evidence where previously it was “ *very sketchy*”. She further noted that WHO people are “ *quite sceptical*” about the local production agenda, but it has now “ *found its way back onto the roadmap of access to medicines at the WHO*”. The research has helped German Development Cooperation “t *o communicate the wider impacts of local pharmaceutical production \[…\] very well*”. 

 In South Africa, a Department of Trade and Industry official **\[C5\]** attended a 2015 workshop on biopharmaceutical industry associations at the OU. She stated that this meeting facilitated a better understanding of the policy role of trade associations and generated new contacts for her work especially outside South Africa. In the UK, the project **\[G2\]** was the sole case selected in 2017 to showcase the impact of the DfID/ESRC Growth Programme to a new DfID Minister **\[C5\]**. A major follow\-on project on industry\-health synergies for cancer care has been funded **\[G4\]**: the funding panel feedback recognised the scope to build on the earlier project’s impact networks and pathways. 

 **International NGOs \(influence on policy thinking\)** 

 Some growing impact of this research can be evidenced on policy thinking by international NGOs. The OU team’s evidence that locally produced medicines reach rural areas more effectively than imports **\[O4\]** is cited in the South Centre’s report on TRIPS and medicines **\[C6\]**. **Mackintosh** was consulted in 2016 on institutional policy by *Médicins sans Frontières* \(MSF\), which at the time was reconsidering its role in global health policy and wished to reflect on its sources of supplies. Following the meeting, an MSF official **\[C6\]** stated that “ *I think you have contributed a lot to helping people to think differently about some common assumptions in MSF*”. The team was also consulted in 2017 as a stakeholder by the Access to Medicines Foundation on the methodology for their 2018 Index. A Foundation official wrote that the input on local manufacturing capacity building had been “ *so valuable*” **\[C6\]**. 

 **Summary** 

 This research has contributed strongly, as evidenced, to a major shift in policy thinking, decisions and action, and to manufacturers’ involvement in that process, on the subject of health\-related local manufacturing in Africa and its importance for local health care quality and access. The impact is evidenced within the private sector; at national, regional and international level; and increasingly in NGO thinking. The Covid\-19 pandemic has dramatically increased recognition, among African and international stakeholders, of the importance of African industrial supply capabilities for local health care systems, and the research team is continuing to work actively in this field both in research and responding to requests for policy involvement.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The campaign to retain the Southbank Centre’s ‘Undercroft’ as a place for skateboarders rather than retail cuts to the heart of heritage debates: what makes a space valuable and who gets to decide this? Ruiz’s research examined young people’s attachments to the Undercroft over its forty\-year history. The research created a newly collaborative relationship between the Long Live Southbank \(LLSB\) campaign and the Southbank Centre, resulting in the restoration of the Undercroft and the creation of a Children and Young People’s Centre. It informed a new grant programme for young people from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The research changed perceptions of heritage and skating, facilitating change for skater groups, and generated advocacy support and improved services for young people. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Dr Ruiz specialises in researching the way that dissent is mediatized, and what this means for social and political activism. Her monograph *Articulating dissent: protest and the public sphere* \[R6\] combined fine\-grained ethnography with the analysis of uses of media in various protest movements \(the use of media by protesters as well as the media representation of protests and protesters\). It is this analytic mixture that combines investigating the actuality and potential of media in social struggles with a deeply ethnographic approach to understanding the experiences of dissenters that lay the foundations of the research for this project. *Engaging Youth in Cultural Heritage*, an AHRC\-funded project that started at the end of 2014, was designed and directed by Ruiz and included peer researchers from the Universities of Glasgow \(Madgin\), East Anglia \(Snelson\), and Newcastle \(Webb\). The research was collaborative and Ruiz’s contribution ran across all aspects of the project. As PI she structured the project, assembled archival material, conducted walking interviews, analysed findings, produced and co\-directed the films, organized the workshop and produced the website. 

 The research focused on young people’s attachments to the Southbank Undercroft – the “world’s oldest surviving skateboarder spot” – and how their campaign to resist its replacement with shops and restaurants \(a planned ‘refurbishment’ that the Southbank Centre announced in 2013\) might involve ideas about heritage. The research followed the Long Live Southbank \(LLSB\) campaign that was established by the Undercroft community to save the site \[R5\]. Working with a grassroots organisation \(BrazenBunch\) and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the research investigated the way young people communicated their attachments to policy makers and the wider public. The research used oral histories, filmed walking interviews, visual and documentary analysis. 

 The problem\-oriented research \(How can the campaign to save the Undercroft succeed? How can the Southbank Centre incorporate skateboarding into their self\-understanding? How can heritage be rethought to include skateboarding?\) produced two widely disseminated research films *You Can’t Move History* \[R1\] \(produced by Ruiz\) and *You Can Make History* \[R5\] \(co\-directed by Ruiz\); a report published by the Heritage Lottery fund \[R2\]; and \(to date\) two peer\-reviewed journal articles \[R3 and R4\]. The extensive ethnographic research revealed the value of the Undercroft as a ‘found space’ for skateboarding \[R3\] \(as opposed to purpose\-built spaces\) which embodies subcultural experience and knowledge \(subcultural heritage, subcultural memory\). It also recognised the importance of the ways in which young people’s conceptualisation of time differed from the understandings currently embedded in the legislative heritage system. This unique research was the first time that cultural studies scholarship had focused critical attention on the overlap between subcultural knowledge and the cultural politics of heritage. The deeply ethnographic work challenged heritage discourse’s understanding of temporality, while complicating our understanding of subcultural experience \(for instance the conceptualising of skateboarding as a form of action art\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of the research has resulted in long\-term changes to the built environment of the Southbank, in changes to heritage policy, and in changed perceptions and practices around heritage and skateboarding. 

 <ins> **Transformative Communication**</ins> 

 The project’s central mode of impact was via the films and associated workshops. These allowed the skaters’ voices to be heard by institutional stakeholders including representatives from Southbank Centre \(SBC\), Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic England, the Mayor’s Office, and others. The Youth Engagement officer at the BFI commented that the film and the workshop “bridged the gaps between the young people and the policymakers” creating a mutual intelligibility which hitherto hadn’t been possible \[S1\] **.** This was recognized by the Director of Policy and Partnerships at the Southbank Centre, who said that the workshop “brought all the participants together” and “helped lift the lessons and the key meanings out of the heat of the campaign” and made the SBC realise why “you can’t move this history” \[S2\]. 

 Participating in this research increased skaters’ capacity to connect with policy and statutory bodies and “gave confidence and a voice to people who wouldn’t have it otherwise” \[S3a\]. A skateboarder who spoke at the workshop, said “it brought us together with a lot of people who it is helpful for us to have conversations with” \[S3b\]. Another young skater, who at 15 had been expelled from school, was able to gain “authority and confidence” from speaking on the workshop panel \[S3a\]. 

 Following on from the first workshop, and as a result of improved relations, LLSB and the SBC successfully applied for planning permission to extend and restore the Undercroft. This work \(which includes a Centre for Children and Young People\) was completed shortly after the second workshop. As \[text removed for publication\] of LLSB argues: “If Pollyanna \[Ruiz\] hadn’t done that film that history wouldn’t have been recorded and that valuable case study material which has inspired so many people wouldn’t exist and those unheard voices that the film documents would never have been heard” \[S3a\]. 

 <ins> **Changing heritage organisations**</ins> 

 The value of this research was recognised by the Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\) who asked the researchers to create a report in which young people could express their sense of value in relation to historic places; its purpose was to enable their views to inform the ongoing evolution of the heritage sector in the UK, particularly the HLF’s youth programme, ‘Young Roots’ \[R2\]. Deputy Director of Strategy Karen Brookfield noted that the research fed “into a more general strategic thinking …\[about\]…our next strategic framework, what will HLF fund, and how” \[S4\]. In 2016 the Heritage Lottery Fund launched a £10million investment to make heritage relevant to the lives of young people aged 11\-25 \[S5\]. Brookfield described this major new development as containing the ‘legacy’ of Ruiz’s project \[S6\]. The extent of this change was recognized by the head of Policy and Partnerships at the Southbank Centre Mike McCart, who said the research “grabbed both Historic England ... and Heritage Lottery Fund’s interest. They were always being subjected to criticism about being fuddy duddy and only talking to old people … both those conservation bodies began to realize that there was a thing called communal value or intangible value” \[S2\]. 

 Outside of the HLF, Ruiz’s research has been used to evaluate heritage programmes. When the consultancy agency MHM Insight \(an agency supporting charity, heritage and cultural organisations with audience engagement\) were asked to evaluate an English Heritage project ‘Shout out Loud’ and a National Trust project working with young people in community green spaces, they adopted the ethos of Ruiz’s project by valuing young people speaking in their own voices, the role of youth\-led design, and the concept of ‘found space’ \[S7\]. \[text removed for publication\] of MHM Insight, said: “Pollyanna’s research has served as a constructive model of good practice for us, and had a tangible value to us in terms of learning for our organisation” \[S7\]. 

 <ins> **Changing</ins> <ins>P</ins><ins>erceptions</ins> <ins>and Practices</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 *You Can’t Move History* won best film in the AHRC’s Research in Film Awards 2016. The panel noted that “this remarkable piece of work challenges easy assumptions about heritage and creates a fascinating portrait of contemporary urban outsiderness in the process” \[S8\]. The extensive dissemination of the film \(20,000 views on Vimeo and YouTube, presentations in Sweden, Spain, Austria, Italy, Canada, Taiwan, Australia as well as in the UK to over 1,000 people\) has altered perceptions about heritage and subcultures. For example, a programme officer at UNICEF UK said that the film “opened my eyes to the beauty and far\-reaching benefits of the skate community for young people” \[S9\]. The Director of the Museum of London has added it to the museum’s archive and said; “this research deeply resonates with me as I consider how to create a more tangible and connected place called the Museum of London” \[S10\]. And Sara Crofts, Head of Historic Environment, Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\) said “I try and use \[the project\] where I can around getting people to rethink their notion of heritage, both policy\-makers, potential grant applicants or stakeholders…” \[S11\]. 

 The research has also been used by grassroots skater organisations from Gateshead to Norwich. As just one example, Skate Southampton used the film \(and Ruiz\) as the basis for talking to local councillors and representatives of the police. The film helped “explain to people clearly what we wanted to achieve” \[S3c\]. One major tangible result was an increase in funding for revamping the city skate parks from £50K to £250K.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Obesity affects a third of UK children and is a major determinant of health inequality and outcomes with substantial cost implications. University of Liverpool research exposed the inadequacy of existing public health policy and showed that a 9pm watershed on unhealthy food advertising would reduce childhood obesity, improve health outcomes, and deliver substantial health cost benefits. These findings were used to engage, and inform, public and stakeholder audiences and directly influenced the policy position of public health agencies, charities and advocacy groups. This has led to the adoption of a major new and unique UK\-wide health policy with the UK Government’s decision in July 2020 to introduce a watershed on advertising as part of their obesity strategy. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Effective restriction of children’s exposure to high fat, sugar, and salt \(HFSS\) food and beverage \(hereafter, food\) is a key recommendation of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) for tackling childhood obesity. Since 2009, the UK Government have banned such advertising around television programming ‘of particular appeal’ to children under 16 years \(based on the proportion of children in the viewing audience\) and on dedicated children’s channels. The implementation of stronger restrictions was impeded by a lack of clarity over i\) the strength of evidence that advertising impacts on eating, ii\) the potential causal relationship between HFSS advertising and increased body weight, iii\) the efficacy of existing regulations, and iv\) an effective policy option to meaningfully reduce child exposure to HFSS advertising. 

 Boyland and colleagues provided crucial evidence of advertising harms, being the first group to demonstrate through meta\-analysis \(including several of their own published studies\) in 2016 that television food advertising exposure leads to significantly greater food intake in children \[3.1\], a result since corroborated by others. Boyland also showed that children do not compensate for this increased intake at subsequent eating occasions \[3.2\] and that existing research satisfies all key criteria commonly used to establish causal relationships in epidemiology \[3.3\], providing critical evidence for a causal pathway linking unhealthy advertising exposure with greater body weight. 

 Our research also exposed the fundamental shortcomings of the current policy of regulating programming directed at children specifically. We conducted the largest TV advertising monitoring study in the world to date, and this demonstrated that the 2009 policy had not meaningfully reduced children’s exposure to unhealthy food advertising \[3.4\]. Further monitoring conducted in collaboration with the Obesity Health Alliance \(OHA, a coalition of over 45 health charities, medical royal colleges and campaign groups\) showed that a majority \(59%\) of food advertisements shown during family viewing time \(6\-9pm when the number of children watching TV is at its highest\) would be banned from children’s TV under the existing rules \[3.5\]. This illustrated that the policy was insufficient because the restrictions did not cover the content watched by the greatest numbers of children \(namely family entertainment shows, soap operas etc, programming not specifically directed at children\). 

 We then proposed an alternative policy, in which a 9pm ‘watershed’ could be applied to prevent unhealthy food advertising being broadcast during family viewing time \[3.5\] and therefore better ensuring that such advertising was not seen by children. Boyland and colleagues quantified the potential health impact and wider benefits of the proposed policy. The research found that the watershed policy would result in a health\-related net monetary benefit of GBP7,400,000,000 to society, by effectively reducing children’s exposure to HFSS advertising on television, decreasing daily caloric intake, and thus reducing childhood overweight and obesity \[3.6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Boyland’s research has had a unique and material impact on UK food advertising policy. This work has definitively demonstrated the impact of high fat, sugar, salt \(HFSS\) food advertising on children’s consumption and clarified the causal relationship between food advertising exposure and body weight outcomes. The research  also highlighted the shortcomings of  existing food advertising policy, identified an alternative policy, demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the alternative policy, engaged public and stakeholder audiences  and directly influenced the policy position of public health agencies, charities and advocacy groups. This led to the UK Government, in July 2020, being the first in the world to announce the alternative policy \(a 9pm watershed for unhealthy food advertising on television\) as part of its UK wide obesity strategy. 

 Prior to this, and since 2009, UK Government policy was limited only to banning advertising of foods and non\-alcoholic beverages high in fat, sugar and/or salt \(HFSS\) around television programming ‘of particular appeal’ to children under 16 years, and on dedicated children’s channels. Boyland’s research identified and addressed key roadblocks preventing progress towards greater restrictions on HFSS advertising, namely a lack of clarity over i\) the strength of evidence that advertising impacts on eating, ii\) the potential causal relationship between HFSS advertising and increased body weight, iii\) the efficacy of existing regulations, and iv\) an effective policy option to meaningfully reduce child exposure to HFSS advertising. 

##  Evidence of advertising impact 

 Boyland, with UoL colleagues, has conducted over 30 studies showing the impact of unhealthy food advertising on eating behaviour in children. Boyland and the UoL team were the first to demonstrate through meta\-analysis of 40 years of experimental evidence, including several of their own studies, that television food advertising exposure leads to significantly greater food intake in children. Thus, their work has substantially strengthened and clarified the evidence base and demonstrated the need for effective policy action. 

##  Evidence of shortcomings of existing policy and proposing an alternative 

 Boyland’s research demonstrated that the 2009 policy had not achieved its aim of reducing children’s exposure to HFSS food advertising on television, and that this was largely due to its scope being limited to programming made for children rather than programming watched by children in greatest numbers \(i.e., primetime family shows\). Boyland and colleagues proposed a 9pm watershed policy as a more appropriate way of ensuring the rules captured the broadcasting \(and therefore the unhealthy advertising\) seen by children, and showed that it would reduce childhood obesity, improve health outcomes, and deliver substantial health cost benefits. 

##  Engaging media discourse and building public opinion 

 Boyland’s studies have informed and enhanced broader public and stakeholder engagement with the issue of food advertising to children. The substantial media attention across local, national and international media outlets \(including newspapers, radio and TV\) \[5.1\], as well as significant engagement in social media, has extended the impact of academic research into increasing public awareness of the health implications of unhealthy food marketing exposure, contributing to putting \(and keeping\) this issue on the Government agenda. The media and public pressure generated has contributed to the new watershed policy being adopted. 

##  Informing and influencing the position of public health agencies, charities, and advocacy groups 

 Boyland’s public engagement and knowledge exchange activities have ensured that her research has had influence beyond academia. Furthermore, reports by University of Liverpool have been commissioned by major UK and international public health agencies, charities and advocacy groups  \[5.2\]. Boyland’s research was cited extensively in written submissions from leading NGOs, including the Obesity Health Alliance and Cancer Research UK \(CRUK\) to the UK Government’s Health and Social Care Committee’s Childhood Obesity Inquiry in spring 2018 \(67% of inquiry submissions on food advertising cited Boyland’s research to support their position\) and the subsequent advertising policy consultation \[5.3\]. A report authored by Boyland \[3.5\] was shared with 154 contacts at 45 organisations via the OHA mailing list, and it has been referenced in 6 MP briefings over the last three years \(each sent to 650 UK MPs\). It also has at least 5 references in Hansard \(the official report of the proceedings of the Houses of Commons and Lords\) demonstrating that it formed a core part of policymaker discussion on this issue. A recent industry report labelled OHA and Boyland’s research “often influential”. Key national executive public health agencies \(Public Health England\) and NGOs \(Obesity Health Alliance\) have corroborated the impact of Boyland’s research evidence on their policy\-related positions and activities, and the unique and critical role that Boyland and her research played in securing the commitment from the Government to toughen its policy on food advertising to children \[5.4\]. 

##  Inform Government’s policy position 

 Boyland has actively engaged in knowledge translation and consultancy with policymakers to drive evidence\-based policy action, including giving several invited presentations on evidence for food advertising impact to Public Health England, the Department for Health and Social Care and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Boyland drew on the findings of her research on advertising impact and policy evaluation \[3.1\]\-\[3.5\] in her written submission to the Childhood Obesity Inquiry in 2018 \[5.5\]. Boyland was subsequently invited as an expert witness to give oral evidence to the committee in May 2018 \[5.6\]. The subsequent Inquiry report \[5.7\] cited Boyland’s research and oral evidence 5 times, using it to underpin its call for the Government to include further restrictions on junk food marketing in its childhood obesity strategy. 

 The UK Government Childhood Obesity Plan \(June, 2018\) \[5.8\] acknowledged that food marketing influences children’s eating, citing two of Boyland’s papers to support this \(including \[3.1\]\), and committed to consulting on a 9pm watershed. As part of the consultation, the Government published an impact assessment \[5.9\] that cited three of Boyland’s papers \(including \[3.1\] and \[3.3\]\). Boyland again drew on the findings of her research in her written response to the consultation, as did numerous NGOs, particularly highlighting the findings of \[3.6\] that a watershed would reduce childhood obesity by approximately 5% and result in a health\-related net monetary benefit of GBP7,400,000,000 to society. During June and July 2020, Boyland was directly consulted on the evidence for a 9pm watershed policy by telephone and e\-mail by Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care. In July 2020, the UK Government announced a new obesity strategy including a 9pm watershed for HFSS food advertising on television \[5.10\]. The Department of Health and Social Care have corroborated the key role of Boyland’s research and knowledge translation in the decision\-making underpinning the introduction of the health policy, further advertising restrictions in the UK \[5.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research in the Built Environment & Sustainable Technologies \(BEST\) Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University \(LJMU\) allows sustainable and low\-cost repairs, surfacing and maintenance of the existing asphalt, reducing the need for a complete resurfacing of roads. The application of thin layers postpones major repairs for several years and is suitable for all types of roads, therefore reducing the costs of major reconstruction works as well as reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emission and preventing disruption to infrastructure users. Since developing new products based on the research at LJMU and developed with LJMU, Colas Ltd has increased annual sales by over €7M in the UK and France through laying over 850,000 m<sup>2</sup> of roads in 2018 and 2019 using the new product, with similar projections for 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The LJMU Research Team comprises Professor Hassan Al Nageim \(Lead\) and Dr Clare Harris from the Civil Engineering Department, Linda Seton and Nicola Dempster from the School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences and Dr Howard Robinson, Managing Director of ASI Solutions as an external advisor. This multi\-disciplinary team, supported by seven PhD students, have spent twenty years at LJMU working in the field of improving the properties of hot mix asphalt \(HMA\), culminating in 2 granted patents \(PT1 and PT2\). The research behind these patents sparked interest and collaboration with companies including Colas Ltd, Tarmac Ltd, and Velocity UK Ltd. This collaboration led to the team’s research focusing on \(i\) zero CO<sub>2</sub> emission cold mix asphalt \(CMA\) using secondary cementitious materials \(SCM\), \(ii\) micro\-asphalt \(EF1\), and \(iii\) bituminous emulsions for roads and highways surfacing \(EF2\). 

 The team responded to environmental and industry needs, namely: \(i\) sustainable development \(the use of CMA to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to 85% and a reduction of fume exposure by 100%\); \(ii\) asphalt production improvements \(simplified cold mix plants, produced on site \(i.e. mobile plant\), longer storage period\); \(iii\) cost effectiveness \(no heating for storage or mixing, use of industrial waste materials\); \(iv\) improving engineering properties \(high stiffness modulus, high rutting resistance and high fatigue resistance\); and \(v\) improving durability compared to traditional hot mix asphalt \(high resistance to rainfall and water\). 

 The team focused in particular on researching the properties of CMA \(Cold Mix Asphalt\), which can be prepared and constructed at ambient temperature, is cheaper to produce, easier to transport and has no health and safety issues compared to HMA. This was achieved by experimenting with different waste streams to formulate new cold bituminous emulsion mixtures \(CBEM\) \(UR1\) similar to what had been achieved with HMA in PT1 and PT2. This then led to experiments comparing the mechanical strengths between these new mixes along with the traditional HMA methods \(UR2\) and then comparing different waste streams to improve the curing times of CMA to make it comparable to HMA \(UR3\). The combined lab results of all of these components are reported in UR4, which was the start of a KTP \(EF1\) with Colas Ltd taking this research forward to a new product for Colas. 

 Hot mix asphalt produces 221kg of CO<sub>2</sub> / tonne during the mixing and paving process, whereas CMA has zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during mixing and paving. The UK produces 26 million tonnes of HMA per year. However, to date and since 1957 when CMA was first introduced in the USA, conventional CMA has not had the durability and mechanical strength of HMA and has a long curing time \(2\-24 months\) and is therefore restricted for use only in footways and lightweight trafficked pavements. In response to a request from the Tarmac R&D Managing Director in 2000, to explore green and cheap technologies to challenge the restrictions imposed by road engineers on the use of conventional CMA, the LJMU research team provided, for the first time worldwide, CMA containing secondary cementitious materials from waste ashes suitable for road and highways asphalt structural layers with a curing time of less than 1 day, a stiffness modulus 27 times more than a mixture with commercial limestone dust after 3 days, and with significant resistance to rutting in wheel\-track tests at high temperatures. These results are much better than the two grades of hot asphalt concrete binder course \(currently used by road engineers\) meaning it can carry heavy traffic loads in hot climate conditions. 

 The research team continued to research and develop a new fast\-curing and environmentally friendly cold asphalt concrete for binder courses mixture \(CACB\) following the success of EF1. The result \(UR5 and UR6\) is a mix that has the same gradation as that of traditional hot asphalt concrete mixtures but incorporates a binary blended cementitious filler \(BBCF\) containing waste, high calcium fly ash \(HCFA\) and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue \(FC3R\) activated by a waste alkaline NaOH solution. The benefits of the new mixture are significantly improved mechanical properties including water susceptibility, and a substantially lower thermal sensitivity than traditional hot asphalt concrete binder course mixtures.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact has been through: \(i\) the development and commercialisation of a product \(COLBIFIBRE\) in the UK and EU, with annual sales of over 7m EU in 2018 and 2019, and \(ii\) the development of another novel product \(Colbond 50X Emulsion\), which has recently gone into production. 

 **\(i\) Sale of products in the UK and EU \(COLBIFIBRE\)** 

 LJMU’s previous research involving experimentation with different waste streams to formulate new cold bituminous emulsion mixtures \(CBEM\)\(UR1\), comparing the mechanical strengths between these new mixes along with the traditional HMA methods \(UR2\) and then comparing different waste streams to improve the curing times of CMA \(UR3\) resulted in Colas Ltd collaborating in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with LJMU \(EF1\). The compound COLBIFIBRE was developed through this KTP 2013\-2015, where the exact mix of the compound is commercially sensitive and belongs to Colas Ltd. 

 COLBIFIBRE improves the durability of existing asphalt, allowing the aging stock of roads and highways to remain in service for longer. In addition, it provides a construction environment that is more cost effective and produces no CO<sub>2</sub> during its production and construction, as it is bonded using cold bituminous emulsions. 

 “In 2015, the research results on fibre reinforced micro asphalt were presented to Colas Ltd who partnered with LJMU to perform on\-site trials in Leeds and assess its performance.  Subsequently, Colas decided to commercialise the product and use it in a number of their road surfacing contracts for Local Authorities in the UK on roads and city streets. In France, the technology has been used in the development of a combined surface treatment called COLBIFIBRE, with applications on highways/roads ranging from traffic categories T5 to T1.” \(EV2\) 

 “In 2018, the revenue for COLBIFIBRE was about 4m Euros, accounting for resurfacing of more than 500,000 m2 of roads. The sales in 2019 dropped to over 3m Euros, due to difficult trading conditions, accounting for more than 350,000 m2 of roads, and sales indicate similar trade in the first half of 2020, before activity recovers.” \(EV3\) 

 The local councils in the UK, France, and Ireland prefer this material application as a maintenance surface layer over other types of road surface layers such as hot rolled asphalt, dense bitumen macadam and mastic asphalt to treat road surface aging. 

 “In France, it is used when pavement degradation is too severe to be treated with other single types of treatment and it restores impermeability to the road surface, improves skid resistance of the surface course, and extends the service life.” \(EV2\) 

 None of the conventional micro\-asphalts possess the unique characteristics of this product, which include reinforced anti\-cracking complex micro\-asphalt; dual fibre reinforcement and dual asphalt coating to block cracks; reinforcement of the new wearing course; waterproofing the pavements; and repair of affected areas in a single day. Thin layers postpone major repairs for several years and are suitable for all types of roads. \(EV1\) 

 **\(ii\) New product development \(Colbond 50X Emulsion\)** 

 This new emulsion was developed through a second KTP \(EF2\) for Colas Ltd in 2019.  The emulsion is the first of its kind internationally and emerged through defined industrial needs. Colas required a product to achieve improved bonding strength for a bonding coat applied between pavement layers, which when applied would be able to penetrate dust on the surface and also when fully broken would prevent ‘pick\-up’ on wheels, tracks or tyres of the paver/delivery vehicles. \(EV4, EV5\) 

 Colbond 50X Emulsion \(EV4, EV5\) is also a spray application on road surfaces to promote a stronger adhesion between an old road surface and the new bituminous overlay. This new emulsion made its way into production at Colas’ Warrington UK Emulsion and Micro\-asphalt plant in February 2020.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 King’s researchers worked closely with the Department for Transport \(DfT\) Drink and Drug Driving Policy Unit, playing a leading role in the use of biomarkers to assess fitness to drive. King’s research has improved UK road safety ,supported the introduction of a new biomarker for mandatory ‘Fitness to drive’ re\-assessment of drink\-drivers and helped establish the UK as a policy leader in this area. . King’s led a systematic review for DfT on the growing problem of drug driving, recommending 17 controlled and illicit drugs as dangerous for driving. This provided the evidence for the UK’s first strict liability drug\-driving offence \(s5A Road Traffic Act\) in 2015. In the first 316 days after legislation came into effect, approximately 8,599 convictions took place; this trajectory has continued, with >10,000 drug driving convictions in 2018. King’s is contributing to innovative approaches for robust roadside testing of evidential samples and plans for a high\-risk drug\-driving offender scheme.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **King’s develop biomarker led assessment of high\-risk drink\-drivers allows more accurate relicensing decisions.** As described in a REF2014 case study, King’s researchers have worked closely with the UK Department for Transport \(DfT\) and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency *\(*DVLA *\)* since 2006.  This research focused on developing biological measures \(biomarkers\) to increase the ability of law enforcement agencies to act against drink\-driving. King’s secured DfT research funding \(2006\) to identify a biomarker to screen high\-risk drink\-drivers on the DVLAs High Risk Offender Scheme, \(for drivers who are convicted of repeated or serious drink driving offences\) **\[1\]**.  King’s showed that testing for Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin \(CDT, a protein produced by the liver\) could be used as a sole blood test to identify continuing alcohol consumption in disqualified drivers applying for re\-licensing **\[2\]**. King’s then developed a traffic light system, based on detected CDT concentration to aid decision making for medical staff at the DVLA. Subsequently, King’s showed CDT to be superior to other blood markers such as gamma glutamyl transferase because it enables better differentiation of dependent versus social drinking **\[3\]**. 

 **Drug\-driving road traffic collisions are a serious and increasing issue in the UK.** The issue of rising road\-traffic collisions \(RTCs\) caused by drink\- and drug\-driving came to a head following a public campaign \(2012\-2015\) after a young girl was killed by a driver intoxicated with cannabis. At that time, and in contrast to drink\-driving: \(i\) there was no systematic understanding of whether or which drugs dangerously impacted safe driving; \(ii\) the Police had limited options for reliable roadside drug testing; and \(iii\) there was no UK strict liability offence to prosecute drug\-driving offences. This campaign led to a public petition presented to the Prime Minister with 22,000 signatories calling for specific action on drug\-driving, alongside tightening action on drink\-driving. Based on her expertise in forensic toxicology in relation to drink\-driving, Professor Wolff was appointed to Chair the Government’s expert technical panel \(DfT Road Safety Division\) on Drug Driving and was awarded UK Government funding to carry out a systematic review of all available research, to identify specific drugs that were unsafe for driving **\[4,5,6\]**. 

 **King’s researchers provide new evidence of drug\-driving harms.** A King’s\-led systematic review introduced the concept of risk\-based road safety. This statistically driven approach identified the risk of a RTC when under the influence of certain drugs. For instance, drivers under the influence of cannabis \(blood concentration ≥ 1 µg/L\) have twice the risk of a RTC compared to drivers who have not taken the drug \(OR: 1.89; CI 1.43‐2.51\). King’s brought to the attention of the Government that alcohol use alongside cannabis increased this RTC risk significantly: drivers being 16 times more likely when compared to a non\-using driver. In addition, King’s also highlighted that driving under the influence of medicinal controlled drugs such as benzodiazepines increased the likelihood of a RTC 8.5 times. Overall, King’s identified 17 medicinal controlled and illicit drugs known to increase the risk of RTCs and made recommendations for blood concentration limits, particularly concerning cannabis \(the most used illicit drug in the UK\) for the new strict liability offence **\[4,5,6\]**. King’s advocated changing the assessment of driving under the influence of drugs from an impairment \(subjective\) model to an evidence\-based approach. 

 **King’s use expertise on drug\-driving toxicology to lead a systematic review of alternative biological matrices for use as an evidential sample for drug driving.** Proving a suspected driving offence requires drug tests following blood sampling; for accurate evidence, confirmatory blood samples must be obtained quickly. However, in RTC scenarios, the practical difficulties of obtaining blood tests often hamper drug testing. A second King’s\-chaired expert panel \(2015\-17\), a collaboration with Queen Mary University, evaluated the potential of different biological samples for tests to confirm drug\-driving offences. Oral fluid \(saliva\) was identified as a viable alternative to blood testing for illicit drugs compared to sweat, hair and urine because it can be easily collected, including at the roadside. This review was published by the DfT in August 2017 **\[7\]**. 

 **King’s investigate synthetic oral fluid for type approval of roadside drug\-driving tests.** Currently, the only roadside drug\-driving tests are non\-quantitative screening devices, which detect the presence of cannabis or cocaine in saliva \(oral fluid\) collected from the tongue. These tests need to be confirmed by quantitative analyses, which require collecting a blood sample, before results can be used as evidence in court. King’s was funded by the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology \(CAST\) to explore whether quantitative oral fluid tests could be undertaken at the roadside \(2016\-2018\). A significant challenge is calibrating potential roadside devices for Home Office approval \(‘type approval’\). This process requires much larger volumes of oral fluid than is practicable to collect from humans. King’s therefore characterised a Home Office formula for synthetic oral fluid \(SOF\) to develop a viable synthetic oral fluid \(SOF\) alternative **\[8\]**. 

 **King’s demonstrated that SOF samples can be kept stable and sterile, crucial for roadside drug testing.**  King’s then successfully bid for further CAST funding to investigate drug stability in SOF, another crucial element of type approval testing. King’s employed state\-of\-the\-art laboratory instruments \(hyphenated liquid chromatography\-mass spectrometry\-LC\-MS/MS\) to show that SOF drug solutions performed as well as blood samples, with highly reproducible results. King’s have led research in this area, conclusively demonstrating the stability of the most used illicit drugs \(cannabis and cocaine\) in SOF, giving a viable means to approve roadside drug\-testing devices. **\[8\]**.  King’s further determined whether SOF is susceptible to microbial contamination, and whether this impacts the stability of SOF containing drug samples. SOF samples challenged with five common microbial species – two fungal species \(Candida albicans and Aspergillus brasiliensis\) and three bacterial species \(Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus\) – were tested alongside two separate antimicrobials \(sodium azide and ProClin®300\). King’s confirmed that it is feasible to maintain sterility and stability using SOF in combination with ProClin®300 antimicrobial agent **\[8\]**. Collectively, this work demonstrated that SOF provides a feasible, practical alternative approach to develop roadside evidential drug testing.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The public health importance of substance abuse was recognised in the UN Sustainable Development Goals \(SDG3\) which aim to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse and harmful use of alcohol, as well as aiming to halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic collisions \(RTCs\). 

 **King’s research improved the UK DVLA’s medical re\-assessment of disqualified drink\-drivers to allow more accurate relicensing decisions.** Before 2014 the DVLA employed a suite of liver function tests \(LFTs\) to re\-assess high\-risk drink\-drivers, and decisions were often delayed because other common medical problems \(e.g., hypertension, non\-alcoholic liver disease\) might confound test results. Following King’s research on biomarkers for drink\-driving originally described in a REF2014 case study \(1\-3\), the UK Department for Transport \(DfT\) introduced Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin \(CDT\) testing in the mandatory medical reassessment of all drink\-drivers as part of the relicensing process. Since full adoption as the sole biomarker by the DVLA in 2014, it has been mandatory in England and Wales for the CDT test to be included in the ‘Fitness to Drive’ assessment for high\-risk offenders \(HROs\) **\[A\]**. Within this REF period \(1 August 2013 onwards\), there have been an estimated 23,000 CDT tests carried out in the UK per year for relicensing high\-risk drink drivers **\[B\]**.  During 2015, 25,933 HROs were referred for CDT testing, of which 90.7% fell into the green CDT range and were issued a licence \(CDT <2.1%\); 3.1% an amber range CDT requiring further investigation; and 6.2% had a CDT in the red range \(>3%\) and, were refused a licence **\[B\]**. 

 Providing evidence and expert advice to support the first ever UK Drug\-Driving legislation. Road traffic injuries are a growing public health problem causing emotional and economic harm. The World Health Organization \(WHO\) noted that crash survivors, their families, friends, and other caregivers often suffer adverse social, physical, and psychological effects, taking an enormous toll on individuals and communities as well as on national economies **\[C\]**. Before 2015, UK police relied on Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which requires evidence of being “unfit to drive through alcohol or drugs”; this was assessed using a field impairment test \(FIT\) such as walking in a straight line. The legislation was limited in scope for policing and convicting drug drivers. Professor Wolff’s expert Panel report \( **5**; published by the DfT in 2013\) gave key evidence for developing the UK’s first ever strict liability drug\-driving offence **\[E1\]**. In 2014 Professor Wolff was appointed to the Home Office CAST expert committee, tasked with setting thresholds for drug\-driving to be included in the new legislation **\[D\]**. The strict liability offence, outlined in Section 5A of the Road Traffic Act, became law in England and Wales in March 2015 **\[E\]**, including the 17 drugs \(8 illicit substances and 9 controlled medicines\) identified by the DfT Expert Panel to increase the risk of RTCs **\(5\)**, and cut\-off levels endorsed by the CAST committee, above which an offence has occurred **\[E\]**. Similar legislation came into effect in Scotland in 2019 **\[E4\]**. The new legislation for the first time allows the police to test for drugs at the roadside, and legislators to bring prosecutions more objectively and effectively for drug\-driving. The DVLA explained that “\(Prof Wolff’s\) knowledge especially in the area of drug and drink driving has been pivotal in the formulation of our policies in relation to driver licensing” **\[E5\]**. 

 **King’s research has improved road safety in the UK, with greater awareness of drug\-driving harms, and an increasing number of drug tests and prosecutions**. Data from freedom of information requests made in 2018 by the BBC to 40 police forces showed that the new drug\-driving legislation led to a significant increase in the number of drivers testing positive for drugs \(almost 25,000 motorists in England and Wales\) within three years **\[F1\]**. This indicated growing awareness of drug driving amongst the Police and the removal of significantly more unsafe drivers on UK roads: the DVLA said “\(the\) data shows that between March 2015 and 2018, the number of drivers disqualified for drug driving is 29,225” **\[E\]**. In 2018, the DfT carried out a retrospective evaluation of the new legislation, which showed that it already had a substantial impact: in the first 316 days after the legislation came into effect, 8,599 convictions took place **\[F2\]**. Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) data from every police force in England and Wales showed over 2000 roadside screening tests were undertaken, with 1718 individuals providing a blood sample for a confirmatory test at a police station. Of these, 750 drivers were subsequently charged with a section 5A offence \(49 %\), with most offenders males aged 18\-29 years **\[F3\]**. Evidential drug testing has also led to an increased number of prosecutions. In 2014, 17 prosecutions were brought for causing death by careless/dangerous driving under the influence of drink or drugs whereas in 2019, 4 years after the introduction of the Section 5A drug\-driving offence, there were 80 prosecutions for causing death by careless/dangerous for drug\-driving alone. In 2019, there were 1,321 RTCs involving a driver under the influence of prescription and illicit drugs compared to 594 in 2013 and data from 43 UK Police forces showed that between March 2015 and January 2018, 8,336 drivers tested positive for cannabis and 3,064 for cocaine **\[F\]**. This illustrates the extent of previously undetected drug\-driving in the UK and the significance of introducing this legislation. As the DfT Policy lead for Drink and Drug Driving says “King’s work brings significant societal impact for road safety and has helped in establishing the UK as a policy leader in this area” **\[E1\]**. 

 Alongside the new legislation, the DfT rolled out an associated £2m public awareness campaign \(THINK\!\) on the dangers of drug driving, targeting young people **\[G1\]**. There were 446 pieces of media coverage, 7m YouTube views of THINK\! ‘Paranoia’ film and King’s researchers joined radio campaigns that reached 61% of the target audience. Awareness of the personal consequences of drug driving increased significantly from 45% pre\- to 51% post\-campaign **\[G\]**. 

 **Changing UK national clinical and healthcare professional guidelines on drug\-driving.** In 2016, Professor Wolff was invited by the UK Government Department for Health and Social Care \(DHSC\), to update the ‘drug\-driving’ section of the DHSC’s National Guidelines on Drug Misuse and Dependence \(‘Orange Guidelines’\) **\[H1\]**. The update was based on the scientific evidence produced by the DfT expert Panel report, particularly drawing on the conclusions about methadone.  These guidelines are recognised as being evidence\-based best clinical practice and intended for use by all UK specialist addiction doctors and nurses. The King’s team also helped produce the drug\-driving guidance for healthcare professionals approved by the Secretary of State for Transport’s Honorary Advisory Panel on Alcohol, Drugs and Substance Misuse **\[H2\]**. 

 **Influencing the development of European policies to improve road safety.** Professor Wolff has given expert advice and evidence in fora influencing European drug\-driving policy development and worked with the European Transport Safety Council \(ETSC\), a network of 200 internationally renowned transport safety experts, to publish a report for a debate on drug\-driving at the European Parliament on 8th March 2017 **\[I\]**. Collaboration with the ETSC included presentations in Spain and Poland to raise awareness of the need for a systemic approach to reduce drug driving amongst EU policy makers, the private sector and key opinion leaders.  Prof Wolff contributed to a symposium on the dangers of cannabis use and driving alongside speakers from EU Member States; the National Highway Safety Transport Administration, USA; Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety, Australia and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction; the resulting report was published by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction \( [EMCDDA](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications%20/8805/20181120_TD%200418132ENN_PDFA.pdf)\) – known as the ‘reference point’ on drug use for EU member states **\[I\]**. The ETSC called this work “instrumental in raising political awareness of the problem of drug driving, the necessity to enforce rules on drug driving, and the technical possibilities for enforcement through the detection of \(il\)licit substances…”, and “key in raising awareness among Members of the European Parliament… of the problem of drug driving” **\[I3\]**. 

 **King’s make synthetic oral fluid fit\-for\-purpose for type approval of confirmatory tests for roadside testing.** King’s researchers refined SOF to be fit\-for\-purpose in calibrating drug driving testing and quality control management of drug screening and championed the development of oral fluid testing to the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology \(CAST\). As the Type Approval Manager for Drugs at CAST explains: “The testing of suspected drug drivers at the roadside is a key element of the implementation of the s5A offence. Testing is undertaken on a sample of a suspected drug drivers’ oral fluid \(saliva\), using preliminary drug testing devices which have been Type Approved for that purpose by the Home Office.” **\[J\]**. 

#  King’s lead a Government panel to devise a High\-Risk Offender Scheme for drug\-drivers. 

 Since 2015, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales \(CSEW\), self\-reported drug\-driving as a proportion of all drivers who have taken illicit drugs in the previous 12 months has steadily increased **\[K\]**. Between 2007 and 2017, both the number of casualties and the number of fatalities involving drug\-driving have also risen: casualties increasing from 869 to 1889, and fatalities from 41 to 105. In recognition of this growing problem, the UK DfT made a commitment in the 2015 Road Safety Statement \(Parliament’s priorities for improving the safety of Britain’s roads\) to consult on the issue of high\-risk drug\-drivers \(those who drive under the influence of particularly high concentrations of drugs or commit multiple drug\-drive offences\) and the 2019 Road Safety Statement subsequently recognised the need for expert advice to explore options for a High\-Risk Offender \(HRO\) scheme for drug drivers **\[K\]**. Prof Wolff was asked to chair the DfT Panel \(2019\-2020\) tasked with making recommendations for introducing a scheme to run in parallel with the High\-Risk Drink\-Drive Scheme. The Panel of 6 experts used DVLA data to make recommendations to the Government on a framework, including criteria for determining which individuals should be on the scheme \(report signed off by DfT, out for consultation Jan 2021\) **\[E\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There has been limited support for those recently diagnosed with dementia and their families. Research examining a community\-based dementia support model, the Meeting Centre Support Programme, demonstrated the benefits of the model for those recently diagnosed with dementia and for their families. It showed the implementation of Meeting Centres led to improved quality of life and better mental health. More than 200 Meeting Centres have subsequently been established or are in development across the world, bringing their benefits to thousands of people. The research has informed national and regional policy in the UK and in Italy and the Netherlands. It has also shaped the approach of charities supporting those living with dementia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Meeting Centres Support Programme \(MCSP\) originated in the Netherlands.  It provides a model for the delivery of locally tailored, post\-diagnostic support, for people living with mild to moderate dementia and their family carers.  The Meeting Centre \(MC\) “club” is offered 3 days per week, usually to 12 – 20 members per meeting in an easily accessible location \(e.g. community centre\).  The typical MC is provided within a local community of around 5,000 older people and membership is open to people of all ages and types of dementia diagnosis and their family carers. Evidence\-based post\-diagnostic interventions are provided within the MC according to the needs of local members.  MCs are facilitated by staff and volunteers trained in the ethos of person\-centred dementia care and the Adaptation\-Coping Model. 

 Between 2014 and 2017, Prof Brooker and her team in the Association for Dementia Studies were co\-investigators on MEETINGDEM, funded through the EU Joint Programme for Neurodegenerative Diseases \(Grant 1\), leading the work\-package to evaluate effectiveness.  MEETINGDEM was designed to adapt, implement and evaluate the MCSP across the UK, Italy and Poland \(Reference 1\). 

 The research comprised: 

-  An exploration of pathways to care for each country and identification of key stakeholders for the MCSP, leading to the formation of groups of organisational collaborators and user representatives. 

-  Production of inventoried facilitators / barriers to implementing MCSP. 

-  Adaption of Dutch materials to develop country\-specific implementation plans, practical guides and tools kits. 

-  Staff training for 9 new MCs \(including 2 in the UK\). 

-  A controlled trial with people living with dementia who attended the MCs and their family carers.  The trial considered impact on behaviour, mood, quality of life for those living with dementia; sense of competence, mental health, loneliness, distress, experienced burden for family carers; a cost\-effectiveness analysis and evaluation of user satisfaction 

-  An evaluation of facilitators and barriers to implementation of the MCs in each country. 

 The vision for the MCSP was successfully upheld across each country, with adherence to key components for MCs as outlined within the Dutch programme.  Amendments were made to account for the national context of delivery including inclusion criteria, frequency of different components within the programme, and adoption of culturally relevant activities.  Factors associated with successful implementation across different countries included enthusiastic local stakeholders, staff and project manager qualities, and availability of evidence of MC effectiveness \(Reference 2\).  Barriers to implementation included competition between care providers and funding \(Reference 3\). 

 For people with dementia, attendance at MCs had a significant impact on their quality of life \(feelings of belonging, self\-esteem, positive affect\) when compared to usual care.  Higher attendance levels were associated with greater neuropsychiatric symptom reduction and increased feelings of support.  For family carers, attendance at MCs reduced carer burden, distress and enhanced their overall mental health when compared to those receiving usual care \(Reference 4 and 5\). 

 People with dementia and their family carers were highly satisfied with the MCs and reported that they provided an important means for social and emotional adjustment post diagnosis \(Reference 6\). 

 The research concluded that MCs are a transferable method of post\-diagnostic support for people with dementia and their family members across different countries, including the UK.  Those attending MCs realise improvements to their quality of life and wellbeing against reasonable additional costs.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There is currently little statutory care provision across Europe to meet the needs of people living with dementia. This reflects a significant gap for those newly diagnosed with dementia and their families.  People living with dementia are recognised as a ‘hard to reach’ group, given the ongoing isolation and stigma often surrounding a dementia diagnosis.  The research has highlighted the benefits of Meeting Centres \(MCs\) for this group: improved quality of life, enhanced feelings of belonging, increased self\-esteem and positive affect.  It has also highlighted the benefits for carers who attend MCs: they experience less burden, distress and better mental health.  MCs yield high levels of satisfaction for people with dementia and their family members providing an important, and impactful, resource for social and emotional adjustment post\-diagnosis. This is emphasised not only through the research but also through testimonies of people living with dementia and their families \(Source A\). It is further elaborated by the organisations who run the MCs \(Source B\). 

 The reach of this research is global. As of December 2020, over 200 MCs have been established or are under development across the world because of this research. 30 new MCs have already opened across Europe, including 13 in the UK. MCs have opened or are planned in Spain, Chile, USA, Aruba, Singapore, Japan and Australia \(Source C\). 

 The Association for Dementia Studies has been fundamental to the UK implementation of the MC model. The team worked closely with the community to develop the two UK demonstrator MCs, Droitwich and Leominster, and to retain these centres \(Source B\).  Both MCs are now established Charities which have raised more than £500,000 to fund activities for their own local communities as well to support the development of new MCs. During the initial project, the team outlined the mechanisms to successful implementation for community support of this nature. In 2018 the team were awarded a National Lottery implementation grant \(£587,601\) to establish new MC sites across the UK between 2018\-2021, and to share learning about the benefits and key factors associated with successful implementation. As part of this project, the team established a UK\-wide Meeting Centres National Reference Group, including people affected by dementia, representatives from Public Health England, Health Education England, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services \(ADASS\), care organisations and the charitable sector, to inform the roll\-out of MCs across the UK, with a goal of the MC approach becoming a routine source of post\-diagnostic support for people and families. In 2019 there were 74 new enquiries made directly to the team which have resulted in 20 new MCs being planned across England and Scotland.  Learning has been exchanged through 8 UK workshops and a national conference.  These events have directly enabled the setting up of 4 new MCs \(MCs in Purbeck, Oldbury, Cheltenham and Newtown\).  It is expected that at least another 15 MCs will be established in 2021 across the UK. The team have also supported those running MCs across the UK with a Community of Learning and Practice. During the Covid\-19 pandemic, this has been a lifeline for MCs to continue their work and has provided a central location to sustain learning about dementia. 

 The research has impacted on policy at a national and regional level, and internationally. The MC model has informed the Dementia Action Plan for Wales 2018\-2022 and the Powys Dementia Action Plan \(Source D\). It is also a core part of Worcestershire County Council’s long\-term adult social services strategy \(Source E\). It is investing £540,000 initially to set up 9 MCs across the county by 2023 with the direct support of the Association for Dementia Studies which will lead on the implementation and evaluation of these MCs. Internationally, the Dutch Ministry of Health has pledged that 80% of people affected by dementia will have access to a MC by 2030 \(Source H\). The impact of the research internationally is elaborated by co\-investigators on the original project: for example, 17 MCs have been established in Italy through government funding and the model has been embedded in the Regional Dementia Plan \(Source I\). 

 The research has also impacted on policy in the charitable sector. The Shaw Foundation has funded Project Officers in Liverpool and Bristol, to evaluate the barriers and facilitators associated with successful MC implementation in large urban areas \(Source F\).  The Life Changes Trust has funded a Meeting Centres Collaboration to further implement MCs across Scotland \(Source G\), building on the success of the Kirriemuir MC.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cystic Fibrosis is a life\-limiting condition affecting 10,500 people in the UK. Patients are usually prescribed three nebuliser treatments each day, however only 36% of treatments are taken. Non\-adhering patients are more likely to need hospital treatments, which disrupt their lives and result in higher costs. Arden's research informed the development and refinement of an intervention ‘CFHealthHub’. This intervention is now being used in clinical practice at more than three\-fifths of sites in the UK, with more than 1400 patients registered by 2020, and significant NHS funds committed to its roll\-out. It is being used by patients to self\-manage their treatments and has increased treatment adherence by up to 18%. It has changed the practice of health professionals and the delivery of services within the NHS, generating health gains \(0.17 QALYs\) and offering cost savings of £2.5m per year. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cystic Fibrosis \(CF\) affects 10,500 people \(6000 adults\) in the UK, with patients experiencing life\-limiting conditions and typically dying at 31 years of age. Patients are usually prescribed three treatments a day, taken through a nebuliser, which delivers medications directly to their lungs as a fine mist. Good adherence is vital for treatment effectiveness. However objective measurement shows only 36% of prescribed nebuliser treatments are taken. 

 The development of an intervention to promote nebuliser adherence in adults with CF was undertaken as part of a NIHR funded programme grant \(total grant £2.5 million\). The project team included Arden, as lead for the behaviour change strand, Martin Wildman \(Sheffield Teaching Hospitals; clinical lead\), Alicia O’Cathain \(University of Sheffield\) and academics from universities including Sheffield, Manchester and Queen’s University Belfast. Arden was instrumental in the development of the intervention in the following three areas. 

####  Identifying Key Barriers to Adherence 

 Interviews with a cohort of CF patients led to the identification of key barriers to adherence, with important differences between high and low adherers \[ **R1**\]. This was the first study to use participants’ personal objective adherence data as a prompt within an interview, to assess specific barriers and facilitators to treatment\-taking, rather than relying on subjective recall of adherence \(which is likely to be inaccurate\). The research determined that the barriers and facilitators were highly variable, indicating that a one\-size\-fits\-all intervention would not be appropriate. It was also found that there were key differences between higher and lower adherers, including that higher adherers had routines and habits for treatment\-taking. Further analysis of the same interviews explored how participants used ‘forgetting' in their explanations of non\-adherence. Low adherers utilised 'forgetting' to present a socially acceptable reason for non\-adherence, to help to normalise their behaviour, given that they knew they should adhere \[ **R2**\]. This emphasised the importance of contextualising explanations with objectively\-measured behavioural data and the importance of avoiding judgement in discussions about non\-adherence. 

####  Co\-producing the Intervention with Patients and Clinicians using a Systematic Approach 

 The prototype CFHealthHub intervention was developed and launched in 2016 and comprised two parts: i\) a web platform and smartphone app providing information and behaviour change tools that can be accessed by patients and health professionals, and ii\) an intervention manual and training programme for health professionals to work alongside patients; this uses the web platform content and behaviour change tools to support patient adherence. The prototype was developed based on the barriers and facilitators established in **R1**, where Arden identified evidence\-based behaviour change techniques to address each specific barrier. One of the techniques included was a type of coping plan called a volitional help sheet, shown to be effective in Arden’s previous research \[ **R6**\]. The intervention was co\-produced and iteratively developed with patients and clinicians, with changes made in response to interview feedback and monitored use of CFHealthHub \[ **R3**\]. 

####  Ensuring that the Intervention Worked in Practice 

 A research study ran in three UK sites, which randomised CF patients into ‘intervention’ and ‘usual\-care’ groups. Measures taken pre\-intervention and at five\-month follow up found that the intervention was acceptable to patients and that those in the ‘intervention’ group showed a 10% increase in adherence \[ **R4**\]. A process evaluation identified 14 key changes to the intervention procedures that were needed to maximise the chance of intervention success \[ **R5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The CFHealthHub intervention has had an impact on patients, service delivers and practitioners \- delivering health, financial and skills benefits. 

####  Benefits to Patients with Cystic Fibrosis 

 Research data showed that the intervention is successful in supporting patients to increase and importantly to maintain increased adherence to medication over a 12\-month period. On average patients who received the intervention had 10% higher adherence than those receiving usual care. The difference was even more substantial in patients who started the trial with low \(26\-50%\) or moderate \(51\-75%\) adherence and received the intervention. Their adherence was 18% and 15% greater respectively than with usual care \[ **E1**\]. 

 Patients who receive the intervention reported decreased concerns about medication, lower perceived effort of treatment and increased habit strength. They also report lower perceived treatment burden, which is a top research priority in CF according to a recent priority setting exercise by the James Lind Alliance. Therefore, while patients are taking more of their treatment because of the intervention, this is not negatively impacting on their perceived treatment burden \[ **E1**\]. 

 The intervention also enhanced the patient experience. Interviews with patients indicated that they found CFHealthHub helpful in supporting their adherence: "" *It's helped me find a pattern, which I didn't have before*"" and “\[it’s\] *drastically improved my using of treatments, my overall health and my understanding of CF*”. Patients also appreciated the support they received from health professionals who delivered the intervention: “ *It was good to have that one\-on\-one aspect and it kind of gave me the confidence to then continue without as many meetings*"" \[ **E2**\]. 

 Increased patient involvement in shaping the intervention has resulted in a usable system that patients are invested in engaging with to improve their adherence \[ **E2**\]. Patients chose to use the CFHealthHub system during the research \[ **E1**\] and subsequently when it became available in clinical practice. Between August 2019 and December 2020, patients logged into CFHealthHub 28,135 times in total \[ **E3**\]. 

####  Benefits to the Delivery of Cystic Fibrosis Services 

 CFHealthHub provides a tool that can easily be integrated into care pathways to inform medical decision\-making and to increase adherence in CF patients. NHS England offered NHS Trusts across England £8 million of investment for the intervention to be rolled\-out within care pathways for adults with CF as part of its 2019/20 Prescribed Specialised Services Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) scheme \[ **E4**\]. This funding supported the adoption of CFHealthHub in 16 CF centres in England \(Barts, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bristol, Exeter, Frimley, Leicester, Newcastle, Norfolk/Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Plymouth, Sheffield, Southampton, Stoke, Truro and York\). CFHealthHub has also been adopted in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh under separate arrangements with the devolved nations. CFHealthHub is therefore currently used in 19 out of 26 centres in the UK, with 1416 patients registered by the end of 2020, representing around 24% of adults with CF \[ **E5**\]. 

 An NIHR economic analysis of the intervention calculated that it generated health gains of 0.17 additional QALYs and cost savings of £1,790 per patient per year, compared with usual care. The savings are from both reduce medicine wastage and lower the risk of exacerbations that lead to hospitalisation. This is therefore offering estimated savings to CF service delivers of £2.5 million annually \(£1,790 average saving x 1416 patients already registered\) \[ **E1**\]. 

 The coronavirus pandemic posed a particular problem for the care of people with CF, who were classified as clinically extremely vulnerable and were asked to shield during the early part of the pandemic. CFHealthHub was recommended by NICE as an innovation that allowed remote delivery of care, with virtual clinics supporting people and providing them with behaviour change tools to self\-manage their condition while they were shielding: 

 *“CFHealthHub enables remote monitoring and virtual clinics for people with CF. This is critical for CF monitoring during the COVID\-19 pandemic”* \[ **E6**\]. 

 The intervention has also been adapted for use in paediatric settings in the UK, with the first feasibility study having begun in Southampton \[ **E7**\]. 

 There has been international interest in CFHealthHub, with CF centres in the USA and France having expressed an interest in adopting it \[ **E7**\]. 

####  Benefits to Health Practitioners 

 Health professionals delivering adherence support to patients, including physiotherapists, pharmacists, nurses and psychologists, have benefitted from CFHealthHub. Practitioners have increased their skills, knowledge and capability for supporting patient adherence using CFHealthHub. Arden has delivered training in behaviour change and the use of CFHealthHub behaviour change strategies and tools to over 100 health professionals working in CF \[ **E8**\]. 

 Health professionals found the CFHealthHub enhanced their decision making and enabled a more patient\-led approach within their practice. A survey of 85 healthcare professional conducted in November/December 2020 found that 95.3% agreed that CFHealthHub supported an open honest conversation that improved the patient\-practitioner relationship, while 90.6% agreed that CFHealthHub provided tools to empower patients to self\-care. \[ **E9**\]. Interviews with health professionals confirmed that it significantly changed and improved their practice. One reported that: 

 *“It changes your whole practice. I think you more ask open ended questions, rather than making assumptions. I think you learn different ways… and making that acceptable, and then something that you do together, is different than you sitting in a clinic and saying ‘well why aren’t you doing the nebuliser, it takes five minutes’*”. Another acknowledged that: *“It has definitely changed my practice in terms of the way that I approach things, it…\[has become\] more patient led now, rather than me firing questions and getting the answer that they think I want back.”* \[ **E9**\]. 

 Experts who reviewed CFHealthHub as part of the NICE briefing stated that *“The innovative aspect of CFHealthHub is the included behaviour change tools*”, and that *“CFHealthHub had improved clinical consultations by enabling…honest discussion about the data…how the patient may be struggling with the burden of treatment…and how the CF team can support them*.” \[ **E6**\]. 

 Health professionals use CFHealthHub as a regular part of their practice. Currently 412 clinicians across 19 UK sites are registered to use CFHealthHub. Between August 2019 and December 2020 there were an average of 1,517 clinician log\-ins per month, during which healthcare professionals looked at patients’ adherence data pages 34,541 times in total \[ **E3**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex sports research, by utilising novel physiological and biomechanical measurements in elite athletes, underpins changes in coaching and organisational practice, which result in improvements in elite athlete performance with associated cultural and economic impacts. This case study highlights **six examples** **within** **three elite sports** where Essex research has underpinned the impact. For **England Golf** and players of the **PGA European Tour** development, validation and implementation of new training, profiling and warm\-up protocols which were adopted by 100% of players, led to wins for all England golf squads at the Home Internationals and 2<sup>nd</sup> in the European Team Championships in 2018 and, since 2018, 12 players have won an event in PGA European Tour. For International field hockey teams \( **Team GB** & **Team USA**\) new training protocols improved sports performance in National, International and Olympic competitions \(Rio 2016\), with Team GB moving from bronze to Olympic gold and Team USA moving up from 12<sup>th</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup>. For elite **synchronised swimming** the use of novel physiological measurements had cultural impacts by being showcased in a multi\-award winning science documentary \( **NHK Japan**\) watched by 21.3 million people in Japan \(receiving six National and International awards\). For European high technology SME \( **Artinis Inc. Netherlands**\) the showcasing of the use of new equipment by Essex research in elite athletes resulted in economic impacts, increasing sales \(GBP 250,000\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The primary aim of the Essex Sports Performance Research Group is to provide evidence\-based research to understand, inform and drive improvements in athlete success; secondary aims include enabling economic activity arising from our research and facilitating public and cultural engagement in the science of sports performance. **This impact case study utilises six examples within three elite sports to highlight Essex research in this area:** 

 **Elite Golf** 

 From 2016 till present, Coughlan was a consultant with England Golf and the European Golf Tour. Therefore, even prior to publication, these organisations were able to apply his original research \(described below\) on elite golfers to inform their practice and improve performance. Coughlan’s work on athlete profiling in golf \[R1, R2\] revealed that the previous use of jump height to inform greater driving distance was flawed, due to its penalisation of high body mass; he showed that countermovement jump impulse or jump power are more strongly related to club head speed and should be used instead, especially when combined with medicine ball throws and isometric mid\-thigh pulls. In \[R2\] Coughlan further highlighted key physical attributes which should be assessed and relate to club head speed in high level youth golfers. Where previous research in this area had little impact, this unique publication was undertaken in a key developmental area with an elite cohort. It was therefore directly relevant to National Governing Bodies. In \[R3\] Coughlan demonstrated how a simple and player accessible, range based warm up could improve club head speed and shot quality, both important determinants in golf play outcomes. Research into this specific group of young elite athletes is rare and highlighted the usefulness of these tests when looking to improve club head speed. In \[R4\] Coughlan evidenced that training only once per week is sufficient to support meaningful changes in club head speed in youth golfers. Given the limited strength and conditioning time given to youth golfers, this finding into training dose and response held real and direct value for practitioners and players in terms of training effectiveness. 

 **Elite Hockey** 

 Cooper’s Near Infrared Spectroscopy \(NIRS\) research on elite athletes’ training adaptations following high intensity training led Team GB women’s field hockey’s strength and conditioning \(S&C\) coach to engage Essex to develop and validate new training approaches for Team GB hockey.  Cooper and Jones did so, reporting the first measurements of muscle oxygenation and haemodynamics in individual Olympic athletes in response to a sprint interval cycling training programme approach \[R5\]. This work was significant because the use of NIRS to detect training effects in response to exercise is usually reported as group data, within untrained or recreationally active cohorts. \[R5\] showed that NIRS can report on training induced changes in individual elite athletes and further how it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of future sport performance enhancing practices. Additionally, this work evidenced and validated the development of a low volume, time efficient, bike training protocol that led to enhanced muscle oxygen consumption; the subsequent increase in running performance in elite hockey players, was significant given the rarity of previous research evidencing such a performance effect in elite athletes. 

 **Underwater Physiology Measurements in Elite synchronised swimming** 

 NIRS technology had been exclusively used within “dry” applied sport & exercise fields, the lack of waterproofing preventing use in more challenging aquatic environments. In 2013, however, Cooper began the development, testing and *in vivo* validation of a new waterproof NIRS device, facilitating measurements in previously inaccessible exercise settings \[R6\]. The exemplar paper by Cooper and Jones \[R6\] showed that, using appropriate caution, adaptations could be made to NIRS devices that enabled underwater measurements equivalent to those on dry land. NIRS use was well tolerated and yielded interesting physiological measures during cold water immersion and sprint swimming in club level athletes and triathletes. This research therefore described the first use of NIRS to measure muscle oxygenation during swim exercise and enabled the future use of NIRS technology to provide novel physiological measurements in an aquatic environment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We evidence six examples \( **highlighted in bold below**\) of our research’s impact within three elite sports: physical profiling and training interventions in golf research, both amateur \( **England Golf\)**\) and professional \( **PGA European Tour**\), changing organisational practice leading to enhanced performance; non\-invasive muscle optics physiological monitoring improving elite **Team GB** & **Team USA** hockey players’ performance; underwater NIRS use in synchronised swimmers  benefitting creativity, culture and society by enabling the  co\-creation of a new cultural artefact for **NHK Japan**; and research improving the economic performance of a business by contributing to entrepreneurial activity and improving existing products for **Artinis Inc**. 

 **England Golf and European Tour \- Research led to a change in organisational practice leading to improved sports performance** 

 **England Golf \[S1, S2\]** 

 Athlete profiling by Coughlan \[R1, R2\] revealed that the previous use of jump height to inform greater driving distance was flawed. England Golf consequently trained eleven staff in this area and now use isometric mid\-thigh pulls and countermovement jump to profile all of their National players and medicine ball throws and countermovement jump power to profile all regional players. The demonstration in \[R3\] that a standardised warm up led to longer, more accurate drives led to its adoption by England Golf for all players in the England system. \[R4\] showed that even if youth golfers only train once per week, it has a meaningful positive impact on their club head speed and drive distance; this directly led England Golf to encourage all regional programmes to deliver face to face weekly S&C sessions. Equipment was purchased and all S&C staff trained to complete testing according to \[R1\] and interpret the results and provide training recommendations based on \[R3\] and \[R4\]. According to the Lead S&C Coach at England Golf, Essex “ *research has helped us define our programmes sport science support*” \[S1\]. 

 Coughlan then collaborated with England Golf to develop new physical profiling protocols \[S2\]. In profiling, England Golf now require all S&C staff working with national players and players in regional squads to complete physical profiling using key measures from \[R1\] & \[R2\] \[S2\]. They add “ *profiling tests from your first study looking into the physical characteristics of players have been incorporated across all regional squads, with 100% uptake. These profiling tests are now used across \~200 regional under 18 players twice annually and have been since 2017. The results from the profiling are being used to provide training goals and specific training recommendations to all regional players and form a significant part of how we evaluate the effectiveness of our regional strength and conditioning support”* \[S2\] *.* They noted *“100% of our 40 national level players complete these profiling tests twice annually, from which they receive specific training advice to advance their performance*” \[S2\]. 

 In terms of warm up, “ *your research into the effectiveness of warm\-up in golf \[R3\] has been used as the foundation for our nation\-wide approach to warm\-up education for the players in both regional and national squads \[S2\]. All players \(\~240 across the programme\) are taught the warm\-up used in your study \[R3\] when they enter our pathway and are expected to use that or variants of that warm\-up throughout the competitive season*” \[S2\]. 

 In S&C, “ *your research into the effectiveness of strength and conditioning training \[R4\] has helped us to develop and justify resourcing strength and conditioning coaches to deliver once\-weekly sessions for players in the regional programme. This is now our preferred delivery strategy, especially in the off\-season*” \[S2\]. 

 In terms of performance outcomes, England Golf have noticed a dramatic increase in success following the policy changes introduced as a result of the recommendations in \[R1\-R4\]: “ *Over the past year \[to July 2020\], we have had incredible success as a nation, including wins for all squads \(Women’s, Girls’, Men’s and Boys’\) at the Home Internationals and placing 2<sup>nd</sup> in the European Team Championships* *Our players are hitting the ball further; we are seeing injuries less frequently and we are commonly observing more positive training and warm\-up behaviours*” \[S2\]. The research “ *played a significant part in achieving the world leading success England Golf has enjoyed and had it not been for your work the quality of our sports science support and results achieved would not have been possible. This research has allowed us to gain a major performance advantage on the international stage*” \[S2\]. 

 **European Tour \[S3, S4\].** 

 According to Director of the European Tour Performance Institute \(ETPI\) “ *In 2017, as a consequence of our discussions with Essex’s sports performance research team and on the basis of the evidence in their work, we began using a predicted countermovement jump peak power measure of explosive strength*” \[S3\]. Coughlan then collaborated with the Tour to develop new physical profiling protocols for ETPI, \[S4\], based on and referencing \[R1 & R2\]. Coughlan facilitated the implementation of his research to PGA European Tour members via ETPI so that they could implement the protocols outlined in \[R3\] and \[R4\]. Specifically ETPI “ *purchased the required equipment to mimic the testing methodologies used in your club head velocity and force paper. We took on contractors to supply strength and conditioning support to players, and you trained and supported them directly, so they could deliver the standardised profiling assessment used in your work*” \[S3\]. Profiling based on the recommendations from Essex research \[S4\] “ *is now offered free of charge, to all 650 players who compete under the PGA European Tour and its associated tournaments”* \[S3\]. 

 According to ETPI, Coughlan’s research directly resulted in “ *organisational level change and practitioner level change in practice regarding profiling and training for players*” \[S3\]. The increased knowledge gained about optimising golf physical preparation as a result of \[R1\-4\] and “ *helped inform the facilities we offer at events*” \[S3\]. Notably “ *at the 2018 and 2019 Open Championship as well as the victorious 2018 and up\-coming 2020 \[now 2021\] Ryder Cups, the PGA European Tour and R&A have provided and will continue to provide bespoke training facilities, tailored to the needs of players, based on your research*” \[S3\]. 

 ETPI have noted significant associated performance outcomes.  “ *During any given tournament, approximately 25% of the total field will have been through the physical profiling assessment to inform their training. Since 2018, 12 players have won an event following training recommendations directly related to the profiling they received. Most of the players we profile, who follow the tailored recommendations, report meaningful increases in their driving distance, which gives them an important competitive advantage*” \[S3\]. 

 **Elite Hockey Team GB \+ Team USA \(change in coach methods & teams’ performance\) \[S5\]** 

 Seeking to enhance the performance of Team GB women’s field hockey, their S&C coach contacted Essex in 2013 to explore the use of NIRS to test new training adaptations and devise a protocol for them prior to the 2016 Rio Olympics \[S5\]. They were especially interested in Cooper’s previous use of NIRS in research testing performance in elite rugby players: “ *the use of off\-feet \(bike\) training had resulted in both performance and peripheral muscle adaptions, suggesting that such an additional training load can be introduced without the need for impact \(run\) training*” \[S5\]. Crucially, Essex research had demonstrated that “ *bike training can yield improvements in such \[elite\] athletes*” and that “ *the use of NIRS analysis meant that information could be obtained at the peripheral level, which is of interest to a practitioner like me*” \[S5\]. In collaboration with Team GB women’s field hockey, a specific training programme was devised and validated by Cooper’s research, subsequently published in \[R5\]. The new training methods were implemented in Team GB hockey players from 2014 onwards. This had a “ *notable effect on the player’s physical capacity*”, “ *increased the player’s final running velocity*” and “ *capacity to undertake more high intensity efforts*”, which the coach believed was “ *a key determinant in winning matches*” \[S5\]. Crucially “ *the players did not experience injuries or overtraining as a consequence*” \[S5\]. This Essex research changed the S&C coach’s whole “ *approach to training regimes for high intensity efforts*” \[S5\]. When he subsequently moved to be Head of Performance Science for Team USA women field hockey, they “ *implemented training protocols from 2014\-2016 based upon University of Essex research*” that “ *resulted in notable improvement in the players capacity to improve high intensity efforts and thereby increased their ability to sway decisive points to their advantage. During this time the team improved, raising their Olympic performance from 12th in London 2012 to 5th in Rio 2016, earning fourth place at the 2014 World Cup and winning the gold medal in the FIH \(Federation Internationale Hockey\) championship challenge in May 2014. Performance gains in elite athletes already near their limits are hard to achieve, nevertheless, the insights from working with your group gave us such advantages*” \[S5\]. 

 The “novel insights” \[S5\] from Essex research \[R5\] therefore improved a coach’s approach, leading to changes in training programmes for two national field hockey teams. Indeed, without Essex’s contribution these teams “ *would have lacked an advantage in a critical aspect of their performance for international competition*s” \[S5\]. 

 **Enabling physiological measurements in elite synchronised swimmers:  impact on creativity, culture and society by co\-creating TV programme \(new cultural artefact\) \[S6\-8\]** 

 The demonstration by Cooper and Jones that NIRS could be used successfully underwater \[R6\] directly led the Production Research Manager from Japan's national broadcasting organization \(NHK\) to contact Cooper in January 2016 to discuss aiding with the scientific content for a new TV programme \- “Russia’s Golden Mermaids”. This formed part of the Japanese public broadcaster NHK’s highly successful “Miracle Body” Series focussing on the science underpinning performance in elite synchronised swimming \[S6\]. Jones continued these discussions; assisted with the planning of the programme; personally took the oxygenation measurements on the muscle and brains of swimmers in Tokyo and Barcelona that featured extensively as key visuals in the programme \[S7\]; and explained the meaning of the data to the production team and on camera to the TV audience. As noted by Konishi “ *Ben was invaluable to us not only for the data acquisition but also in interpreting the data obtained from these tests*” \[S6\]. His analysis featured extensively in the finished programme as helping “ *immensely in translating scientific methodology and analysis into language which could be appreciated by our general public audience*” \[S6\]. NHK considered the programme highly successful as it received above average viewing figures for a NHK special documentary of 6.6% \(9.9 million\) in the Kanto \(around Tokyo\) area, and 7.6% \(11.4 million\) in the Kansai area and was syndicated in six other countries \[S6\]. “Russia’s Golden Mermaids was praised by critics winning six national and international awards \[S6\], most noticeably the Takayanagi Grand Prix Prize for best TV science documentary prize in Japan \(2016\), the “Silver Screen”. In the year following the documentary \(2017\), the Japanese Swimming Federation saw a 5% increase in registered synchronised swimmers, against a backdrop of a fall in other registered swimmers \[S6, S8 p11\]. 

 **Artinis Inc.  economic impact via contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity and improving the performance of a business through improvement of existing products \[S9\]** 

 Artinis Inc. \(established 2002\) are a Dutch SME with approximately 50 employees that manufacture innovative NIRS systems for muscle and brain oxygenation measurements. For over 10 years they have had a close working collaboration with Cooper and Jones and the CEO notes that “ *The University of Essex research group have been instrumental in our product design and algorithm” and the collaboration has led to “innovative product design and advancement*” \[S9\]. Artinis consider Cooper’s research team “ *world leading in the applied work that they conduct*” with Artinis products \[S9\] and when contacted by potential customers “ *we always mention the special work by the University of Essex in speed skating, sport and elite sport*”. The company uses Essex research on elite athletes \(e.g. \[R5\] as marketing\) to enhance sales of their muscle Portamon device. Additional markets were opened by the demonstration that University of Essex modifications of Artinis devices enabled their successful use underwater, both in club athletes \[R6\] and elite synchronised swimmers \(see NHK documentary above\). Artinis note that “ *As with all new products, market introduction is difficult*” but that highlighting the research of Cooper’s group “ *aided with the marketing process*”. The research “ *aided in product requests and sales that have benefited the company demonstrably*”, “ *increased sales rates in the region of GBP 250,000, which has enabled company growth and increased company employment*” \[S9\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research on the relationship between rhythmic awareness and reading development in children found that **sensitivity to the rhythmic components of language is related to reading skills and can be trained in both beginning readers and older struggling readers**. Our **novel findings were used to develop a new range of 408 books with an external publisher.** These books use rhythmic reading activities to increase children’s reading proficiency. The Rising Stars: Reading Planet scheme for Key Stage One uses rhythmic reading activities to embed the speech rhythm sensitivity we found to impact children's early reading ability. This is the **first literacy scheme to explicitly incorporate rhythmic training into its resources for teachers and parents**. It is estimated that over 750,000 copies have been sold, including over 150,000 copies internationally, and that over 12,000 children in the UK have engaged with the Reading Planet scheme. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 It is estimated that one in five children leave primary school unable to read at a standard that will ensure they are well placed to succeed in secondary school \(DfE, 2015\). Traditional reading curriculums focus on developing readers’ phonological awareness \(awareness of grapheme\-phoneme correspondences, commonly referred to as ‘letters and sounds’\), but do not incorporate the rhythmic components of language which accompany phonological awareness, such as linguistic stress, intonation and timing. Dr Harrison’s research has demonstrated \(a\) the importance of sensitivity to these rhythmic components of language for the development of reading skills, and \(b\) that rhythmic sensitivity can be successfully trained in both beginning readers and older struggling readers. 

 To address the absence of rhythmic tasks in reading curriculums, we undertook a review of existing rhythmic sensitivity assessments, and existing approaches to reading tuition **\(R01\)**. By examining existing tasks used to assess speech rhythm sensitivity, **we were able to specify areas where rhythmic tasks could be adapted for incorporation into early reading intervention**. 

 Dr Harrison then used this knowledge to develop a new speech rhythm\-based intervention, and trialled it against a traditional phonological awareness\-based intervention and a control group, with 73 4\-5 year olds **\(R02\) in the first randomised controlled trial of a rhythmic\-based reading intervention in beginning readers.** In a further study, Dr Harrison examined the effectiveness of this intervention in 49 struggling readers aged 7\-8 years **.** Results from both studies showed that **both beginning readers and older struggling readers who received our speech rhythm\-based intervention made significantly larger pre\-post\-test gains in word reading performance** compared to those who received either the traditional phonological awareness\-based intervention or the control. Importantly, to ensure that this intervention had a lasting effect, Dr Harrison also conducted post\-intervention trials and found that **those who received the new speech rhythm intervention continued to make the largest gains in word reading 3 months post\-intervention, demonstrating the longer\-term benefit of rhythmic\-based training.** 

 The relationship between rhythmic sensitivity and various elements of literacy was explored further in a sample of seventy 5\-7 year\-olds, with results suggesting that rhythmic awareness may indirectly affect reading outcomes **\(R03\)**. To understand the relationship between rhythmic sensitivity and reading in more depth, we explored the relationship between individual components of speech rhythm \(including stress, intonation, and timing\) and individual elements of reading \(including decoding, comprehension and fluency\) in a sample of 49 6\-7 year\-old children **\(R04\)**. We showed that all rhythmic elements were significantly correlated with all reading measures as expected. However, findings for individual elements of speech rhythm demonstrated novel findings showing that stress awareness made the biggest contribution to reading comprehension and fluency, whilst intonation appeared to make the biggest contribution to decoding. **Our findings demonstrate the importance of individual elements of speech rhythm sensitivity to reading in early readers, which has been used to influence the development of literacy scheme Rising Stars Reading Planet \(see section 4\).**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of our research has been achieved through the following key activities: 

 **Rising Stars: Reading Planet** 

 Our research findings on the effectiveness of rhythmic training for enhancing reading skills in beginning readers **\(R01\)** gained the attention of external publisher, Rising Stars. We were approached to collaborate on the development of Reading Planet, the first literacy curriculum on the market to successfully incorporate rhythmic training for children alongside its books. We worked with Rising Stars to not only help develop the content of 408 children’s books based on our research, but also to develop material for the teacher’s guides, providing a\) guidance on the importance of developing children’s awareness of speech rhythm for reading and b\) related classroom activities based our research. 

 Reading Planet was launched to schools with 132 titles in October 2016 \( **S01; S02**\). Rising Stars have since published a further 276 titles, taking the scheme to a total of 408 books. Specific information on sales data and data from independent trials conducted by Rising Stars is not accessible to us, however, it is estimated that over 12,000 children in the UK have engaged with Reading Planet and the rhythm\-based activities developed by us, with additional interest in markets internationally \(monetary sales data are confidential and not accessible to us, though some indication is provided in supporting statement **S01**\). Over 750,000 copies of Rising Stars: Reading Planet books have been sold, including over 150,000 internationally. At least 20 schools who have utilised the scheme in the UK have provided positive feedback on the official Rising Stars website. The scheme also provides home learning resources to parents via its website \( **S02**\), including free reading advice \(e.g. helping children to master phonics\) and the opportunity to buy copies of the books provided in schools. 

 An independent evaluation of the impact of Reading Planet in 2017 yielded qualitative data from practitioners demonstrating the positive impact on the experience of learning to read for both children and their teachers. Unlike sales data, we were provided access to the qualitative feedback. Feedback from teachers describes the rhythmic activities within the books as “… *fun and engaging activities for the children and were used to help them learn about the importance of intonation, stress and timing. The activities match up with Letters and Sound phase 1 and seen as particularly useful for children struggling with phonics, helping them to become more aware of sounds before they start reading. Some schools are using speech rhythm activities as 1\-2\-1 interventions with lower achievers”* \( **S02**\) *.* 

 **Improving on teacher’s knowledge and use of rhythmic reading activities** 

 Despite research findings demonstrating the importance of rhythmic awareness for the development of literacy skills **\(R01\),** and the implementation of Rising Stars across primary schools in the UK and internationally, many teachers are still not aware of the benefits of including such activities in their teaching. 

 We provided a virtual CPD accredited workshop in July 2020 on rhythmic awareness and rhythmic training activities that can be used with primary school children. We assessed attendees’ knowledge of speech rhythm both before and after the workshop, and also measured the perceived utility of rhythmic activities for attendees’ teaching practice. The workshop was attended by a diverse range of 40 professionals including teachers, teaching assistants and assistant head teachers, from community, state and SEN schools \( **S03**\) **. Our workshop was both effective in increasing delegates’ knowledge of the importance of speech rhythm sensitivity, and increasing knowledge of rhythmic reading activities. Importantly, the activities were perceived by delegates as being suitable for use in their classrooms.** 

 Overall, 90% of the responding delegates reported a large increase in their knowledge of rhythmic reading activities after attending the workshop, that the activities were suitable for use in their classroom, and that they would be able to implement them with ease. Approximately 80% of responding delegates stated that they would be ‘very’ or ‘highly likely’ to include the activities in their teaching. Intention to share the content of the activities with colleagues was also high, with 90% of responding delegates indicating a likelihood to do so. 

 Comments from attendees also demonstrated how the workshop had improved their understanding of rhythmic reading and its implementation in their classrooms: *‘It has given me more knowledge to know what to use and resources I will need’, ‘I am going to link this \(activity\) into our phase 1 letters and sounds planning’.* 

 **Delegate feedback demonstrated both the suitability of rhythmic reading activities and their perceived ease of implementation into teaching practice across a diverse range of educational settings.** A follow\-up four months later, once teachers had had the opportunity to implement the new approach, demonstrated that teaching staff who engaged with the workshop have successfully embedded rhythmic activities into their teaching, and have observed benefits for their pupils. For example, one respondent stated that she had “ *created PowerPoint presentations outlining activities which focus on rhythm, music and speech*”, and has “ *integrated these into \[her\] teaching*”, as well as sharing materials, ideas and knowledge surrounding rhythmic awareness with her colleagues. Another explained how she had implemented rhythmic activities into her teaching to promote student engagement: “ *I have used a drum skin to tap out the rhythm of poems with my students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. They have become highly engaged with this activity over time and a couple of them are usually very difficult to engage.*” This follow\-up demonstrates that **attendance at our workshop had an impact on the teaching techniques used within the classroom.**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 McInnes’ research in global health has had a direct and significant impact on public policy in Wales. Because of his research, during 2015\-2016, McInnes was invited to work with Public Health Wales in drafting a ‘Pathfinder for Global Health’, with the encouragement of the Learned Society of Wales and the InterAction Council. The Pathfinder, and McInnes’ research, contributed directly and substantially to the first international health strategy to be developed by the government of Wales: *Nationally Focused, Globally Responsible: Our International Health Strategy 2017\-2027*. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 McInnes has been researching in the field of global health since 2003. During the period 2009 to 2015, he conducted research on the transformed nature of global health governance, focusing both on the relationship of global health with other policy sectors, and the manner in which health governance was characterised by multiple, intersecting levels of policy formulation – from the local through national to global. 

 Much of McInnes’ research in global health has been collaborative and inter\-disciplinary, especially with Kelley Lee \(formerly of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, now at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver\). His research has been funded by UK and international research councils as well as charities. In particular, much of the underpinning research for this Impact Case Study \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\] were funded by a European Research Council Advanced Investigator Grant into ‘The Transformation of Global Health Governance’ \[3.5\]. 

 Specifically, McInnes’ research has focussed on a number of areas, including: 

1.  How globalisation has impacted upon health. McInnes’ research discusses how phenomena such as the increased mobility of people and animals acting as vectors for the spread of disease, the dominant presence of multi\-national companies in the pharmaceutical market, the increased mobility of health professionals, and the emergence of global funding bodies has transformed not only health determinants but responses to, and the politics of, health – that ‘health is global.’ McInnes’ research suggests that a consequence of this is that health policy needs to be multi\-level – community, national and global \[3.1; 3.2\]. 

  

1.  How new global threats are emerging for public health, including the effects of climate change and novel pathogens. The emergence and rapid spread of new infectious diseases in particular is a by\-product of globalisation, leading to cross\-border outbreaks and pandemics which require national responses to be sensitive to global systems and processes \[3.1\]. 

1.  How, if health is global, then there is a requirement for improved global governance of health. However, existing governance mechanisms are stressed by globalisation, requiring a new commitment to the global good and new forms of engagement, including the use of global networks \[3.2; 3.4\]. 

1.  How global health is multi\-sectoral. Global health does not exist in a policy bubble, but interacts with a variety of other sectors. Health policy therefore needs to be not only multi\-level, but multi\-sectoral taking into account other sectors such as international development \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Health is a devolved responsibility to Wales. Public Health Wales \(PHW\) is the national public health agency charged with protecting and improving health and well\-being in Wales. McInnes’ research directly shaped the Wales’ ‘Pathfinder for Global Health’ \[5.1; 5.2\], which led to Public Health Wales’s international health strategy: *Nationally Focused, Globally Responsible: Our International Health Strategy 2017\-27* \[5.3\]. 

 Between the 2 and 5 of June 2015, the InterAction Council \(IAC\) \- an international think tank consisting of 44 former heads of government from across the world – held its plenary in Wales. In the aftermath of the Ebola crisis, the meeting addressed ‘Responding to Global Health Emergencies,’ and McInnes was invited to join the High\-Level Expert Group producing the report for the Plenary \[5.4.a\]. Leading the discussion on global health governance, McInnes articulated his research findings concerning global threats and the multi\-level and multi\-sectoral nature of global health policy \[5.5\]. The Group included representatives from Public Health Wales, while the Plenary was attended by the First Minister of Wales. The IAC Plenary encouraged Wales to develop a global health strategy and asked its global health adviser, the Secretary of the Learned Society of Wales and formerly Secretary of The Nuffield Trust, to facilitate this \[5.4.b\]. In an email on 29 November 2015, copied to the CEO and other senior figures in Public Health Wales, the Executive Director of Public Health Services, PHW, states that the work done by McInnes for the IAC provides an ‘excellent’ basis for developing the global health strategy for Wales led by Public Health Wales \[5.4.b\]. 

 With the direct support of PHW’s Chief Executive Officer \(CEO\), the IAC’s global health adviser convened a small meeting on 9 November 2015 to discuss drafting a ‘Pathfinder for Global Health in Wales’, which would inform a Wales global health strategy \(this became the *International Health Strategy*\). The meeting involved senior figures in Public Health Wales \(including the Executive Director of Public Health Services, PHW, who had been on the InterAction Council High Level Group\), officers from the Learned Society of Wales, and McInnes \[5.4.b; 5.4.c\]. 

 Following this, McInnes began to draft the Pathfinder with the International Health Lead in Public Health Wales. A second meeting, this time including PHW’s CEO, was held in Cardiff on 7 January 2016 \[5.4.c\] and a draft of the Pathfinder was presented to the InterAction Council’s Plenary in Baku 8 to 10 March 2016 and published on the Learned Society of Wales’ website \[5.1\]. The Pathfinder clearly reflects McInnes’ research in its acknowledgment of: 

-  how new global threats to health were emerging \(e.g., pp.9\-10\); 

-  how health is now both global and multi\-level, and that national policies therefore need to have an international dimension \(e.g., pp.5\-8\); 

-  the significance of governance for health and the importance of new forms of governance such as networks which can promote common values and establish best practice \(e.g., pp.10\-11\); and 

-  of the multi\-sectoral nature of global health, especially the links with sustainable development including the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals \(e.g., pp.6\-7 and 11\). 

 During 2016, McInnes and PHW’s International Health Lead continued to work on the Pathfinder, incorporating comments from staff in Public Health Wales, NHS Wales, and the Welsh Government. This culminated in a 31 October 2016 meeting in Cardiff with Public Health Wales, the InterAction Council Secretariat and McInnes, when the final version of the Pathfinder was discussed and agreed \[5.4.c\]. In the document, McInnes is explicitly identified with the Executive Director of Public Health Services and International Health Lead, PHW, as the lead authors of the Pathfinder. 

 Attention then moved in Public Health Wales to using the Pathfinder as the basis for developing its global health strategy. 

 The *International Strategy* was published in 2017 \[5.3; 5.6\] and clearly reflects the Pathfinder in the following ways: 

1.  The Pathfinder is referenced and explicitly discussed in the *Strategy* \(e.g., pp.33\-4\). 

1.  The underlying emphasis of the *Strategy* on ‘global threats… which have major repercussions for public health’ \(p.iii\), clearly reflects the origins and emphasis of the Pathfinder that ‘local health threats can become global and global health threats have local effects. Further, text on the global nature of health is directly lifted from the Pathfinder \(e.g., p.6\) *.* 

1.  Five of the six ‘Strategic Objectives’ outlined in the *Strategy* \(e.g., pp. 2 and 5\) first appear as ‘areas where Wales can make a difference’ in the Pathfinder: 

|| Pathfinder ‘area where Wales can make a difference’. | *Strategy* Strategic Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Networking and partnerships | 1 | 1 |
| Research and innovation | 2 | 2 |
| Capacity and capability | 3 | 5 |
| Responsibility and sustainability | 4 | 6 |
| Governance and accountability | 5 | 4 |

 Table 1: To show the five strategic objectives outlined in the *Strategy* that first appeared in the Pathfinder 

1.  The *Strategy’s* understanding of the multi\-sectoral and multi\-level nature of health and health governance \(e.g., ‘Strategy Map’ p.3\), and especially the relationship with sustainable development and the SDGs, is clearly articulated in the Pathfinder. 

 As a result, McInnes’ research on global health can be clearly seen to have had a direct and significant impact upon public policy in Wales. Specifically, his research identifying the global, multi\-sectoral nature of health, the emergence of new threats, and the requirement for new governance mechanisms, including networks.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at University of Lincoln has contributed to international practices of conflict prevention and shaping the national curriculum in Rwanda through applied performance practice\-as\-research. The research has had wide\-ranging impacts on international practices of conflict prevention; public awareness and understanding of conflict issues; public access to and participation in political processes; the design and delivery of school curricula and new extra\-curricular opportunities for young people; the inspiration, creation and support of new forms of artistic and social expression \(particularly in performance art\); and the integration of participatory practices as a teaching and learning method in the UK and abroad. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The impacts described here arise from research conducted by Professor Ananda Breed since joining the University of Lincoln in January 2018. Breed works both nationally and internationally as an applied performance practitioner and researcher, contributing to several important projects exploring the relationship between participatory art and peacebuilding processes. Breed served as Co\-Investigator on the £2M AHRC GCRF Network Plus ‘Changing the Story: building inclusive societies with and for young people in 5 post conflict countries’ *\(NB grant confirmed Oct 2017, research commencing 2018\).* She implemented a critical review pilot project entitled ‘Mobile Arts for Peace’ \(MAP\) working with partners University of Leeds, Rwanda Education Board \(REB\) and the Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace \(IRDP\) alongside five schools in the Eastern Province. This project received £100,000 AHRC GCRF funding for project ‘Ubwuzu: Shaping the Rwandan National Curriculum through Arts’ to extend the initial pilot project to the other four provinces \(Western, Northern, Southern, Kigali\) reaching 25 schools in total \(2018\-20\). In January 2020, Breed was awarded as Principal Investigator of a £2M AHRC GCRF Network Plus project to extend her research and its impact to three additional countries including Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia and Nepal. This AHRC GCRF Network Plus project ‘Mobile Arts for Peace: Informing the National Curriculum and Youth Policy for Peacebuilding in Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Indonesia, and Nepal’ 2020\-24. \( [https://map.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/](https://map.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/)\) includes 8 Co\-Investigators and 22 partnering organisations. 

 Across this work, Breed’s research investigates the relationship of underlying collective or ‘public transcripts’ and personal or ‘hidden’ transcripts to socio\-political contexts of conflict \[3.1\] working with local communities to identify how cultural forms can be adapted for dialogic purposes and to stage possible solutions to conflict issues. Breed's research has developed arts\-based methods that: a\) help communities and individuals forge peace\-building initiatives in post\-conflict countries \[3.2 and 3.3\]; b\) engage young people in peace\-building strategies after conflict and trauma; and c\) develop policy and knowledge\-exchange partnerships co\-led by countries affected by conflict and trauma \[3.4\]. Through MAP, Breed’s research has underpinned practice\-based initiatives in post\-genocide Rwanda. Notably, Breed’s research responded to the UNESCO Rwanda 2017 report \(‘Diversity of Cultural Expressions’\) to inform the subject of Music, Dance and Drama in primary and secondary schools in Rwanda. 

 This research has contributed new knowledge about how embodied local discourses may inform or counter hegemonic or national constructions of post\-conflict identity formation. It responds to wider international debates concerning participatory practices for conflict prevention. Breed developed this specific approach through her consultation with artists, educators, young people, academics and CSO workers to adapt local games and performance traditions into applied practices for dialogic purposes \[3.2\]. Her research exploring the use of the arts in post\-conflict contexts yielded several notable publications \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Breed's underpinning research focuses on the relationship between applied performance practice\-as\-research and international practices of conflict prevention. Her research has delivered measurable and sustainable benefits for peacebuilding initiatives and civil society organizations \(Institute for Research and Dialogue for Peace, Kwetu Film Institute, and Uyisenga Ni Imanzi\) in all five provinces in Rwanda. Many of the broad benefits of the research are described in two Kwetu documentaries about the impact of Breed’s methodology in Rwanda **\[5.1\].** 

 More specifically this research has had demonstrable national impact through underpinning the development of: \(a\) subject provision for Music, Dance and Drama and Peace Education within Rwanda's National Curriculum Framework; \(b\) MAP activities which, to date, have supported the teaching practice of over 479 educators and worked with 9,682 Rwandan young people **\[5.2\]**; and \(c\) a Youth Advisory Board \(2019\) composed of youth representatives from each province to make recommendations for Rwanda’s Curriculum Framework. Between 2018\-2020, MAP was the Rwandan strand for the GCRF ‘Changing the Story' Project \(University of Leeds\). As a result of the listed impacts below, Breed has been awarded a £2M GCRF award \(2020\-24\) to expand MAP to three additional ODA countries: Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, and Nepal. 

 **Development of MAP Curriculum and contribution to Rwandan National Curriculum** 

 Breed conducted the pilot project for MAP in Rwanda's Eastern Province, which extended to the other four provinces \(Western, Northern, Southern, Kigali\). Applied performance is new to this region, and MAP adult trainers report in personal testimonials that MAP’s participatory techniques have ' *enriched teachers' communication skills and leadership skills'* and had a ' *huge impact*' on teachers ‘ *using \[MAP\] methodologies in teaching and learning processes*' in schools across all five provinces of Rwanda **\[5.3\].** 

 In 2020, the University of Rwanda commissioned a critical review report that concluded that MAP has demonstrably ' *contributed to the academic achievement of students and raised their leadership skills*' and that MAP has ' *contributed greatly to conflict resolution among students in schools'* **\[5.2\].** The report cited testimonials from MAP trainers who commented that using MAP techniques in their classrooms had increased their confidence as teachers and enhanced the ' *motivation*', ' *critical thinking*', and ' *discipline of learners'* **\[5.2 & 5.3\].** Breed's contributions to teaching and school resources in all five Rwandan provinces include a curriculum manual, cultural arts workshops, training of trainer workshops, youth camps, and establishment of MAP clubs and arts\-based electives within schools. The Rwanda Education Board has recognized the benefits of MAP's participatory approaches as addressing the need for a national curriculum in Music, Dance and Drama in Rwanda. The Director of the IRDP, notes that Breed led a productive ' *partnership with Rwanda Education Board \(REB\) and College of Education, University of Rwanda for MAP to provide both formal and informal routes to inform the national curriculum'* **\[5.4\].** REB's endorsement of the MAP curriculum ensured the sustainability of MAP training and methodology in Rwanda. The Director General from REB noted *‘Breed has served as an exemplary researcher, trainer and consultant to inform the National Curriculum through informal and formal mechanisms working alongside partnering organisations…Breed has sought to serve an existing need; to inform the National Curriculum in the subject of Music, Dance and Drama alongside Peace Education.’* **\[5.5\].** 

 **Integration of interdisciplinary participatory arts into peacebuilding initiatives** 

 Leading civil society organisations including the IRDP, Kwetu Film Institute and Uyisenga Ni Imanzi, noted the importance of Breed's work in enhancing dialogue and peacebuilding initiatives **\[5.1, 5.4, 5.6. 5.7\].** Uyisenga Ni Imanzi is an organization that provides support to orphan\-headed households in Rwanda and its Director, Chaste Uwihoreye, recognizes that MAP has demonstrably improved the organisation's understanding of ' *how young people can play an active part in research, policy and community\-building'.* Uwihoreye notes that MAP has provided Uyisenga Ni Imanzi *'with a clearer understanding of the strategic steps which we could take to generate new opportunities for youth\-led community dialogue that could provide opportunities to address trauma and conflict resolution'* **\[5.7\]** Similarly, Breed's focus on local Rwandan cultural forms within applied performance has provided teachers with exceptional participatory resources that connect Rwandan cultural heritages to psychosocial initiatives. IDRP's testimonial affirmed that MAP ' *has achieved exceptional impact due to the curriculum design, training, and facilitation of Breed*' and has equipped teachers to ' *integrate psychosocial approaches to mental health within the design and delivery of the project, to create participatory theatre performances based on conflict issues, and to develop the role of arts for dialogue and peacebuilding*' **\[5.4\].** Through the ‘MAP at Home’ project funded by UKRI GCRF/Newton Fund \(\~£500k, 2020\-22\) Breed \(PI\) has connected the existing MAP community with leading mental health providers in Rwanda during COVID\-19, including the Rwanda Biomedical Centre and the National Rehabilitation Services. 

 **MAP Youth Advisory Board \(YAB\)** 

 MAP has demonstrably widened young people's access to, and participation in, political processes. This has occurred through the development of a Youth Advisory Board \(YAB\) to work alongside the Rwanda Arts Council and National Youth Council. The YAB has delivered policy\-informing documents related to young people's issues and problems to policymakers. According to a YAB member 'With MAP I have come to understand that art \[Music, Dance, and Drama\] plays an important role in the Rwandan society. Art \(for instance through songs\) can expose problems prevailing in Rwandan society. Art serves as an efficient means of communication' **\[5.2\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at York has estimated the health effects of changes in health care expenditure. <ins>First</ins>, these estimates **inform all impact assessments conducted by the UK Department of Health and Social Care** \(DHSC\). They have informed negotiation with the UK Treasury during spending reviews, the reform of the cancer drugs fund, how new vaccines are commissioned, and how health benefits are discounted in national accounts. They have also contributed to the negotiation of substantial rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to the NHS. <ins>Second</ins>, the research has inspired **similar work in other countries** and has directly informed national policy on pharmaceutical pricing in Norway and Canada. It has also informed the discounts required by health insurers and state\-funded Medicaid programmes in the United States. <ins>Third</ins>, applying a similar approach to country level data has provided **estimates of health opportunity costs for low and middle income countries** \(LMICs\). This has led the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and the World Bank to change how they make recommendations about the cost\-effectiveness of health care interventions, informed prioritisation at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) and has directly informed the development of the health benefits packages of the Ministries of Health in Malawi and Ghana. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at York has estimated the marginal productivity of NHS expenditure or the shadow price of the NHS budget constraint. This indicates the health opportunity costs associated with additional NHS costs and how the cost\-effectiveness of interventions and policies can be judged. It is central to a range of resource allocation decisions. Output **\[A\]** demonstrated how national data, which identifies expenditure by broad programmes of care, can be linked to mortality outcomes and used to estimate the relationship between changes in expenditure and health outcomes, while addressing issues of endogeneity by identifying and testing suitable instruments. This work was further developed through MRC/NIHR funded research to estimate expenditure and outcome equations across all 23 programmes of NHS care; capturing the effects of changes in expenditure on length and quality of life **\[B\]**. 

 This research also identifies where \(by disease area\) and what types of health outcomes \(mortality and quality of life effects\) are likely to be gained \(lost\) as a consequence of increases \(decreases\) in NHS expenditure and for whom \(by age and gender\). It provides the analytic and evidential foundation to incorporate a range of values that can be attached to different types of health effects \(gained or displaced\), as well as the associated wider consumption effects \(supported by other York published research\). Since 2014 the DHSC \(Department of Health until 2018\) has funded the development of this work as part of the Economic Evaluation Policy Research Unit \(EEPRU\) with analysis of subsequent waves of expenditure and outcome data **\[E\]**, examination of the effect of the scale of budget impact and adopting an alternative approach to identification based on exogenous elements in funding allocations **\[C\]**. This research was conducted with close oversight by the DHSC and the Health & Care Alignment Working Group. **The key insight was that the cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year \(QALY\) gained through changes in NHS expenditure is likely to be less than GBP15,000 per QALY, which is substantially less than the norms used to judge the cost\-effectiveness of new health technologies**. The DHSC renewed EEPRU funding \(2019\) with estimation of health opportunity cost identified as a key priority area and extended the analysis to consider public health **\[F\]** and social care expenditure. 

 This work has been extended in a number of directions by researchers at York. The implications that these estimates might have for other countries was explored using estimates of income elasticity of demand for health and assumptions about the relative ‘underfunding’ of publicly funded health care. Work funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) applied estimated elasticities of health expenditure on mortality, survival and morbidity, using country level data, to country specific measures of: infrastructure, donor funding, population distribution, mortality rates, conditional life expectancies \(by age and gender\), disability burden of disease and total health care expenditure. This work provides estimates of country specific cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year \(DALY\) averted of changes in health expenditure in 93 low and middle income countries \(LMICs\) **\[D\]**. The key insight is that cost per DALY averted of changes in health expenditure is likely to be substantially lower than the norms widely used by global bodies which make recommendations, purchase health technologies or prioritise the development of new ones as well as decision makers in LMICs. Published York research showed that an assessment of the health opportunity costs of expenditure, and how it is likely to evolve over time, is an important consideration in the appropriate discounting of health and health care costs. The work was extended to cover LMICs, contributing to the BMGF reference case for benefit cost analysis. The research has also inspired similar work in other countries \(Spain, Australia, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China and Indonesia\) with the advice or collaboration of York researchers.

##  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **UK Impact**: Research at the University of York on health opportunity costs was described \(by the former DHSC Chief Analyst\) *as “the single most important piece of work”* being done for the DHSC **\[1a\]**. Since 2014 DHSC routinely uses GBP15,000 per QALY as an empirical estimate of health opportunity costs based on the findings of York research.  Since 2014 this ongoing programme of research has been funded by DHSC \(through EEPRU\). Progress and findings are regularly presented by York researchers and discussed at frequent meetings with policy makers and analysts at DHSC and the Health & Care Alignment Working Group \(a cross departmental group tasked with aligning how economic evaluations are undertaken\) **\[1a\]\[1b\]**. **This research has changed the way policy analysis undertaken by the DHSC is conducted** and *“the results of the work are being used in internal Impact Assessments at DHSC”*, which are a mandatory requirement for all new policies introduced across government. Since 2014, DHSC has undertaken 23 impact assessments using the GBP15,000 per QALY estimate, considering policies ranging from the regulation of dental charges to accelerated access to new medical technologies **\[1c\]**. These assessments reported a total financial impact of GBP1.9 billion. However, the health opportunity costs associated with these policies, which were not routinely considered prior to the York research, were estimated to be 125,846 QALYs, which the DHSC values at GBP7.5 billion. 

 York research on the marginal productivity of NHS expenditure has, at the request of DHSC, been extended to public health and more recently social care expenditure. These estimates have informed negotiations between HM Treasury and DHSC during periodic spending reviews and the role of public health and prevention in the strategic plan for the NHS. The findings of York research have been described \(by the Chief Economist at Public Health England\) as, *“the central message to HMT in relation to public health spending, and I believe was influential in securing a better funding settlement than in previous years”* **\[1b\]**. More recently these findings have also, *“been fed directly into the deliberations of the Health & Social Care Taskforce, a jointly\-run group between HMT and No.10”* **\[1b\]**. York research has also had an impact on proposed reforms by DHSC and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\) regarding how new vaccines are commissioned, and how changes to existing national immunisation programmes are considered. An estimate of GBP15,000 per QALY was recommended to judge the cost effectiveness of immunisation programmes **\[1d\]**. The DHSC supported this recommendation, which *“should deliver a positive impact on overall population health through the better allocation of health resources,”* although, to date, this has not been taken up by the Government. 

 Research at York on health opportunity costs has also been central to the question of how much the NHS can afford to pay for the benefits offered by new pharmaceuticals. The importance of an empirical assessment of opportunity cost \(‘displacement’\) was evident in the terms of reference DHSC gave to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) for developing value based assessment for pharmaceutical pricing **\[2a\]**. Claxton was a special advisor to the NICE Methods Working Party on value based assessment, and evidence of opportunity costs \(‘displacement’\) based on York research was presented, and informed the briefing papers **\[2a\]**. The scheme ultimately proposed by NICE in 2014 did not, however, reflect likely opportunity costs, and, as a consequence, was withdrawn following consultation, which included a critical submission from York **\[2b\]**. With evidence from York research, that the cost per QALY of NHS expenditure was likely to be lower than the norms used by NICE **\[2b\],** the DHSC was able to negotiate national rebates, based on caps on total branded pharmaceutical expenditure as part of the 2014 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation \(PPRS\) agreement. A new voluntary scheme was agreed, following confidential negotiations in 2018, where evidence from this body of research, indicating that the cost per QALY remains less than GBP15,000, was vital in securing continued rebates payments from 2019 to 2024 \(GBP841,000,000 was repaid to the NHS from manufacturers in 2019\) **\[3\]**. Researchers from York were involved in detailed discussions about rebate mechanisms with key stakeholders in preparation for these negotiations \(e.g., ABPI May 2016, Janssen Dec 2017 and March 2018, DHSE and NHSE, May 2017 and March 2018\). 

 York research has also informed other policies. For example, in 2015 the National Audit Office \(NAO\) investigated the Cancer Drugs Fund and requested evidence from York researchers. This showed that the health opportunity costs of the fund far exceeded possible health benefits. Following the NAO’s critical report, which cites this evidence **\[4\]**, the Cancer Drugs Fund was reformed, removing the possibility of budget overruns \(GBP136,000,000 in 2014/15\), removing less cost effective drugs, and collecting more adequate evidence of benefit. The Office of National Statistics \(ONS\) commissioned an external review of discounting national accounts including health benefits where an empirical assessment of health opportunity costs is important. The review, co\-authored by York researchers, drew heavily on the underpinning research and provided transparency and validation of how ONS discounts QALY gains **\[5\]** which informs the evaluation of a range of health policies. 

 **Shaping Public Debate**: As well as direct impact on a range of national policy and expenditure decisions in the UK, the research has generated broader public debate about funding and access to health care. This is evidenced by invitations to address a range of stakeholders including: devolved UK administrations \(All Wales Medicines Strategy Group, Jan 2019\); regulators \(Association of Competition Law Judges & the European Commission, June 2018\); health policy stakeholders \(e.g. Westminster Health Forum Keynote Seminars Jan/Sept 2015, Jan 2016 & July 2017\); clinical communities \(e.g., Society of British Neurosurgeons Sept 2015, UK Oncology Forum June 2016 & June 2019, Academy of Medical Sciences June 2017\); and the pharmaceutical and health insurance sector \(e.g. FT Global Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Conference Nov 2015, WPA Group Sept 2018\). The impact on public debate is evidenced by interviews for TV \(‘ [Trust me I’m a Doctor’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2lpf77CqzzsxqsQDRjcCxDh/is-the-nhs-using-your-money-wisely) BBC2 2018\), radio \(e.g. BBC Radio 4  [Today Programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b052ln53) Feb 2015\) and coverage in print media \(e.g.  [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/drugs-watchdog-costs-more-lives-than-it-saves-glqsxr3m0gl),  [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/d00c4a02-b784-11e4-981d-00144feab7de),  [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/19/nhs-buys-expensive-new-drugs-nice-york-karl-claxton-nice), Feb 2015\) as well as invitations to address lay audiences \(e.g., Stopaids Oct 2016 & April 2019, *Cafe Scientifique* March 2017, Rotary Club April 2018\). 

 **International Impact**: The research has also had a direct impact on national policy on pharmaceutical pricing in Norway and Canada and discounts to list prices in the USA. Researchers at York were invited by The National Council for Quality Improvement and Priority Setting in Health Care to present the UK research to members of the Norheim Commission \(Oslo, March 2014\). This public enquiry recommended that the Ministry of Health and Care Services adopt a cost per QALY ‘threshold’ founded on evidence from York research **\[6\]**. These recommendations were adopted by the Norwegian Medicines Agency \(NoMA\) in 2015. Researchers at York were invited to present their research and its implications for pharmaceutical pricing to members of the Canadian Patented Medicines Price Review Board \(PMPRB\) \(Banff, June 2017\). PMPRB commissioned researchers at York to conduct an analysis of the likely cost per QALY for the Canadian Provinces, founded on the underpinning research, to inform their reforms to pharmaceutical pricing \(Ottawa, May 2018\). Following unsuccessful legal challenges, these reforms require potentially substantial discounts to list prices based on a cost per QALY threshold which draws on the results of this work **\[7a\]\[7b\]**. The US Institute for Clinical and Economic Review \(ICER\) evaluates the clinical and economic value of prescription drugs. It has become known as the nation’s independent watchdog on drug pricing, reporting ‘health\-benefit price benchmarks’ that inform the discounts required by private health insurers as well as the state funded Medicaid programmes. Informed by York research, the ICER updated its value assessment framework which lowered its ‘benchmark prices’, following an invitation to present a series of ICER Webinars \(June 2019\) **\[8\]**. It has also inspired recent US research \(with York researchers\) that further strengthens the case that substantial discounts are often required. 

 **Impact on LMICs**: The Gates Foundation has funded research at York to apply a similar approach using country level data to provide estimates of health opportunity costs for LMICs. Following presentation of this work to the Foundation \(Seattle, June & September 2016\) this evidence has been integrated into how the Foundation undertakes health impact and cost effectiveness analyses for most product development projects in the BMGF portfolio **\[9a\]**. This analysis informs the executive board when prioritising product development decisions \(York researchers presented to members of executive board, April 2019\). The key insight from this research was that the cost per DALY of changes in health expenditure is likely to be substantially less than the 1 to 3 GDP *per capita* per DALY averted, which had become a widely used norm to make recommendations and inform decisions in LMICs. Following a presentation of these findings to key stakeholders in Global Health \(June 2015\) and at WHO \(Geneva, March 2016\) the WHO distanced itself from these norms **\[9b\]**. In September 2020 Claxton was appointed to the WHO working group for the Fair Pricing Forum and this work is informing proposals for tiered pricing mechanisms. Disease Control Priorities \(DCP\) is an influential resource published by the World Bank which guides global organisations, donors and LMICs in identifying essential packages of related and cost\-effective interventions. Researchers at York were invited to discuss their research with DCP authors \(Seattle, June 2016\). The third edition of DCP rejects the previous norms as too high, and instead uses criteria based on evidence from York research to identify those interventions which are likely to be cost\-effective in different settings **\[9c\]**. 

 This work has informed which interventions should be included in publicly and donor funded packages of care. The Ministry of Health \(MoH\) of Malawi invited researchers at York to assist in developing the Health Sector Strategic Plan and identify an essential health benefit package \(HBP\) based on evidence of health opportunity costs. Researchers at York worked closely with the MoH developing analysis which was presented to stakeholder workshops \(Lilongwe, June 2016\), which included the Minister of Health, senior civil servants, politicians and donors. This provided the MoH with a transparent, evidence based approach to informing the content and scale of the HBP with existing resources, identifying interventions that should be prioritised and the value of implementation efforts **\[10a\]\[10b\]**. This HBP is recognised as an example of how universal coverage might be achieved with a more affordable package that almost doubles the DALYs averted in Malawi, evidenced by the Minister of Health being invited to address the plenary opening of the 71st World Health Assembly in Geneva about the Malawian HBP **\[10c\]\[10d\]**. York Researchers also provided advice during the development of the health benefits package for Ghana, which took a similar approach, based on evidence of health opportunity costs from York research **\[10e\]**. **In summary, by informing policy and practice in relation to decisions on the use of health care resources the research, as whole, has contributed to maximising the health gains achieved from limited resources both nationally and internationally.**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the University of Exeter \(UoE\) has increased understanding of fisheries’ impacts on the spatial ecology, population dynamics, and conservation of endangered marine predators. This research has developed analytical approaches that have: 

 \(1\) informed **policy debate,** leading to evidence\-based **legislative change** in the designation of a 580km<sup>2</sup> Marine Protected Area \(MPA\), which has increased protection for two highly threatened seabird species in South Africa, and improved the management of marine environments; 

 \(2\) supported **capacity building** in Southern Africa \(South Africa, Namibia, Angola\) through the development of a decision\-support tool adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Shark Specialist Group and governments in Southern Africa. This has improved reliability and transparency in status assessments of heavily exploited marine predators such as sharks and rays; 

 \(3\) influenced international policy leading to **international regulation changes** for two threatened shark species \(Shortfin Mako and Oceanic Whitetip\) resulting in their addition to international conventions managing the international trade and retention of key species. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Although we know that industrial fisheries can negatively affect individual marine predators via direct exploitation, bycatch and competition for prey stocks, we still have an incomplete understanding of how these pressures manifest themselves at the population level. Since 2013, Sherley and Votier have conducted research under three cross\-cutting themes to address this critical knowledge gap. This research, conducted in collaboration with host\-country partners, has developed cutting\-edge analytical techniques to inform protected area designations and fisheries management at a national scale, and efforts to increase the protection of highly threatened marine predators at the global scale. 

 <ins>Ecologically relevant MPAs for predatory seabirds:</ins> In Southern Africa, four endemic seabirds are considered *Endangered* by the IUCN as a result of population declines in excess of 50% over the last 50 years. These declines were linked to competition with fisheries. To understand whether fishing closures might mitigate these declines, in 2008 the South African government, in partnership with a number of stakeholders including \(from 2013\) UoE, initiated a unique experiment that saw alternating 3\-year fishing closures of 20 km around four African Penguin *Spheniscus* *demersus* colonies \(Figure 1\). UoE\-led research highlighted the importance of prey close to these colonies for penguins \(which eat commercially targeted forage fish\) \[ **3.1, 3.2**\] and Bank Cormorants *Phalacrocorax neglectus* \[ **3.3**\] \(which eat benthic, reef associated prey, including the commercially valuable rock lobster *Jasus lalandii*\). The UoE modelling approach revealed that Bank Cormorants populations would respond positively to localised closures of the rock lobster fishery \[ **3.3**\], and that excluding fishing improved penguin chick survival and condition, which in turn increased their population growth rate \[ **3.2,3.4**\]. **This body of research was the first to demonstrate that a pelagic \(open ocean\) fishing closure could drive bottom\-up biodiversity benefits.** 

 
<ins>Matching the scales of conservation and ecological processes:</ins> 

 **Figure 1.** Experimental fishing closures \(green circles\), the new 580km<sup>2</sup> Robben Island Marine Protected Area \(black and green dashed box\) in South Africa, and the Namibian Islands’ Marine Protected Area \(NIMPA, green hashed box\). 

UoE research has also highlighted that the population decline of African Penguins was happening too rapidly to be driven only by poor reproductive success \[ **3.2,3.4**\]. Tracking juvenile penguins during their initial dispersal from colonies spanning central Namibia to Bird Island, South Africa \(Figure 1\) revealed that these birds travelled long distances to cool, plankton\-rich waters that no longer supported large stocks of sardines and anchovies because of overfishing and climate change. **This provided the very first example of a marine ecological trap** \[ **3.5**\], highlighted the importance of protecting prey for non\-breeding African Penguins \[ **3.4,3.5**\], and demonstrated that the existing MPA network, including the 12,000 km<sup>2</sup> Namibian Islands’ MPA \(NIMPA, Figure 1\), were insufficient to protect all key penguin foraging habitats. 

 <ins>Informing the</ins> <ins>global conservation status of pelagic predators:</ins> Studying the ongoing seabird declines in South Africa and Namibia led Sherley to begin working with Henning Winker \(EU Joint Research Centre\) on Bayesian state\-space models. This collaboration led to the development of a decision\-support tool called JARA \(Just Another Red\-List Assessment\). By combining Bayesian state\-space modelling and abundance data, **this new tool improves the transparency and robustness of IUCN Red List species assessments**. To date, five species have been identified as highly threatened \(globally *Endangered* or *Critically* *Endangered*\) for the first time using JARA, including the Shortfin Mako *Isurus oxyrinchus* \[ **3.6**\] and the Oceanic Whitetip Shark *Carcharhinus longimanus \(Critically* *Endangered\).* All five species suffer high mortality in fisheries, highlighting that existing conservation actions have been ineffective.

 Fishing is having major negative effects on the marine environment, preventing countries from meeting their commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity and UN Sustainable Development Goals. UoE\-led research has **developed innovative analytical approaches and tools** \(such as JARA\) that have informed **policy debate** \[ **5.1**\] **,** led to evidence\-based **legislative change** \[ **5.2**\], supported **capacity building** in Southern Africa \(South Africa, Namibia, Angola\) \[ **5.3**\], and **informed regulation changes** around species status under international conventions \[ **5.4**\]. 

 <ins>Process and beneficiaries:</ins> through long\-term collaborations with NGOs working in the region, governmental departments and academic partners, UoE research has had a demonstrable impact on capacity in Southern Africa and international efforts to robustly assess the status of globally threatened species: 

 “*The publications arising from \[projects with UoE\] in highly regarded journals, give increased credibility to the conservation work that we do*” – *Chief Executive Officer, Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds \(SANCCOB\)* \[ **5.5**\]. 

 “*Research from the University of Exeter has been of great importance to the South African government, especially its role in investigating the impact of fisheries on seabirds*” – *Chief Director: Oceans and Coastal Research, Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries \(DEFF\), South Africa* \[ **5.2**\]. 

 “*JARA has resulted in far greater objectivity and transparency in the Red List Assessment of sharks and rays \[and\] greater stakeholder trust in the resulting species classifications*”– *IUCN Shark Specialist Group Co\-Chair* \[ **5.4**\]. 

 <ins> **1</ins><ins>.a</ins> <ins>Informed policy debate</ins>, leading to evidence\-based legislative change**: **Marine Protected Area \(MPA\).** UoE work has, through the designation of a 580km<sup>2</sup> MPA, increased protection for seabirds in South Africa. UoE research \[ **3.1–3.4**\] has been integral to **ensuring the** **government could make evidence\-based decisions** on management of marine resources \[ **5.2**\]. UoE\-led research on penguin\-forage fisheries interactions \[ **3.1,3.3,3.4**\] contributed to independent reviews of South Africa’s experimental fishing closures in 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2020 \[ **5.6**, **5.7**\]. Moreover, Sherley was one of six members of a Task Team \[ **5.7**\] that advised the government on decisions pertaining to the continuation of the experiment \[ **5.2**\]. These outputs, combined with UoE\-led research that confirmed a link between rock lobster abundance and Bank Cormorant population dynamics \[ **3.2**\], **guided legislative change** by providing **the evidence base** needed to include provisions for seabird conservation \(prohibiting fishing for rock lobster, sardine and anchovy\) in a **new 580km<sup>2</sup> MPA** designated around Robben Island \(Figure 1\) in 2019 \[ **5.2**\]: 

 “*Dr Sherley’s contributions have assisted the government with evidence\-based decision making predicated on scientific advice of international standing \[and\] University of Exeter led research \[has\] contributed to the motivation for and design of the Robben Island Marine Protected Area”* – *Chief Director: Oceans and Coastal Research, DEFF, South Africa* \[ **5.2**\] 

 <ins> **1</ins><ins>.</ins><ins>b</ins> <ins></ins><ins>Informed</ins> <ins>policy debate</ins>, leading to evidence\-based legislative change: Management** **of Marine Environments.** UoE research has also **informed submissions to government by NGOs**, including a 2019 policy brief \[ **5.1**\] in which our papers \[ **3.1,3.3,3.4**\] were 3 of the 5 “key scientific publications” underpinning the argument for “declaring permanent closure of \[20 km\] areas around the six largest \[penguin\] breeding colonies” \[ **5.1**\]. And UoE research has **stimulated decisions in regional policy documents:** the Draft 2<sup>nd</sup> Biodiversity Management Plan for the African Penguin states that UoE research on metapopulation tracking of juveniles \[ **3.5**\] supports “suspending fishing when prey drops below critical thresholds” to safeguard seabirds’ access to prey outside of existing protected areas \[ **5.8**\]. The important role played by UoE research in these processes has been recognised both by the government \[ **5.2**\] and external stakeholders: 

 *“The \[UoE\-led\] work highlights the benefits of fishing restrictions to penguins within 20 km of paired islands through the island closure experiment, one we laud the South African government for having initiated and maintained”–* *IUCN Penguin Specialist Group Co\-Chairs* \[ **5.9**\]. 

 “*The South African government is updating the current Biodiversity Management Plan for the African Penguin \[and\] Dr Sherley’s work is crucial to some of the actions that have been drafted therein”* – *Chief Executive Officer, SANCCOB* \[ **5.5**\].

<ins> **2.</ins> <ins>Supported capacity building</ins> in Southern Africa through the development decision\-support tool.** The development of JARA as a decision support tool \[ **3.6**\] was directly influenced by Sherley’s experience working with policy makers in Southern Africa \(South Africa, Namibia, Angola\). The JARA tool has subsequently been used by NGO, government and academic scientists to assess the conservation status of 112 marine predator species. The easy\-to\-use, open access nature of JARA has **supported institutional capacity building** in at least 5 countries \(Bahamas, Canada, USA, South Africa and UK\) \[ **5.2–5.4**\]. For example, the Benguela Current Convention \(BCC\) Top Predator Working Group has employed JARA to assess five seabirds, three marine mammals, and two sea turtles in South Africa and Namibia \[ **5.2,5.3**\]. An IUCN Shark Specialist Group analyst \(trained by Sherley\) has used JARA \[ **3.6**\] to undertake IUCN Red List assessments of > 50 species during 4 international workshops \[ **5.4**\]. 

 <ins> **3.</ins> <ins>Influence on international policy:**</ins> UoE research has helped **change the policy of international agencies** on two of the five oceanic shark species identified as highly threatened using JARA \[ **5.4**\] \(Figure 2\). The inclusion of the Oceanic Whitetip Shark on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species \(CMS\) at the 13th Conference of the Parties \(February 2020\) was supported by a JARA\-based Red List Assessment \[ **5.4**\] and our assessment of Shortfin Mako as globally *Endangered* \[ **3.6**\] contributed \(Figure 2\) to a successful proposal \[ **5.10**\] to list the species under Appendix II at the 18th Conference of the Parties \(CoP18\) of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species \(CITES\), a binding treaty with 183 signatory countries that regulates the global wildlife trade: 

 *“The one single page of graphs cut through hundreds of pages of detail, complexity, and uncertainty. Without the transparent and robust analysis from JARA, it is highly likely that the \[Food and Agriculture Organisation\] opinion would have carried the day at CoP18. Consequently, it is no exaggeration to say that the JARA analysis played a pivotal role in Appendix II listing and international trade regulation for the Shortfin Mako”* – *IUCN Shark Specialist Group Co\-Chair* \[ **5.4**\]. 

 One hundred and two countries supported the proposal and Canada has subsequently banned retention of Shortfin Makos in their North Atlantic fisheries.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Treatments for psychological disorders have not kept pace with advances in cognitive theories. Aiming to improve outcomes, research at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) resulted in developing Metacognitive Therapy \(MCT\) that has had worldwide impact on clinical practice and improving lives. MCT is more effective than existing ‘gold standard’ psychological treatments. MCT has improved social anxiety \(SA\), generalised anxiety disorder \(GAD\) and depression treatment, is recommended in NICE guidelines, and is a ‘core competency’ \(SA\) for training UK clinical psychologists. MCT has led to the not\-for\-profit spin\-out company, MCT\-Institute \(MCT\-I\), training over 200 healthcare professionals in 25 countries in MCT each year. The 2019\-2020 Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\) annual report documents approximately 170,000 patients in 2019\-2020 entering treatment in England for SA or GAD, the majority of whom benefitted from MCT. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 UoM\-led studies by Professor Adrian Wells’ team have been responsible for developing and evaluating metacognitive therapy, a treatment focused on modifying metacognitive beliefs that perpetuate states of worry, rumination and biased attention that impact on mental health. Pilot studies were conducted between 2006 \- 2012 at UoM on trauma, GAD and depression. This was followed by larger scale international studies involving randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) of SA \[1\], GAD \[2\] and depression \[3\]. 

 The research process adhered to stage\-by\-stage gold standard scientific methods for the development and evaluation of complex interventions including: i\) developing a detailed model grounded in cognitive psychology and devising novel measures of causal mechanisms; ii\) testing underlying causes; and then iii\) developing and evaluating a new psychotherapy \(metacognitive therapy\) in mental health and physical health settings based on a true causal\-interventionist approach. Instrumental to this staged process were: 

1.  Discovering a central role of particular mechanisms in psychopathology and demonstrating that metacognition is a major contributor \[4\] and plays a role in treatment response. 

1.  Developing new measures to assess psychological mechanisms including the metacognitions questionnaire\-30 \(MCQ\-30\) \[5\] \(developed by Wells and Cartwright\-Hatton\); meta\-worry questionnaire, beliefs about rumination scales, beliefs about memory questionnaire, thought fusion instrument, beliefs about rituals inventory, and Cognitive\-Attentional Syndrome scale \[4\]. These measures are widely used by researchers and clinicians globally and have been distributed by independent test companies such as Checkware and Better World Healthcare. 

1.  Establishing trials of MCT which have wide reach across treatments for SA, GAD, depression, traumatic stress, obsessive compulsive disorder \(OCD\) and also mental health problems in patients with cardiovascular disease. Studies comprised single\-case replication series, phase I and II trials, and definitive RCTs. Definitive trials in MCT were especially notable in key aspects, all of which highlighted that MCT improves patient outcomes in comparison to gold standard treatment and routine clinical services, both in the UK and abroad \(e.g. Norway, Denmark, Germany\). A study of MCT in SA was the first to test a combination of psychological treatment and pharmacotherapy against psychological treatment, drugs and placebo alone \[1\]. Additionally, a study of GAD was the first to test MCT against gold standard CBT \[2\]. Group\-MCT for OCD \(evaluated by Papageorgiou and Wells \[6\]\), has been compared to routine clinical service in the UK, where 86% of MCT patients responded to treatment in comparison to 64% treated with CBT \[6\].  Wells, Callesen and Reeves compared MCT to CBT for depression, delivered in a routine outpatient clinic in Denmark, where patients received individual treatment. At post\-treatment, 74% of patients who had received MCT were classed as recovered in comparison to 52% in CBT \[3\]. The success of clinical trials has resulted in MCT treatments cited and recommended in NICE guidelines.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Adult psychological disorders are highly prevalent, with 1 in 6 adults experiencing a common mental health problem \(CMHP\). CMHPs are often chronic and associated with high morbidity and mortality. As only 50% of patients recover from a CMHP with CBT, improvements in recovery were needed.  Enhancement in mental health is a key aspect of the NHS Five Year Forward Plan \(2014\), which set out the vision of the future of the NHS. MCT was developed by applying cognitive science to theory building and testing of predicted causal mechanisms before moving to developing techniques to modify the mechanisms. This was followed by single\-case series evaluations and then by RCTs of the treatment itself, a scientifically rigorous approach that is not typically followed in the psychotherapy treatment field. Such an approach resulted in a major improvement in psychological treatment and clinical outcomes that has had multiple beneficiaries. 

##  Pathways to impact 

 The background research was presented at leading conferences \(e.g. World Congress of Psychiatry 2017, European Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Therapies 2018\) and published in leading journals \(see above\), and led to an invited special issue in *Frontiers in Psychology* which includes contributions from over 100 researchers, clinicians, and industry collaborators from 10 countries and has so far received 152,193 views \(as at 31 December 2020\) \[A\]. In the last 10 years, over 600 senior clinicians have undergone MCT masterclass training provided by the spin\-out company, MCT\-I. MCT\-I is a not\-for\-profit company that serves to regulate MCT, providing training to clinically qualified professionals, maintaining a registry for the public for accessing therapy, and supporting mental health research internationally. MCT\-I currently trains approximately 200 new MCT registered therapists per year in 25 countries \(England, Faroe Islands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, USA, Croatia, Lebanon, Israel, Germany, Italy, Poland, Austria, Belgium, Turkey, Iceland, Canada, Spain, France, Macedonia, Scotland, Ireland and Serbia\) \[B\]. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

 The MCT research programme has had extensive national and international reach and significance \(Table 1\). 

###  Improving Clinical Outcomes 

 MCT has resulted in significant improvements in clinical outcomes in the UK and internationally. Published independent meta\-analyses have demonstrated that MCT is more effective than current ‘gold standard’ treatments \[C\] in treating anxiety and depression. MCT has been integrated into clinical services in both private institutions, the UK NHS, and health services abroad \(see below\), and has become the preferred form of treatment for over 600 therapists \[B\-F\]. In Norway, MCT is the preferred treatment option for therapists treating anxiety disorders, trauma and depression at hospitals such as Modum Bad, an inpatient psychiatric clinic \(Oslo\), and Nidaros DPS at St. Olav’s Hospital \(Trondheim\). At Modum Bad, it has now become mandatory that all new therapists hired attend MCT training to become registered MCT therapists. MCT has improved recovery rates, return to work, decreased waiting time for treatment, and requires fewer treatment sessions \(see Table 1\). In the UK, MCT has been applied in the private sector as well as in the NHS, leading to improved outcomes as evidenced by the treatment of OCD at the Priory Hospital Greater Manchester \[F\]. More specifically, 86% of patients who received group MCT have improved compared with 64% before this intervention was introduced \[F\]. Following these improved outcomes, group MCT is now the primary psychological intervention for patients referred with OCD at the Priory Hospital Altrincham \[F\]. 



###  Improving Healthcare Delivery 

 Therapists have reported a substantial improvement in their clinical practice as MCT has allowed them to treat a range of disorders with success. Therapist feedback includes: 

 *“Learning MCT has given me a powerful tool to treating patients with all kinds of disorders. I feel that I finally know something that really works \- and I have gone from talking to people to really treating them \- often with success. I love this\!*” Clinical Psychologist \(Norway\) \[B\]. 

 In addition to improving clinical outcomes internationally, in Norway and Denmark, MCT has been adopted to improve rates of return to work among patients on long\-term sick leave \(see Table 1\). In Denmark, MCT is also a component of recommended treatments to aid patients in returning to work. Research and development of MCT has led to major changes in the way anxiety and depression are understood and treated. It has led to substantial improvement in recovery and mental health service provision in the UK NHS. The 2019\-2020 IAPT annual report documents approximately 170,000 patients in 2019\-2020 entering treatment in England for SA or GAD, with most of their treatments benefitting from MCT models \[H\], such as the NICE recommended treatment for SA \[Ii\], which forms part of IAPT core competencies in workforce training \[J\]. 

 MCT has been incorporated in mandatory core training of Clinical Psychologists in the UK and forms part of the national IAPT programme, as stated in the IAPT manual created by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health \[J\]. Healthcare workers completing training in MCT report major positive impacts on their clients and their own working practices. For example: 

 “*I am still fascinated to see how rapidly the patients get better. I think I have learned great skills from MCT training that will guide my therapy through my whole life and this feels priceless.*” Psychiatrist \(Turkey\) \[B\]. 

 MCT has influenced clinical practice and research internationally where it has become a central model in treating the underlying psychological processes central in psychological disorders. The Director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and  [Weill\-Cornell University Medical College](http://www.weill.cornell.edu/) stated that “ *Metacognitive Therapy has had a world\-wide influence in clinical work and research...at our American Institute for Cognitive Therapy the model has been our central model in dealing with rumination and worry.*"" \[E\]. 

###  Policy Impact 

 The treatment for SA by Clark and Wells is recommended by NICE as a first line treatment approach \[Ii\] and is a ‘core competency’ in clinical doctoral training programs. MCT is recognised as a beneficial treatment for CMHPs and has been incorporated in NICE guidelines since 2011 as an effective treatment for GAD \[Iii\]. MCT is incorporated in national training programmes for clinical psychologists and training of IAPT workers \(see Table 1\), with approximately 600 clinical psychology trainees and 300 IAPT trainees currently trained in MCT models and methods per year, with over 5,000 trained over the impact period based on clearing house numbers for the yearly number of clinical psychology trainees \(where the models are part of core training\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This research impact promotes interreligious harmony and social cohesion between Tamil Christian minorities and dominant ‘Hindu’ communities in Tamil Nadu, India. It has enabled the Tamil Lutherans Christians in Tranquebar, Tanjore, Trichy and Chennai to meaningfully engage with their non\-Christian neighbours. It inspired the formation of an NGO *Grace Endearment Mission Services* \(2010\) in Guntakal, Andhra Pradesh. It has recreated afresh an Indo\-German relationship and led to the establishment of *The TELC Ziegenbalg House: A Museum on Intercultural Dialogue* \(2017\) in Tranquebar. It has influenced more than 175,000 people in and outside of South India in reclaiming their cultural memories. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Jeyaraj has been at Liverpool Hope University since 2008 as Professor of World Christianity and Director of Andrew Walls Centre for the Study of African and Asian Christianity. His research continues to play a role in shaping the way many Lutheran Christians in South India, Germany, Denmark and the USA think of their origins, identities and works. 

 Tamil Hindus frequently accuse Tamil Christians of destroying Tamil culture. Jeyaraj’s research has since 1991 identified the lack of textual evidence for this accusation; it has provided a body of texts, accessed by both Christians and Hindus, which recover and preserve their linguistic, socio\-cultural and religious memories. 

 Jeyaraj retrieved these memories from representative archival documents of 18<sup>th</sup> century Christians, written in Tamil, German, Latin, Danish and Portuguese. Works cited build on other major textual outputs such as the German and English editions of the *Genealogy of the South Indian Deities* \(2003, 2005\) and *A German Exploration of Indian Society* \(2006\). 

 Jeyaraj studied the formation of an indigenous Christian worshipping community in Southern India and the life and works of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, the first Protestant Lutheran missionary to arrive in South India, at the Danish port of Tranquebar \(1706\). Research findings \(R1\-6\) demonstrate how writings by Christians have preserved the unique socio\-cultural, linguistic, religious aspects of Tamil communities in early eighteenth century south Indian. They also illustrate the positive dynamics interaction between the values of German Lutheran Pietists and of the Tamil *bhakti* adherents. These interactions defined their socio\-cultural interdependence and religious distinctiveness. For example, Jeyaraj produced the first English version \(annotated\) of *Grammatica Damulcia* \(R2\); composed by Ziegenbalg, this was the first Tamil grammar printed outside of India, to teach Tamil to his contemporaries in Europe. Jeyaraj’s English translations of 99 letter\-reports received by Ziegenbalg from Tamil sources retrieve the voice of the Tamil people and provide insight into everyday habits in early 18<sup>th</sup> century India \(R3\). 

 To extend the reach of his research, in 2014 Jeyaraj made the decision to publish Tamil texts within Tamil Nadu, in recognition that European publication imprints may not be affordable. In this way his research has reached a much wider Tamil population \(in particular, R4, *Earliest Tamil Christian Spiritual Songs*, and *Tamil Christian Ethics* \[Tanjore: Tamil University, 2017\]\). 

 Jeyaraj’s work on *Thirukkural* \(200–500 CE\) \(R5, R6\), the moral Bible of the Tamils, shed new light on the earliest references to it in German literature, revising current scholarship and giving important insight into how Tamils in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century used it. Retrieving memories of *Thirukkural* from Christian missionary writings in German \(1712–1714\) strengthened the claims of *Thirukkural* possessing universal moral appeal. Scholars on *Thirukkual* invited Jeyaraj to share his discoveries with other *Thirukkural*\-enthusiasts in Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu in 2017, in Liverpool/UK \(June 2018\) and New Delhi \(September 2019\), and regularly invite Jeyaraj to share his archival findings with other experts. For example, on 26 September 2020, he shared with them hitherto little\- or un\- known information about “The earliest German translations of Tamil Ethical Works in 1708 and the First Tamil Teachers in Germany in 1711” \( [https://youtu.be/qpModo2e7wc](about:blank)\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The impact of Jeyaraj’s research outputs has been described as “transformative” \(1iv\). Tamil Lutheran Christians constitute a minority and there is a tendency for them to be blamed for the destruction of local cultures; Jeyaraj’s research refutes this perspective with textual evidence of how written Christian records have preserved early 18<sup>th</sup> century Tamil socio\-cultural memories. These memories, “not available anywhere else”, are identified as ‘empowering’ \(1.iv\). 

 The primary impacts of Jeyaraj’s research are described under three headings: \(1\) Renewed Self\-Understanding of the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church \(TELC\), \(2\) Establishing of New National and International Institutions, and \(3\) Creating New Learning Materials. 

 **1. Renewed Self\-Understanding of the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church** \(TELC\): The authentic relevance of Jeyaraj’s research has enabled the Tamil \(and Telugu\) Christians at grassroots level to address questions about identity, role and status; it has provided them with new tools for meaningful exchanges of ideas with their Hindu neighbours in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh \(1, 2, 3\). 

 According to the Bishop of the *Tamil Lutheran Evangelical Church* \(TELC\) \(1i\), Jeyaraj’s research has impacted “more than 150,000 communicant members” in the States of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Pondicherry and Andaman Nicobar Islands. They have become aware of how the European and Tamil founders of their Church engaged with the socio\-cultural and religious world of the Tamils and worked toward their religious, socio\-cultural, educational, emotional and economic wellbeing. Jeyaraj’s research has given them the necessary textual data, insights and vocabulary to meaningfully interact with their Hindu neighbours about diverse themes of mutual interest. 

 Additionally, the TELC members “changed their former hagiographic understanding about the \[European founders\] of the TELC” and began appreciating the role of Tamil Lutheran leaders such as the first Tamil Lutheran Pastor Aaron” \(1.i\). The Aaron Family, besides naming a ninth\-generation descendant after Jeyaraj, has come forward to renovate a heritage building in Tranquebar for community purposes. The Bishop also notes the positive impact of Jeyaraj’s research on rural communities: “They have gained new insights into their history and Lutheran identity. Particularly, they motivate their children, especially the girls, to pursue studies; in our contemporary situation, these countercultural practices benefit the downtrodden greatly” \(1i\). The Bishop further states that some pastors have also developed their Tamil\-Lutheran identity by drawing into their sermons insights from Jeyaraj’s publication of the worship songs and 397 Tamil ethical maxims \(1.i\). 

 Members of the TELC \(1.ii; 3\), who earlier attributed the origin of their church solely to European missionaries, now understand them as catalysts for change; the main actors are understood as the Tamil people, who embraced Lutheranism and interpreted it within the socio\-cultural and traditions of the Tamil\- *bhakti* movements and village spirituality \( *gramadevata*\). A pastorate chairperson, who hosted Jeyaraj’s book releases and public lectures, was inspired by Jeyaraj’s research to build twenty churches and three community halls as centres of socialisation for Christian and non\-Christian neighbours, stating that the research showed him the significance of church and community buildings for “a sense of identity, unity and empowerment” \(1.ii\). One of these halls in Trichy has become the home for a rallying point of gypsies, who have now begun to send their children to schools. This pastorate chairperson reported how Jeyaraj’s research has helped his congregation members to gain “new awareness and deeper understanding” of the TELC and its shared culture, deepened their sense of belonging and loyalty to each other, and thus shaped their attitudes and behaviour patterns significantly \(1.ii\). 

 **2. Establishing of New National and International Institutions**: In 2010, the NGO *Grace Endearment Mission Services* \(GEMS\) was established in Guntakal in Andhra Pradesh, with the research of Jeyaraj cited as an influence \(1iii\); they train school teachers and local leaders in rural and tribal villages. GEMS has used Jeyaraj’s recovery and interpretation of socio\-cultural memories from historical texts as a means to empower neglected people groups in several rural and tribal villages, for example in the Arakku Valley. GEMS representatives have helped the oppressed Dalits and tribal peoples to reclaim their dignity as human beings and to assert their identity. They do it by developing a fresh respect for their unwritten tribal languages, life\-affirming ancestral customs and making life\-transforming choices to think and live differently. The Founder\-President connects this directly to Jeyaraj’s research, as a means “to foster new thinking”; he states that the recovered texts “preserved the socio\-cultural memories of the Tamil Christians, who belonged to similar *Avarna*\-groups”, and the narrated stories “encouraged them to form a better opinion about themselves and to negotiate a better social standing” \(1.iii; see also 1.iv\). On a personal level, the Founder\-President notes that engaging with Jeyaraj’s research “leads me to appreciate the key role of native agents in bringing about positive societal transformation” \(1.iii\). 

 Secondly, *Ziegenbalg House: A Museum on Intercultural Dialogue* was jointly established in Tranquebar in 2017 by leaders of the Francke Foundations \(Halle, Germany\), the TELC, two German mission agencies and relevant officers of the Government of Germany. The Head of Mission and Ecumenics at UTC, Bangalore, attests that Jeyaraj’s research “concretely…paved the way” for the museum’s establishment \(1.iv\). The museum fosters new forms of Indo\-German exchange of visitors, volunteers and artists. It shapes the regional history of the Tamil people by demonstrating to them German perceptions and representations of and contributions to the Tamil people, language, literature, culture and religions. 

 The Curator describes the museum as “the most tangible impact” of Jeyaraj’s research, mediating insights on “inculturated Christianity and interreligious encounters” in the 18<sup>th</sup> century \(1vi\). The research shows how the Tamil in Tranquebar “encountered German Lutheran understandings of God and human beings; likewise, German readers in Germany, Denmark and England were dazzled to engage with the Tamil views of God and human beings”. These “models of intercultural and transnational learning” help visitors expand “attitudes towards people outside of their daily encounters” and learn “complementary ways of being human” \(1vi\). The museum’s permanent panel exhibition and artefact descriptions contain “insights … gleaned from Prof. Jeyaraj’s research publications” \(1vi\). The museum staff also utilize Jeyaraj’s translation of Ziegenbalg’s *Grammatica Damulica* to teach school children and visitors: this reciprocal knowledge means that “invariably, they express astonishment and happiness about the impact of their Tamil language on Germans since more than 300 years” \(1vi\). 

 The Director, Francke Foundations, concurs on the important role of the “fusion and cross\-fertilization of socio\-cultural ideas” in Jeyaraj’s research for “our concrete attempts to rejuvenate our Indo\-German relationships that remained dormant for nearly a century”; his insights are used at the museum in the education of “local, national and international visitors” about Indo\-German relationships \(1vii\). 

 Jeyaraj also led a day workshop at the museum for non\-specialist audiences on the theme of retrieving cultural memories from Tamil palm leaf manuscripts in September 2019, which was attended by some forty people \(1iv\): archivists, librarians, curators, students, teachers and members of the public \(1vi\). The Curator describes this sharing of knowledge with “rural and underprivileged students as much as with scholars \[of renowned institutions\]” as a “breakthrough” \(1vi\). 

 **3. Creating New Learning Materials**: Lamp Post Media prepared the 68 minute television documentary entitled *Beyond Empires: the hidden tale of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg*, completed for distribution in 2014 with an interreligious and international production team \(2i\). It is entirely based on Jeyaraj’s research \(2ii\). The producer gives an account of its showing \(1v\), often with Q&A sessions, at local theatres, international conferences, universities and churches, in the USA, Australia and New Zealand. In November 2014, the USA\-based RBN cable television aired it to their 3 million subscribers; it was also released to ACCTV \(cable Christian channel\) in Australia and UK/New Zealand affiliates and broadcast on a Tamil TV channel in India. The film has been purchased as a perpetual license DVD by 23 colleges in the USA and is used by the producer/director at Excelsia College in Sydney, Australia, to teach integration of Christian theology into daily life. In addition, this documentary inspired two Australian producers to interview Jeyaraj for their educational videos “How Missionaries Changed the World?” \(Public Christianity, Australia, 2018\) \(2iii\) and “What Indian Christianity Teaches us Today” \(Global Church Project, Australia, 2018\) \(2iv\). 

 Jeyaraj’s research findings have also inspired Tamil Christians to come up with newer ways of disseminating knowledge. For example, a Tamil teacher used them to write a drama entitled *The Life of Ziegenbalg* to enthuse Tamil Christian youth for greater public service and social harmony. On 25 August 2019, the TELC Adaikalanathar Church in Purasawalkam, Chennai hosted this drama. As the photos of this event show, about 1500 people viewed it \(3\). Thus, the ripple effects of Jeyaraj’s research findings continue to facilitate recovery of socio\-cultural memories and rejuvenation of Tamil Christian minorities in South India.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 In high\-income countries, obesity is more prevalent among men than women. Despite this being a significant public health issue, men are still less likely than women to attend weight management programmes. Mutrie’s research has been instrumental in developing the physical activity elements of the Football Fans in Training \(FFIT\) programme which addresses this issue. The Scottish Professional Football League \(SPFL\) Trust delivered the programme with the researchers in 2013 and is now solely responsible for delivery. Since then, the FFIT programme in Scotland has been supporting approximately 1,000 participants per year to become more active and lose weight. Now 125 professional clubs in football and other sports \(ice hockey, Aussie rules football and rugby\) are using the FFIT programme and engaging several thousand men and women worldwide to increase step counts and to lose weight. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

###  The FFIT programme 

 A multidisciplinary team of psychologists, health social scientists, a nutritionist and a men’s health nurse designed FFIT to harness the personal connection men feel to the professional football club they support, with the purpose of engaging them in an evidence\-based weight loss and physical activity programme. 

 Working in partnership with the SPFL Trust, which aims to deliver social change through community engagement with SPFL professional football clubs, the researchers developed the free FFIT programme for men aged between 35 and 65, who are obese or at risk of obesity. The World Health Organisation classifies a person with a Body Mass Index \(BMI\) of more than 25 as overweight and someone with a BMI above 30 as obese. The men involved in this research each had a BMI of more than 27. 

 FFIT consists of 12 weekly 90\-minute sessions for groups of 30 men, delivered by specially trained football club coaching staff at their home stadium. Each meeting involves classroom time to teach participants useful skills and techniques to become more active and improve their diet, followed by a “pitch\-side” physical activity session. The multidisciplinary team of researchers was led by the University of Glasgow, with Mutrie from the University of Edinburgh advising on all aspects of physical activity and designing the rigorous, incremental walking programme that supported participants to use a pedometer and meet goals to take more steps each week, during and after the 12\-week FFIT programme. 

###  FFIT development and results 

 The researchers followed the Medical Research Council’s guidance on developing complex interventions with phase one being a pilot and feasibility trial and phase two being a fully\-defined trial. Scotland’s Chief Scientist Office \(CSO\) funded the first phase of FFIT’s development. The 2013 \(GBP218,197\) pilot and feasibility trial involved 103 male fans of two SPFL clubs. It demonstrated the programme could recruit overweight men and support them to increase their step counts and their overall physical activity, which helped them to lose weight \(3.1\). 

 The UK’s National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) funded phase 2 of the research. The GBP808,980 research project with 748 male fans of 11 SPFL premier league clubs produced 3 critical outputs: 

 1. A 2013 process evaluation of the pilot study with participants and coaches demonstrated men’s enthusiasm for both the classroom and physical activity components, including the walking programme Mutrie designed. The research also showed the value men placed on the camaraderie and peer\-support they received, and it found that coaches appreciated the simplicity of FFIT’s key messages on healthy eating and physical activity \(3.2\). 

 2. A qualitative study based on semi\-structured interviews with a representative sample of 29 participants evidenced the success of Mutrie’s pedometer\-based walking programme in motivating and empowering men to self\-monitor and progress to self\-defined goals. The 2013 research found participants responded enthusiastically to the speed at which the programme helped them regain fitness to begin other forms of physical activity, and it helped bolster their masculine identity \(3.3\). 

 3. A pragmatic, randomised control trial divided the 748 men into an intervention group \(who began FFIT immediately\) and a control group \(who started it 12 months later\). The 2014 research found fans in the intervention group lost an average of 5kg more than their control group counterparts after 12 months. They also self\-reported an average increase in physical activity equivalent to walking for 4 hours each week \(3.4\). 

###  FFIT sustained results 

 It is always important to determine long\-term changes in lifestyle interventions. Therefore, a follow\-up study of 488 men who took part in the original, randomised control trial found they were still an average of 3kg lighter 3.5 years after starting the programme. This subsequent GBP338,161 NIHR\-funded project also found participants’ self\-reported, sustained improvements in total physical activity were equivalent to more than 2.5 hours of extra walking each week \(3.5\). 

 This 2018 research also evidenced FFIT’s cost\-effectiveness \(3.5\). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) measures the cost\-effectiveness of health interventions based on the cost of providing a person with a year of good health they otherwise would not have had – known as Quality\-Adjusted Life Years \(QALYs\). Based on the 3.5 years of results, the researchers calculated FFIT had a QALY cost of between GBP10,700 and GBP15,300, which is significantly lower than NICE’s guideline of GBP20,000 to GBP30,000 for determining the upper limit for cost\-effective interventions. 

###  FFIT international results 

 A 2016 randomised control trial involving 1,113 male fans from 15 professional football clubs in England, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal found more than 25% of men who took part in European Fans in Training \(EuroFIT\) sustained more than 5% weight loss 12 months after starting the programme. Developed by the original FFIT multidisciplinary team in collaboration with European partners, the EUR5,957,158 European Commission\-funded EuroFIT project is based on the Scottish programme’s framework and includes Mutrie’s walking programme. Published in 2019, the research also indicated participants continued to walk an average of 678 more steps per day 1 year later \(3.6\).

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has had a significant impact on policy and practice to improve health and wellbeing in Scotland and internationally, as shown below. 

###  Impact on football fans in Scotland 

 The SPFL Trust continues to run the FFIT programme Mutrie and her colleagues developed \[5.1A\] through their research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\), through a licencing agreement with the researchers. The University of Edinburgh agreed to allow Mutrie’s contribution to be licensed under the University of Glasgow’s licensing agreement. Since then, participants have lost over 3,800kg in 2016\-17 \[5.1B, p. 15\] and over 3,300kg in 2018\-19 \[5.1C, pp. 11\-12\]. 

 The SPFL Trust’s 2016\-2017 annual report states that the programme *“is well established as the SPFL Trust’s flagship project”* with 79 programmes running and a 72% completion rate for participants \[5.1B, pp. 14\-15\]. FFIT continued to have a high retention rate of 74% with 1,067 participants completing FFIT in 2018\-19 across 27 SPFL clubs \[5.1C, pp. 11\-12\]. In 2020, the SPFL Trust described FFIT as *“Europe’s most successful sport intervention programme”* \[5.1D\]. 

###  Impact on Scottish Government policy 

 In July 2018, the Scottish Government published its Active Scotland Delivery Plan setting out the actions it and its partners were undertaking to encourage people in Scotland to be more active. The plan included a commitment to *“continue to support the delivery and development of healthy living interventions as a treatment through the NHS and the third sector, such as the innovative Football Fans in Training programme”* \[5.2, p. 16\]. Furthermore, Action 3.8 of the Scottish Government’s 2018 Diet & Healthy Weight Delivery Plan stated: *“the Scottish Government will continue to fund healthy weight interventions designed and delivered by the third sector, such as Football Fans In Training \(FFIT\)”* \[5.3, p. 24\]. The funding is given to the SPFL trust annually. 

###  Impact on football fans and other sports fans internationally 

 In January 2020, FFIT project members published an evaluation of the programme’s implementation beyond the scope of the original research. The research in partnership with the SPFL Trust evidenced several international applications of the FFIT approach, including the walking programme Mutrie designed, in football and beyond \[5.4\]. Highlighted examples include: 

-  In 2016, the SPFL Trust worked with FFIT researchers and German coaches to adapt the programme for Bundesliga teams. Between December 2016 and July 2018, more than 934 men registered for the “Fussball” Fans in Training programme across 15 clubs. Among a sample of 477 participants, after 12 weeks, more than 50% lost at least 5% of their body weight \[5.4, p. 17\]. 

-  Following the trial of EuroFIT in 15 professional football clubs in England, The Netherlands, Norway and Portugal \(3.6\), EuroFIT project partner and licence holder the European Healthy Stadia Network has overseen the programme’s roll\-out to clubs across Europe \[5.5\]. The European Healthy Stadia Network launched a suite of online resources for coaches based on the research on its website in English, Dutch, Norwegian and Portuguese \[5.5, 5.6\] although coaches must register to be able to access these resources. EuroFIT was embedded as a core component of the Portuguese National Physical Activity Programme and the European Healthy Stadia Network has been agreeing legal frameworks and collaborative structures to upscale EuroFIT across Europe \[5.7\]. As of September 2020, 29 football clubs facilitated EuroFIT and the Executive Director of the European Healthy Stadia Network wrote: *“Feedback from programme coaches and participants alike has always been extremely positive about the step count programme \[designed by Mutrie\] owing to its simplicity, and the sense of control participants have over the goal\-bound nature of step increments, and this is unquestionably a keystone to the EuroFIT programme’s success”* \[5.8\]. 

-  Between 2018 and 2020, the SPFL Trust collaborated with the European Football for Development Network in an Erasmus\+ project to train coaches from nine European clubs to deliver FFIT, including the pedometer\-based walking programme. The Active Fans & Healthy Football League programme has been open to men and women in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Hungary and Norway \[5.9A\]. Active Fans has produced wellbeing and social benefits for participants, including: increased physical activity, improved body mass index, blood pressure, nutrition, and social inclusion \[5.9B\]. 

-  The FFIT project has also inspired independent research teams in Canada, New Zealand and Australia to develop similar programmes in collaboration with professional teams in their respective national sports, Ice Hockey, Rugby and Australian Rules Football \[5.4\]. These programmes have now engaged over 1,400 participants in total across 40 Canadian Hockey teams \[5.10A\], 3 New Zealand Rugby clubs \[5.10B\], and 2 Australian Rules Football clubs \[5.10C\]. 

 Across all of the aforementioned examples, FFIT and related programmes have supported several thousand participants across 125 sports clubs worldwide to increase step counts and to lose weight.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 *Expanded Interiors \(EI\)* investigated Roman wall paintings, while developing site\-specific fine\-art installations for UNESCO World Heritage sites at Pompeii and Herculaneum. In collaboration with Parco Archeologico di Ercolano \(PaErco\), Parco Archeologico di Pompei \(PaP\), and the Herculaneum Conservation Project \(HCP\), the research generated multiple impacts: 

 **A.** Enhancing the experiences of more than 600,000 visitors from across the world. **B.** Raising awareness amongst local communities of their own heritage and culture by involving them with the research. **C.** Establishing an exemplar of best practice for the organisations managing Herculaneum and Pompeii, changing their future practice and working methods with artists creating interventions within their archaeological sites. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 *Expanded Interiors,* funded by a peer\-reviewed grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) was conducted by Professor Huber and her interdisciplinary team from 2017\-2019. The project investigated how contemporary fine art practice can provide new insights into Roman wall painting and how, in turn, Roman wall painting can inform and enhance site\-specific, contemporary art practice. The project also explored new strategies for the display of \(replica\) Roman artefacts, while allowing for the creative exploration of these replicas. 

 *Expanded Interior’s* main stages and achievements include: 

 a\) New insights into the sophisticated technical / artistic methods used by Roman wall painters, including their tailored, creative responses to specific architectural settings including public and private spaces, and the social, economic and cultural contexts of the spaces within which they worked. The research focussed on two Roman houses with wall decorations \(PUB3 and PUB4\). 

 b\) An artistic re\-interpretation of some compositional, perspectival and contextual methodologies used by Roman wall painters \(PUB1 and PUB2\), and the development of practice\-led methods relevant to contemporary fine\-art making. These include use of specially designed perspectival systems to help create immersive environments \(PUB3 and PUB4\). 

 c\) The display of three large\-scale site\-responsive art installations in two Roman houses, the House of the Beautiful Courtyard in Herculaneum, and the House of the Cryptoporticus in Pompeii. The installations also included innovative display systems for eighteen 3D printed replicas of Roman artefacts, \(PUB1 and PUB2\). 

 d\) Huber’s peer\-reviewed chapter for *Contemporary Art in Heritage Spaces.* Reviewers highlighted the ‘ *innovative and engaging approach to the contemporary art/heritage discussion’* and that it *‘demonstrates first\-hand the way in which artistic practice can impact upon historical interpretation’* \(PUB4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *Expanded Interiors \(EI\)* **\(A\)** changed visitor experiences and understanding for worldwide audiences at Pompeii and Herculaneum. **\(B\)** Drew together local and regional communities and stakeholders with the archaeological site. **\(C\)** Impacted upon organisational practices of its key partners in Herculaneum and Pompeii. 

 **\(A\)** *EI* engaged a worldwide audience with site\-specific contemporary art installations at two world\-famous archaeological sites. Combined, these attracted over 4,000,000 visitors in 2018. This afforded visitors new experiences, changing understanding and appreciation of the contemporary relevance of Roman Wall painting, Roman objects and the relationship between contemporary art and archaeology. This is evidenced through visitor questionnaires conducted on\-site and online \( **IMP1**\), and a testimonial from the Director of Parco Archeologico di Ercolano \(PaErco\) \( **IMP3**\). 

 **IMP1:** Our visitor survey showed 92% of visitors enjoyed the exhibition. For 50% of under 24\-year\-olds, a key target group for the organisations, the project changed their perception of Roman wall painting, one visitor explaining how the exhibition *‘validates the Roman painting as art, not just tired artefacts’.* 54% of visitors said that *EI* helped them to look at Roman objects in a different way: ‘ *one sees them together and relating to each other, not like an exhibition display in the museum’*. Almost 50% visitors aged under 24 felt that the exhibition had encouraged them to look at fine art, heritage and archaeology in new ways: ‘ *I have always enjoyed fine art, but I've never seen it used within an archaeological context \- the art reinvigorates. Until now I thought of both being quite separate from one another’*. The exhibitions successfully engaged young adults – outside of school visits, traditionally a challenge for Italian heritage sites as noted at the *EI* Arts and Archaeology Symposium \( **IMP9**, from 1.45.05\). The exhibitions changed attitudes towards art and archaeology among adults with educational attainment at secondary school level and below \(reported as 10% of total visitors\). Of this group, 100% liked the exhibition and gave very high scores in relation to the impact it had on their appreciation of contemporary art within an archaeological site. The data shows the potential of innovative multidisciplinary projects such as *EI,* not just in involving groups of visitors traditionally underrepresented among exhibition visitors, but also in transforming people’s perception and understanding of research fields such as fine art and archaeology. 

 **IMP3:** The Director of PaErco said, ‘ *We recognise art’s importance for provoking new ways of understanding the past and its role in the present. The Expanded Interiors exhibition has offered a new and exciting visitor experience for our local, national and international visitors…, and has attracted new \(and in particular local\) visitors, also through Expanded Interiors workshop and event programme’*. 

 **\(B\):** *EI* had positive cultural and societal impact on local communities. In Ercolano, key stakeholders were involved through an extensive workshop programme. This resulted in closer relationships between surrounding communities and the archaeological site; changed opinions and behaviour regarding local Roman heritage; and attracted new visitors to the site. Evidence for this includes feedback from workshop participants and schoolchildren **\(IMP2\)**; independent follow\-on activities from the teachers and art students who used our workshops as an inspiration **\(IMP7\)**; visitor numbers **\(IMP5\)**; statements from the Director at PaErco **\(IMP3\)** and Senior Manager and Community Consultant at HCP **\(IMP6\)**. 









 *EI* workshops with local teachers \(PaErco, January 2018\) and in local schools in Ercolano \(October 2018\). 

 **IMP2:** *EI* offered a teacher training workshop \(January 2018\), artist tours of the exhibition for primary school classes \(May 2018\), and student workshops for primary and secondary schools in Ercolano \(October 2018, 7 classes\) and also in Newcastle \(July 2019, 2 classes\), involving 290 people. Outcomes from these workshops have been instrumental in setting up teaching and learning resources for families and schools \- available in Italian and in English on the *EI* website. These are enabling teachers in Ercolano to creatively engage with the research and the site in a sustainable way. Our survey **\(IMP2\)** showed that *EI* workshops changed both teachers’ and pupils’ attitudes towards heritage, prompting feelings of belonging and new understanding of the relationship between contemporary art practice and Roman archaeology. Teachers were inspired to incorporate contemporary art into their teaching, including during site visits: *‘The workshop gave me good ideas that I will take with me at work; It gave me ideas of how to prepare my young students for the next visit to the site using a method completely different than the one I had been using so far; It gave us good ideas for creative development in the school community; The ideas and new points of view I gained during the workshop will definitely help me set up my lessons with a wider and different open\-mindedness; I will change the way I teach my students, showing them the findings in a different way’* \(workshop feedback\). 

 **IMP4:** A primary teacher at F. Giampaglia primary school in Ercolano said: *‘We learned so much… with the teaching of Catrin Huber, we look back with other eyes… we perhaps didn’t realise we have so much here… As a teacher, I think only when students know and understand what they have around them \[Herculaneum\], they can have respect of it…*’ \(testimonial video, May 2018\). 

 **IMP7:** Teachers’ and pupils’ sense of connection to, and understanding of their local heritage site were further enhanced by: 1\) An exhibition at Parco Archeologico di Ercolano of the work created in the schools inspired by the *EI* workshops *;* 2\) 60 children joining artist tours of the *EI* exhibition; 3\) After participating in *EI* workshops, students from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli organised art laboratories at PaErco in which 200 children took part. 

 **IMP5:** The biggest increase of visitor numbers to Herculaneum in 2018 was in May 2018 \(up 15,375 from the previous year\), when *EI* opened and these activities took place. 









 Exhibits of pupils’ work and art laboratories at PaErco \(May 2018\); Tours with Huber of the *EI* exhibition with local school classes \(May 2018\). 

 **IMP3:** The Director of PaErco said: ‘ *Expanded Interiors community\-focused workshops and engagement activities support PaErco’s and HCP’s efforts in bringing the old and new cities of Herculaneum and Ercolano closer together \[and\] renewing the relationship between the site and the community… The students were incredibly enthusiastic and the feedback from the children and teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. Teachers stressed the importance of enthusing the children about ‘their’ archaeological site and of giving them ownership of it’.* 

 **IMP6:** In their introduction *The Artistic Process Triggering Change At Herculaneum* to the *Expanded Interiors* book, senior manager and community consultant from HCP write: ‘ *The Expanded Interiors project became a platform for multiple dialogues between the ancient and modern worlds and a stimulus for new reflections – and by communities not previously involved* which *took on central roles in the process and were inspired to engage with the ancient world in new and innovative ways’.* 

 **\(C\):** *EI* has also influenced the organisational practices of its key partners in Herculaneum, by setting up new connections with regional stakeholders, which have since developed into closer, sustained relationships with PaErco and HCP **\(IMP3\)**. By featuring as an example of good practice for Herculaneum and Pompeii, *EI* has influenced future commissioning practice around artistic interventions at the sites **\(IMP7\)**. 









 Audience of heritage guides at EI talk and EI workshop at PaErco discussing replicas \(January 2018\). EI workshop with art students at PaErco \(January 2018\). 

  

 **IMP7:** *EI \-* *Mischievous Objects* talk and workshops at PaErco, January 2018 involved 73 local heritage guides and fine art students from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli, to discuss together the potential for fine art practice to create change within heritage sites. This initiative led to the establishment of an on\-going cross\-PaErco and HCP focus group of local heritage guides, which enables them to feedback directly to the sites’ management, affording them a greater sense of involvement and ownership of the sites’ activities. The workshop with heritage guides also triggered new ideas for engaging tourists, for instance enabling them to handle \(replica\) Roman objects **\(IMP2\)** and initiated a brand\-new collaboration between PaErco and the Accademia **\(IMP3\)**. 

 **IMP3:** *EI* has helped change PaErco’s strategy for working with artists. The Director of PaErco said: ‘ *These activities \[exhibition, workshops, tours, events\] made Expanded Interiors a successful event for the partnership between PaErco, HCP and Newcastle University. Expanded Interiors functions also as a case study and example of good practice for PaErco, changing practice of working with artists to support PaErco’s local agenda of fostering connections with local communities and creating sense of ownership of site among local communities’.* The Director of Parco Archeologico di Pompeii highlighted that ‘ *Expanded Interior’s interdisciplinary, practice\-led research offered a unique approach to integrating contemporary artistic practice directly within the site and – for the first time* in Pompeii *– within a Roman house… As such, it has functioned as a case study for the Parco Archeologico di Pompeii and has informed the planning for future artistic commissions to be situated directly within and as a response to the archaeological site’* **\(IMP3\)**. 

 *EI’s* unique approach of linking interdisciplinary, practice\-led research, culminating in on\-site contemporary art installations with extensive local community engagement, offers a transferable model for other heritage sites. By influencing stakeholders from heritage and educational contexts, and by providing accessible and flexible resources including a teaching pack and podcasts, it generates sustainable impacts on professional practice and public understanding. An AHRC Follow\-On funding grant \(December 2020\) for *EI Re\-Staged* will build further value by engaging new groups of young adults with the research. By expanding online resources, including a VR environment, compatible within Covid19 restrictions the reach and impact of *Expanded Interiors* will be further extended for the long term.

","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the impacts comprises long\-term methods development and evaluations and some study\-specific innovations. This section focuses on recent directly underpinning research. The findings are typically that the method is effective in specified contexts. Most impacts have harnessed multiple indicators and methods, with too many underpinning studies to mention individually. Except where mentioned, the underpinning research is from Statistical Cybermetrics Research Group \(SCRG\) members alone. 

 <ins>SocialMedia1: A validated method to assess social media strategy success</ins> 

 Thelwall has developed methods to gather and analyse social media data since 2008. The methodological approach is encapsulated in his social media analysis toolkit, Mozdeh. Mozdeh is backed by numerous studies describing, justifying and analysing the word frequency/sentiment methods. In conjunction with Canadian consultancy AlterSpark, we developed a simple but novel quantitative/qualitative mixed method using Mozdeh to assess the factors associating with success within a social media strategy by harvesting all tweets and identifying themes, differentiating highly retweeted tweets from less retweeted tweets \[R1\]. 

 <ins>Altmetrics1: Development and evaluation of altmetrics</ins> 

 Kousha and Thelwall have proposed and/or evaluated many altmetrics. This allows us to knowledgeably select and apply multiple indicators for individual client needs, and provide general advice on research indicator use. A study co\-authored with Wellcome staff \(unfunded\) demonstrated that Mendeley reader counts, when appropriately collected and processed, could give early impact evidence for funders \[R2\]. This enables funders like Wellcome to make earlier evaluations of programme strategy changes. 

 <ins>Altmetrics2: Validated web method to count grey literature citations</ins> 

 Non\-academic organisations often publish grey literature as online PDFs. Wilkinson \(retired\), Sud, and Thelwall introduced and evaluated a method to count and geographically classify web mentions of these online white papers and other grey literature through commercial search engine queries \[R3\]. 

 <ins>Altmetrics3: Validated method to extract commercial search engine results</ins> 

 Ongoing search engine research informs the choice of methods and development of our software \(Webometric Analyst\) to collect general web indicators and harvest other academic\-related information from the web. We introduced and validated alternative search engine\-based methods to obtain relatively complete and robust general web citation information \[R4\] when the search engine results are incomplete. 

 <ins>Altmetrics4: The validated linked citation method to identify academic hyperlinks</ins> 

 Thelwall has developed link analysis methods to construct network diagrams illustrating citation\-based connectivity between websites. These use advanced search engine queries, data processing strategies and visualisation tools within Thelwall’s Webometric Analyst software. The *linked citation* concept and algorithm of Sud \[R5\], is critical to generate network diagrams by indirectly finding hyperlink connections between a set of websites. This gives much richer network connections than academic\-type citations and supports web impact evaluations when web citation counting methods are ineffective due to ambiguous names. 

 <ins>Scientometrics1: Proposed statistical models fit citation counts poorly in some fields</ins> 

 We investigated the fit of statistical models to citation data, finding that no previously proposed models fitted well in some Scopus fields due to magazine\-style articles being indexed \[R6\]. Because of this, that citation benchmarking with Scopus is unreliable for some fields. 

 <ins>Networks1: Agglomerated co\-inlink network diagram method</ins> 

 The co\-inlink type of network, with our own link agglomeration algorithm exploiting different link methods \[R5\], as built into Thelwall’s Webometric Analyst, has been shown to be effective at creating meaningful network diagrams.

 The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation \(UNFAO\) developed improved strategies from its 2014/5 self\-evaluation with the help of our 49\-page report, “Evaluation of FAO’s Contributions to Knowledge on Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources: Cybermetric Analysis” \[C1\]. Drawing on our methods to map web communities \[Networks1\] and evaluate the online impact of grey literature \[Altmetrics2\], this report illustrated the web communities of the UNFAO compared to related organisations, evaluated the web impact of UNFAO reports \(grey literature\) and other outputs based on traditional and web citations, and tabulated online evidence of UNFAO contributions to national policies and programmes. Our work gives a uniquely wide international overview enabling UNFAO to assess its impact more broadly than before. 

 The United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) evaluated its gender equality and women’s empowerment strategy with our help, allowing it to make improvements \(2014/5\). The report “Thematic Evaluation of UNDP’s Contribution to Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment \(2008\-13\): Cybermetric analysis” was incorporated into the overall evaluation report \[C2\]. UNDP used our evidence about the online impact of their grey literature \(leaflets, reports, briefings\) \[Altmetrics2\] and factors associated with success in their Twitter social media strategy \[SocialMedia1\]. 

 Our unique co\-inlink analysis methods and software \[Networks1\] were used by the UN Environment Programme to identify web communities in their evaluation report \[C6\] and by other consultants working for UNEP \[C3\], enabling UNEP to better understand its past performance when planning strategies. 

 <ins>I2.</ins> <ins>Policy decisions or changes to legislation, regulations or guidelines have been informed by research evidence</ins> 

 a\) Belgium: 

 The Belgian government made better informed decisions about future research funding plans, with our support, for Flanders Marine Institute \(2014\), Antwerp Management School \(2016\), Flanders Make \(manufacturing industry research\) \(2017\), and Belgian Space Agency Infra \(2019\). With IDEA Consult \(www.ideaconsult.be\), we provided innovative tailored sets of grey literature impact indicators \[Altmetrics2\] and website impact indicators \[Altmetrics4\], aided by comprehensive search engine query results extraction \[Altmetrics3\]. The results were combined into reports about the non\-academic impacts of Belgian funded research \(a tailored set of indicators for each\). Reports are strictly private \[except C10\], but our IDEA Consult income data is evidence that the four projects exist and were valued enough for repeated contracts. “Wolverhampton’s Cybermetrics allows us to assess aspects of research impact that would be impossible to measure otherwise” \(Van Hoed, IDEA Consult\). 

 b\) European Union \(EU\): 

 EU DG\-Research made better mobility policy decisions based on reports \[C4\] we contributed to. We identified appropriately targeted survey samples of online academics with advanced search engine querying \[Altmetrics3\] for the MORE3 EU researcher mobility survey. Our method allowed the survey to include academics without published journal articles, in contrast to international surveys using email addresses from Scopus or the Web of Science. This ensured high representation from EU countries without substantial English\-language publishing. 

 c\) England and the UK: 

 The UK higher education sector \(via HEFCE, Research England, and Universities UK\) used our advice to employ citation and other indicators appropriately within research evaluations, helping make the sector more efficient. Our advice drew on citation analysis \[e.g., Scientometrics1 was used\] and alternative indicator expertise \[e.g., Altmetrics1 was used\]. This included advice to avoid indicators when counterproductive. In particular, Thelwall provided appropriate indicator use advice to multiple UK committees. Thelwall was an altmetrics specialist in the Independent Review of the Role of Metrics in Research Assessment and Management \(2014\-5\), gave a short presentation to David Willets, then Minister of State for Universities and Science and co\-authored its final report, the Metric Tide \[C7\]. Thelwall and Kousha authored the associated literature review \[C7\]. Thelwall helped ensure that altmetrics were not mandatory for REF2021 because they are not robust enough \[Altmetrics1\]. 

 Thelwall is the altmetrics/scientometrics specialist Member of the UK Forum for Responsible Research Metrics \(FFRRM\) \(2016\-\). He helped to ensure that expert, informed indicator advice was given to the UK higher education sector both at key stages, including for REF decision making, and for general advice. The latter includes ongoing recommendations \[C9\] about responsible and ethical uses throughout academia and advice on quantitative indicators for the REF2021 environment component and the standardised impact metrics \[C8\]. For example, the indicator research validated the Web of Science technical claim to have more “balanced” journal coverage than Scopus \[Scientometrics1\], helping the decision to choose it instead of Scopus.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Charlotte O’Brien’s ‘EU Rights Project’ has seen a broad range of impacts concerning the rights and welfare of EU nationals living in the UK. The project, first, has shaped legal and policy debates about the meaning of equal treatment under EU law. Second, it has directly affected the welfare of EU nationals in the UK by supporting them in disputes with government agencies about their legal entitlements. Third, with similar effect, the project has indirectly assisted a much wider group of EU nationals by training and educating networks of UK advisors. Fourth, it has indirectly assisted additional EU nationals through knowledge exchange with advisors, equipping them to advise their clients about how to prevent the emergence of future disputes about their entitlements. And fifth, it has indirectly assisted a much wider group of EU nationals in the UK by influencing administrative practices within the government agencies that determine all entitlement claims. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The EU Rights Project was a legal action research project undertaken by Charlotte O’Brien. It was funded by an ESRC ‘Future Leaders’ Fellowship \(2013\-2017 \- ES/K000993/1\). The project focused on the right to equal treatment enshrined in EU law, particularly with respect to women, older people and those with disabilities. O’Brien set up a specialist advocacy service with Citizens Advice Bureaux to work closely with EU nationals. Her project offered direct assistance and support with respect to individual claims. It also ran a programme of skills and capacity building for networks of advisors so that they could offer similar support and assistance to a much wider group of affected individuals. 

 Through these action research methods, O’Brien compiled an ethnography of the problems EU nationals faced when making welfare claims. The research showed that migrants from the EU were treated differently from UK nationals. O’Brien’s work thus revealed injustices that would otherwise have gone unnoticed and provided the basis upon which they might be challenged. Such ‘advice\-led ethnography’ offers a highly novel way of interrogating EU law, blending socio\-legal studies with doctrinal, philosophical and historical work on EU social law. 

 The key research findings were as follows: 

-  EU nationals within the UK face administrative, political and legal obstacles when claiming entitlements, particularly welfare benefits: e.g., language demands; extra evidential burdens; and coordination problems amongst different national benefit offices. These obstacles combine to render equal treatment an illusion. EU nationals in the UK suffer systemic disadvantage in accessing justice and in the associated recognition and enforcement of their rights. **\[A\-F\]** 

-  In periods of legal transition, risks of administrative injustice increase as a result of changes in practice and guidance, confusion among decisions makers, and the congestion of communication channels. **\[A\]\[F\]** 

-  Some groups are especially adversely affected. Although legal protections exist for EU migrants facing certain social security risks \(Article 7\(3\) of 2004 Directive 38\), these provisions are better suited to risks experienced by men. Moreover, they have been interpreted by both UK courts and UK administrative decision\-makers in a restrictive manner in which proportionality plays very little role. Equally, they do not allow children an independent right to reside, making them dependent upon the status of their parents. Accordingly, free movement and equal treatment frameworks, as implemented in the UK, contain very significant gaps through which women and children are likely to fall – particularly women who have caring responsibilities, who have children with disabilities, or who have been the victims of domestic abuse. **\[A\]\[D\]\[E\]** 

-  By working with representational agencies, such as Citizens Advice offices, it is possible to improve significantly the support and protection of individual rights through: \(a\) improved information gathering and provision; \(b\) a more detailed and thorough knowledge of the law; and \(c\) increased confidence to challenge decisions of central government agencies. **\[A\]**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 O’Brien’s research has seen a broad range of impacts concerning the rights and welfare of EU nationals living in the UK. She employed a number of techniques to facilitate this impact: establishing herself as an authoritative voice in legal and policy debates; providing direct support to advisors working with EU nationals in entitlement disputes; sharing expertise and building capacity amongst a nationwide network of advisors; advocating directly with government agencies to change problematic administrative practices. 

 <ins> *Shaping Legal & Policy Debates*</ins> 

 O’Brien established herself as the leading expert on the meaning of equal treatment under EU Law for EU nationals who were resident in the UK **\[10e\]**, particularly with regard to welfare benefits. She wrote articles in practitioner journals **\[5a\-5g\]**, gave research briefings to parliamentarians and civil servants **\[2a\]**, gave presentations to groups of lawyers, judges, civil servants and NGOs, with outstanding feedback **\[9\]\[10\]**, and made media appearances **\[7\]**. Her scholarship won awards and was published in major legal journals \(section 3\). As a result, she became an authoritative and highly influential voice in legal and policy debates. 

 O’Brien advised welfare organisations in strategic litigation in the senior courts. For example, her academic output **\[D\]** was adopted by counsel in a UK Supreme Court case and cited in the subsequent judgment **\[1\]**. Advocate General Szpunar quoted and relied upon her academic output **\[C\]** in the Court of Justice of the European Union **\[3\]**. Her evidence to the London Assembly was quoted at length in the Assembly’s letter to the Mayor of London **\[6\]**. Her evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee for Exiting the EU \(2017\) was drawn upon heavily in the Committee’s report \(eight references; 58 lines of text in total\) **\[2b\]**. It was also cited by several MPs in the Commons Debate on the EU \(Withdrawal\) Bill **\[2c\]\[2d\]**. Her written evidence to a later Select Committee inquiry \(2018\) was used explicitly to formulate a specific objection to government proposals regarding the rights of EU nationals post\-Brexit. Drawing directly on O’Brien’s argument that vulnerable groups would fall through the gaps left open by government policy proposals, the Committee demanded that: 

 *“the Government must ensure that there are specific provisions and flexibility for such people to ensure eligibility for Settled Status that will cover vulnerable children and adults, particularly women who have had caring responsibilities or have been temporarily unable to work because of domestic abuse.”* **\[2e\]** 

 The Home Office reversed its policy ten weeks later. As the Assistant Counsel for the Justice Committee in the House of Commons noted: 

 *“\[O’Brien’s\] evidence represented a compelling contribution to the arguments for changing government policy on citizens’ rights. I have no doubt that her arguments were extremely influential in setting the agenda for how the Government should approach policy in this area.”* **\[10e\]** 

 At the supra\-national level too, O’Brien’s work impacted on legal and policy debates. O’Brien was appointed as an analytical expert on the EU Commission’s *Free Movement of Workers and Social Security Coordination Network* \(FreSsco\), as a member of its successor expert network \(MoveS\), and co\-authored three research reports **\[4a\-4c\]**. Her FreSsco report on definitions of a worker under EU Law **\[4b\]** was, according to an EU Commission lawyer, considered both ‘influential’ and a ‘game\-changer’ **\[10b\]**, informing the work of the Commission when considering litigation to set standards and precedents that govern rights: 

 *“\[It\] gave lawyers in the commission evidence and continues to give us a basis for discussion with member states, and amongst ourselves.”* **\[10b\]** 

 <ins> *Direct Assistance in the Resolution of Disputes Over Entitlements*</ins> 

 The EU Rights Project, in its advocacy work, directly supported disputes that represented a recurrent problem encountered by legal advisors. From 2014\-2017, 42 of the project’s 53 case studies involved direct legal action research work: advice, drafting, representation and advocacy. These featured clients from 15 EU member states. There were immediate benefits for claimants relating both to housing \(e.g., preventing evictions; getting housing assistance\) and finances \(e.g., writing off overpayments; accessing benefits, including back payments\). Some outcomes were worth tens of thousands of pounds and feedback was that *“we would not have achieved this result without \[O’Brien’s\] help*” **\[8\]**. The advisors supported by O’Brien in these disputes attest to the central significance of her input: 

 *“\[O’Brien\] made a real difference to the outcomes, particularly of those clients with really technical cases.”* **\[10d\]** 

 *“\[O’Brien\] had a huge impact on my clients… She had so much expertise and knowledge that these decisions were often positive.”* **\[10a\]** 

 *“\[O’Brien’s\] project actually helped people at the same time as studying them – that’s what’s really unique about it.”* **\[10b\]** 

 <ins> *Indirect Assistance in the Resolution of Disputes Over Entitlements*</ins> 

 In addition to direct advocacy support, O’Brien’s research also engaged in considerable knowledge exchange in order to build the capacity of others to reproduce her expertise for the benefit of the wider body of EU nationals in the UK. For example, she wrote articles for publications with wide circulation amongst advisor audiences to inform the advisory networks supporting EU nationals \(e.g., *Advisor*; *Poverty: Journal of the Child Poverty Action Group*\). She also contributed to briefing documents for the *Public Law Project*, subsequently circulated to a broad range of advice organisations, including Citizens Advice Bureaux, housing lawyers’ advisory groups, Greater Manchester Welfare Rights Advisors Groups, the Brexit Civil Society Alliance, and the Birmingham Welfare Rights Advisors **\[10c\]**. She convened knowledge exchange events with advice organisations around the country, gathering data on problems they had encountered and offering training at the same time. Feedback from these events was excellent and demonstrates the significance of their impact in terms of knowledge exchange and capacity building: 

 *“I have a much clearer understanding of those rules and can therefore do a better job for my clients, \[with\] lots of useful stuff I can take away and use.”* **\[9\]** 

 *“\[O’Brien\] encouraged me to learn more and to understand the residency rules for EU nationals, allowing me to do more and more on my own… I became the person that people would come to for advice … I was a bit of a champion for challenging negative decisions instead of accepting them.”* **\[10a\]** 

 <ins> *Indirect Assistance in the Prevention of Disputes Over Entitlements*</ins> 

 Whereas the support of dispute resolution is essentially backwards\-facing – challenging a decision that has already been made – O’Brien’s work also had forwards\-facing impact in the prevention of disputes. The capacity\-building aspect of her action research project enabled advisors to give advice to clients about how to take steps to *avoid* negative decisions and disputes in the future. As one advisor noted: 

 *“I also used this knowledge to give preventative advice … I would tell \[clients\] what documents to keep, just in case they needed to make a claim in the future.”* **\[10a\]** 

 <ins> *Indirect Assistance by Influencing the Decision\-Making Practices of Governmental Agencies*</ins> 

 A second preventative form of impact relates to O’Brien’s influence over routine decision\-making practices within the governmental agencies responsible for determining welfare claims. O’Brien’s advocacy work changed the ways in which entitlement decisions were made in the first place. In relation to a number of her case studies, she reported the problematic nature of decision\-making directly to the UK government agencies concerned: the Department for Work and Pensions and HMRC. Among the responses received, recorded on the case files, was an undertaking to train all helpline advisors on a specific point about claimants’ rights: specifically, that they were entitled to keep an appeal live whilst making a new claim based on different circumstances \[under the terms of the ethical permission to conduct this research, all file note evidence had to be destroyed\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Clause 13 of the Trade Union Bill 2015\-6 originally provided Ministers of State with powers to specify maximum levels of facility time \(the paid time off for union representatives to fulfil their duties such as negotiating with employers and advising members\) in the public sector. This would have significantly reduced the ability of public sector union representatives to support their members. However, this Clause was significantly watered down and delayed in the Trade Union Act 2016, in part as a result of research conducted jointly by Professor Nick Bacon \(Cass Business School\) and Professor Kim Hoque \(Warwick Business School\). This research, which identified the considerable value of facility time to both employers and employees, was widely cited by MPs and Peers in Parliamentary debates on the Trade Union Bill 2015\-16. This led to the removal of the Clause by the House of Lords and a weaker and delayed clause reinserted in the House of Commons. As a result, levels of facility time and workplace union representation, affecting 5.44m public sector workers, have remained relatively unchanged for five years. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 There are three main underpinning elements to the research: 

 i\) Research drawing on the 2011 Workplace Employment Relations Study \(WERS 2011\) explores the presence, activities and effects of workplace union representatives in the public sector in Britain \[3.1\] \[3.2\]. The findings show a positive association between workplace union representation and levels of trust between managers and representatives, suggesting managers regard representatives as making a positive contribution to industrial relations and do not use facility time to engage in political activity or foment dissent \(as several government ministers suggested as motivation for the Trade Union Bill\). The research suggests that enforcing the Clause 13 reserve powers in the Trade Union Bill would compromise partnership working and the positive effects of union representatives on public sector industrial relations. 

 ii\) Analysis of data from the Unite trade union evaluated the relationship between the presence of workplace union representatives and employee perceptions of collective voice and job quality \[3.3\]. This research showed a positive association between workplace union representatives and employee perceptions of collective voice. It also showed enhanced job quality in workplaces with union representatives, a finding explained by the positive effect of representatives acting as an effective collective voice. This research thus further underlined the positive effects of workplace union representatives. 

 iii\) Further research conducted with the Royal College of Nursing \(RCN\) analysed WERS 2011 data to explore the relationship between workplace union representative presence and workplace outcomes in public healthcare services, including: staff turnover and absence rates; the number of tribunal cases; productivity; quality of service  and financial performance \[3.4\]. The results demonstrated a positive relationship between these outcomes and the presence of workplace union representatives. Building on \[3.5\] and their prior surveys exploring the relationship between facility time and the effectiveness of workplace union representatives \[3.6\], Bacon and Hoque designed a new survey instrument administered to the population of RCN union representatives during October and November 2015 \[3.5\]. Analysis of these data indicated that any reductions in workplace union representative numbers, or in facility time, would likely harm rather than improve a range of outcomes, from employee wellbeing to patient care, that successive governments have prioritised for the NHS.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The Trade Union Bill 2015\-16 emerged following the financial crash of 2008 and downward pressure on public sector expenditure. Several prominent government ministers sought to reduce facility time and prevent employers from funding individual union representatives to spend all of their time at work on union duties. Clause 13 of the Trade Union Bill 2015\-16 would have provided immediate reserve powers for Ministers of State to specify maximum levels of facility time for union representatives in the public sector. This would have negatively affected the ability of trade unions and their representatives to support their members and executing their duties. Bacon and Hoque’s research contributed towards major changes in the Trade Union Bill 2015\-16 before it was brought into law by \(i\) the removal of Clause 13 \(providing reserve powers for Ministers of State to specify maximum levels of facility time for union representatives in the public sector\) in the House of Lords, \(ii\) significant alterations of Clause 13 when a revised version was subsequently submitted by the government in the House of Commons \(with the reserve powers delayed subject to a three year period of data collection in which public sector employers would be required to publish facility time arrangements\), \(iii\) helping postpone the date \(five years on\) ministers could exercise reserve powers to limit facility time in the public sector and \(iv\) require ministers to collect appropriate data to justify such actions. 

 Bacon and Hoque’s concern that Clause 13 of the Trade Union Bill was based only on the costs of facility time and did not account for the benefits of facility time led them to calculate the value added by facility time \[2\], and disseminate the findings to trade union general secretaries, and selected opposition peers and MPs \(front and back bench\). They also met with the civil service team responsible for the Trade Union Bill to discuss these findings in detail. Baroness Hayter, leading Labour’s response in the House of Lords, was particularly appreciative of the research, using it and referencing City, University of London in the House of Lords debate: “ *Research at City University London shows that facilities for union reps in the public sector are very similar to those in the private sector, and from neither have we heard, nor have the Government demonstrated, calls for change. Indeed, evidence points the other way, with facility time being beneficial to the safety of work environments, staff welfare and, consequently, particularly in the case of the health service, patients* "" \[5.1\] 

 Bacon and Hoque’s research \[3.1\-3.3; 3.6\] was cited in numerous submissions to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills consultation on aspects of the Trade Union Bill \[5.2\] and attracted the attention of the Royal College of Nursing \(RCN\) \- the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world, promoting patient interests and representing 435,000 registered nurses and related professions. RCN commissioned Bacon and Hoque to conduct further analysis \[3.4\-3.5\] which uncovered positive associations between workplace union representatives and staff turnover in healthcare. Estimations suggested that, inter alia, the presence of representatives saves the NHS over £100 million annually in recruitment costs \[4\]. The RCN disseminated multiple research briefs based on these findings to MPs and Peers \[5.3\], and within the health services community \[5.3\]. This information enabled the RCN to gain support from Trust Chief Executives \(e.g. South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust\) and the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Professional Development \[5.4\]. Sixteen Directors of Nursing directly linked facility time to delivering high quality and cost\-effective patient care, stating “ *there is no need for primary or secondary legislation to interfere with these arrangements”* \[5.5\]. Focussed parliamentary briefings disseminated at each stage of the Bill further ensured the research \[3.2,3.4,3.5\] was widely cited in the Lords to support Amendment 20 to omit Clause 13 of the Bill, proposed by Lord Kerslake, Baroness Watkins, Baroness Hayter and Lord Stoneham. This amendment was supported by the House. Bacon and Hoque’s research \[3.2,3.4,3.5\] was central to this, being repeatedly cited in House of Lords debates by Peers supporting the amendment including Lord Foulkes, Lord Beecham, Lord Hunt, Lord Monks, and Baroness Neville\-Rolfe \[5.6\]. 

 Bacon and Hoque’s research was therefore central in the removal of Clause 13 from the Bill in the House of Lords. A revised version of the clause subsequently reinserted in the House of Commons postponed implementation and imposed data collection requirements to justify such action \(as outlined above\). Bacon and Hoque’s research \[3.2,3.4,3.5\] was again central in this watering down and the postponement of powers to implement these changes, being cited in Commons’ debates by Liz McInnes MP, Dr Lisa Cameron MP, Stephen Doughty MP, Jo Stevens MP, Dennis Skinner MP, and Chris Stephens MP. \[5.6\] 

 Bacon and Hoque’s research therefore provided the necessary evidence to support the removal of Clause 13 from the Bill in the House of Lords and its replacement with amended, diluted provisions in the House of Commons. Regarding this, Lord Monks’ testimonial \[5.7\] states Bacon and Hoque’s research: “ *provided an excellent and timely assessment of the role and impact of trade union representatives with regard to clauses 12 and 13 of the Trade Union Bill 2015’ and ‘ultimately played a critical role in enabling MPs and Peers to argue, first, for the removal of Clause 13 from the Bill, and second, for the postponement of the introduction of reserve powers for Ministers of State to specify maximum levels of facility time for union representatives in the public sector*”. 

 In response to the reinstatement of Clause 13, albeit in diluted form, the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee criticised the Cabinet Office for not paying greater heed to Bacon and Hoque’s research for the RCN, describing the Cabinet Office’s response as ‘ *broad brush’* and that it “ *fails to deal with the substance of the RCN’s concern which, in our eyes, warrants careful consideration”.* \[5.8\] These comments make clear how strong the impact of the research has been in shaping the debate surrounding the subject of facility time and the act itself. 

 Despite reinstating Clause 13, the government conceded not to take any action on facility time for at least three years until further evidence on costs and benefits has been gathered, with The Trade Union \(Facility Time Publication Requirements\) Regulations 2017 statutory instrument requiring all relevant public sector employers to publish annually a specified list of facility time data. Given its centrality in the watering down of Clause 13, Bacon and Hoque’s research has therefore resulted in the introduction of facility time reporting \(at a ‘one\-off familiarisation cost of £2.2m and £2.4m recurring annual reporting cost’ = £9.4m to date\), and the requirement for ministers to provide a more evidence\-based approach to policymaking with regard to facility time. \[5.9\] This has involved 1545 public sector organisations reporting facility time data in 2017\-18, 1291 organisations in 2018\-19, and 1131 in 2019\-20. This has delivered the government’s objective to improve transparency and accountability of facility time expenditure and has set a high threshold before minsters may exercise reserve powers. 

 Ultimately, the government did not return to the facility time issue in 2019 as planned, suggesting the threshold to provide data justifying the use of reserve powers served as a deterrent, further highlighting the enduring impact the research has achieved. Clause 13 powers have now remained unused for five years \(and will likely remain unused indefinitely\). During this period, official facility time returns by public sector employers to government \[5.10\] show increases over three years in the average number of union representatives per employer \(17% increase from 15.82 in 2017\-18 to 19.15 in 2019\-20\) and the percentage of representatives that spent 100% of their working hours on facility time \(10% increase from 0.71 in 2017\-18 to 0.79 in 2019\-20\). The average wage costs of facility time per public sector employer increased by 16% from £55,661 in 2017\-18 to £66,014 in 2019\-20.  This indicates that the impact of Bacon and Hoque’s research on the Trade Union Act had an enduring and ongoing effect, halting and effectively reversing a ten\-year campaign to reduce facility time in the public sector and contributing towards a revitalisation of workplace representation. According to Lord Monks, their research “‘ *has proved to be extremely important in enabling public sector union representatives to continue to provide effective representation to their member”*’. \[5.7\] Facility time underpins the positive effects of unions on a range of outcomes for employees and organisations \[3.1\-3.6\]. These include positive effects on: partnership working; job quality; staff turnover and absence rates; the number of tribunal cases; productivity; quality of service; and financial performance. Lord Monks reasonably infers these effects would have been significantly reduced if Clause 13 had survived and been implemented. 

 These outcomes reflect the impact of Bacon and Hoque’s research on employers and unions at national and local levels. Regarding employers, this research has become further embedded into management practice over time, as public sector employers who backed campaigns to change the Trade Union Bill have recognised and restated the importance of facility time for organisational functioning. For example, the NHS Social Partnership Forum \(SPF\) cites Bacon and Hoque’s research in stating ‘ *”o be effective, union representatives need to have reasonable paid time off from their normal job to enable them to undertake the role. The SPF urges all organisations to agree appropriate time\-off and facilities arrangements so that the trade union representatives are able to participate in local partnership activities*”. \[5.11\] Similarly, NHS Scotland’s Staff Governance Standard embeds union participation as a central requirement for partnership working. These examples illustrate the cascading impact the changes in policy and delay of the bill have had by securing additional facility time and enhancing industrial relations arrangements for over 5 years and counting. 

 Unions at national and local levels have also drawn on this research to place a renewed emphasis on workplace representatives. Approximately a third of the TUC’s position paper on facility time was based on Bacon and Hoque’s research \[5.12\]. The RCN has embedded evidence on the positive effects of facility time and facilities agreements in the RCN Representatives Joint Handbook. It has also drawn on this research to devote more resources to workplace representatives. The RCN Stewards Committee developed a vision for 2020 to increase the visibility and contribution of RCN representatives, increasing the conversion rate from expressions of interest into newly accredited representatives from 34% in 2016 to 64% at the end of 2017\[5.12\]. 

 At regional and local levels, Bacon and Hoque’s research has also been used to remind employers of the value of facility time. For example: “ *The RCN is urging reps to remind employers of the benefits of facility time. This isn’t union time, it’s actually time spent supporting staff and employers through employment, safety and learning issues in their workplaces. The RCN will continue to challenge any attempt to arbitrarily reduce facility time in the workplace”.* \[5.12\] Similarly, it has been used by regional/local union branches in the education sector, for example, to develop new facility time arrangements after Lancashire Country Council withdrew the Combined Facilities Agreement for the schools forum in 2018 \[5.12\], and by Coventry National Union of Teachers \(NUT\) to force Coventry City Council to withdraw a planned 70% reduction in facility time for teaching union representatives \[5.12\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Bina Agarwal’s research led an international organisation and several NGOs to introduce an unusual institutional innovation – group farming – in India and Nepal. As a result: 

-  In Bihar, West Bengal \(eastern India\) and eastern Nepal, 140 poor farmers formed 20 collectives, which: \(1\) increased their bargaining power vis\-à\-vis landlords; \(2\) improved the efficiency of land and machine use; \(3\) enabled access to government subsidies; \(4\) reduced input costs; and \(5\) enhanced yields and livelihoods. 

-  In Gujarat \(western India\), 92 tribal women formed 16 collectives, opening a pathway to greater food security. 

 Moreover, Agarwal’s research in Kerala \(south India\), led an extant programme of 68,000 women’s group farms \(with 300,000 members\) to incorporate more caste\-disadvantaged women. 

 In all regions, the group farming model is continuing and has proved effective in protecting livelihoods and food security during the coronavirus pandemic. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 South Asia’s agriculture is in crisis. Some 86% of its farmers cultivate ≤2 hectares, often in scattered plots and mostly in family\-run farms. These farmers, a growing proportion of them being women, face serious production constraints linked to the small scale of their operations, land fragmentation and poor input access, often rendering their businesses economically non\-viable. Arguing that solutions could lie in alternative models of farming, for over a decade Agarwal has been researching such models, based on small farmer cooperation in South Asia and Europe, to assess their potential and draw policy lessons. Her research examines whether group farming can help smallholders overcome their production constraints and create sustainable livelihoods. Under these arrangements, farmers voluntarily pool land, labour, capital and skills to create a larger enterprise and cultivate jointly, sharing costs and benefits. Her findings show that group farming, if carefully structured, can significantly enhance farm productivity and profits among small farmers, and can empower women farmers, both socially and politically. 

 Two facets of Agarwal’s research have had a major impact: 

 1. She drew lessons from the group farming experiences of socialist and post\-socialist societies, as well as of postcolonial developing economies and democratic Europe, to outline a model embodying a set of principles on which groups could be formed successfully, especially under conditions of resource scarcity. The principles were voluntariness, small size, participatory decision\-making, egalitarian sharing of costs and benefits, trust, and interdependence \[1,2\]. 

 2. She evaluated the economic and social impact of contemporary group farming through a series of empirical studies in two Indian states, Kerala and Telangana \[3,4,5\]. Funding from the two state governments through their poverty alleviation programmes was indicative of their deep policy interest in the research. 

 To assess the economic effects, Agarwal compared the productivity and profitability within each state of all\-women group farms \(69 in Kerala and 70 in Telangana\) and individual family farms \(181 in Kerala and 693 in Telangana\), 95% of which were managed by men. The results were derived through rigorous econometric methods applied to detailed weekly data Agarwal had collected with her team over one year via questionnaire interviews, followed by focus group discussions. 

 Agarwal found that Kerala’s group farms had 1.8 times higher annual value of output and 5 times greater net returns per farm than individual family farms in the state \[3\]. The groups did especially well in commercial crops \[3\]. Telangana’s groups, in marked contrast, did less well than the state’s individual farms in cultivating food grains, but equally well in cash crops \[3\]. 

 Analysing the divergent performance of the two states provided important policy lessons on what works and what does not. Underlying Kerala’s success was strong state support \(e.g. in technical training, marketing and financial incentives\); subsidised bank credit; a multi\-tiered community organisational structure with elected group representatives; small\-sized groups with some social heterogeneity; favourable ecology; and commercial cropping. Telangana, in contrast, had only limited state support; large, more homogeneous groups with limited social capital; difficulties in leasing in land; and limited irrigation, which led to lower yields in subsistence crops \[4,5\]. 

 Notably, however, and despite their divergent economic performance, both states were equally effective in empowering the women managing group farms both socially \(e.g. they enjoyed enhanced respect from their families and communities\), and politically \(e.g. many more stood for village council elections and won seats\) \[4\]. 

 Agarwal’s research thus demonstrated the potential of group farming and provided the justification, principles and pathways for successful replication.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Agarwal’s research and its dissemination have generated four specific forms of impact, the most recent being in safeguarding livelihoods during the Covid\-19 crisis. 

#  Initiation of group farming among poor farmers in eastern India and Nepal 

 In 2015, Agarwal’s research \[1,2\] provided the model for the design of a new action\-research project on group farming in eastern India and Nepal by the International Water Management Institute \(IWMI\) Nepal. As the project head confirms *: “Our aim was to identify farming models to address some of the challenges of landlordism, fragmentation and tenure insecurity through farmer collectives. Agarwal’s papers* \[1,2\] *on the potential advantages of group farming collectives and the principles on which they should be formed was…extremely useful in helping us shape our…models. In project design, we followed the principles specified by Agarwal, ensuring that the groups were voluntarily formed, small\-sized, and had systems in place for egalitarian decision\-making and equal distribution of workloads and benefits.”* \[A\]. Within a year, 20 farmers’ collectives involving some 140 farmers were operating in eastern India and Nepal. The degree of resource pooling varied, but all the collectives reported early economic benefits. 

 Under IWMI’s oversight and support, and using a co\-partnership model, the project was implemented by local NGOs, who also collected baseline data and periodic \(seasonal\) impact data. 

 After its launch, although not involved in the data collection, Agarwal provided key inputs into the project: 

-  She helped analyse the impact data and was a co\-author in the resultant publication \[B\]. 

-  She gave expert advice to IWMI and the NGO partners on how to strengthen social inclusion, gender balance and institutional sustainability. 

 The data analysis revealed several positive benefits of forming farmers’ collectives \[B\]. 

 *First, it enabled farmers* *to challenge feudal relations* 

 The poor farmers who formed collectives now have greater bargaining power vis\-à\-vis the landlords from whom they lease land, than they had individually. One Bihar group with 7 farmers bargained down the rent from about INR12,000 to INR10,000 per acre. Another refused to provide the landlord unpaid domestic services which were earlier obligatory, or to allow the landlord’s family to gather vegetables from their fields without payment \[B\]. 

 *Second, it provided access to government schemes* 

 In Nepal, three groups combined to claim government entitlements, such as seed and fertiliser subsidies offered to cooperatives with at least 20 members. \[B\] 

 *Third, it provided economic benefits* 

 All the collectives reported that cultivating a large contiguous plot created by land pooling, rather than multiple scattered plots, had made irrigation and tractor use feasible \(whereas previously, it was time consuming to move heavy pumpsets between distant plots, and often difficult even to use electric pumps without a nearby power source\). In all cases, machine use is now much greater, efficiency of use is higher, the amount of uncultivated area is lower, and crop yields have increased significantly. In both Nepal and Bihar the pre\-monsoon fallow area fell from 96\-97% to 44%. In all collectives, rice and wheat yields rose; indeed, in some Nepal collectives rice yields rose to thrice their pre\-collective period, and in some Bihar groups wheat yields almost doubled \[B\]. Similarly, labour pooling within groups has helped overcome manpower shortages in peak seasons. As a farmer in Saptari, Nepal, said *, “It took me three days to complete one field task. With the group it takes just half a day or a day”* \[B\]. The groups also reported cost reductions from bulk purchase of fertilisers and seeds, and shared transportation of output \[B\]. 

 *Fourth, it increased women’s skills* 

 The collectives have given previously marginalised women visibility, economic and managerial autonomy, and new skills. Two all\-women collectives report operating irrigation pumps, something denied to them earlier. One woman stated: “ *When we were girls, we were not allowed to even ride bicycles…I have learned…to cycle and to write. Similarly, I have learnt to operate pumps and spray machines.”* The women now also perform formerly ‘male’ tasks, such as negotiating with tractor operators or ploughmen \[B\]. 

 In 2017, Dr Sugden, then head of the IWMI, invited Agarwal to a workshop in Bihar, attended by group farm members and NGO representatives implementing the project in all three sites \(Bihar, Bengal and Nepal\). Agarwal made several suggestions for improvement, drawing on her research \[2,3,4\], such as improving the gender\-balance in mixed\-gender groups, and creating a federation\-like organisational structure to help the groups resist external pressures and ensure sustainability. 

 The first suggestion was taken up immediately, with positive results: “ *Following her* \[Agarwal’s\] *suggestion we interviewed Monila* *who was landless, and found that she was indeed feeling disempowered \(she was the only woman in her group\). We added another woman suggested by Monila…This case also alerted us on the need to nudge groups to be more gender\-inclusive*” \[A\]. The second suggestion will be implemented in Phase II of the project: “ *We have taken that recommendation on board and will be building this structure…starting later this year*” \[A\]. 

 Women also gained in other respects. As an illustration, Monila gained control over her inherited land after joining the farmers’ collective: *“I had been demanding my portion for 8–9 years and finally I received it in 2017. This happened due to my active participation in the collective”* \[C\]. 

#  Initiation of group farming by poor women in Gujarat 

 In August 2018, as requested by Indian NGOs, including a pan\-India women farmers’ network \(MAAKAM\), Agarwal conducted a two\-day workshop to share lessons from her research. As a result, one NGO, which had failed earlier, started 16 new group farms involving 92 poor tribal women. “ *Our learning at the workshop* \[helped\] *us revive group farming…the women farmers became highly motivated…16 groups have* \[now\] *started group farming. This is the largest such attempt…in South Gujarat...Prof. Agarwal’s research and workshop…set in motion a process for… transforming the lives of large numbers of disadvantaged women*” \[D\]. 

#  Inclusion of more caste\-disadvantaged women in a group farming programme in Kerala, South India \(site of original research\) 

 In Kerala, in 2017, Agarwal presented her research findings and recommendations to the Kudumbashree management. Kudumbashree involves 4.5 million women across all 14 districts of Kerala and is its most important development programme. Kudumbashree’s group farming programme \(involving 68,000 women’s groups and over 330,000 women farmers \[E\]\) was the site of Agarwal’s research. Following her presentation, the management team initiated steps to include more poor, low\-caste women in group farming: “ *Kudumbashree has taken various steps to implement the recommendations suggested by Prof. Agarwal in her detailed analysis…Kudumbashree is now focusing more on inclusion of Scheduled Caste* \[lowest caste\] *women in JLGs* \[group farms\] *. Also, Kerala witnessed devastating floods in 2018 and more than 25,000 women’s group farms lost their…livelihoods.* \[Based on Prof. Agarwal’s suggestions\] *strengthening of group farming…was given highest priority after the floods*” \[F\]. 

#  Covid\-19 and group farming 

 The effectiveness of the group farming model was also demonstrated during the Covid\-19 lockdown in 2020. For example, in Kerala, 87% of over 31,000 women’s group farms growing crops in March 2020 were able to harvest and sell their produce \[E\], whereas large numbers of individual farmers in Kerala and other states were widely reported to have lost their incomes due to labour and marketing bottlenecks \[G\]. Moreover, the inclusion of more Scheduled Caste women into the groups prior to COVID means that the most disadvantaged women too would have been protected. 

 In Bihar and Gujarat, similarly, the farmers’ collectives reported that they were more food secure during the COVID\-19 lockdown than if they had farmed individually, and compared to individual smallholders in their village \[A,D\]. 

 These positive outcomes of group farming during an unprecedented crisis can be seen as additional \(indirect\) impacts of Agarwal’s research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by **Professor John Oates** and colleagues identified the significance for child development of carers’ mental representations of their children and led to the design and development of a set of robust tools to measure these, for use by practitioners such as health visitors, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists. The tools have led to impact on health policies and professional services and practice through: 

-  Inclusion in the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Framework for Routine Outcome Measures in Perinatal Psychiatry \(2018\); 

-  Adoption by >30 NHS Trusts’ perinatal mental health services; 

-  Adoption by health care systems in >4 countries in 2 continents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to the research and development work of Prof. **Oates** and colleagues, there was an unmet need in perinatal mental health services for robust screening tools specifically designed to identify mothers’ disordered thinking about their infants. This is a known risk factor for dysfunctional parenting, difficulties in forming secure attachment relationships and longer\-term poor outcomes for the child. For example, a mother may perceive her infant as being too demanding and not caring about her, which can then lead to her not responding appropriately to infant signals of need for comfort, interfering with the formation of a secure attachment. 

 Research by **Oates** and colleagues has shown strong associations of such disorders with mothers’ anxiety and depression, and thus with subsequent developmental problems in their children **\[O1\]**. Although health visitors may often feel concerns about a mother\-infant relationship, until the tools that form the basis of this impact case study became available there were no easy\-to\-use instruments available for standardised assessment of this aspect in primary care. Psychotherapists and other health practitioners delivering perinatal health services also need easy\-to\-use tools as indicators to help them decide on the most appropriate treatments. Similar needs exist for assessing disordered caregiver thinking with respect to young children. Given the identified significance of such disorders, clinical research also requires validated instruments to investigate the developmental pathways and most appropriate treatments to avoid negative long\-term outcomes in child development. 

 Oates’ research gathered and analysed mothers’ narrative accounts of their perceptions of their infants to identify the range of descriptors they used. Based on a thematic analysis, forty\-four distinct descriptive terms were identified and presented to mothers in the form of a questionnaire with a Likert scale degree of agreement response frame. Statistical data analysis to identify principal components resulted in psychometrically robust 14\-item short form questionnaires in English and Hungarian **\[O2, O3\]** called the Mothers’ Object Relations Scales \- Short Form \(MORS\-SF\) also titled in service use as the ‘My Baby’ tool **\[O1\]**. This demonstrated that women’s mental representations of their infants’ thoughts and feelings towards them can be adequately described by values on two separate parameters \(warm\-cold and invasive\-distant\) and that these parameters can be accurately measured by the short form questionnaire **\[O1\]**. This questionnaire was designed to meet the need for a short, easy\-to\-administer tool for use by health practitioners in primary and secondary care. Prior to this discovery, the only available method for assessing maternal representations of infants had been structured clinical interviewing and subsequent systematic analysis of transcripts, requiring training and time\-consuming coding, an approach not feasible in primary mental health service delivery. Full\-scale community\-wide trials of MORS\-SF in an NHS Trust found that the tool showed clinical utility in assisting health visitors with making care pathway decisions **\[O4\]**. 

 The extensive validation research, carried out mainly in England and Hungary, has shown the psychometric robustness of the tools and their measurement efficacy. Further, this research has confirmed that the MORS\-SF parameters are associated with significant short\- and long\-term infant developmental outcomes and are affected by maternal anxiety and depression, while being moderated by social support **\[O1\]**; these findings are of significant value for health practitioners in gaining better understanding of the nature of service users’ problems in their relationships with their infants. 

 Health practitioners’ positive reception of MORS\-SF and the need for an equivalent for use with respect to older children stimulated the development of a modified version, MORS\-Child **\[O5\]**. This research was a collaboration with the University of Warwick Medical School and involved the validation of the tool for assessment in carers of older children \(2\-4 years\). MORS\-Child has been shown to perform better than the only other comparable tool **\[O5\]**. 

 In collaboration with the University of Birmingham, **Oates** followed a similar research methodology to include a selected set of the MORS\-SF questionnaire items in developing an assessment tool for use in informing and monitoring psychiatric and psychological treatments, the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire \(PBQ\) **\[O6\]**. Important benefits of PBQ over other tools include its alignment with clinicians’ interests in gaining insights into specific aspects of serious attachment problems between mother and infant that present in the period shortly after birth, to inform psychiatric treatment decisions and to track response to treatment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Rapid and accurate identification of cases where a mother has disordered thinking and atypical representations of her infant is critical in ensuring that ‘at risk’ mother\-child relationships can receive targeted, appropriate intervention at the earliest stage possible. Given the limited resources available for such interventions, to ensure optimal healthcare provider resource allocation it is important to identify where an intervention to specifically address this disorder is indicated. 

 As a package of clinically focused assessment instruments, the primary areas of impact are **Health Policies, and Professional Services and Practice**. The beneficiaries are the NHS and health services in other countries. 

 Pathways to impact on health services and practice have included talks, workshops, conference papers and training events undertaken by **Oates** and his research colleagues in the UK and overseas, throughout this period of assessment. The uptake of the instruments has been supported by giving guidance and advice for first and second\-tier perinatal mental health services, including via the Parent\-Infant Foundation, and collaborating with the Institute of Health Visiting to deliver training for health visitors **\[C1\]**. 

 The previous Professional Development Officer for the Institute of Health Visiting **\[C1\]** states: 

 *“The presentations and subsequent discussion were very well received. Practitioners reflected on their current practice in relation to parent infant interactions and recognised the significant benefits of the MORS SF tool in being able to demonstrate improved outcomes when working with families”.* 

 The Specialist Community Public Health Nurse for Somerset Sirona Care NHS services **\[C2\]** states: 

 *“Following your informative presentation at iHV PIMH champions training, I’m writing to let you know that all the North Somerset HV team continue to use MORS to enhance their assessments around infant/parents bond and screening for any concerns around attachment and bonding between parent and child. This allows the HV’s to discuss/offer an enhances service around both parental mental health and if there are any interventions to promoting bonding”.* 

 A further route to impact is a dedicated website **\[C3\]** that has been set up for health practitioners to register and gain access to proforma versions of the instruments, including in different languages. The website provides download guidance on administration, scoring and interpretation for the use of the tools in screening and treatment; to date \(31 Dec 2020\) more than 250 health practitioners have made use of the site. 

 **Inclusion of MORS\-SF and PBQ in a Royal College of Psychiatrists Framework** 

 As an overarching indicator of the significance of the suite of instruments, the MORS\-SF and PBQ have been included in the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ \(RCP\) Framework for Routine Outcome Measures in Perinatal Psychiatry \(2018\) **\[C4,** p.7 and p.15 **\]**. The RCP Framework recommends MORS\-SF and PBQ for use in perinatal services as ‘best practice’ in the UK. 

 Consequently, the RCP Framework has been a pathway to impact by leading to changes in routine clinical practice for perinatal health care professionals, and further NHS services adopting MORS\-SF in perinatal mental health programmes. This has been supported by the increased investment into this area of health, which is an NHS priority for development. MORS\-SF is also recommended by the NHS national IAPT \(Increased Access to Psychological Treatments\) Under\-Fives programme **\[C5\]**. 

 **Adoption of MORS\-SF by the NHS** 

 Adoption has become increasingly broad across the NHS in this assessment period, with >30 NHS Trusts’ perinatal mental health services reporting the use of MORS\-SF **\[C6**, pp.2\-3 **\]**, including the Bristol University C\-Change **\[C6**, pp.4\-9 **\]**, the Devon Children and Families Partnership **\[C6**, pp.10\-11 **\]**, the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust **\[C10**, pp.12\-16 **\]**, the Bradford Infant Mental Health Service **\[C6**, pp.17\-18 **\]** and the Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust **\[C6**, pp.19\-20 **\]**. 

 The Clinical Lead for Perinatal Mental Health in the Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust SMABS service **\[C6**, pp.19\-20 **\]** comments: “ *The Specialist Mother and Baby Mental Health Service in Bradford have used MORS\-SF since we launched in May 2018 as the tool was recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists as an outcome measure for perinatal services.  We have found it easy to use and a useful conversation starter to open dialogue around child development and baby’s needs \[…\].* *We are a multi\-disciplinary team with varied backgrounds \(psychological therapists, mental health nurses, occupational therapist and nursery nurses\), the tool has helped us bring the parent infant relationship to the centre of our work ensuring we hold baby in mind and support mum in holding the baby in mind”.* 

 Further, a Senior Psychologist in the Child and Parent Service within the  Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust **\[C6**, pp.21\-23 **\]**  states: *“We use it* \[MORS\-SF\] *as an outcome measure in our clinic work and in our group work, pre and post intervention, and  have found it has clinical utility also in assessment in helping generate conversations with parents about what interventions might be most useful for them*”. 

 MORS\-SF data gathered by NHS practitioners are entered into the National Mental Health Data hub, run by NHS Digital, contributing to statistics tracking and analysing mental health across the English population **\[C7\]**. 

 **Adoption of MORS\-SF and PBQ by health services overseas** 

 MORS\-SF has been translated into Polish, Chinese, Hungarian, Russian, Dutch, Hindi and Arabic, and has been adopted by health care systems in other countries including Hungary \[C8, p. 3\], Australia, Belgium **\[C8**, p.3 **\]** and Russia. 

 For example, the Head of the Early Childhood Eating and Sleeping Disorders Outpatient Clinic at the Heim Pál National Paediatric Institute, Budapest, Hungary **\[C8**, p.2 **\]** states: 

 *“The instrument is our primary research tool for questionnaire assessment of the mother\-infant relationship and aligns well with our theorising about the importance of maternal perceptions of infants and our therapeutic orientation. We have found that the MORS is a thought\-provoking set of questions, giving a unique value in starting them thinking about their child's behaviour potentially facilitating positive change in response to therapy”.* 

 And in Belgium the chief psychiatrist of the Bethany Psychiatric Hospital, Zoersel, Belgium **\[C8**, p.3 **\]** states: 

 *“We implemented the MORS\-SF in all our modules \[treatment pathways\] in the MBU \[mother\-baby unit\]. We are really pleased with the usefulness of it”.* 

 An online survey of MORS\-SF users **\[C8**, pp.4\-35 **\]** was conducted in June 2017. This survey reported wide uptake and application with more than 4,000 patients internationally. Based on **Oates’** and colleagues’ research and the positive value of the tools found by clinical users, initiatives have been established over the last five years in which these assessments are central elements. These include a new perinatal mental health clinic model in Budapest, incorporation into perinatal mental health treatment programmes in clinics in Perth, Australia and a revision to the IAPT \(Increased Access to Psychological Treatments\) Under\-Fives programme by NHS England. The MORS\-SF tool has been included in the Checkware virtual suite of clinical tools for access by health practitioners world\-wide **\[C8**, p.36 **\]**. 

 The PBQ has similarly been widely adopted internationally and translated into many languages, and Oates has collaborated with a Brazilian clinical team to develop and validate a version of the PBQ in Portuguese **\[C8**, pp.37\-43 **\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into Orcadian Neolithic archaeology by the University of Highlands and islands \(UHI\) has created the conditions for substantial regional economic growth. This includes fieldwork undertaken by staff at UHI’s Archaeology Institute, both within and beyond the World Heritage zone known as the ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’. The research has enabled the development of heritage tourism, as well as associated infrastructure and goods. It has also delivered cultural impact through a range of media changing the perceptions of a global audience. In turn, coverage has driven engagement with archaeological research among local citizens, helping local communities to understand and appreciate their heritage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The long\-term research into the Neolithic period of Orkney \- particularly in the World Heritage Sites \(WHS\) and buffer zone by current UHI Archaeology Institute staff \- began with the discovery and excavation of Barnhouse and fieldwork at satellite sites including Maeshowe \[3.1\]. This research helped make the case for the ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ to be established as a WHS which was granted in 1999 \( *https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165/*\). The subsequent establishment of a WHS research strategy \[3.2\] resulted in further field\-based research leading to a range of discoveries such as the Ness of Brodgar \[3.3\] and further fieldwork at Maeshowe passage grave, Ring of Brodgar, and the Stones of Stenness \[3.4\]. 

 Beyond the World Heritage Sites, a substantial number of Neolithic sites and ‘settlement landscapes’ have been discovered and continue to be investigated by UHI Archaeology Institute staff. These include: Vestra Fiold \(Richards\), Ha’Breck \(Thomas\), Knowes of Trotty \(Downes\), Wideford Hill, Stonehall, Smerquoy \(all Richards\), Crossiecrown \(Card & Richards\) \[3.5\] and Cata Sand \(Downes & Richards\). Taken together, this substantial body of research has enabled sophisticated charting of Orcadian Neolithic settlement history, unparalleled elsewhere in northern Europe \[3.5; 3.6\]. 

 Continued research by Institute staff at the Ness of Brodgar \[3.3\], the Ring of Brodgar \[3.4\] and the wider WHS landscape \[3.6\] adding to previous results from Barnhouse \- has radically transformed understanding of Neolithic dwelling practices and monument construction. This covers the WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ and buffer zone, including the extraordinary density of settlement adjacent to these great monuments. UHI excavations continue at the Ness of Brodgar \(2008\-2020\) uncovering a vast settlement complex with stone\-built monumental structures. Currently, more than 30 structures have been discovered, many standing over a metre tall covering an area of c.3 hectares. Described as the most spectacular Neolithic architecture in northwest Europe, the sheer scale and visual spectacle of the numerous monuments and ongoing Ness of Brodgar excavations have ensured continual national and international academic interest together with widespread coverage in the mainstream media. This long\-term research programme has helped to elevate the status of Neolithic Orkney to be perceived as a claimed ‘cultural capital of the ancient world’.

 ‘Unquestionably among the most important Neolithic sites in Western Europe’ are those in Orkney’ states UNESCO, further describing them as ‘monumental masterpieces’, with the group constituting ‘a major relict cultural landscape graphically depicting life in this remote archipelago north of the coast of Scotland five thousand years ago’ \( *https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165/\).* UHI Archaeology Institute research informs the interpretation and presentation of these sites to a world\-wide audience enabling enhanced and far\-reaching appreciation of this extraordinary expression of Neolithic culture. Between summer 2014 and 2020 more than 700,000 people visited the WHS *Heart of Neolithic Orkney* in what is a remote archipelago of \~ 22,000 inhabitants. The robust data for increased visitor numbers during the REF period relates to WHS Skara Brae and the Ness of Brodgar only. Many other archaeological sites such as Ring of Brodgar, Stones of Stenness and Barnhouse are unattended, and freely accessible to visitors. WHS Skara Brae saw an increase of \~ 26,000 during the period with a notable increase in 2017 \(Fig. 4.1\). Open day numbers at the Ness of Brodgar follow this trajectory, both benefiting from and reflecting enhanced media attention based on ongoing UHI research. For example, of visitors surveyed 64% knew of the UHI Ness of Brodgar excavations in advance and 63% said it was very important/important in their decision to visit Orkney \[5.1, p12\]. 

 **4.1 Economic impact** 

 Member of the Scottish Parliament \(MSP\), Liam McArthur says that ongoing UHI research projects in the WHS “are a major tourism draw for Orkney and the excavation \[Ness of Brodgar\] has been demonstrated to be a key driver in the visitor economy” \[5.2\], a sentiment mirrored by Orkney islands Council in recognising ‘the short term local economic value of this project is exceptionally high and the long\-term awareness raising potential is enormous’ \[5.9, annex A\]. 

 UHI archaeological research has indeed made a substantial economic contribution to the local economy through the large increase in independent tourists visiting Orkney during the REF ‘impact’ period. Many visited archaeological sites, particularly the accessible ongoing excavations at the spectacular Ness of Brodgar. The rise in independent tourist numbers \- from 142, 816 in 2014 through to 174,273 in 2017, with an additional 113,000 cruise liner passengers – increase tourist revenue from £31m to £50m \[5.3\]. Overall, this increase has helped to transform the local economy and in 2017 more than half \(62%\) of all visitors were ‘heritage tourists’, with 40% identifying that archaeology as the main reason for their visit. \[5.6, p29\]. Approximately 80% of tourists visit an archaeological site in Orkney, and as a proportion this far exceeds Shetland \(57%\) and the Outer Hebrides \(44%\) although both island groups have outstanding archaeological remains. However, the research and presentation of Orkney archaeology has become a model for their own economic development \[5.4, p 15\-7\]. 

 Neolithic archaeology, particularly excavations at the Ness of Brodgar, offers substantial economic impacts to the local community \(5.5, p12\). Economic beneficiaries include tour guides, accommodation, service providers, and transport companies. There are now 28 Orkney\-based tour companies noted in a guide list provided by the Visit Orkney Tourist Information Centre in Kirkwall.  Fully three\-quarters of these businesses highlight Neolithic archaeology on their websites and/or other promotional material \[5.5, p6\].  Specialist/guided tours frequently visit the Ness of Brodgar during the excavation period, 59 such guided parties – a total of 770 people \- visited the site in 2018\-19. This is summarised in table 4.1 \[5.5, p13\-14\]. 

 **Table 4.1 Economic impact of ‘heritage visitors’ to Orkney** 

| *Period* | *No. of*  *Site Visitors* | *No. of Visitors \(excluding Orkney Residents\)* | *No. of visitors for whom Ness of Brodgar was Very Important* | *Average Tourist Visitor Length of stay \(Nights\)* | *Average Daily Expenditure*  *GBP* | *Total Expenditure during trip to Orkney*  *GBP* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2012\-19 | 101,250 | 87,075 | 25,252 | 5.3 | 68 | 9,100,821 |
| 2018 | 18,200 | 15,652 | 4,539 | 5.3 | 68 | 1,635,856 |
| 2019 | 18,500 | 15,910 | 4,614 | 5.3 | 68 | 1,662,886 |

 As an example, multiplying an average stay of 5.3 nights and £68 daily expenditure \[5.6, p53; 5.5, p14\], by the number of visitors for whom the Ness of Brodgar was *very important* in their decision\-making \[5.1\] generates a total expenditure figure for 2019 of £1,662,886 \[5.5, p14\]. The number of local jobs supported by this spending can be estimated by applying the ratio of £50,000 expenditure:1 FTE job \(including multiplier\) giving a total of 31 local jobs created in 2019 \[5.5, p16\]. 

 Locally, exhibitions such as 2015’s *Art and Artefacts – Ness of Brodgar* helped to push the annual number of visitors to Stromness museum over 11,000 for the first time \(11,976 in 2015, an increase of 3,606 on the 2014 figure of 8,370, a normal annual figure between 2000 and 2014\).  The 30% increase in visitor numbers in 2015 \- substantially attributed to the exhibition \- helped to improve the 2015 financial performance of the independent Stromness Museum \[5.7\]. Neolithic archaeology is generating wider economic impact, such as the July 2019 launch by Highland Park of 5000 bottles of its highly successful limited\-edition *Ness of Brodgar* malt whiskey \(sold out\). 

 **4.2 Changing perceptions of Orkney and its Neolithic heritage through media exposure** 

 Wider appreciation of the spectacular nature of Orcadian Neolithic archaeology is enhanced by UHI research in the WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ zone \[3.1 \- 3.4\] and beyond \[3.5 – 3.6\]. The research continues to compile evidence of a complex and rich Neolithic society living more than 5000 years ago. Awareness and appreciation of this society has reached a worldwide audience via social media, TV and radio, newspapers, magazines, and public lectures. Between 2016 and 2020 the Ness of Brodgar excavations/Neolithic Orkney appeared more than 600 times in the national and international media, and the Ness of Brodgar over half a million website and Facebook visits \(5.5, p11\). 

 In August 2014, a front\-page feature in National Geographic Magazine showcased UHI research within the WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ \[5.8a\] The UHI excavations established a claim to Orkney as a ‘cultural capital of the ancient world’. This precept formed the basis of a 2017, three\-part, BBC documentary which not only altered overseas perceptions of the archaeology of Orkney but also engendered internal pride and shift in appreciation by local communities of the world\-class significance of their archaeological heritage. The series – *Britain’s Ancient Capital: Secrets of Orkney* – was based on the UHI excavations in the WHS area and generated an audience of 2.1m viewers, almost 9% of the total available UK audience \[5.8b\]. The series was ‘infectiously enthusiastic’, according to a review in *The Daily Telegraph* \[5.8c\]. It also caught the popular imagination by proposing that a number of ancient customs and artefacts – including stone circles and pottery – originated in the rich cultural milieu of Neolithic Orkney, including the structure of Stonehenge. Other, earlier programmes – such as BBC2’s *Orkney’s Stone Age Temple – A History of Ancient Britain Special*, presented by Neil Oliver \[5.8d\] – have now been viewed more than three million times, and are regularly repeated on terrestrial television. 

 In addition, in 2017 a BBC News Channel Travel Show featuring Neolithic archaeology reached an estimated 350 million worldwide \[5.8e\]. As an indication of the effect of the substantial media coverage in 2017, the number of tourists visiting WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ increased considerably that year, as shown in Figure 4.1. Social media amplifies the reach and awareness of Neolithic archaeology. The Ness of Brodgar’s Facebook page attracted more than 290,000 views and its website more than 137,000 page views over a six\-week period in 2019 \[5.5, p11\]. 



 **Figure 4.1. Increasing visitor numbers for WHS Heart of Neolithic Orkney Skara Brae: note the 2016\-17 jump from 93,375 – 110,028 visitors \(source: Historic Environment Scotland\).** 

 **4.3 Further engagement in heritage as a consequence of UHI Neolithic research** 

 Visitor numbers to the Ness of Brodgar reached over 18,500 during the 2019 excavation period, and two Open Days had over 1000 visitors each day; Some 83% of visitors to the Ness of Brodgar excavations \(sample size 750\) state that the experience had increased their interest in archaeology/heritage, while 82% said they were more likely to visit further archaeological sites in Orkney \[5.1\]. Research\-based narratives of the Neolithic Age through a broad array of media coverage have had substantial impact locally, leading to greater engagement with heritage and fostering community\-based research. As an example, Orkney Islands Council sponsored a successful 2019\-21 National Lottery Grant of £60K for a Neolithic ‘Tombs o’ the North’ project, under which local communities are researching and conducting fieldwork in six of the Northern Isles to produce Neolithic chambered tomb trails. This enhances island heritage and local tourism in outlying areas. Equally, community involvement in the Cata Sand excavations of a coastal eroding Neolithic settlement in Sanday enhanced local understanding of the effect on island communities of rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and climate change. In conclusion, it is challenging to capture the numerous ways in which Neolithic archaeology, specifically, has become embedded in the local community through societies, museum groups, volunteers and in particular, school projects and classes; as MSP Liam McArthur says ‘I would wish to note for the record the considerable investment in time in engaging local schools and young people in what is happening at the Ness of Brodgar’ \[5.10\]. In short, Neolithic archaeology is efficacious in the social and economic fabric of Orkney – and beyond.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia to explore the determinants of refugees’ welfare outcomes led to a radical reframing of assumptions held by aid agencies about the economic lives of refugees. The research finding that refugees can make a positive contribution to the host state economy led directly to a new model for refugee resettlement not only within Africa but also of Syrian refugees in Jordan, funded by the World Bank and European Commission. As a result of the Jordan Compact, work permits have been provided to over 180,000 Syrian refugees, and both major international companies such as IKEA and Walmart, as well as Syrian companies, have invested in the 18 special economic zones \(SEZs\) in which refugees are now employed. The World Bank subsequently established a USD2,000,000,000 fund for similar initiatives in refugee haven countries, initially 12 in Africa and two in Asia.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Refugee Economies Programme at the Refugee Studies Centre \(a research group at the Oxford Department of International Development\) led by Alexander Betts undertook participatory, mixed methods research in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia to explore the determinants of refugees’ welfare outcomes; social cohesion with host communities; and mobility and residency choice \( **R1,** with RSC research associate Josiah Kaplan\). 

 The research began with a pilot study in Uganda, the first study to systematically examine the economic contributions of refugees to a developing country \( **R2**\). The researchers focused on Uganda because, unlike most developing host countries, it allows refugees the right to work and freedom of movement. The qualitative and quantitative research, which was carried out in 2013\-14, included a survey of over 1,500 refugees in both camps and urban areas. The approach was pioneering in recruiting and training refugees and host communities themselves as peer researchers and enumerators, enabling the project to have a positive benefit to the community. 

 The research in Uganda challenged many assumptions widely held by aid agencies as to the essentially dependent economic lives of refugees. In contrast, it was found that \( **R1**\): 

-  Refugees often make a positive contribution to the host state economy. For example, there is a significant volume of exchange between refugees and Ugandan nationals, and refugees also create employment opportunities for Ugandan nationals. 

-  Refugees are networked within settlements, nationally, and transnationally. Both refugee traders and Ugandan traders connect refugee settlements to wider economic systems. 

-  Refugees are economically diverse and there is significant inequality among them. They have a range of different livelihood activities, with some being successful entrepreneurs. 

-  Refugees are users of, and sometimes creators of, technology. They have higher levels of internet use than the general population, use mobile phones extensively, and frequently adapt their own appropriate technologies. 

-  Although many refugees receive humanitarian assistance, most are more dependent on other social relationships, aspire to receive other forms of support, and in many cases create sustainable livelihood opportunities for themselves. 

 This pilot study was later extended to include Kenya \( **R3**, **R4**\) and Ethiopia. Since 2017, with funding from the IKEA Foundation, the researchers have constructed the first ever panel data set on the economic lives of refugees, following 16,000 refugees and host community members across camps and cities in the three countries \( **R3**\). The additional countries were chosen to permit comparison of economic outcomes for refugees and host communities across cases with more and less inclusive policies. This enabled the team to quantify, for example, the difference that the right to work and freedom of movement makes to the welfare outcomes of Somali and Congolese refugees. 

 In 2017, the researchers also worked with Deloitte on a small\-scale project looking at the economic lives of Syrian refugees in Europe, based on primary data collection in the UK, the Netherlands, and Austria, drawing upon methods developed through this initial research on refugee economies. The research identified the barriers to employment for refugees, which included lack of language skills and access to training, the desire to work using existing skills, and business uncertainty around legal requirements. It also noted that existing social networks and access to technology offered potential advantages \( **R5,** produced with support of wider RSC team\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The results of the Uganda research \( **R1**, **R2**\) had enormous impact within the region and eventually across the world. Influencing policymakers by changing their perception of refugees as potentially contributing to the local economy \(rather than being a burden on taxpayers and aid agencies\) had been the explicit objective of the research project, but the outcome far exceeded expectations. First, Betts built on the Uganda experience to influence policymakers in other countries through the United Nations as a forum, particularly in collaboration with the UN High Commission for Refugees \(UNHCR\). Second, the King of Jordan became aware of the research and called on Betts to explain his results, and with the UK government initiated the ‘Jordan Compact’ to integrate Syrian refugees into his country. Third, this initiative in turn had significant international influence, leading to major World Bank funding for the implementation of the model, and Betts’ involvement in similar initiatives in Ethiopia, Colombia and Kenya. 

 *Building on the Uganda experience to transform policymaking and capacity building in the region* 

 Betts presented the Uganda findings \( **R1, R2**\) at the UN General Assembly in September 2016 on a panel that included the Ugandan Minister for Refugees and the UN Secretary\-General \[ **C1**\]. The Ugandan government also presented this research at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016. In response to the research, the Ugandan government worked with the UN High Commission for Refugees and the World Bank to develop a new multi\-year livelihood strategy for refugees, including a focus on the market\-based opportunities highlighted by the research, which will benefit over 100,000 refugees. This led to the UNHCR and the World Bank jointly publishing a 2016 report, titled *An Assessment of Uganda's Progressive Approach to Refugee Management*, in which one of the conclusions is that “\[a\] shift in the philosophy of refugee assistance is also crucial: refugees should be viewed as economic actors in charge of their destiny” \[ **C2**, pxii\] and the ten\-page literature survey cites Betts and Omata 43 times. 

 The value of the research has been recognised by the Office of the Prime Minister \(OPM\) of Uganda, noting that it has elevated their policymaking by providing a previously unavailable evidence base: “The research conducted by Oxford \[on\] the refugees’ economic activities has made a significant contribution to the development of the OPM and joint self\-reliance programme \[the multi\-year livelihood strategy for refugees\] in Uganda…The analysis and data provided by Oxford have become a significant underpinning of our policy making in the area of refugees’ self\-reliance and have also enabled us to conduct evidence\-based policy\-making” \[ **C3**\]. 

 In a statement from 2016, the effect of the research was also recognised and valued by the UNHCR, with the then\-Deputy High Commissioner stating that the work has been transformative for the way in which policymakers understand the contribution refugees can make: “The Refugee Studies Centre’s work \[on refugee economies in Uganda\] has fundamentally altered the debate on the impact of refugees in countries of asylum, demonstrating the capacity of refugees for self\-reliance and their ability to contribute to hosting societies” \[ **C4**\]. 

 In July 2018, Betts co\-organised a visit of World Economic Forum \(WEF\) Young Global Leaders \(YGLs\) to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. The group included government ministers, company CEOs, and journalists. The visit culminated in the creation of a new WEF initiative to support public\-private partnership for refugees, launched in Davos at the WEF Annual Meeting, at which Betts presented his work. In July 2019, this in turn led to Betts co\-organising the first ever Executive Leadership course in a refugee camp, in Kakuma, in collaboration with the WEF and UNHCR for 30 refugee entrepreneurs, who subsequently embarked on a virtual mentorship programme pairing them with YGLs from around the world \[ **C5**\]. 

 *The “Jordan Compact”* 

 Aware of the Uganda research, the Jordanian royal family invited Betts and Professor Paul Collier \(Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford; and at that time adviser to the Cabinet Office on fragile states\) to explore ways to include Syrian refugees in Jordanian labour markets. Based on the Uganda research, Betts and Collier proposed allowing Syrians to work in Jordan’s existing Special Economic Zones \(SEZs\); previously they had not been permitted to take any employment. They presented the model to the Jordanian royal family, senior cabinet ministers, and relevant UN agencies in Amman in April 2015 and subsequently drafted a white paper for the Jordanian government \(later published as an article in *Foreign Affairs*\) \[ **C6**\]. 

 In September 2015, King Abdullah presented the ideas in the white paper to then\-UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and the model was adopted and developed by DFID, forming the basis of the so\-called “Jordan Compact”, an agreement between the Jordanian government, the World Bank, and the European Union, reached in February 2016. The compact states that it “allow\[s\] Syrian refugees to apply for work permits both inside and outside of the zones…Syrian refugees will be allowed by the summer to formalise their existing businesses and to set up new, tax\-generating businesses, including access to investor residencies, in accordance with the existing laws and regulations” \[ **C7**\]. 

 The proposal by Betts and Collier, based on Bett’s original research \[ **R1** and **R2**\] **,** is widely recognised in the NGO community as being a key “trigger” \[ **C8.1** p.2\] for the compact, and also in the specialist media: an article from The New Humanitarian in July 2016 states that: “The use of \[the  [King Hussein Bin Talal](https://6days-jo.com/hay2a/en/module.php?type=cont&id=28) Development Area, one of the key zones under the compact\], and SEZs more broadly, follows on from  [an influential proposal made last October](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2016-04-28/jordans-refugee-experiment) by two Oxford University professors, Paul Collier and Alexander Betts. In it they pointed out that 60 percent of the world’s displaced were concentrated in just 10 haven countries, including Jordan. While granting citizenship to such large numbers was not currently feasible, the targeted use of SEZs might offer the right to work and transform them from a burden to an asset” \[ **C8.2**\]. In 2016, the European Commission agreed to grant Jordan market access to encourage firms to produce there, as recommended in the white paper \[ **C6**\] – its first ever refugee\-related trade concession. 

 The Jordan Compact led to work permits being provided to over 180,000 Syrian refugees. IKEA and Walmart as well as Syrian companies have invested in the 18 special economic zones in which refugees are now employed. In just one example, in the Sahab Economic Zone, the Al Fayhaa Plastics Company employs 82 refugees among its 313 staff, with 40% of its sales being exports to the EU under the Jordan Compact. 

 *Expanding international policy support for refugee economies* 

 Jordan was the first case ever of the World Bank funding a middle\-income country to host refugees. Soon afterwards, in 2016 the “Jordan model” was adopted by Ethiopia \[ **C9**\]. In fact, British backing for the “Ethiopian Jobs Compact” was Theresa May’s first foreign policy announcement as UK prime minister \[ **C10**\]. 

 Betts’ research \( **R1, R2,** and work\-in\-progress research in Kenya later published as **R3, R4**\) was presented to the World Bank by Collier, as he had formerly been the Bank’s Director of Research. The Bank subsequently created a new USD2,000,000,000 fund to support other refugee haven countries, initially 12 in Africa and two in Asia. Priority areas for the funding included to ""promote refugee's welfare and inclusion in the host country's socio\-economic structures"" and support ""formal labor force participation"" \[ **C11**\]. The original RSC research in Uganda and the Jordan Compact formed the basis of a book for a general readership, *Refuge,* by Betts and Collier \[ **C12**\], which led to further invitations to work directly with governments around the world, including Denmark, Austria, Norway, and Colombia. The book sold over 10,000 copies; was named by the *Economist* as among the best books of 2017; was widely reviewed, including by the *Times Literary Supplement*, the *Wall Street Journal*, the *Sunday Times* and the *Financial Times*; and was shortlisted for the Estoril Global Issues Distinguished Book Prize 2019. 

 Given Betts’ expertise on migration in Africa and the Middle East and his pioneering work on refugee integration, he was invited to Colombia by the presidency in 2019 for advice on what lessons could be drawn from elsewhere in the world to help the country cope with the presence of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who had fled their own country. Betts gave presentations relating the Uganda, Syria and East Africa research to the Venezuelan/Colombian context \[drawing on **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4** and **R5**\] at the Presidential Palace to UN and donor agencies, as well as interviews and opinion pieces for the press. In particular Betts’ suggestion that the country convene a multi\-stakeholder “solidarity summit” was taken up \[ **C13**\]. 

 In October 2019, the European Commission convened an International Solidarity Summit on the Venezuelan Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Brussels, in collaboration with UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration \(IOM\). The event was attended by 120 delegations, including EU institutions and member states, the most affected Latin American and Caribbean countries, donor countries, UN agencies, the private sector, NGOs, civil society organisations and development actors. It focused on principles of solidarity such as access to asylum, combatting xenophobia, and the need for responsibility\-sharing. Explicitly not a pledging conference, it nevertheless led to EUR120,000,000 of additional contributions from EU member states, plus EUR50,000,000 of additional EU funding \[ **C14**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Damodaran’s research on climate heritage, botanical history and colonial archives has created new, long\-term collaborations between cultural institutions, groups and individuals in the UK and India, and has enabled them to reach new audiences. Beneficiaries include: the British Library, the UK Met Office; the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; the Natural History Museum; the Botanical Survey of India; exhibition audiences; and indigenous environmental activists. Educational initiatives based on Damodaran’s research have reached over 1,600 schoolchildren, and her work on climate in the Indian Ocean has been incorporated into the Met Office’s Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth \(ACRE\) weather database, helping to improve the data and knowledge available to best predict climate variability. Damodaran’s research on archival collections has inspired lasting impact across two continents.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Over the last twenty years, Damodaran has played a crucial role in the development of histories of the environment, focusing on rights and resources, practices and data, and landscape and climate. Her research has built momentum for a distinctively South Asian Environmental History whilst maintaining a global perspective and attending to the *longue durée*. She has studied both material changes in the environment and local interactions with it. 

 Her pioneering work on the Chotanagpur plateau in Eastern India, which in 1911 was populated by 33 different groups of Adivasi, explored nature as a ‘used’ environment. Attentive to the attacks Adivasi faced from the colonial state and development organizations, she explored long\-term environmental change, community response, and human\-nature interactions **\[R1\]**. Her jointly edited essay collection *The East India Company and the Natural World* showed that resource use was a critical aspect of Imperial History, but that a relentless programme of plant classification, framed by a conservationist discourse, also created invaluable environmental data **\[R2\]**. She has consistently located colonial narratives of tribe, custom and landscape within the context of more recent contestations for space and resources, demonstrating that the past provides an ongoing resource and context for present social justice claims **\[R3\]**. 

 A second strand of Damodaran’s research approaches botany both as a historically\-situated practice and as a historical resource for scholars and public audiences. Her ground\-breaking work on E. K. Janaki Ammal, the first female employee of the Royal Horticultural Society and Director of the Botanical Survey of India, restored a hitherto hidden figure to the history of science – one who attempted to challenge Kew’s imperialist approach to plant classification **\[R4\]**. As PI on the ‘Botanical and Meteorological History of the Indian Ocean’ network project, **\[G1 & G2\]**, she drew together over 90 stakeholders, including the British Library \(BL\), the National Museum of Natural History in Delhi, the Botanical Survey of India \(BSI\), and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to transcribe, collate, and where possible digitise, a wealth of botanical and environmental knowledge collected between the 17th and the 19th centuries and to make these resources more accessible in the Global South. These included the India correspondence of Kew Director, Joseph Hooker, and 33 volumes pertaining to Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich who was the superintendent of Calcutta Botanic Garden until 1846. 

 Damodaran’s research has been conducted within, and its impact realised through, a distinctive collaborative methodology. By developing a cross\-disciplinary framework she has used her own research to gather together previously\-unconnected individuals, groups and organisations for capacity building, dialogue and global partnership. As Director of the Centre for World Environmental History \(CWEH\) from 2003, Damodaran has nurtured four additional research networks \(Academia and Activism; Mines, Water and Energy; Historical Climatology; Climate Change and the Humanities\). Out of these have emerged collaborative grants and edited collections that have positioned humanities scholars from the Global South, as well as the North, as key voices in environmental discourse, and particularly in debates about climate change **\[G3\]**. Under Damodaran’s auspices, Sussex signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the British Library and the Met Office in 2012 to share historical climate and weather data for India and the Indian Ocean world with ongoing impact since. Working with the Met Office and the Indian Ocean World Centre at McGill, she has also collated and analysed such data, synthesising qualitative and quantitative knowledge by linking natural archives with documentary archives to map 17th century historical floods, famines and droughts in South Asia **\[R5 & G4\]**. This work has included identifying historical quantitative daily and sub\-daily temperatures for use in the Met Office Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth \(ACRE\) project **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The extensive impact of Damodaran’s research stems from its demonstration \(to individuals as well as organisations\) that historical climatological and botanical records produced during colonial periods are never simply inert documents or archives, but continue to have a potent political charge and policy relevance for the ever more inter\-connected 21st\-century world. The research has underpinned three distinct, yet complementary, areas of impact. 

 **Increased capacity building for flagship cultural and scientific institutions resulting in new learning, new projects, and extended audiences** 

 Damodaran’s multi\-disciplinary methodology has created international collaborations among a range of previously\-unconnected academics, archivists, curators, scientists and communities. For \[text removed for publication\] of the India Office Records at the BL, this has ‘brought us introductions to people \[with\] whom we would never otherwise \[have\] had contact with’ and has delivered new professional learning: ‘thanks to Vinita, we were also able to take a facsimile exhibition… to Mysore. This was an effective way to get our materials shown to Indian audiences,’ where it generated ‘enthusiasm not only from the general public but also from artists and other creative people.’ A further impact was the generation of more funding for the BL’s environmental collections, such as a Wellcome project ‘to digitise our medical records \[which\] has built on the work on environmental records that I’ve done with Vinita.’ **\[S1a\]**. Fiona Ainsworth, Head of Library Art and Archives at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, states that Damodaran’s research was critical in enabling them to present some of their material – for the first time in India – ‘to the local audience in Kolkata.’ **\[S1b\]**. \[Text removed for publication\] of the Botanical Survey of India \(BSI\), explains that Damodaran’s work has created ‘a stronger bridge’ between the BSI in India and organisations in the UK **\[S1c\]**. 

 The Met Office is another beneficiary. ‘Vinita’s research is bringing the Humanities into the picture of what we do’ explains \[text removed for publication\], from the ACRE project in which Damodaran’s Centre is a partner; ‘\[it puts\] everything in a much more complete context which we believe makes the database, and the weather reconstruction generated from it, more useful to the end user.’ **\[S1d\]**. By recovering and digitising previously\-neglected historical climate evidence, Damodaran has extended the scale and accessibility of data available to predict climate change. According to \[text removed for publication\], this helps to bring ‘a wider socio\-historical and economic perspective which deepens and enriches the extent of the work we do at the Met Office.’ **\[S1d\]**. 

 Damodaran was part of a team including ACRE, other national meteorological and hydrological services, international and regional institutions, and national and international climate experts, that drew up the World Meteorological Organisation’s Indian Ocean Data Rescue Initiative \(INDARE\) implementation plan in 2014 **\[S2a p. 24\]**. 11 Indian Ocean Rim countries signed up to it, thereby committing to enhance the quality and quantity of historical weather data to improve decision\-making and policy formulation **\[S2b\]**. For example, Mauritius, via their Meteorological Society, is now scanning the 188 volumes of Meldrum’s extracts from ship logbooks of vessels that were at harbour in Port Louis from the 1850s to the First World War **\[S2c\]**. 

 **Repatriating knowledge, highlighting environmental destruction in Adivasi lands, and communicating hidden histories of botanical science to new beneficiaries** 

 The pioneering Indian female botanist and cytogeneticist, E. K. Janaki Ammal, was practically unknown in India, as well as in the UK, until Damodaran curated the first exhibition of Ammal’s life, letters and works. The exhibition toured Kolkata and Delhi from 2016 to 2018 – receiving 12,750 visitors – and is currently on permanent exhibition at the Botanic Garden of India in Uttar Pradesh **\[S3a\]**. It was based directly on Damodaran’s research and resulted in several popular articles and blogs on Ammal in India, and internationally, including an article in the *Smithsonian Magazine* which has a circulation of over 1 million. Such publications, which explicitly cite the underlying research, have further extended the reach of Damodaran’s impact **\[S3b\]**. 

 Sponsored by the BSI, the Ammal exhibition appeared at the Indian Museum in Kolkata alongside a partner exhibition – ‘Hooker, Botanical Trailblazer’ – which Damodaran co\-curated with Kew and which was funded by Damodaran’s AHRC impact grant **\[G2\]**. This built on her work with Hooker’s India letters at Kew \(digitisation was initially funded by Sussex\) and combined Kew material with collections from the BSI and other Indian institutions. For Ainsworth \(Kew\), Damodaran’s involvement facilitated additional reach in the bicentenary year of Hooker’s birth: ‘It has been fantastic to have another strand to those celebrations to say we have also, not only been doing things at home in the UK, but have been promoting his work globally.’ **\[S1b\]**. For \[text removed for publication\], it created a new way for the BSI to interact with the public: telling the story of key individuals within environmental history ‘was a new approach we had taken to the museum for the first time… a new interface.’ **\[S1c\]**. In a clear indication of the significance of the exhibition, it was opened by Sri Ajay Narayan Jha, who was then the Secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change, Environment and Forests in the Indian government. 

 In association with the museum exhibition, Damodaran hosted two major public conferences in India, as well as numerous workshops in the UK, to engage – and facilitate connections between – international scholars, activists and diverse publics around issues of forest destruction. The particular issue of the destruction of the Saranda forest attracted press attention in India when the Adivasi activist Gladson Dungdung was barred from leaving the country to attend a Sussex workshop on the matter in 2016. The confiscation of his passport by the Indian government was raised in the Upper House of India Parliament **\[S1e\]**. Subsequently he was able to attend a 2017 conference at the Indian Museum Kolkata on ‘Forests, Sacred Groves and the Environmental Heritage of India’ which drew attention to the natural heritage of India’s indigenous communities and highlighted the destruction through mining of key natural heritage sites in tribal areas. His participation created deeper engagement with marginalised indigenous students on the issue of mining destruction and tribal landscapes. 

 Rinu Kumari, a tribal research scholar from Kolhan University, was prompted to write about how both the event and Damodaran’s research had changed perceptions: ‘tribal people are very scared of the people from outside, after meeting you I felt some people truly think about us in the right way; you have given a new direction to my life.’ **\[S1f\].** For Dungdung, Damodaran’s research has had a fundamental impact on the reach of his activism. By launching his books at her events, he attracted an international audience and more coverage in the Indian media than he would otherwise have had. As a result, his opportunities to present on Adivasi issues have increased ‘both locally and globally’. He writes: ‘this collaboration has enriched my knowledge, strengthened my intellectual capacity, gave me a recognition as one of the powerful Indian activists, created intellectual space and encouraged me to fight for the rights of the Adivasis.’ **\[S1e\]**. 

 The BSI also benefitted from meetings organised through Damodaran’s research, particularly those in 2017 with the Head of the BSI and the Natural History Museum \(NHM\) in London. These led directly to an MoU through which the BSI sent a team of eight scientists to the NHM to make images of, and digitally repatriate, more than 30,000 herbarium specimens originally collected in India **\[S4\]**. As \[text removed for publication\] \(BSI\) explains, this was of huge significance for Indian botanical science because the collection had not previously been made available to Indian scientists. Access to the specimens was essential to the creation of the new flora of India \(‘they helped us in finalising the descriptions and identifying the species’\), while also contributing to the NHM’s digitisation programme **\[S1c\]**. The new flora of India, which will be completed in 2021, will estimate the status of Indian plants in existence internationally and help understand changing biodiversity in the context of industrialisation and development. 

 **Increasing educational opportunities and influencing the design and development of new curricula** 

 A schools and outreach programme, developed in Kolkata through Damodaran’s AHRC\-funded network, has also drawn on her empirical research. A pilot project with two local schools – Dum Dum Motijheel Girls’ High School & Kishore Bharati High School – gave children the opportunity to engage with the natural history collecting practices of the British Empire and the co\-construction of botanical knowledge by local communities, including Adivasis in India. They also learned about the conservation of the endangered flora of South Asia and about the environmental and plant knowledge of India’s indigenous communities. 

 The programme, which ran from January to August 2017, included a guided visit to the Hooker exhibition at the Indian Museum and to the Charya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, Howrah, West Bengal. For Kew, this was an important part of their engagement, as Fiona Ainsworth noted: ‘I know that all the school activities have been great for our outreach, so just being able to participate in it has been really helpful.’ **\[S1b\]**. For the first time, BSI scientists opened up their collections to children from underprivileged backgrounds and engaged with them through talks, discussions and essay projects. The programme developed study kits and 36 different brochures, all in Bengali and English, on topics ranging from medicinal plants to climate change – produced in conjunction with BSI scientists and teachers **\[S5a\]**. The sessions improved student understanding of the natural history collection, of the role of botanical knowledge \(both colonial and indigenous\), and of the importance of India’s botanical heritage and its conservation in terms of India’s endangered flora and fauna. In an essay for a competition run by the programme on ‘Conservation of Biodiversity Elements and their Sustainable Uses’, one student wrote: ‘it is our duty to save our biodiversity. It is essential to save precious life on our earth or it will be a curse on our life and we are destroying our future and our next generation.’ **\[S5b\]**. The project also co\-produced educational materials by inviting children to depict their surrounding environment or a plant in the botanic garden. 240 students participated in the pilot **\[S5c\]**. \[Text removed for publication\] particularly praises the programme for bringing knowledge about biodiversity to ‘underprivileged Bengali speaking children’ and providing ideas and inspiration for ‘new learning material.’ **\[S1c\]**. 

 The pilot study shaped the BSI’s ongoing educational work and persuaded it to continue and extend the programme as the ‘Environmental Education Awareness Programme’ \(EEAP\) in India – an important legacy of Damodaran’s project. In the August 2017\- March 2018 cycle, 475 students from six schools were given the opportunity to learn about plants and conservation at the Botanic Garden and Museum **\[S6a\]**; in the 2018\-19 cycle a further 896 children participated in the programme across 11 different schools **\[S6b\].** Teacher feedback refers to ‘an excellent environmental and educational programme’, explaining that ‘now \[students\] can relate their theoretical knowledge to practical experience’ and stating that ‘I have seen increased interest and engagement with environmental issues as a result.’ **\[S6c\]**. In 2020, the programme extended its reach to the children of a marginal environment in the delta region of the Sundarbans, supported by ESRC funding \[ES/S008292/1\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Leeds researchers have driven a programme of research to establish key risk factors for pressure ulcer development. Work includes: large clinical research studies; risk factor systematic review; and development and validation of an evidence\-based risk assessment instrument \(PURPOSE\-T\). The work identified *skin status*, immobility and factors affecting tissue perfusion as the *primary* risk factors for pressure ulcer development. 

 The research provides ‘Level A’ evidence to support key recommendations in international guidelines with worldwide reach, and has influenced practice/improved clinical outcomes through: incorporation into international guidelines; implementation of PURPOSE\-T; quality improvement projects; and public focused media, where skin status is now a focus in risk assessment practice. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Pressure ulcers \(PUs\) represent a major burden to patients, carers and the healthcare system, affecting 7% and 5% of hospital and community patients, respectively. They occur in patients with reduced mobility when the skin and/or tissues are damaged by *sustained mechanical load* on areas of the body not adapted to pressure \(e.g. buttocks/heels\). PUs are classified according to the level of clinically assessed damage: non\-blanching erythema \(Category 1\); loss of epidermis/dermis \(Category 2\); and deeper tissue destruction \(i.e. fat, muscle and bone\) \(Category 3/4\). Category ≥2 are reportable clinical incidents, and in 2004, associated annual NHS costs were estimated as between GBP1.4billion and GBP2.1billion – 4% NHS total budget. 

 Leeds researchers have driven a research programme that has made a significant contribution to the following PUs aspects. 

 **RISK FACTOR RESEARCH** **SKIN STATUS:** Using large representative populations and analysis methods, we were able to separate confounding effects. Our research has established that aspects of skin status – Category 1 \(i.e. non\-blanching erythema\), alterations to intact skin, and localised skin pain – are independent risk factors associated with Category 2 PU \[ **1**, **2**, **3**\]. 

 **Category 1 \(non\-blanching erythema\):** Three studies using logistic regression modelling have identified that Category 1 \(non\-blanching erythema\) is independently associated with Category 2 PU development. First, in a small exploratory surgical study with 109 patients with wide 95% confidence intervals \(CI\) \(Odds Ratio \(OR\) 7.02, CI 1.67\-29.49, p=0.008\) \[ **1**\]. Second, in a large randomised controlled trial of 1,971 medical and surgical in\-patients \(OR 1.95, CI 1.31\-2.91, p=0.001\) \[ **2**\], and third, in a large cohort of 634 acutely ill hospital/community patients \(OR 3.25, CI 2.17\-4.86, p=<0.0001\) \[ **3**\]. 

 **Alterations to intact skin:** Two of the studies also identified that alterations to intact skin/skin trauma are independently associated with Category 2 PU development \(OR 1.67, CI 0.999\-2.80, p=0.05\) \[ **2**\], \(OR 1.98, CI 1.30\-3.00, p=0.0014\) \[ **3**\]. 

 **Pain:** We are the first group worldwide to identify ‘pressure\-area related pain’ as a possible risk factor through our qualitative research \[ **2**\], quality of life systematic review \[ **4**\] and multi\-centre prevalence of 3,397 patients \[ **5**\]. This informed our large cohort \[ **3**\] where skin site multi\-level modelling found significant evidence that localised ‘pressure area related pain’ is independently predictive of Category 2 PU \(OR 2.25, CI 1.53\-3.29, p<0.0001\). 

 **EVIDENCE\-BASED RISK ASSESSMENT:** Our systematic review \[ **5**, **6**\] identified 54 eligible studies and classified key risk factor domains and sub\-domains. For the first time, we identified skin status together with immobility and factors affecting tissue perfusion as the *primary* risk factors for PU development. 

 The systematic review \[ **6**\] then underpinned the development of an evidence\-based risk assessment instrument, using sequential consensus and validation studies involving service users and international experts. The consensus work led to conceptual framework development, theoretical causal pathway and design of a draft Risk Assessment Framework \(PURPOSE\-T\). Validation included pre\-testing and field testing to assess reliability, validity, data completeness and clinical usability \[ **5**\]. 

 The final PURPOSE\-T \[ **5**\] differs from pre\-existing instruments. It has a screening stage to quickly identify patients who are clearly not at risk of PU development. It incorporates *primary* risk factors – immobility, skin status and perfusion. It stratifies patients using skin status, making a distinction between patients with no existing PUs requiring primary prevention and those with a Category ≥1 PU who require escalation in care/treatment \[ **5**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Changes to PU risk assessment impacts thousands of patients daily. Guidelines advocate risk assessment to be undertaken on admission for all hospital/community facilities to identify ‘at risk’ patients and initiate preventive/management measures \[ **A**, **B**\]. The reach of the Leeds research is extensive due to its incorporation within international guidelines and clinical practice, and significant due to the contribution of large high\-quality studies with low risk of bias \[ **A**, **B**\]. 

 **INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES:** The most wide\-reaching guidelines are international guidelines produced jointly for the first time with a worldwide platform in 2014 \[ **A**\] and 2019 \[ **B**\] through USA, European and Pan\-Pacific collaboration. The guideline is used by healthcare professionals worldwide. **Nixon** and **Coleman** are recognised internationally for their research and led the appraisal and drafting of the guideline risk factor chapter \[ **A**, **B**\]. 

 Leeds research has directly influenced the guidelines in three ways: 

1.  pathophysiological mechanisms explained using our risk factor conceptual framework \[ **5**\], which were reproduced with permission \[ **A** Figure 2, **B** Figures 2.1 and 4.1\]. 

1.  risk factor guideline sections adopted our systematic review methodology and structured the evidence and recommendation hierarchy using our conceptual framework and domain/sub\-domain classification \[ **6**\]. 

1.  Evidence for specific guideline statements including Level A evidence for Category 1 PUs are tabulated: 

| *Guideline Statement* | 2014 \[ **A**\] Leeds data | 2019 \[ **B**\] Leeds data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *‘Consider individuals with a Category/Stage 1 pressure injury **to be at risk** of progression or new Category/Stage 2 pressure injury’* | **Recommendation**  **Strength of Evidence B**.  2/4 studies  2,068/5,125 patients  222/665 PU events\) \[ **1**, **2**\]. | **Recommendation**  **Strength of Evidence A  3/6 studies  2,670/6,337 patients  374/852 PU events \[ **1**\- **3**\]. |
| *‘Consider **the potential impact** of alterations to skin status over pressure points on pressure injury risk’* | *N/A* | **Good Practice Statement**  2/14 studies  2,573/7,883 patients  359/1,262 PU events \[ **2**, **3**\]. |
| *‘Consider **the potential impact** of pain at pressure points on pressure injury risk’* | *N/A* | **Good Practice Statement**  1/1 studies  602 patients  152 PU events \[ **3**\]. |

 \*Note that strength of evidence increased from B to A due to Leeds research. 

 **Guideline reach and revenues:** The international guidelines have been distributed and translated as tabulated, with associated profits of USD293,790 divided between the three collaborating organisations to support ongoing developments in the field \[ **C**, **D**\]:

 **PURPOSE\-T CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION:** Our risk factor \[ **1**\- **3**\], pain \[ **2**, **3**, **4**\] and systematic review \[ **6**\] underpinned the development of our evidence\-based risk assessment instrument \- PURPOSE\-T \[ **5**\] with a focus upon skin assessment \(including presence of Category 1, alterations to intact skin and localised skin pain\), mobility and perfusion. 

 **Intellectual Property:** PURPOSE\-T is copyrighted and accessed through a ‘permission to use’ function \[ **E**\]. Since its 2014 launch, it has had 965 ‘permission to use’ requests from healthcare providers and individuals \[ **F**\] and the paper version has been coded into 4 electronic NHS records systems including: SYSTEM 1/EMIS \(community\) and PPM/EVOLVE hospital by 8 NHS Trusts\[ **F**\]. 

 **Clinical implementation: Nixon** and **Coleman**, who are members of the NHS England Stop the Pressure Programme, are supporting national implementation in England and have ongoing dialogue with the All Wales Tissue Viability Nurses Forum who agreed a national Wales roll\-out \[ **F**\]. Clinical implementation requires a major commitment by healthcare organisations \(consultation, changes to local policies, guidelines and nursing documentation, training large numbers staff etc.\). To date PURPOSE\-T has been fully/partially implemented in at least 16 acute Trusts/Health Boards, 3 combined community/acute and 17 community Trusts, 8 hospices and 1 nursing home, impacting thousands of patients daily \[ **F**\]. 

 **Clinical outcomes:** early adopters of PURPOSE\-T have reported positive outcomes on care processes including improved rates of risk assessment and clinical outcomes \(i.e. reduced PU prevalence\) \[ **G**\]. For example, 4 consecutive annual prevalence studies in a large teaching hospital\(circa 1,400 patients\) indicates: 

1.  sustained reduction in Category ≥1 hospital acquired PUs – 8.02% \(2012\), 7.6% \(2013\)pre\-implementation and 4.91% \(2014\), 3.81%\(2015\) post implementation, 

1.  improved proportion of patients assessed on admission – 80% \(2012\), 78% \(2013\)  pre\-implementation and 80% \(2014\), 91% 2015\) post implementation, 

1.  improved proportion of those at risk with a care plan – 74% \(2012\), 86% \(/2013\)  pre\-implementation and 92% \(2014\), 90% \(2015\) post\-implementation \[ **G**c\]. 

 **BELGIUM QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT:** Based upon our risk factor systematic review evidence \[ **6**\], Smet and colleagues developed a risk assessment approach for Belgium, involving assessment of only two risk factors of skin status \(i.e. presence of Category ≥1 PU\) and immobility/inactivity \[ **H**, **C**\]. 

 They introduced the Belgium tool into Ghent and Leuven hospitals and reported: 

 a\) increased compliance with daily risk assessment from 50% to 85%, 

 b\) similar proportions of patients identified as at risk \(i.e. no additional resource implications but with improved clinical outcomes including: annual prevalence in Ghent hospital was 5.27% in 2015, 4.01% in 2018 – relative reduction 23.9%; and annual incidence in Leuven hospital was 0.62% in 2015, 0.45% in 2018 – relative reduction 27.4%\) \[ **H**\]. 

 **PUBLIC FOCUSED MEDIA:** In 2018, the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel launched a video for use by healthcare professionals, patients and the public \[ **I**\]. The content is based upon our research and systematic review evidence that skin status and immobility are key indicators of risk \[ **1**\- **3**, **6**\] \[ **C**, **I**\]. The video has subtitle/sound translations into 13 languages with over 16,000 views.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at SOAS is the first systematic analysis of the link between climate vulnerability and the cost of capital in developing countries. Based on this research, the Ministers of Finance of the Vulnerable Twenty Group of climate\-vulnerable developing countries \(V20\) planned and launched new financial instruments in collaboration with international partners to address this problem. The V20 Ministers of Finance agreed with the International Monetary Fund to work on a V20\-IMF Joint Action Agenda and invited SOAS to write a background paper. The research also had impact on various international financial institutions including the World Bank, where it contributed to the development of a “Sovereign ESG Data Portal” to encourage and facilitate further analysis and improved data quality in this field. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Climate\-vulnerable developing countries are most exposed to the physical impacts of climate change, including an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves, as well as chronic impacts, such as worsening water stress or a sea\-level rise. These countries also tend to lack the financial resources to mitigate risks and adapt to climate change by investing in climate\-resilient infrastructure and other resilience\-enhancing measures. 

 Research conducted at SOAS between 2017 and 2019 represents the first systematic analysis of the relationship between climate vulnerability and the cost of capital in developing countries. The initial research **\[3.1\]** was conducted in 2017\-2018 by an interdisciplinary team comprising Prof Gerhard Kling \(Professor of International Business and Management at SOAS until August 2019\), Prof Victor Murinde \(AXA Professor in Global Finance\) and Dr Ulrich Volz \(Reader in Economics\) together with Yuen Lo \(MSc student and RA in 2018\). A report based on this research was launched in London **\[3.2\]** by SOAS, Imperial College and the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\). To investigate the impact of climate vulnerability on sovereign bond yields, the research by SOAS applied econometric analysis using measures of climate vulnerability and social preparedness for the impacts of climate change along with a series of macroeconomic control variables. The sample analysed comprised 46 countries, including 25 members of the V20 group of climate vulnerable countries, over the period 1996\-2016. The research found that the incremental debt cost due to higher climate vulnerability, for the V20 countries, exceeded USD 62 billion over this period. The research also found that a lack of social readiness, which includes education and infrastructure, has a negative and significant effect on bond yields, implying that social and physical investments can mitigate climate risk\-related debt costs and help to stabilise the cost of debt for vulnerable countries. The research hence recommended greater investment in climate resilience in vulnerable countries. It also highlighted ways in which international cooperative efforts to measure, monitor, and transfer climate risks will provide an opportunity to prevent a deterioration of sovereign borrowing capacity in affected countries. Bob Buhr, Charles Donovan and Natalie Pullin from Imperial College contributed the country case studies to this report. The framing was developed jointly by SOAS and Imperial College. 

 Follow\-up research conducted in 2019 by Kling, Volz, Murinde and Sibel Ayas \(Visiting Researcher at SOAS in 2019\) showed that the cost of capital problem also extends to businesses in vulnerable developing countries **\[3.3\]**. In particular, it investigated the effect of climate\-related risks on firms’ cost of capital and access to finance both theoretically and empirically. First, the paper developed a theoretical model that shows how climate vulnerability could affect firms’ cost of capital and access to finance. Second, the paper examined this issue econometrically, using panel data of 15,265 firms in 71 countries over the period 1999\-2017. The research showed that on average the cost of corporate debt in high\-risk countries is 0.68 percentage points higher than in low\-risk countries because of climate vulnerability. The research hence highlighted the urgency of scaling up investments in adaptation that can mitigate vulnerability risks and demonstrated that climate\-vulnerable developing economies need international support through innovative risk transfer mechanisms that would facilitate private and public investments. 

 This has led to further policy\-oriented research, externally funded by the International Network for Sustainable Financial Policy Insights, Research, and Exchange \(INSPIRE\) \(2019\-2020, USD 30,000, GBP21,768\) **\[3.4, 3.5\]** by Volz and Jeanne Stampe \(Senior Fellow at the SOAS Centre for Sustainable Finance\) co\-authored by interlocutors at the Asian Development Bank Institute \(John Beirne, Nuobu Renzhi\), risk data firm Four Twenty Seven \(Natalie Ambrosio Preudhomme, Emilie Mazzacurati\) and WWF Singapore \(Adrian Fenton\) to further develop the understanding of the macrofinancial impacts of climate change on vulnerable countries, and develop policy recommendations. It also led to commissioned research jointly undertaken with the V20 Secretariat \(Sara James Ahmed\) to develop proposals for how the IMF can support V20 countries **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research led to 1\) direct policy actions by the Ministers of Finance of the Vulnerable Twenty Group \(V20\) of 48 climate\-vulnerable developing countries that are home to 1.2 billion people. It also 2\) influenced the work of several international financial organisations; 3\) led the UK government to commission a study on the role of climate risk transparency in preparation of COP26, and 4\) led to an award of funding by a research network aiming to support central banks and supervisors in their work to manage climate risk and mobilise finance to support the transition to a sustainable economy through innovative research. 5\) the research was picked up by a wide range of international media and thereby contributed to raising awareness of the problem in business, finance, civil society and public policy. 

####  1\) Influencing the V20 policy agendas and action on green financing 

 The initial research **\[3.1, 3.2\]** was commissioned by the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\) in collaboration with the V20. The resulting policy report was launched in London on 2 July 2018. The report’s findings were referred to in a Ministerial Communique after a meeting of the V20 Ministers of Finance at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and IMF in October 2018. Urging states to act fast, the Communique states: “According to a July 2018 UNEP\-mandated report, developed further to the V20 Ministers’ focus on the development policy consequences of green financing, climate change risks could severely penalize V20 economies with 1 dollar of additional costs due to climate vulnerability for every 10 dollars paid in interest. That penalty will double within the coming decade due to rising climate risks with concrete negative consequences for our growth and development prospects.” **\[5.1 p1\]**. 

 Volz was subsequently invited to present the report’s findings to a meeting of the V20 Finance Ministers at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(COP\) in Katowice in December 2018. The V20 Finance Ministers further discussed the report’s policy implications at a Ministerial Dialogue at the Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and IMF in April 2019. The press release makes direct reference to the research findings on the cost of climate vulnerability: “In the last ten years, climate vulnerability has cost V20 countries an additional US$62 billion in interest payments alone, \[…\] reducing countries’ ability to invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.” **\[5.2 p1\]**. and announced in a press release that they would launch new financial instruments. In response to the problem identified in the research, the V20 press release announced an ambitious programme of new financial instruments, in collaboration with international partners such as the World Bank and other multilateral development banks \(MDBs\). Proposals include an “Accelerated Financing Mechanism \(AFM\) for Maximal Resilience & a 100% Renewable Energy Transition to upscale existing risk mitigation tools, guarantees and blended finance facilities” in addition to “a new menu of instruments within MDBs and other development banks for adaptation, resilience and renewable energy projects.” **\[5.2 p2\]**. Such instruments would ensure continued global economic growth in the face of increasing threats from climate change. Work by the V20 on the AFM is still ongoing, and in 2020, the V20 Secretariat commissioned a concept update paper for the AFM, again with reference to the project’s research. 

 The Ministerial Brief of the same meeting also refers to the cost of capital problem identified by the research: “A new financing mechanism proposed for access by V20 members facing capital challenges with adaptation and mitigation projects serving V20 goals that are inhibited by higher relative costs of capital due to interest rates and debt maturity/tenures.” **\[5.3 p1\]**. Moreover, the V20 Ministers agreed on Workplan Priorities including “Address high costs of capital and mismatch of loan maturities to enable more private & public climate investments” and “Follow\-up work on UNEP report on climate risk implications for cost of capital \(V20 Regional Consultations in 2019\-20\)”. **\[5.4\]**. 

 To translate these workplan priorities into action, during New York Climate Week in September 2019, the V20 announced the launch of a Sustainable Insurance Facility to protect micro, small and medium\-sized enterprises in vulnerable economies. In the announcement, the V20 referred again explicitly to our research findings **\[5.5 p5\]**. The research also contributed to a dialogue between the V20 and the IMF. In May 2020, the V20 Secretariat commissioned Volz to lead a study for the V20 to support the development of a V20\-IMF Joint Action Agenda on Transition Risks and Climate\-related Financial and Fiscal Stability **\[3.7\]**. 

####  2\) Influencing international organisations to improve climate related financial risk management 

 The research has influenced the work of several international financial organisations in this area. Notably, the research instigated follow\-up research at the World Bank Group on how climate and environmental, social and governance \(ESG\) factors are incorporated into both credit rating agencies’ scoring and ESG index composition. Specifically, it informed the World Bank’s methodology for looking into how natural capital wealth is incorporated into sovereign bond pricing. It contributed to the development of a Sovereign ESG Data Portal launched by the World Bank in October 2019 to encourage and facilitate further analysis and improve data quality in this field **\[5.6\]**. It also led to work by the World Bank on a proposal for a “TCFD for Sovereigns”, analogous to the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures \(TCFD\) **\[5.7\].** Building on the SOAS research, the Interamerican Development Bank \(IDB\) conducted internal analysis on the impact of climate risk on the cost of capital with a focus on Latin American and Caribbean countries. The research also led the IDB to consider how to integrate climate change into its risk analysis framework and “prompted a preliminary investigation on the IDB credit rating to its sovereign exposure in the region.” **\[5.8\]**. The research also influenced the work of international bodies such as the Global Commission on Adaptation, where it “reinforced \[an\] emphasis on the urgent need to strengthen the capacities of finance ministries and central banks in mitigating and managing macro\-fiscal and financial sector risks related to climate change” **\[5.9\]**. 

####  3\) Influencing the UK government as host of COP26 

 In response to the research findings, in May 2020 the UK’s Department for International Development \(DFID, now Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, FCDO\) commissioned a study by Climate Finance Advisors, Benefit LLC on Understanding the Role of Climate Risk Transparency on Capital Pricing for Developing Countries **\[5.10a, 5.10c\]**. With this, DFID tried to obtain a better understanding of how greater transparency around climate risks may affect the cost of capital in climate vulnerable countries, the problem identified in our research. The study was also intended to help inform the UK government’s policies aimed at improving the framework conditions for scaling up private financing for adaptation and mitigation in vulnerable countries, in preparation of the 26th UN Conference of the Parties \(COP26\) on Climate Change. DFID invited Volz to join an Expert Review Panel to advise on this study. The COP26 and its preparations were delayed by a year as a result of COVID\-19 and will now take place in November 2021 **\[5.10b\]**. The project’s research is cited in the preparatory report, which was published in November 2020 **\[5.10c, pp11, 22\]**. 

####  4\) Externally funded follow\-up research with the Asian Development Bank Institute endorsed by ASEAN 

 The initial research **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]** led to the award of peer\-reviewed funding in May 2019 by the International Network for Sustainable Financial Policy Insights, Research and Exchange \(INSPIRE\), an independent research network hosted by the ClimateWorks Foundation and the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, established to support the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System \(NGFS\) in its work to manage climate risk and mobilise finance to support the transition to a sustainable economy through research. The new research **\[3.4, 3.5\]** was conducted by Volz and research partners at the Asian Development Bank Institute, WWF Singapore, and 427 in 2019\-2020. The report, which included a chapter on macrofinancial risk in the ten countries forming the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \(ASEAN\), and its policy recommendations were endorsed in a foreword by the Deputy Secretary General of ASEAN **\[3.4\]**. The report **\[3.4\]** was originally scheduled to be launched at the Annual Conference of the NGFS hosted by the Bank of Thailand in Bangkok in April 2020. Due to COVID\-19, the conference had to be cancelled and the launch was delayed until the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in October 2020. 

####  5\) Influencing media discourse and raising public awareness 

 The research findings were widely reported on in the media, generating almost 60 pieces of global coverage, including by The Economist **\[5.11 pp1\-3\]**, the Financial Times **\[5.11 p4\]**, Reuters **\[5.11 pp5\-6\]**, and UN Climate Change News **\[5.11 pp7\-8\]**. This contributed to rising awareness of the problem in business, finance, civil society and public policy, but also highlighted the potential for virtuous circles: that low cost or affordable borrowing by vulnerable countries to invest in climate adaptation will “help bring down the cost of their borrowing” **\[5.11 p6\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research carried out by Professor Kehinde Andrews demonstrated the need for systemic changes in education to address structural racism against people of African descent and led to impact on three levels: 

-  Influencing European Union \(EU\), United Nations \(UN\) and United States \(US\) policy changes towards education by providing recommendations to policymakers on how to amend legislation to improve the national curricula by including history of People of African Descent and European colonialism; 

-  Aiding educators in British schools and colleges, as well as universities across the globe, to help them recognise the Eurocentric nature of the standard curricula and radically alter the way they teach; 

-  Supporting non\-governmental organisations, such as Each One Teach One \(EOTO\) and Christian Aid, in enhancing the conceptual frameworks used to develop internal policies and outreach, thus empowering people of African descent.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The work of Andrews investigated the highly problematic areas of education across Europe and especially in the UK. In particular, Andrews challenged the Eurocentric assumptions that perpetuated a flawed understanding of race and thus prevented comprehensive resistance to racism. 

 Andrews’ monograph, *Back to Black* \[R01\], and a peer\-reviewed journal article that came out of the AHRC\-funded research project Blackness in Britain \[R02\], argued that racism is understood at the level of the nation\-state rather than as an international phenomenon. Using qualitative analysis, Andrews found that a framework that conceptualizes racism as a phenomenon that is separate from one country to another, or can be tackled at the national level, fails to address the imperial origins of the idea of race and accepts its fundamentally racist assumptions. Andrews argued that such an understanding is not only empirically and conceptually flawed, but also prevents any serious progress for Black people. Instead, his research shows that progress would be made by reshaping the way race and racism are taught, particularly in educational institutions. 

 In R01, Andrews provided a robust scholarly basis for the idea that Blackness must be defined by embracing a connection to Africa and her diaspora which cannot be contained by national borders. This contested the idea that problems of racism are confined to and must be challenged at the national level. After critically analysing primary and secondary sources concerning the long history of Black radicalism through a thorough examination of several strands of Black politics, including pan\-Africanism, Cultural Nationalism, Black Marxism and others, the book demonstrated that the ability to resist racism requires a transformation of education through reclaiming and renewing the tradition of an internationalist Black radical thought. 

 In R02, Andrews focused on Black Studies as an educational discipline that fosters an understanding of racism and Blackness that goes beyond the nation\-state. By promoting Black Studies, Andrews argued, we can challenge racism at a more fundamental level. The work offered concrete ways to create curricula that would embed the teaching of Africa and the African diaspora, with a particular focus on the legacies of colonialism. 

 In his contribution to *Decolonising the University* \[R03\], Andrews further demonstrated how universities struggle to challenge the Eurocentric curriculum in the neoliberal context and offered solutions to this problem. Using Birmingham City University’s Black Studies degree as a detailed case study, Andrews demonstrated how decolonisation of knowledge and conscious decolonisation of staffing by universities are interconnected. Andrews pointed out the paradox of the marketing success that a Black Studies degree offered to the University in a neoliberal environment that conforms to the values that the discipline seeks to oppose. This, Andrews argued, is why the Black Studies degree must consciously focus on maintaining its values within an alternative space inside the academy as well as sustaining and reinforcing the connection with the communities outside the academy. 

 In addition to demonstrating the need for a curriculum that recognises Black perspective and embeds the teaching of empire and colonialism, Andrews’ findings demonstrated a clear and urgent need for employing a more diverse staff base that would be able to develop stronger educational programs and maintain community \[R04\]. Andrews found that current academic theories of race run against the diverse and fluid conception of Blackness that serves as a basis to existing collective movements. This work highlighted the importance for Black communities to be able to create spaces for students to be educated with a Black Studies curriculum and be free from the negative assumptions perpetuated by many institutions, curricula, and academic frameworks.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Influencing and contributing to global policy change** 

 Andrews’ work on Black radical politics led him to be invited to three major consultation events, where Andrews presented his research on structural racism in education and the ways the current curricula must be changed \[S01\]. **This group of events have resulted in several documents that have laid the groundwork for changes in EU, UN and US legislature.** 

1.  For the first event, organised by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights \(FRA\), Andrews’ consultation as an expert contributed to the development of the FRA report ‘ *Being Black in the EU*’ \[S02\]. The report subsequently influenced European Parliament Resolution of 19 June 2020 on the anti\-racism protests following the death of George Floyd. This Resolution stated that Europe’s colonial past and role in the slave trade “ *should be recognised at EU and national level, and be addressed at institutional level and within education*”. This resolution additionally noted “ *the crucial role of education in deconstructing prejudices and stereotypes”* and that education is *“a key tool to end structural discrimination and racism in our societies*” \[S03\]. 

1.  Andrews was invited by a Member of the European Parliament to attend the multi\-day, EU\-sponsored People of African Descent \(PAD\) Week as the only representative of the Higher Education sector. The event was held in May 2018 in the European Parliament. Here, Andrews spoke about the importance of making the history of people of African Descent part of university and school curricula, which was neglected in UK and European education. He argued that these gaps could not be addressed by simple addition of separate modules into the curricula – the change needed to be more systemic. The PAD Week led directly to the EU Parliament Resolution on the Fundamental Rights of People of African Descent. 

 The EU Parliament Resolution was recognised as a “ *a historic watershed moment*” by the Chair of the European Network Against Racism, marking the first time the specific issues of racism and fundamental rights of people of African descent were recognised at the European level. The resolution means the official recognition that people of African descent have a presence in Europe and that nation states have a responsibility towards them. Andrews’ research and recommendations at the PAD Week led to the inclusion of Article 20 of the Resolution whereby the European Parliament requests “ *Member States to make the history of people of African descent part of their curricula and to present a comprehensive perspective on colonialism and slavery which recognises their historical and contemporary adverse effects on people of African descent, and to ensure that teachers are adequately trained for this task and properly equipped to address diversity in the classroom*” \[S04\]. 

 Andrews’ contributions also supported the development of the EU Commission’s conclusion paper \[S05\] that provided informal guidance to the European policymakers and the US Congressional Bill Res. 256 entitled “ *Resolution Recognizing people of African descent and Black Europeans*”. This bill was a direct response to the PAD Week as stated in its text \[S06\]. 

1.  Andrews co\-led an “ *information gathering session*” for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. His own research\-based contributions to this fact\-finding mission informed the UN report on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and racial intolerance. The report called on member states to “ *take urgent steps to ensure representative and accurate accounts of slavery, colonialism and their contemporary legacies, including in their education systems*” \[S07\]. 

 **Shaping educational policy and pedagogy** 

 Establishing the first Black Studies degree in Europe had firmly rooted Andrews and his work at the centre of the decolonisation movement. Andrews provided insight to universities across the globe \(including the University of Bremen, University of Southern California, University of Sao Paolo, and University of Bristol\), equipping these institutions with the tools they need to incorporate changes to their curricula. For example, Maynooth University found that Andrews’ research contributions resulted in “ *improved attention to questions of race and discrimination*” by University management and improved conditions for applying for funding and sustaining the discussion on racism in education. 

 Due to the strength of his research in the area of racism and education, Andrews was invited by the Bernie Grant Trust to collaborate in developing a resource for teachers to include Black history in their everyday teaching. The material included hitherto ignored struggles from the recent Black history of the 1980s and 1990s. Andrews’ research was utilised to specifically understand “ *how items from the extensive Bernie Grant Archive could be linked directly to Key Stages in the national curriculum in a way that made it easy for teachers to use the material*.” 

 Andrews, along with undergraduate students from Birmingham City University’s Black Studies degree, ran two workshops at London’s BSix sixth form college. Here, he introduced students and teachers to his research and encouraged them to rethink their approach to education. One BSix teacher noted that Andrews’ workshops “ *had a considerable impact on my attempt to create a parallel curriculum to A Levels*.” According to one student, Andrews’ work “ *opened our eyes to the lack of representation in the educational system*” and fuelled discussions that extended outside of the classroom. Another student stated, “ *I went home to talk to my parents, and it sparked a longer conversation about Black history and how much we don’t know*” \[S08\]. 

 **Improving policies within third sector organisations** 

 Andrews facilitated workshops with several non\-governmental organisations, whose focus is on empowering people of African descent. These were Black Archives Amsterdam, Christian Aid in the UK, Centre for Social Change in South Africa, and Each One Teach One \(EOTO\) in Berlin, Germany. 

 In addition to impact from PAD week event co\-organised by EOTO and other organisations, the Project Manager at EOTO said, *“\[a\]s a result of Andrews' research and our discussions, we have started introducing ways of how African descendants can be more accurately portrayed and recognized in German systems of education, knowledge production, including recognizing positive contributions, and histories of colonialism, enslavement, and redress. This has led to several activities for People of African descent… such as our three\-day community conferences … in the German Bundestag \(2019, 600 attendees\) and the European Parliament \(2018, 150 attendees \[…\]\)*.” These events, policy debates and subsequent publications by EOTO “ *led to an increase of engagement among the Black civil society in Germany as well as to a confrontation of mainstream society with the colonial past of Germany*”. EOTO continued to work with Andrews in developing an anti\-Black racism campaign and guidelines for their Black Empowerment Academy \[S09\]. 

 According to Christian Aid’s Strategist and Chief Development Economist, Andrews’ work had been fundamental in providing a better “ *structural argument of reparations*” that “ *has been interwoven into strategy*” in the social justice activism of Christian Aid. “ *Having a credible body of work that Professor Kehinde Andrews has pioneered on Black radical thought has validated the arguments we have been trying to make and has helped to turn the corner*.” She continued, “ *whereas previous arguments of racial disparity might have been dismissed, the strength of this work has led to it not being easily dismissible*” \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Tamsin Bradley’s research has made a significant contribution towards the goal of ending violence against women and girls in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal through a three\-stage process of increasing awareness, informing programmes and initiatives, and increasing the resilience of women at community level. According to the World Health Organisation around 30% of all women and girls have experienced some form of violence, and in the countries covered by this research, many women have experienced multiple forms of such violence. Violence against women is now acknowledged by sustainable development goal 5, as a global problem that needs urgent attention. Working directly with affected communities, this research has established the value of peer networks for resilience building and helped to bring such groups into existence, which have become part of the strategies of women’s rights organizations, international agencies and local governments. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Over the last two decades, Bradley has developed a world\-leading profile of research on some of the most intractable problems facing individuals and communities in the developing world. Her research in South Asia, commencing in 2000, has addressed the sources and structures of violence that hold women back from greater participation in development efforts, and often continue to explicitly victimise them. Her earlier work addressed the need to refine understandings of religious sensibilities and practices in such contexts \(R5\). It used interdisciplinary perspectives to cast light on the complex balance between community religious beliefs, religious understandings in the practices of development NGOs, and the link between these dimensions of understanding and violence expressed through practices around bridal dowries \(R4\). 

 Bradley’s more recent work \(2017 onwards\), grant\-funded through the UK Department for International Development and the Economic and Social Research Council \(G2\), has pursued the possibility of strategies for mitigating harm to women in contexts of poverty and displacement. The research has demonstrated empirically how significant the risk of interpersonal violence is to women in such circumstances, and began to develop concrete, community\-based approaches to reducing that risk. To do this successfully, Bradley drew on her preceding experience of designing optimal means of researching these highly sensitive issues \(G2\). Her model of mixed\-methods data collection at community level uses local culturally\-respected organisations as points of entry, recognising their role as potential gatekeepers, and building positive relations to facilitate the lowering of such barriers. Research on the ground can then be undertaken by selected local researchers, recruited and trained by Bradley to be sensitive to the context, and to deploy a range of open\-ended qualitative approaches \(R2\). In\-depth investigative conversation with individuals is used alongside a sensitive approach to gathering wider survey data, to give greater understanding of the extent and complex nature of the problem of violence within communities. 

 The first of two recent projects led by Bradley \(2015\-2017\) was *VAWG: Violence Against Women and Girls in South Asia* \(R2, G1\). It explored whether women earning an income results in greater resilience to violence and an ultimate reduction in it. The project sought to understand and document the impact income brought to women’s lives across different work contexts: in Pakistan home\-based workers, in Nepal construction and sex workers, and in Myanmar garment workers. The findings generated a rich and complex picture of the role income plays in building self\-esteem and confidence, especially when women are able to come together in peer\-support networks. What they also showed was that income alone does not reduce violence, and indeed, that women who out\-earn their husbands become more vulnerable to violence from them. 

 The second and third recent projects, *Narratives of violence: the impact of internal displacement on violence against women in Nepal and Myanmar* \(2017\-19, G2\) *, Climate Change and the Environmental Determinants of Violence and Mental Distress in Fragile contexts: Ethiopia, Myanmar and Nepal* \(2020\-2021, G3\), sought to understand the chain of impact from environmental disasters to the displacement of communities, on into widespread violence against women and girls. It also sought to gauge the level of awareness and response to such violence present in organisations delivering humanitarian relief. The project was methodologically innovative in its recruitment of a number of women from within the affected communities to act as “displacement narrators”. Their input enabled the project to get a longitudinal overview of how women cope with the extended aftermath of displacement. 

 The data gathered clearly showed that violence against women increases sharply following periods of environmental displacement. The quality of data pinpointed the way in which women took or created opportunities to gather and share incidences of violence and explore options. Prior to this research, such spaces were invisible to local development organisations and government officials mandated to improve the lives of women and girls. The research also demonstrated that, despite notional high\-level commitments, there was in practice an almost complete lack of humanitarian response to violence against women and girls \(R1\). 

 The findings from both projects point to the vital importance of women\-only peer support groups in fostering resilience and resistance to violence, and highlight the critical need to ensure these peer networks are linked to specialist women’s organisations and social mobilisers who can offer support and advocacy. In addition, the findings show how essential a committed enabling environment is, consisting of responsive donors, local government and judicial officials. The findings also point to the urgent need for greater mainstreaming of a sensitised lens to violence against women and girls in development in both responses to displacement and economic empowerment programmes \(R1\-6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Bradley’s funded projects were designed to integrate stakeholder engagement and pathways to impact from the outset. Data\-collection tools and overarching research questions were framed and finalised in active consultation with country\-level advisory groups made up of both academic and non\-academic stakeholders. Through an active process of workshopping these issues, the project team secured interest, trust and engagement with the projects and their outcomes. As the projects developed, the team, supported by a dedicated research\-uptake consultant, kept in touch with these groups, passing on and explaining key findings and conclusions. 

 This active engagement helped secure three dimensions of transformative impact: 

 Firstly, **increasing awareness**. Through their engagement with Bradley’s research, the size and scope of the problem of violence against women and girls in Myanmar, Nepal and Bangladesh has been made clearer to a wide range of groups, including development practitioners, development studies scholars and students, women’s rights organizations, and international agencies such as the United Nations Population Fund \(UNFPA\). For example, the Women’s Rehabilitation Centre, based in Nepal, found Bradley’s research to be essential in providing visibility of the problem of gender\-based violence in the region, and thus supporting their advocacy programme. Their Monitoring and Evaluation Officer stated \(in 2020\) that *“the findings from the research have put forward different critical points highlighting the need of specific services and support to the victims in the post\-disaster situation.”* The research had made clear, for example, the extent to which responses to such crises need to take account of differences in *“level of vulnerability among women due to castes, poverty, different education levels, etc.”* \(S6\) Another Nepal\-based group, Women for Human Rights \(WHR\), reported \(in 2020\) that the research and its findings *“have influenced and shaped the thinking of our organisation not least in terms of helping us articulate the importance of what we do better and with more confidence”* \(S3\). 

 Beyond supporting awareness, the research findings have also **informed specific programmes and initiatives.** Bradley offered evidence\-based recommendations on effective responses and solutions to prevent violence against women and girls. The UNFPA in Myanmar worked with its downstream partner, the Metta Foundation, in Kachin State, to formulate initiatives \(2017 to present\). A senior gender advisor at the UNFPA communicated the findings to the foundation and they implemented Bradley’s recommendations, creating peer networks, organised around a micro\-finance programme which benefits women. She noted that Bradley’s research *“proved to be exceptionally useful to support evidence based programme design.”* \(S1\) In Nepal, the WHR, with a membership of 100,000 single women, also adopted Bradley’s research recommendation of creating peer networks in order to build resilience among women to better resist violence and seek justice \(S4\). 

 Through these initiatives, the research findings have achieved their most important impact, by **increasing the resilience of women at community level.** In **Myanmar**, around 50 peer groups were created in 2016 by the Metta Foundation, consisting of approximately 8\-10 women in each. The Foundation confirmed in September 2020 that the groups were still operating successfully. They reported that *“as a result of these groups being created the women involved reported feeling more confident and resilient to the challenges they may face and more able to help other women in their community. The help and support given commonly includes responses to domestic violence”* \(S2\). 

 The Foundation went on to observe that *“The fact that these groups are still in existence and fully utilised by their membership evidences the value of a peer support approach embedded as part of programmes focused on improving women’s economic empowerment and resilience to violence. Building the psychological and collective resilience of women can be seen through these peer groups \(as a result of the research findings\) and are critical in ending instances of abuse”* \(S2\). 

 Given the cascading impact of the resilience generated in these groups it is hard to accurately capture the number of women impacted. However, given the size of the villages and the groups, we can safely estimate that approximately 480\-500 women benefitted through the membership of the peer networks. Potentially a further 1000 women have benefitted through cascaded impact. According to the Metta Foundation, Bradley’s peer network approach *“is even more critical given that informal justice \(by ethnic leaders, almost all are male\) is still strong in the area making it exceptionally challenging for survivors of domestic abuse to achieve an end to it through justice mechanisms.”* \(S2\). 

 The potential to work to overcome gender inequalities has been shown in **Nepal**, where the research was able to engage with a recent concerted effort \(during 2019\) to recruit more women into local government. Many women who previously worked as social mobilisers are now in office. Working in this context, Bradley supported the work of 10 ‘displacement narrators’ in Kathmandu \(Middle Hill Area\) and the Eastern Terai region. The narrators were recruited, mentored and further supported by the national women’s organisation WHR. A year into the project the narrators felt confident in facilitating peer networks, making them safe for women to share stories of violence. The peer networks consist of around 15 to 20 women per group. On the recommendation of the research findings, they have been linked by WHR to female local government representatives who are then able to follow up on cases of abuse. Up to 200 women have benefitted from membership. The WHR reports that the groups *“are offering ongoing peer support to group members. Members of these peer networks have confirmed that they have helped \[the women\] to work through their challenges and share instances of violence and/or harassment that they endure”* \(S4\). 

 Reflecting on the direct impact of these networks in 2020, the director of WHR stated: 

 *“Resilience among women has been improved through the creation of these groups. Local government and organisational support has followed and channels for recourse to justice when instances of domestic violence occur function better. This level of coordination brings optimism that prevalence rates will and are in decline. The emergence of Covid has made such networks even more important as we are hearing of many more cases of domestic violence as a result of lock down restrictions.”* \(S4\). 

 One narrator reported the impact she has experienced and witnessed as follows: *“In the time of disaster and other emergencies, women and children are hard hit and all the safety nets that the women have built become fragile and collapse. However, it is really important to acknowledge that the women are the frontline responders ... The opportunity to share the sorrows of VAW, supporting each other as an individual and as networks is important as part of social and mental wellbeing of these women with also institutional support accessibility.”* \(S4\) Inspired by Bradley’s research, the WHR confirmed in 2020 that they were systematically facilitating peer networks across their programming in Nepal and in particular as part of their Covid response. Given the reach of this national organisation, the impact is now being cascaded to the WHR’s extensive national membership. 

 Impact in **Bangladesh** is at an earlier stage due to the more recent start of research there \(2019\). However, the findings have already been used by Foreign Commonwealth Development Office gender advisors and by UNWomen to campaign for greater visibility of violence against women, and also to leverage greater government policy attention and commitment. Displacement narrators are in place in the Char region and continually report on the changing situation. The community stories captured by the narrators have been used by the FCDO in monitoring the impact of Covid \(S5\). 

 Underscoring the significance of Bradley’s research impact in a range of contexts, a UNFPA Senior Gender Advisor states that as a consequence of the findings, *“women are coming together \[through the peer networks\] to discuss issues in common as well as laying the foundation for increased participation and leadership”* in order to achieve greater empowerment \(S1\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The self\-directed misuse of anabolic androgenic steroids \(AAS\) and other image and performance enhancing drugs \(collectively referred to as \(IPEDs\)\) within the general population is now recognised within public policy as a cause for concern. Our research over the last 20 years has, identified and quantified the significant health and social harms associated with this form of drug use; identified the barriers to health service provision; and informed legislative change and health service guidance. Policy changes have made a tangible impact on health\-related provision at a community level. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Public Health Institute \(PHI\) at Liverpool John Moores University \(LJMU\) is at the forefront of research relating to the anabolic androgenic steroid and associated drug misuse amongst the general population. The topic has historically been under\-researched and largely unaddressed within health policy. Academic staff at PHI, together with a range of stakeholders and academic collaborators have undertaken a programme of research investigating the extent, characteristics, and responses to this form of drug misuse. 

 An innovative longitudinal surveillance system of needle and syringe programme \(NSP\) provision for injectors of illicit drugs, developed and implemented at PHI \(2000\- present\), provided the first indications of the extent of this drug misuse phenomenon. This new population of injectors was identified as having different health risk profiles and health service requirements to other injecting populations such as users of heroin \[1\]. Until the publication of research, conducted in partnership with Public Health England and Public Health Wales, this population were not recognised as being at significant risk of contracting blood borne viruses \(BBVs\) such as human immunodeficiency virus \(HIV\) and hepatitis C. Our research \(2011\-present\) identified HIV prevalence was at similar levels \(between 1% and 2%\) to those previously identified in injectors of heroin and other psychoactive drugs \[2\]. Compared to the general population, elevated prevalence of other BBVs were also found. Risk behaviours such as high levels of cocaine use, previous imprisonment and self\-reported injecting injuries were identified, combined with low levels of primary healthcare engagement \[3\]. 

 Accompanying qualitative work with anabolic–androgenic steroids \(AAS\) users gave an insight into the feelings of stigma and the mistrust of health practitioners amongst users of AAS. Furthermore, a high variability in both the scope and quality of available services was identified \[4\]. 

 A complimentary programme of research sought to identify the extent of adulterated and potentially harmful products being used by this population. In addition to identifying the extent of over the counter nutritional supplements contaminated by AAS, collaborating with colleagues at Aalborg University in Denmark, samples of illicitly manufactured melanotan II \(a peptide hormone commonly used in conjunction with AAS for tanning the skin\) were purchased and analysed. Our findings showed discrepancies in the content and purity of active ingredients between products with similar or identical packaging \(between 4.32mg and 8.84mg\), with levels of impurities up to 5.9%. This work highlighted the poor quality of illicitly produced and purchased IPEDs. 

 The extent of polypharmacy within this population was confirmed in a metasynthesis conducted with colleagues at the University of Oslo \[6\]. This work provided further evidence of the complex array of risk behaviours within this population of drug misusers. 

 Findings from the research at PHI have provided an insight into a range of clandestine risk behaviours together with associated drug\-related harms. Research is ongoing, in the form of a unique Integrated Monitoring System \(IMS\) in the Liverpool City Region, continuing evaluation of service provision in Wales and collaborative surveillance with Public Health England.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Based on our research and expertise in the field of injecting drug use, including AAS and associated IPEDs, we were commissioned to support the development of NICE guidance relating to NSP provision. Systematic review and survey analysis, to update the previous evidence review conducted by PHI \(NG18\), together with an evidence review relating to IPED use highlighted the evidence gaps regarding service engagement and behaviour change amongst IPED users. Guidance for service development and future research is solely based on research undertaken and published by PHI \(SOURCE 1 page 22\). 

 McVeigh presented research findings on IPED use to the NICE Public Health Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse Prevention in January 2016 \(SOURCE 2\). Together with the subsequent written testimony, this was the sole evidence used to inform the NICE guidance \(NG64\) to make the recommendation for drug prevention information to be provided in gyms \(NG64; Recommendation 1.5.1\) and for effectiveness and cost effectiveness research to be undertaken \(NG 64; Research recommendation 6\). 

 Based on PHI’s expertise and ongoing research into IPED use, we led a group of expert researchers and health practitioners in developing ‘Turning Evidence into Practice’ guidance for Public Health England \(SOURCE 3\). Nine of the fifteen sources of evidence had been produced by PHI \(SOURCE 4\).  The briefing was initially distributed to support commissioning of drug services in Local Authorities and Clinical Commissioning Groups across England. Subsequently, it has been disseminated to the rest of the United Kingdom to both commissioners and service providers, helping shape service delivery \(SOURCE 5\). 

 Drug misuse and dependence: UK guidelines on clinical management is the definitive set of guidance for healthcare professionals; providers and commissioners of treatment for people who misuse or are dependent on drugs; professional and regulatory bodies; and service users and carers \(SOURCE 6\). The 2017 edition was the first to include guidance relating to the use of AAS and other IPEDs. McVeigh was commissioned to provide a review and synopsis, on which the included guidance was based \(SOURCE 7\). These guidelines, together with the specific research outputs produced by PHI, have influenced and guided drugs services and BBV prevention initiatives related to the use of AAS and other IPEDs in the United Kingdom \(SOURCE 5\). 

 The UK Drug Strategy published in 2017 \(SOURCE 8\) was the first drug strategy to explicitly highlight the use of IPEDs. The strategy raises concerns relating to the reluctance of drug users to engage with services, the transmission of BBVs, physiological and psychological harms and the threat of adulterated products within the illicit market. The Strategy only cites one source of evidence for these findings, which is the ‘Turning Evidence into Practice briefing \(SOURCE 4\) led by researchers at PHI. 

 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs \(ACMD\) have recently reviewed legislation related to AAS and associated IPEDs. McVeigh and Hope were co\-opted to the group, which considered the evidence and made recommendations to the Home Office in 2019 relating to legal status, drug prevention, drug treatment and research priorities. Our research constituted the academic foundation of the review, including sections on prevalence of use, characteristics and typologies of users, motivations for use, socioeconomic factors, adulterated products and the illicit market. McVeigh also presented these findings at the public evidence\-gathering day held on 26th September 2019 \(SOURCE 9\). 

 IPED use in the United Kingdom is an emerging public health issue that PHI have identified, quantified and publicised through research publications, policy briefings and through the media. The IPED research published by PHI and colleagues is both diverse and novel, incorporating different methodologies to address epidemiology, health policy and behavioural sciences. The impact of the research can be identified at the practice level with individual practitioners being influenced and guided by evidence briefings \( **SOURCE 5**\) and at a policy and strategy level where evidence from PHI research has directly influenced population health strategies \( **SOURCE 10**\) together with changes to legislation and development of social policy \( **SOURCE 9**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Andrew Grainger’s research on, and conceptualisation of, the topic of trade facilitation has informed debate at global, regional and national policy levels surrounding how best to reduce friction between public and private sector stakeholders as well as improve upon the quality of controls for the benefit of wider society and business competitiveness. This includes informing the establishment of the World Trade Organisation’s ‘Trade Facilitation Agreement’ and the UK’s obligations, with regards to the private sector, under that agreement, including the formation of a national trade facilitation committee and developing content for the International Trade Centre’s training course for understanding and implementing the agreement. Other impacts include providing guidance to the World Bank\-funded implementation of National Trade Information Portals and informing the Brexit preparations of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\), the Office for Product Safety and Standard \(OPSS\) and HM Revenue and Customs \(HMRC\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Grainger’s research, conducted at the University of Nottingham, has explored and contributed to the conceptualisation of the field of trade facilitation, specifically by cutting across the disciplines of politics and international relations; law; public administration; business; information technology; as well as transport, logistics and operations management. Key findings from Grainger’s research include demonstrating the importance of cutting red tape in international trade and removing friction between businesses and government agencies. It has also shown the need to make borders work better whilst safeguarding business competitiveness and societal expectations. 

 In 2011, Grainger argued for a new understanding and conceptualisation of trade facilitation by taking a more operational, bottom\-up perspective of the topic alongside the traditional top\-down premise previously advocated **\[1\]**. This approach provided a strong case for an interdisciplinary research agenda and questioned whether current institutions, concerned with trade and border controls, had the necessary capabilities to apply themselves to the more operational aspects associated with international trade. Grainger continued this research in 2014 but with greater focus on the role of the private sector and how it can best be consulted. This research argued for the importance of developing suitable institutions to ensure that the friction experienced by business operators is adequately identified and remedied. This approach would guarantee that the resources invested into trade facilitation are put to optimal effect and that the quality of implemented trade facilitation measures are continuously monitored and assessed **\[4\]**. 

 Much of Grainger’s research has been commissioned by organisations seeking to gain a better understanding of both trade facilitation as a broad topic and specific operational and policy aspects of the field. For example, **\[2\]** was commissioned and published by the World Bank and demonstrated how dialogue between the private and public sectors can identify opportunities for reform, how a climate of shared responsibility can be encouraged, and can be used to gain a systemwide understanding of complex international trade operations. **\[2\]** also showed that the interests of particular communities can vary and, therefore, Grainger argued that guidance from dedicated trade facilitation committees, often with government sponsorship, and better substantiated research, can help identify best solutions and fine\-tune reform programs. 

 Grainger’s research continued by applying his bottom\-up approach to develop a methodology that engages public and private sector stakeholders across the supply chain. In 2013, Grainger used this method to examine the cost of importing meat into the UK with the support of the UK’s Association of Port Health Authorities \(APHA\) and the UK’s International Meat Trade Association \(IMTA\) **\[7\]**. The study, which was directly informed by businesses, involved a detailed review of current import procedures applicable to importing meat into the UK from outside of the EU and an in\-depth study of the trade and customs compliance costs. As such, it untangled the many legal and operational complexities associated with international trade compliance and measured the associated costs. 

 In 2015, Grainger was commissioned by the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade to address MEP questions about the significance of customs and trade facilitation type issues in contemporary trade policy and EU practices. **\[5\]** addresses those questions and, by examining the relation between EU trade and customs policies, demonstrates explicitly why customs and trade facilitation must be part of INTA’s formal remit. **\[5\]** argues that the development of Customs specific performance indicators could achieve much greater co\-ordination between stakeholders. The success of this project led to another commissioned piece, in 2017, examining ‘The role of border management in implementing trade policy goals’ **\[6\]**. This research demonstrated how trade facilitation principles help reduce the cost of cross\-border trade in goods while safeguarding regulatory control objectives and how appropriate border management practice is integral to trade facilitation. The study demonstrated how border management can be improved through coordination, cooperation and integration within the respective border agencies \(intra\-agency\), between the many border agencies \(interagency\) and internationally \(with colleagues across the border and EU trade partners\). Specific recommendations were made on the development of suitable EU institutions in aid of trade facilitation as well as for future research.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The work of Grainger has had significant impact on informing policy makers and practitioners, and thus helps them consider relevant measures to reduce friction between public and private sector stakeholders in the administration and control of national borders. The impact relates to multilateral, regional and bilateral \(FTA\) policy. 

 **World Trade Organisation** 

 Grainger’s conceptual research laid the foundation for his work with the World Trade Organisation \(WTO\) which led to many of the impacts detailed below. In the WTO’s 2015 World Trade Report, Grainger’s research **\[1, 4\]** was cited and used to define the concept of trade facilitation as well as the factors that would need to be considered in a prospective Trade Facilitation Agreement **\[A\]**. The WTO report, which thanks Grainger for his ‘useful comments on early drafts’, clearly demonstrates the expected benefits of the Trade Facilitation Agreement as reducing trade costs by an average of 14.3% and boosting global trade by up to USD1,000,000,000,000 per year, with the biggest gains in the poorest countries **\[A\].** The WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement was adopted by members of the WTO in February 2017 and binds member countries to adopting measures that help reduce transaction costs experienced at national borders. 

 In 2018, Grainger’s research and expertise continued to be utilised by the WTO as he produced the content for a free online eLearning course that is hosted on the website of the WTO and UNCTAD’s International Trade Centre \(ITC\) – a multilateral agency which has a joint mandate with the WTO and the UN to lend technical assistance to developing countries with focus on enabling business communities to participate fruitfully within international trade. The ITC note that they drew on Grainger’s expertise ‘on a number of occasions’ and draw particular attention to the WTO’s 2015 World Trade Report **\[A\]** which evidences that ‘much of Grainger’s conceptual work in trade facilitation is seminal’ **\[B\].** The ITC also specify that for the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement to boost global trade by USD1,000,000,000,000 per year, as is estimated, ‘a key requirement for the trade facilitation related economic benefits to be realised is that the business community in developing countries understands key trade facilitation principles and knows how to articulate its requirements to policy makers’ **\[B\]**. Therefore, Grainger’s research and expertise was used by the ITC ‘to develop the content of a dedicated online training module which aims to raise the understanding of the private sector on the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, assist businesses in developing countries to effectively advocate for trade facilitation reforms and build private sector capacity to benefit from a reformed cross\-border environment’ **\[B\].** The online course, “Introduction to the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement”, was made available in December 2018 \[ [https://learning.intracen.org/course/info.php?id=310](https://learning.intracen.org/course/info.php?id=310) *accessed 28/01/2020*\] and, as of December 2019, the course has been successfully completed by more than 593 participants from over 35 countries. The ITC note that ‘the participants feedback has been very positive and the increasing number of enrolments to each edition of the training demonstrate the relevance of this e\-learning course’ **\[B\].** 

 **World Bank** 

 From 2015 to 2017, Grainger, serving as an international project advisor, assisted World Bank funded trade facilitation projects including the implementation of National Trade Information Portals in Laos, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malawi, and Sri Lanka. Funding for these projects, as stated by PM Group’s Associate Director who oversaw the project, was provided by the World Bank as ‘all WTO members are encouraged to implement Trade Information Portals by reference to Article 1 of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. They serve as a centrally managed gateway for government agencies to publish all information necessary for businesses to be able to comply with applicable import and export procedures – this includes access to all trade tariff and customs information’ **\[G\].** 

 The PM group state that Grainger provided ‘strategic guidance’ and was relied upon ‘to run a workshop \[in Bangladesh\] with the business community and senior policy makers to advise on best practice trade facilitation principles’ **\[G\].** The guidance and expertise provided stemmed from Grainger’s conceptual research **\[2,4\].** The PM Group notes that Grainger’s ‘steer and guidance has subsequently helped shape our approach – as well as that of the World Bank – to implementing and operating the respective trade information portals. This has not only made trade compliance significantly easier for the business community, it also helped make regulatory complexity more visible. Subsequently, it became easier for policy makers \(along with donors, such as the World Bank\) to identify opportunities for further reform – for example by cutting down the volume of applicable trade and customs procedures or by implementing electronic systems to help automate and speed up border management operations’ **\[G\].** 

 **Brexit** 

 Grainger’s research informed the Brexit preparations of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) including their economic modelling to understand Brexit’s impact upon UK food supply chains and industries. This impact stemmed from Grainger’s research, **\[7\]**, which underpinned two research projects, commissioned by DEFRA, ‘to calculate Non\-Tariff Measures \(NTMs\) at the HS four\-digit level and their impact upon UK food supply chains and upon the UK fish industry once the UK departs from the European Union’ **\[F\]**.These projects were led by the Anderson’s Centre who specialise in producing economic, policy and market analysis of agriculture and collaborated closely with Grainger. They note that ‘in developing our methodology, we drew extensively on Andrew’s earlier work at the University of Nottingham. To date there is no other study within the public domain that is as comprehensive as his early work in 2013 about the cost of trade and customs procedures for goods within the agricultural domain’ **\[F\]**. The work led to the creation of specific economic models which DEFRA were able to use to input data and receive expected outcomes relating to Brexit and UK food supply chains. The specific findings of the commissioned research are subject to a non\-disclosure agreement, but the Anderson’s Centre have confirmed that the projects, which were ‘commissioned because the UK relies extensively on food imports and because non\-tariff barriers are a key feature in contemporary trade policy’ culminated in models which ‘covered all the main food categories and were used by DEFRA and other government agencies to inform their BREXIT related economic modelling’ **\[F\].** 

 Grainger’s research has also been utilised by The Institute for Government in its recommendations to the UK government regarding Brexit. In its 2017 paper, ‘Implementing Brexit: Customs’, The Institute for Government drew particular acknowledgement to Grainger’s involvement and cited his research **\[1, 8\]** to ultimately make recommendations to help the UK avoid ‘the customs cliff edge’ **\[C\].** Additionally, subsequent to the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, Grainger was requested to serve as witness in front of the Health Select Committee to advise upon the impact of Brexit on Health Supply Chains \(December 2017\) **\[D\]** and the International Trade Committee in support of its enquiry into Brexit and issues specific to Northern Ireland \(July 2018\) **\[E\]**. 

 **Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and HM Revenue and Customs** 

 Grainger’s research has been used in the activities of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy’s \(BEIS\) Regulatory Delivery, which is now superseded by the Office for Product Safety and Standards \(OPSS\) and has led to the establishment of a dedicated Trade Facilitation Expert Reference Panel \(the secretariat of which was provided by BEIS\) and subsequently the UK’s National Trade Facilitation Committee \(where the secretariat is provided by HMRC\). His research has also informed OPSS’s preparations for Brexit by informing their ideas and responses about UK product safety and market surveillance requirements and cited by HMRC in its statements to UK Parliament. 

 These impacts are evidenced in a testimonial from the CEO of the OPSS which states that Grainger’s conceptualisation of the topic of trade facilitation **\[1\]** led the BEIS to invite Grainger to share his research surrounding best practice trade facilitation measures with over 200 senior international policy makers and then with BEIS key staff members, therefore informing and providing essential understanding of the topic **\[H\].** The OPSS states that ‘concluding \[Grainger’s\] presentation and subsequent Q&A’s, a decision was taken by us to establish a dedicated Trade Facilitation Expert Refence Panel’ **\[H\].** This has involved more than 110 UK business interest associations and has ‘helped raise wider awareness of trade facilitation principles, such as those described by Dr Grainger in his work’ and engaged ‘HM Revenue and Customs, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and its Permeant Representation to the World Trade Organisation to engage in dialogue with the UK business community about how to improve regulations specific to international trade and cross\-border operations’ **\[H\]**. 

 More specifically, OPSS’s testimonial notes, ‘a particular output of the establishment of \[the\] Trade Panel was Dr Grainger’s academic work in assisting the panel members consider how to identify and address technical barriers to trade with Brazil and how this might provide a model for addressing bilateral issues with other countries. The existence of this panel helped collate UK business concerns about trade and border related procedures as well enable government to communicate with the UK business community on such matters in a more efficient way’ **\[H\]**. Furthermore, the OPSS notes that ‘following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, and the UK’s subsequent independent trade policy along with its obligations to the WTO, HMRC decided to set\-up a dedicated National Trade Facilitation Committee’ and ‘Dr Grainger also worked with OPSS in December 2017 and January 2018 to help inform ideas and responses about UK product safety and market surveillance requirements after the UK’s exit from the European Union’ **\[H\].** 

 The OPSS’ acknowledgement is referring to research, **\[1, 2, 4\],** which helped the Head of EU and International Relations, Customs ‘and other senior colleagues in familiarising \[them\]selves with: key trade facilitation principles, trade and customs related compliance costs, and the practicalities of running a National Trade Facilitation Committee in line with the expectations of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement’ **\[I\].** The Head of EU and International Relations, Customs’ testimonial also states that detailed studies, including **\[7\],** have fed into ‘our better understanding of trade compliance costs’ and were drawn upon ‘in our briefings to UK Parliament and elsewhere \(as was cited by our Chief Executive … on 23 May in his oral evidence to Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee\)’ **\[I,** **J\]**. Therefore, Dr Grainger’s research has provided essential knowledge and understanding to senior HMRC officials and, in turn, informed the information they provided to UK parliament surrounding trade compliance, specifically in regard to costings surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and what this would cost in customs declarations **\[J\]**.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Staff at Heriot\-Watt University within the Edinburgh Research Partnership in Engineering \(ERPE\) led a collaborative project with Scottish Power Energy Networks \(SPEN\) to develop the *Network Constraints Early Warning System \(NCEWS\)*, with on\-board machine learning for active asset management and maintenance/reinforcement planning of the electricity distribution system. This supports the critical pathway to enable decentralised energy networks for future low carbon renewable integration. The impacts included: 

 \(A\) Integration of NCEWS within SPEN’s network management platform enabling more confident prediction of system response, penetration of renewable generation, supporting demand management and electric vehicle \(EV\) charging. Network design, analysis and contingency planning modelling time was reduced by 67%. 

 \(B\) Increased knowledge and closer management of the increasingly active network enabled consideration and deferral of network asset renewal and delivered operational cost savings \(GBP1 billion in the SPEN distribution area alone\). 

 \(C\) NCEWS was adopted in SPEN’s Digitisation Strategy, enabling the Networks to help drive carbon reduction, increase security of supply and extend asset maintenance intervals and lifetimes. 

 \(D\) SPEN were able to leverage consequent funding to upgrade an area of their network in anticipation of electric vehicle rollout. The collaboration also won several significant national awards, including the E&T 2019 Innovation of the Year Award. 
","
# 1.  Underpinning research 

 The UK government has committed to an ambitious decarbonisation agenda, and electricity distribution network operators \(DNOs\) are mandated to prepare the electricity distribution and supply network for the integration of low\-carbon technologies from the rapid rollout of electric vehicles to embedded renewable generation \(PV panels, wind turbines and combined heat & power systems\). UK DNOs are required to operate and maintain their networks with statutory responsibility to ensure quality of supply to end\-use demand customers. They are also required to connect and accept production from new renewable energy generation schemes and to interact with third\-party demand management systems, to the satisfaction of the regulatory bodies and their investors. Active asset management is a key component to support the decentralisation of energy into local renewable energy supply and enable future growth. The UK spent GBP34 Billion between 2014\-2020 to replace aging infrastructure and to modernise, automate and reinforce the network. The complex and highly distributed network of assets previously operated in a largely passive manner, but is now active, both in supply and demand. Both old and newer distribution network assets now need to be managed in real time and maintained with increased foresight, in order to minimise constraint on new supply and to ensure quality of supply to prescribed, enforceable standards. Compliance can be costly for developers and DNOs alike.  Failure to maintain continuity of supply within defined limits will result in the regulator, OFGEM, issuing fines for consumer redress. OFGEM fined energy service providers GBP60M between 2019 and 2020. 

 SPEN is one of the UK's ‘Big 6’ electricity network and distribution operators, with responsibility for keeping the lights on for over 3 million domestic and industrial customers in Scotland, Wales and England, incorporating 128,000km of electricity network overhead lines and underground cables. Their asset base \(cables, transformers, switchgear, protection and metering\) is ageing, with large parts having been installed many decades ago, often suffering from poor observability. For example, the exact disposition and capacity of cables installed at many locations is no longer known, and physical verification is very costly and disruptive. ERPE researchers found that new embedded loads and generation, if improperly connected and managed, could cause voltage and power quality violations \[3.1\]. The rollout of smart meters \(SM\) in nearly every home presents an opportunity, but also requires conversion of massive new data\-streams into reliable, actionable information. Moreover, due to constraints from the UK's energy regulator, OFGEM, this must be done in a privacy\-preserving way for individual domestic/industrial customers. 

 The NCEWS \[P1\] Knowledge Transfer Partnership project, involving SPEN and ERPE researchers, designed a network operation and planning decision support system. There were three fundamental challenges that the research addressed. 

 **1. The network asset base is never fully described and always contains static unknowns, such as missing network cable data, and dynamic error.** The current state of the art in machine learning cannot perform to the required levels of accuracy when using data acquired from the working electricity network. ERPE researchers developed new machine learning \(ML\) techniques, specifically, deep learning and ML algorithms that could perform matching on asset paths \[3.2\]. For the first time, they were then able to accommodate the highly variable and imperfect data scenarios of real electricity networks. This allowed SPEN to backfill their asset database, with a high degree of confidence, by extracting information from data on other similar assets in the area, as well as smart meter data. 

 **2. The determination of how much SM coverage was required to represent and monitor the system, to be able to make confident prediction and create accurate forecasts.** ERPE researchers developed an operational decision support \(ODS\) system for network modelling that utilised metadata, including that derived from Geographical Information Systems, Asset Management Databases and Real\-time Monitoring Equipment, to support forecasting of voltage violations. The ODS also created a standardised data management platform that was scaled into parallel and future projects. This brought quality assurance and scalability to data analysis in the electrical network. 

 **3. Understanding the impact of network topology, EV energy demand, current energy demand and Distributed Generation \(type and Level\) on network performance.**  ERPE researchers combined the latest advances in ML and AI, with state\-of\-the\-art tools for simulation of electricity networks \(PSSE techniques\) \[3.3\]. For example, in order to address data privacy concerns, the underpinning research showed that it is sufficient to collect data from several ‘key identified locations’ to predict with very high accuracy voltage deviation estimates for the whole network, and that this analysis can be performed without individual power consumption data \[3.4\]. Thus, the system operator does not need to have full observability of the power consumption of individual users, protecting their privacy. This enabled SPEN to identify which areas/subnetworks of their low\-voltage \(LV\) distribution network are potentially most at risk from dangerous voltage excursions, due to developments such as EV uptake or solar panel installations.

# 1.  Details of the impact 

 The multi\-award winning NCEWS project \[P1\], supported by Innovate UK through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) designed an operational and planning decision support system \(DSS\) that embodied the functional, operational and compliance requirements of the SPEN distribution system. The ERPE team were able, through their underpinning research \[3.1\-3.4\], to create advances in machine learning techniques that were integrated into SPEN’s information platform and used to support strategic network planning decisions. This has supported the critical pathway to enable decentralised energy networks for future dynamic low carbon renewable integration. The impacts include: 

 **\(A\) Deployment and Integration of NCEWS within Utility Network Management Platform** 

 The NCEWS project integrated metadata, network expertise and novel machine learning\-based analysis that achieved \[5.1\] three primary aims: 

 \(i\) It backfilled missing asset data \(especially cables\) in the SPEN system, by applying machine learning \(ML\) to detect patterns from both existing assets and smart meter \(SM\) data. This provided critical new network information without the disruption and expense of physical inspection \[5.1\]. 

 \(ii\) It leveraged large\-scale real\-time data available from the rollout of smart meters, while preserving the privacy of individual consumers. This allowed SPEN to detect areas of the network which are prone to voltage violations and potentially poor supply quality, and to simulate the benefits of new investments, for example new electric vehicle \(EV\) charging stations, under large numbers of scenarios \[5.1\]. 

 \(iii\) ERPE research was able to identify the optimal strategic SM sparse deployment locations, providing the equivalent accuracy in voltage prediction of a 100% SM installation. It accelerated network monitoring and reduced the associated costs \[5.1\]. 

 The impact was increased and assured through the integration of NCEWS with the SPEN Network Analysis and View \(NAVI *\)* platform. It was rolled out and integrated as business\-as\-usual \(BAU\) across the company, to support real business and planning decisions. For example, when a network planner is unsure of the type of cable present in a particular location, he/she can inquire of the ML tool to provide a prediction that includes the degree of statistical confidence. This has allowed decisions to be taken that, hitherto, would have required physical verification \(which is often expensive/unfeasible, as cables are buried underground, in complex locations\) \[5.1\]. 

 **\(B\)  Deferral of Network Renewal and Associated Cost Savings** 

 The use of the ML systems has also led to significant economic impact \[5.1\]. A key benefit of predictions made by users of NCEWS is the potential to safely defer expensive network reinforcements \[5.1\]. Recent internal figures from SPEN show that in order to accommodate the rollout of EV charging, network reinforcements could be deferred, with savings of around GBP1,000,000,000 in the SPEN distribution area alone \[5.1\]. 

 NCEWS uses real smart meter data across the network and helps to pinpoint critical sub\-networks, where deferrals will result in cost savings.  Examples of such cost\-saving decisions include smarter selection of the placement of EV charging stations, distributed storage and demand\-side response, and avoiding placement in areas of likely voltage/power violations. The NCEWS predictive tool, that uses real smart meter data across the company's network and helps pinpoint critical sub\-networks, is now central to achieving these deferral savings \[5.1\]. 

 **\(C\)  Enabling Digitalisation Strategy and Supporting Decarbonisation** 

 NCEWS is now being integrated into a larger national roll\-out and rebranded as NAVI as part of SP Energy Networks’ ‘RIIO\-RD2’ plans with OFGEM \[5.1\]. In the SPEN Digitalisation Strategy 2019, the NCEWS project and outcomes was cited as a key project, ‘ *by reducing modelling design time by two thirds \(67%\)*’, ‘ *automatic tracing of the network also means much larger geographical areas can be analysed…. leading to improved understanding supporting informed decision making regarding network reinforcement*’ \[5.2\] 

 More significant impact for NCEWS was in the standardisation of data collection across other innovation projects relating to energy networks \[5.2\]. At the launch and introduction of the 2019 SPEN Digitisation Strategy, the CEO of SPEN stated that “ *Improvements in control, automation, flexibility and demand side management are helping us create a more dynamic and active network*,"" \[5.3\] 

 NCEWS is assisting SPEN to support the UK's decarbonisation agenda \[5.1\]. In some cases, where there is uncertainty whether a new investment project \(e.g. building a new EV charging station\) could lead to voltage/power violations, SPEN has had to err on the side of caution in the past, until the local network can be physically assessed and/or reinforced. With the aid of NCEWS, however, acting on real smart meter data, SPEN can make faster approval decisions, and faster approval/rollout of the decarbonisation investments \[5.1\]. 

 **\(D\) Consequent Funding and National Awards** 

 The results of the NCEWS project enabled SPEN to leverage consequent funding for the PACE project, in collaboration with Transport Scotland and Scottish Government. PACE sought to accelerate and widen the installation of EV charging points across a weak area of the low voltage distribution network in Lanarkshire \[5.1\]. 

 The ERPE and SPEN partnership, and the resulting development of the NCEWS, won national awards including the prestigious E&T 2019 Innovation of the Year Award \[5.4\]. 

 Fiona Fulton, SPEN, Smart Grid Manager stated the significance of the project and relationship to their low\-voltage \(LV\) network: *""The NCEWS project with Heriot\-Watt University was a real success, that met and exceeded our expectations. The information platform developed allows SPEN to automatically backfill missing asset data, as well as using advanced analytics to identify ‘at risk areas’ and potential voltage excursions in our LV distribution network. The project leverages the massive amounts of data made available by the smart meter rollout, and allows SPEN to be at the forefront of European innovation efforts in this key area. The ongoing Business\-As\-Usual rollout across SPEN will enable all parts of the business to benefit from its results, which is an outstanding result for a knowledge transfer project""* \[5.5\].   The project resulted in several further awards, including 

-  2019  [IET's Information Technology Award](https://www.theiet.org/media/press-releases/press-releases-2019/15-november-2019-ground-breaking-innovations-steal-the-show-at-iet-innovation-awards/) \[5.6\]. 

-  Top ""outstanding"" rating for a KTP project from InnovateUK \[5.7\], 

-  [Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) ""Rising Star"" award for KTP Associate Maizura Mokhtar](https://interface-online.org.uk/news/winners-4th-scottish-knowledge-exchange-awards-announced), \[5.8\] 

 Overall, the project positioned SPEN at the cutting edge of electrical network modernisation and importantly serves as a keystone in their acceleration of decarbonisation and incorporation of low carbon technologies. \[5.1\]

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 In 2014, the UK Government introduced a compulsory foreign language teaching policy in primary schools in England.  In response to this, and to assist implementation of this policy into practice, Myles created and leads a **researcher\-practitioner network** \(Research in Primary Languages; RiPL\). **RiPL** is now the vanguard for foreign language learning in primary schools, unique in championing combined stakeholder support for researchers, practitioners, policy makers and teacher educators, acting as a conduit for policy and practice debate and change, challenging and contributing to debates on government policy. To date, RiPL has directly benefited **\(a\) teachers; \(b\) teacher educators, \(c\) policy makers**. 
","
### 1.  Underpinning research 

 Since 2011, Myles main body of research \[R1; R2; R3\] investigated **how children of different ages learn foreign languages**. It compared beginner learners of French aged 5, 7 and 11 respectively, taught by the same teacher following the same pedagogic principles, in terms of learning outcomes and attitudes and motivation towards learning French. The study found that younger children were highly motivated but made slower progress in terms of language learning, especially grammar, and that their cognitive and emotional development during middle childhood affected their motivational profile and their learning behaviour. Age\-appropriate pedagogic practices were also found to play a major role in children’s development. 

 Myles’ research \[R3; R4\] showed that this age group learns more implicitly and therefore requires \(a\) adequate classroom time; \(b\) more repetition as learning strategies are underdeveloped at that age; \(c\) age\-appropriate classroom activities \[R2\]. Her research also showed that young learners’ motivational and emotional profile changes throughout middle childhood, with enjoyment being the prime driver in early stages, and gradually becoming replaced by more instrumental reasons, including a sense of progress and achievement \[R2\]. 

 Myles subsequently contextualised the **implications** of her findings within the **policy** landscape prevalent in England \[R1; R3; R4; R5\], and in particular the introduction in 2014 by the UK Government of compulsory foreign language teaching in primary schools in England. Her research showed that the lack of guidelines in the new policy and the lack of training/upskilling provision for primary teachers with no experience of language teaching, led to schools facing many challenges as well as to very patchy and non\-inclusive implementation on the ground. 

 Her work also suggested research\-informed solutions for a successful implementation of the policy could be found, based on an understanding of language learning and teaching in this age group \[R1; R2; R3; R5\]. Myles invited all major national stakeholders to a *Primary Languages **Policy Summit* to discuss research findings, which led to the publication by Holmes & Myles of a **White Paper* \[WP R5\]. Informed by Myles and RiPL colleagues’ research and discussions at the *Summit*, the *White Paper* provides an evaluation of the current state of primary languages education in the country, outlining challenges faced by the profession, and proposing a series of 10 **research\-informed recommendations to policy makers and practitioners** to overcome these challenges and ensure the successful implementation of the 2014 primary languages policy. These recommendations focus on: allocation of a minimum teaching time to ensure progression; initial teacher training and CPD provision; curriculum planning across phases; transition between primary and secondary school; assessment and reporting to ensure continuity; use of digital technology; importance of school accountability; role of school leadership; research programme to address gaps in understanding; the necessity of creating a national taskforce to address the challenges faced by schools and coordinate the implementation of the national policy. 

 Myles’ body of research on how primary school children learn and how this can and should inform policy \[R1; R2; R3; R4; R5\] has informed all the strands of work carried out by RiPL with **teachers, teacher educators and policy makers**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The disconnection between research findings identified in Myles’ work on one hand \[R1; R2; R3\], practitioner need and Government policy on the other hand \[R3; R4; R5\], led her to set up a series of **RiPL** events during which she established a consensus across stakeholders that a single point of reference was required, to provide reliable information to inform policy and practice from a sound evidence base. Launched in June 2017, and initiated by Myles, RiPL has the dual aims of \(1\) **supporting schools and practitioners** obliged to implement the UK Government’s 2014 policy and \(2\) **informing policy debates** about the implementation of the statutory requirement to teach Foreign Languages \(FL\) in English primary schools, on the basis of robust research evidence. Led by Myles, RiPL brings together ten leading researchers \(Universities of Reading, Southampton, Oxford, Manchester Metropolitan, King’s College London\) and one policy influencer \(Holmes MBE; *Born Global*\), and is unique in bringing together key stakeholders to provide an authoritative and well\-informed ‘voice for change’. RiPL is central to FL debates \[S1; S2; S3\] as the **Chair of APPG for Modern Languages** confirms ‘ *The APPG is concerned that there is little in the way of strategic, joined\-up support for primary language practitioners in England, and regards **the RIPL network and Florence Myles’s research as an absolutely key resource** in this regard’* \[S1a\] and as shown by the **adoption of \[R5\] recommendations** in an influential report *Towards a national languages strategy: education and skills* \(2020\) \[S3d\] by British Academy \(BA\), AHRC, Association of School and College Leaders \(ASCL\), British Council, & Universities UK *.* RiPL is also central to teacher education in this area. In 2020 the highly popular **MOOC** *Teaching Languages in Primary Schools: Putting Research into Practice* by Myles and Porter, based on their research had 6,353 participants from 140 countries across July and November \[S4\]. Myles, as RiPL Chair was appointed **Curriculum Partner by the DfE\-funded **Oak National Academy* for the provision of online language lessons to primary schools nationally during the pandemic \[S1d\].

 Launched in January 2018 the  [RiPL network’s website](http://www.ripl.uk/policy/) contains \(1\) state of the art review of research on seven themes central to the field; \(2\) one\-page jargon\-free summaries of research articles of interest and relevance to practitioners and non\-academic audiences; \(3\) policy documents and reviews; \(4\) resources for teachers; \(5\) ‘School Focus’ best practice; \(6\) a blog; and \(7\) relevant events. The **website** is RiPL’s main communication tool with professionals and policy makers. The range of resources it provides is being used extensively, as exemplified by teacher trainers in \[S5\]: *‘\[…\] for MFL in the primary to secondary sessions, we **drew extensively on the website**. We gave the students a ‘tour’ of the website and then drew up a series of activities for independent study and for group seminars*’ \(Head of MFL Teacher Education, KCL\); ‘ *RiPL work has **directly affected my practice**; I also regularly refer to it in **training** \[…\] and send primary practitioners to check the website as a reference and for their own knowledge and training’* \(Teacher trainer/consultant\) \[S5\]. Between 2018 and 2020 the website had **179,279 visits**, with traffic steadily increasing \[S6\]. The **summaries of research** and reviews of sub\-fields written by Myles and her team are used by **teachers, teacher trainers, journalists, policy makers** and are **reshaping thinking and training** by making research evidence readily available to practitioners \[S1; S5; S7; S8\]: ‘ *The research summaries have been really valuable within our teacher training’* \(Teacher educator, Australia\); ‘ *The summaries of research are extremely useful as I would not be able to access the information without them’* \(MFL Consultant, Harris Federation\); ‘ *I use the website and particularly the research summaries to share research relating to key issues for MFL pedagogy with my students to enable them to adopt research\-informed practices in their own teaching. Research from the RiPL website is incorporated into lectures and workshops* \(MFL Lead, Northumbria University\) \[S5\]. **The Association for Language Learning** \(ALL – who represent Modern Foreign Language teachers in the UK; 3,500 members\) regularly features RiPL on its website and its testimony \[S5a\] concludes ‘ *In summary the contributions of RIPL in various ways to the professional work of language teachers in Primary education, in teacher training, and in Secondary education particularly in the field of transition matters is considerable, and fairly unique in the UK scenario’*. 

 Myles and Porter \(University of Southampton\) produced a 3\-week interactive online course \( **MOOC**\) on *Teaching Languages in Primary Schools: Putting Research into Practice* \[S4\]. This course is based directly on Myles’ research on how young children learn languages, for example what activities motivate this age group, what progression can be achieved at this age, or how to introduce increasingly complex language \[R1; R2; R3\]. The first run in July 2020 attracted **4,931 participants from 140 countries** who scored the course **4.8/5** and testified how the course changed their thinking and practice \[S4\]. An analysis of the 476 feedback questionnaires received showed that, at the end of the first session based on Myles’ research \[R1; R2; R3\] **81.4%** of respondents agreed with the statement ‘ *I **learnt something new** about how children's learning changes between ages 7 and 11*’, **74.8%** agreed that ‘ *I have **learnt something new** about how changes in the way children learn have implications for pedagogy,* and **78.6%** agreed ‘ *As a result of the MOOC, in future, I will **adapt my teaching** more closely to suit the age of the children’* \[S4\]. Participants invariably specified in their discursive comments on the questionnaires and in the **14,150 comments** from participants generated during the course, how they had found learning about the research enlightening \( *I completely **changed the way I taught** last term.* \[…\] *This has been the most useful professional development I have undertaken to date* – Japanese primary language teacher, Australia; ‘ *the MOOC \[has\] been beneficial to my role as subject leader of MFL. I have improved my subject knowledge, and this has **fed into my medium and long term planning’ – MFL subject leader *,* UK\) and how they will apply it to their own contexts \( *I have used some of the ideas in my lessons \[from the MOOC\] \[…\] and shared them several times whilst **delivering online training**, both on a local level and at a national level –* Primary FL consultant, UK\). Many PGCE leads are now including the MOOC in their courses \[S4\]. 

 Myles, as RiPL Chair, was appointed by the **Oak National Academy* as a **curriculum partner** to develop 78 online lessons for French and Spanish for Key Stage 2 by December 2020. *Oak* was set up by the DfE in April 2020 to provide National Curriculum online lessons for children as a national response to the pandemic, and it now provides nearly 10,000 video lessons; there were 578,000 pupil\-visits in weeks leading up to mid December 2020. The Chair of the *Oak National Academy* comments ‘ *the connection between RiPL and Oak National Academy is likely to bring evidence led primary MFL teaching to a very wide audience of pupils and to a very large number of primary school teachers.’* \[S1d\]. 

 Myles’ research and expertise has led to invitations to share her research findings with the Minister for Education, APPG, influential professional bodies and policy advisors as well as discussing the research underpinning her policy recommendations at teacher conferences, workshops and training events. Feedback from these events has shown evidence of impact on professionals’ thinking and practice \[S2; S8\], as evidenced by this statement from the Content Manager, **Government Events**: ‘ *Professor Myles’ contribution to our events and content has been extremely valuable to the wider professional community \[...\] In sharing the outcomes of RiPL’s research Professor Myles has expanded the horizons of teachers working against an increasingly difficult backdrop, improving provisions for the teaching of primary languages in a range of settings.*’ \[S5\]. Myles research has **shaped public debate** appearing in top **newspapers**: *The Guardian*, March 2019 \(circulation 141K\); The ‘I’, December 2014 \(circulation 298K\) \[S7\]; *Svenska Dagbladet,* October 2019 \(leading Swedish newspaper, circulation print 300K, digital 450K\) states ‘ *The summaries of research hosted on the RiPL website were particularly useful, and I used several of them to provide background information, including those on your own research about how children of different ages learn foreign languages, and the implications for language education policy.’* \[S7a\]. 

 <ins> **Shaping</ins> <ins>Policy**</ins> 

 Myles research is influencing the development of a **national strategy for languages**, ensuring it includes research\-informed primary education recommendations. In 2018 Myles organised the RiPL Policy Summit \- a research\-informed event about the issues and challenges faced by the primary education sector, and possible solutions, attended by major stakeholders and decision makers nationwide \(26 organisations e.g. DfE, APPG Modern Languages, Ofsted, Ofqual, ASCL, British Council, British Academy, Cultural Partners etc.\). Input from this event led to the RiPL **White Paper** \[R5\] outlining 10 recommendations for the implementation of the national policy. The White Paper’s impact can be evidenced by a number of testimonies from influential policy makers and language professionals \[S1; S5\], as well as a series of high profile invitations for Myles to contribute to policy development \[S2\] and its subsequent contribution to a range of influential national policy documents \[S3a\-f\]: 

-  British Council \(2019\). *Language Trends 2019* \[S3a\] *.* 

-  All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Modern Languages \(2019\). *A National Recovery Programme for Languages* \[S3b\] *.* \[audience reach in national press 62 million and on national radio 16.3 million; S1a\] 

-  British Council \(2020\). *Language Trends 2020* \[S3c\]. 

-  BA, AHRC, ASCL, British Council, & Universities UK. \(2020\). *Towards a National Languages Strategy* \[S3d\].

-  ASCL Transition Toolkits \(2020\) \[S3f\]. 

 The Co\-Chair of the **APPG** testifies how RiPL and the White Paper have influenced its work: *‘the APPG participated in RIPL’s Primary Languages Policy Summit \[…\], which **fed directly** into the APPG’s National Recovery Programme for Languages \[…\] In providing critical reading, the APPG MFL was able to **draw on RIPL’s research** to better frame its priorities for primary languages in the wider context of improving languages policy in the UK.\[…\]* *The RIPL **White Paper** provided **important evidence** which the APPG MFL used to justify calling publicly for a statutory entitlement to languages education from age 5.* *\[…\] The APPG MFL has subsequently held meetings with the **DfE** and with **Ministers** drawing on Florence Myles’s research to argue for the development of primary language policy.’* In its concluding statement, the testimony states that the APPG is continuing to draw on the work of RiPL and states ‘ *\[RiPL\]  is unique in providing a national network for primary\-focussed practitioners and experts along with focussed academic research which in turn leads to a development of policy recommendations*.’ \[S1a\]. 

 The **Lead Fellow for Languages at the British Academy** writes ‘ *Professor Myles’ research and her leadership through RiPL have **informed ongoing debate** about Primary Languages Policy in England in important and constructive ways. That is why the White Paper is referred to four times in ‘Towards a National Languages Strategy’, which **echoes some of the White Paper recommendations**, and is targeted at policymakers as well as stakeholders. \[…\] my **own understanding** of some of the issues has been improved by Prof. Myles’ research on how primary age children learn and on what motivates them.*’ \[S1c\]. The **Chair of the DfE Review of Modern Foreign Languages Pedagogy**, who regularly advises the Government on MFL policy, chairs the Oak National Academy and is the incoming Chair of Ofqual, comments on the Policy Summit which led to the White Paper as a ‘ *rare and important opportunity for research and thinking to be mobilised into proposals which those responsible for curricular decision making in schools can engage with, and, indeed, influence policy*’ \[S1d\]. Evidence of further shaping of policy at a national level is provided by the MFL Consultant at **ASCL** \(Association of School and College Leaders\) in the two documents they published in 2020, who used RiPL’s research and the White Paper as evidence in support of their work \[S1b\]. Myles’ policy paper \[R1\] continues to attract attention with 62,898 \[2/12/2020\] unique views since its publication in May 2017 \(the most viewed paper ever from this policy journal with well over half of its total views for all papers\) \[S1e\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Engineering research undertaken by Professor Keith Mayes, at the request of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute \(ETSI\), proved the feasibility of securely implementing the TUAK algorithm in eSIM devices. This removed a security risk that had been a barrier to widespread eSIM adoption in mobile communications networks. His research has supported market growth in areas including, consumer devices, automotive, smart manufacturing \(Industry 4.0\), smart metering, and is influencing plans for remote healthcare. Between the start of 2017 and the end of 2020, a total of approximately 1,398,000,000 eSIMs were issued, with approximately 622,000,000 of them in consumer devices. At the end of 2020 over 20 flagship smartphones supported eSIM technology. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 To support cellular communications in the Internet of Things \(IoT\), an embedded Subscriber Identity Module \(SIM\) chip was needed that could be remotely and securely provisioned/re\-provisioned to provide authenticated access to different mobile networks. The solution was standardised, becoming the embedded SIM \(eSIM\), also fitted in mainstream Smartphones and personal devices. Remote eSIM Service Provisioning \(RSP\), requires a common authentication and key establishment algorithm that can be reconfigured, rather than replaced when changing networks. Mobile networks had one de\-facto common standard algorithm called MILENAGE. However, as eSIMs will be in billions of things, it was an unacceptable security risk for the telecommunications industry, to have eSIM and RSP reliant on a single algorithm; in case a security vulnerability emerged. Therefore, to make eSIM and RSP feasible, it was necessary to develop a second algorithm based on a completely different design \(called TUAK\); so both are unlikely to share common security vulnerabilities. The responsibility for this, fell to the Security Algorithm Group of Experts \(SAGE\) of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute \(ETSI\), who tasked Mayes with the first ever evaluation of the practicality of secure implementation within deployed and/or new eSIM chips. The Mayes work received some funding contribution from government \(GCHQ\) and the GSM Association \(GSMA\); specialist tools were provided by MULTOS and Crisp Telecom. 

 Mayes was a credible choice for the research, having previously contributed to related ETSI and Third Generation Partnership Project \(3GPP\) international telecommunications standards while working in industry; and for subsequently founding \(in 2002\) the Smart Card Centre \(SCC\) at Royal Holloway University of London, with telecommunications industry funding. SCC engineering research \(hardware and software\) includes implementation and evaluation of security algorithms on specialist attack\-resistant microcontroller chips e.g. in conventional SIMs, phones and IoT devices; including security testing at native \(chip\-level\) and platform\-level. The latter characterised by high security evaluation, but much slower speed than native implementation; unless crypto\-coprocessor hardware is added to accelerate algorithms. 

 Mayes research within the SCC, in support of ETSI, initially created baseline implementations of the new common authentication algorithm, TUAK, on two advanced security chips and two MULTOS platforms using those chips; subsequently, a legacy chip was evaluated. A server baseline was also created \(supported by Ericsson\), representing the network Authentication Centre. Implementation strategies were refined over multiple iterations, identifying and optimising pre\-computations to the extent permitted by very limited memories and using hardware features accessible at chip or platform level. Equipment included sample chips and platforms \(MULTOS\), software development and test environments; digital oscilloscopes, a power\-leakage test rig and a legacy chip hardware emulator from Crisp Telecom. 

 The main research findings of Mayes, captured in standards reports and academic publication, were: 

1.  It was feasible to implement the algorithm at chip\-level, with adequate performance, even on 16\-bit legacy security chips without the need for hardware crypto\-coprocessors. 

1.  It was not advisable to download the algorithm at the platform\-level of deployed SIMs, as the speed was too slow and some side\-channel power leakage \(potential to infer sensitive data from power consumption variations\) was detectable. 

 Finding \(1\) proved to ETSI and 3GPP that the algorithm was feasible on both new and legacy SIM chips; and as a result, 3GPP added the TUAK algorithm \(and Mayes reports\) to its international standards. In parallel, the GSMA was standardising the Remote eSIM Provisioning specifications and responded to finding \(1\) by accepting TUAK as a suitable security algorithm, and to finding \(2\) by mandating both MILENAGE and TUAK support within all eSIMs. Publication of the GSMA specification \(December 2016\) very notably accelerated the rollout of eSIMs; with approximately 1,398,000,000 deployed by the end of 2020.

###  3. References to the research 

 The Mayes TUAK research evidence is found in technical reports for ETSI and GSMA, within 3GPP international standards and within related peer\-reviewed academic publications. Quality is determined, by global international standards bodies commissioning the research and then accepting and publishing the results, by the endorsement letters of leading industry experts directly involved in this work, by the engagement of industry expert authors within peer\-reviewed accepted conference publication, and by being one of the papers invited to publish an extended version in a related journal. The work began February 2014 helped by GCHQ’s competitive small grant scheme \(GBP25,000\), Mayes PI. It was extended in October 2014 helped by private funding from the GSMA \(EUR5,000\), Mayes PI.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Cellular connectivity of machines, and personal devices, is key to realising the Internet of Things \(IoT\). Removable SIM cards have become impractical from environmental, operational and manufacturing viewpoints, and need to be replaced by embedded SIMs \(eSIM\).The mass deployment of eSIMs with reliance on just the 3GPP MILENAGE algorithm was considered too great a risk by the telecommunications industry. Mayes research, undertaken on behalf of ETSI, for the standardisation of the TUAK algorithm, mitigated this risk and was a pivotal enabler for eSIM roll\-out. 

 **Transforming industry capability by producing globally accepted standards for eSIM** 

 The engineering research Mayes undertook was critical to TUAK and eSIM standardisation, as evident from current ETSI and 3GPP standards \[R1\] and the opinion of the Vodafone \[text removed for publication\], who is also \[text removed for publication\] ETSI Security Algorithms Group of Experts \(SAGE\); the design authority for TUAK standardisation  \[S1\]. 

 \[text removed for publication\]. *\[S1\].* 

 Prior to 2017, non\-standard eSIMs had failed to achieve significant growth. The critical change was publication of version 2.0 of the GSMA RSP eSIM standards, which mandated TUAK, \(an earlier version had only limited take\-up for smartwatches\). This was summarised by the eSIM \[text removed for publication\] for the GSMA. 

 \[text removed for publication\]. *\[S2\].* 

 **Transforming global markets with eSIM** 

 Following standardisation, deployment of eSIMs in consumer devices rapidly accelerated as illustrated in Figure 1; representing the number of eSIMs issued per year. By December 2020 approximately 622,000,000 had been deployed in total; and more than 20 flagship Smartphones \(Apple, Samsung, Google and Huawei\) plus tablets and PDAs, supported eSIM \[S5\]. 

 \(millions\)                                                                 \(billions\) 





 Figure 1 Deployed Consumer eSIMs \[S4\]            Figure 2 Annual Global Shipments of eSIMs \[S3\] 

 Figure 2 indicates the number of eSIMs issued per year for all uses \(consumer and non\-consumer\) \[S3\]. Based on the published data, 360,000,000 were shipped in 2018 and using the market report’s \[S3\] calculation of 27% CAGR, an approximate total of 1,398,000,000 eSIMs had been issued by the end of 2020, predicted to be rising at a rate of 2,000,000,000 per year by 2025. At the end of 2020, approximately 776,000,000 of deployed eSIMs were for a mix of automotive, industrial and other IoT uses. 

 Beneficiaries of secure eSIM are diverse and on enormous scale. Manufacturers of eSIM chips, are now producing standardised, rather than network\-specific eSIMs. Mobile and IoT manufacturers can produce devices that are smaller, more robust and tolerant to extreme environments. Mobile network operators can offer connectivity via a range of devices, without SIM card deployment costs. Billions of end\-users benefit by simple connection and reconnection of consumer devices to preferred networks. Two existing and major market sectors are now presented. 

 **Automotive/connected\-cars** is an exciting market \(estimated worth in 2020 USD151,800,000,000\), critically enabled by eSIM, as reported by GSMA and Ericsson \[S6, S7\]. Vehicles must withstand extremes of operating environment, yet remain reliable and secure for decades, with increasing reliance on cellular communications. 

 *“eSIM: Driving global connectivity in the automotive industry… all cars built will be cellular\-enabled, leading to an enhanced driving experience made possible by innovative connected services, like assisted driving and better infotainment.” \[S7\].* 

 The eSIMs are installed into vehicles at manufacture, however, at that stage it is impossible to predict all owners, networks or countries that will span the vehicle life. 

 *“From a connected vehicle’s birth in the factory, to the port, to dealer, to the consumer – no matter where in the world it goes \-\- eSIM allows for a steady, compliant, high performant local connection, and most important, seamless.” \[S7\].* 

 *""...GSMA’s Embedded SIM Specification uses Remote SIM Provisioning technology and therefore enables late stage programming of M2M devices. In the auto sector, this will massively simplify production and will accelerate the growth of the connected car market..."" \[S6\].* 

 **The Industrial IoT Market** was worth USD126,000,000,000 in 2019, and with CAGR of 29.4%, is predicted to have reached USD163,044,000,000 by end of 2020; aided by eSIM technology \[S8\]. The Ericsson whitepaper on *“The cellular connected enterprise – from products to production”* \[S8\], explains the importance of cellular communications in industrial IoT and how eSIM simplifies integration, unlocking value across the market. 

 *“…To leverage supply chains and multiple factories across the globe … enterprises receive simplified global connectivity management by exploiting eSIM capabilities for seamless device deployment…Key benefits of global IoT Connectivity… \(1\) Faster time to market, build and scaling global cellular IoT efforts faster, \(2\) Reduced integration costs, \(3\) Future proof products, \(4\) Improved cost savings by tracking and controlling assets remotely, \(5\) Simplified, more integrated supply chain, \(6\), Increased security” \[S8\].* 

 The opinion of the Thales Marketing Director for Embedded Products, further emphasises the strong linkage between eSIM and IoT market development. 

 *“…*the standardisation of the TUAK security algorithm, by the European Telecommunications Institute \(ETSI\) and the Third Generation Partnership Project \(3GPP\); and *standardisation of the embedded SIM \(eSIM\) by the GSM Association \(GSMA\), have represented a major achievement to enable the mass roll\-out and business potential for mobile connected devices within the Internet of Things \(IoT\). It is the combination of security … and remote provisioning capability … that makes the eSIM so suited to a range of our markets…” \[S9\].* 

 A further market to consider is the **Medical IoT Market**, which considering several market reports \[S10\], had a value in 2019 of between USD57,620,000,000 and USD113,750,000,000. Current medical IoT solutions include, chronic care, assisted living, remote treatment, sleep therapy, blood sugar and pressure meters, and cardiac monitors. 

 *“IoT healthcare solutions have the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes and save millions of lives with remote patient monitoring...” \[S10\].* 

 eSIMs are not yet deployed in significant numbers within this market, but their properties of security, support for data privacy, reconfiguration, and environmental tolerance, are positively impacting manufacturer design strategy for connected medical devices. This is particularly important, as the majority of health care organisations that have so far deployed medical IoT devices have experienced cyberattacks against their legacy technologies \[S10\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at The University of Manchester invented technology that expedites drug discovery by measuring the bioactive shapes of small molecules with unprecedented accuracy using nuclear magnetic resonance. The technology, assigned to spin\-out C4XDiscovery, was used to successfully initiate several novel drug programmes, which led to the company raising GBP31,000,000 *via* a floatation on the London Stock Exchange. 

 Its lead programme aims to treat addiction across a broad range of substance use disorders – which are areas of unmet need costing the United States USD1,000,000,000,000 annually – by targeting the craving process itself. The technology delivered drug candidates for this programme significantly quicker than traditional pharmaceutical methodologies, with substantially lower toxicity and side\-effects and saving 90% of the typical pre\-clinical cost, which averages around USD1,000,000,000. The programme entered clinical development in 2018 *via* a USD294,000,000 licencing deal with Indivior PLC.

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  Background 

 The impact is underpinned by research at The University of Manchester \(UoM\) from 2005‒2008 conducted by Dr Andrew Almond and Dr Charles Blundell. The researchers invented new methods for determining small molecule 3D\-shapes, and in particular, techniques that could be applied to complex sugars, which pose a unique set of research problems given their high flexibility. One strand of research led to determination of the molecular 3D\-shape of the flexible polysaccharide hyaluronan, which is distributed widely throughout mammalian connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. Almond and Blundell achieved this by performing computer simulations of the molecule in the presence of aqueous solvent, preparing pure samples in the laboratory and performing detailed experiments to validate the computational results **\[1\-3\]**. 

##  Discovery and patent application 

 During their research on hyaluronan \(2005‒2008\), funded by a BBSRC David Phillips Research Fellowship, Almond and Blundell developed a quantitative theory that enabled raw nuclear magnetic resonance \(NMR\) experimental data to be used to calculate a quantified flexible structure of a hyaluronan hexasaccharide **\[4\]**. The molecular 3D\-shape of this molecule was resolved for the first time, validating the new methodology on an inherently flexible biomolecule \- a world first. Furthermore, this nascent technological breakthrough was applicable to virtually any small flexible molecule, including drugs and peptides **\[4\]**. 

 Using proof\-of\-concept funding from UoM and two BBSRC Follow\-on\-Fund research grants, the dynamic 3D\-structures of several important molecules were resolved and the research became more applied and directed towards the pharmaceutical sector. Importantly, the resultant models were established to be predictive of bioactive shape, *i.e.* the bound molecular shape required for ligand\-based drug discovery processes such as virtual screening, chemical scaffold hopping and pharmacophore identification **\[4\]**. A patent to protect the technology was filed in 2007, which has been granted in the USA **\[5\]** and Japan as of November 2019. In 2008, Conformetrix Ltd \(now C4X Discovery Ltd\) was spun out of UoM to commercially license the technology.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Ligand\-based drug design is a contemporary and exciting area of pharmaceutical R&D that aims to predict the affinity and selectivity of small molecules \(candidate drugs\) in the absence of the receptor 3D information. It relies on chemical and physical knowledge exclusively from small molecules that bind to the biological target of interest, such as small molecules 3D shape and flexibility. However, current methods of determining small molecule 3D shape and flexibility have limitations: protein co\-crystallography is very expensive and time\-consuming, small molecule crystallography suffers from non\-physiological packing artefacts, computational modelling predictions of the 3D\-shapes of small molecules and proteins needed to predict binding is inaccurate, and neither NMR methods nor crystallography can quantify small molecule flexibility. 

 The technology invented at UoM, Conformetrix \(hereinafter referred to as “UoM Technology”\) overcomes these shortcomings, producing accurate, experimentally determined 3D shapes in solution. Its accuracy and novelty stems from the fact that it can quantify the flexible \(rather than time\-averaged\) shapes of small molecules in solution \( *i.e*., to effectively reproduce the Boltzmann distribution of conformations for a given molecule\) to the atomic resolution needed for drug design **\[4\]**. These can then be used in traditional computer\-aided drug design workflows, such as virtual screening, molecular docking, pharmacophore mapping and structure activity relationship models to improve the speed and accuracy of drug hit identification and lead optimization. C4XD have stated that, “ *The patented \[UoM\] technology platform* \[…\] *is at the heart of the C4XD drug discovery engine enabling rapid progress in developing new and better drugs at a fraction of the cost compared to best industry practice.*” **\[A\]** 

##  Pathways to impact 

 The UoM Technology was taken from the laboratory to a spin\-out company by Almond and Blundell \( *via* research, translational and proof\-of\-concept funding and a secondment of Almond from the University to C4XD\). A demonstration prototype was developed using BBSRC Follow\-on\-Funding and the drafting of a business plan was enabled by a BBSRC/RSE Enterprise Fellowship. C4XDiscovery was assigned IP from The University of Manchester and incorporated in 2007 \(it was originally named Conformetrix Limited\), hereinafter referred to as “C4XD.” Since 2013, C4XD has achieved significant growth and expansion into new technologies and therapeutic areas, by development and application of the UoM Technology. The appointment of Dr Clive Dix as CEO is particularly significant given his experience as a leading UK pharmaceutical R&D executive. 

 The impact of the UoM Technology falls into three categories: \(i\) accelerating drug discovery for C4XD and the associated benefits; \(ii\) economic impacts for C4XD; and \(iii\) creating new partnerships between C4XD and other pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of the UoM Technology. 

##  Reach and significance of impact 

###  \(i\) Accelerating drug discovery for C4XD 

 An example of the UoM Technology enhancing drug discovery at C4XD is its impact on their anti\-addiction and substance abuse programmes. Abuse of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs costs the US alone over USD740,000,000,000 annually in healthcare, crime and lost productivity \(according to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA\) and represents a substantial area of unmet medical need, forecast to be worth an estimated USD13,000,000,000 *per annum* in 2018 **\[B\]**. The UoM Technology enabled rational identification of multiple drug candidates that are highly specific to the Orexin G\-protein coupled receptor \(Orexin\-1\). C4XD estimates the development of their molecules, including the lead pre\-clinical candidate drug C4X3256, has been achieved at less than 10% of the typical industry cost, and been delivered in a fraction of the time normally required **\[B, C\(p15\)\]**. Development of a drug candidate up until clinical studies costs industry on average circa USD1,000,000,000, and C4XD achieved this milestone using investment and revenues that totalled less than GBP100,000,000, while also progressing its other preclinical drug programmes. These candidates are substantially safer and have improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared to competitor best\-in\-class alternatives, which were discovered using traditional pharmaceutical methodologies. 

 The lead pre\-clinical candidate drug, C4X3256, has highly desirable properties that had not previously been achieved through conventional drug discovery methodologies **\[B\]**. In particular, the compound has negligible off\-target effects to a homologous receptor \(Orexin\-2\), which causes insomnia, allowing rapid development into a therapy to tackle the craving associated with addictions to substances such as tobacco, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Using the UoM Technology to study ligands that bind with varying affinities to the two receptor homologues, C4X3256 was able to be identified as having crucial specificity of C4X3256 for Orexin\-1 over Orexin\-2 **\[B\]**. C4XD had previously announced efficacy data of its lead compound, C4X3256, in *in vivo* models of addiction **\[D\]** and the pivotal pre\-clinical and toxicology studies were completed successfully. In 2018 C4XD was awarded a grant of USD480,000 from the NIDA to support the pre\-clinical development of C4X3256 in cocaine use disorder **\[B\]**. 

 Alongside C4XD’s Orexin\-1 antagonist programme, the UoM Technology has driven several other promising drug discovery programmes. For example, it was used to identify multiple drug leads that activate Nuclear factor erythroid 2\-related factor 2 \(NRF2\), a human transcription factor associated with the cardiovascular diseases Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension \(PAH\) and Sickle Cell Disease, both of which are orphan indications **\[B\]**. In pre\-clinical evaluation, several lead compounds identified using the UoM Technology show prolonged duration of action following low oral dosing, including in blood **\[B\]**. 

 Another successful application of the UoM Technology at C4XD has been in targeting the signalling protein Interleukin\-17 \(IL\-17\), a high\-value clinical target for inflammatory and auto\-immune diseases with a \~USD13,000,000,000 *p/a* market **\[B\]**. The only clinically\-approved drugs for IL\-17 are injectable monoclonal antibodies. A goal of many companies is to identify orally\-administered drugs for IL\-17, in part because patients find oral pills preferable to injections. Using the UoM technology, C4XD has identified selective molecular inhibitors of IL\-17, which maintain the pharmacokinetics properties of small, drug\-like molecules **\[B\]**. C4XD say they “\[continue\] *to receive strong interest from potential partners for this oral IL\-17 inhibitor approach*” **\[B\]**. 

###  \(ii\) Economic impacts from successful commercialisation and formation of C4XD 

 C4XD was the first BBSRC part\-funded spin\-out to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, following admission to AIM \(Alternative Investment Market\) in 2014 with a market capitalisation of GBP31,000,000 **\[E\]**. C4XD subsequently raised over GBP33,000,000 from public investors enabling the UoM Technology to be applied across strategic and opportunistic therapeutic areas to build a balanced pre\-clinical portfolio of 11 discovery programmes, spanning immunology, inflammation, neurology, neurodegeneration and cancer. In 2016, C4XD acquired Adorial Limited for GBP1,700,000 using revenue and investment proceeds from the UoM Technology platform. The acquired technology, Taxonomy 3, is used to drive forward the search for novel gene targets and then the UoM Technology is used in tandem to enable hit identification, further enabling and expediting early\-stage drug discovery. 

 The UoM Technology has resulted in significant new R&D growth in Manchester, and created high quality graduate and PhD jobs, as evidenced by C4XD’s financial results. **FY2017**: Revenue GBP143,000, R&D expenditure GBP6,100,000 \(\+16% YOY\), employees 42. **FY2018**: Revenue GBP7,064,000, R&D expenses GBP6,992,000 \(\+15% year on year: YOY\), employees 47 \(\+12% YOY\) **\[F\]**. **FY2019**: In 2018, C4XD changed its business model to move away from service contracts and towards its own pharmaceutical development, and as such generated no revenue in FY2019 – however, it successfully raised GBP17,700,000 in funding from external investment, and spent GBP10,585,000 on R&D **\[F\]**. **FY2020**: R&D spend of GBP6,900,000, and raised a further GBP9,200,000 from external investment in two tranches **\[F\]**. 

###  \(iii\) Benefits for partnering organisations through use of the UoM Technology 

 By 2018 C4XD’s Orexin\-1 antagonist drug discovery programme had met preclinical endpoints and entered clinical development as a novel addiction therapy *via* a license agreement with US\-based Indivior \(which markets Subutex and Suboxone, both substitution products for opioid addiction\) **\[G\]**. C4XD received an upfront payment of USD10,000,000 \(3/2018\) and up to USD284,000,000 of development, regulatory and commercialisation milestones in addition to royalties **\[B\]**. Indivior has a global and exclusive license to C4X3256 and all other compounds in the same patent family and is responsible for the cost and execution of all further development. In September 2019, Indivior received a significant grant from the US National Institutes of Health to advance C4X3256 through clinical evaluation in the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder, which in 2018 affected some 10.3 million people over the age of 12 in the USA **\[B\]**. This grant is allowing C4X3256 to progress through Phase 1 clinical evaluation, and fund toxicological and metabolism studies to enable Phase 2 clinical evaluation **\[B\]**. 

 In 2014, C4XD signed a research collaboration agreement to apply the UoM Technology across therapeutic projects at Takeda Pharmaceutical Company \(Asia’s largest pharmaceutical company: \~30,000 employees, revenue USD16,200,000,000\) to enhance lead discovery and hit identification **\[B, H\]**. The Senior Director of Chemistry at Takeda commented: "" *We are pleased to partner with C4XD and are excited about the potential of this collaboration. C4XD has a highly innovative platform technology \[UoM Technology\] which complements our strong research base to accelerate product development*."" **\[H\]** No financial terms have been disclosed. 

 In 2016, C4XD entered a collaboration with Hamburg\-based Evotec AG \(\~2,000 employees, revenue EUR258,000,000\) to apply the UoM Technology to co\-develop new small molecule drugs across a range of targets, therapeutic areas and stages of development **\[B, I\]**. No financial terms were disclosed but Evotec indicated that the collaboration was beneficial because it would reduce near\-term costs while increasing the potential output of C4XD’s drug discovery engine. Evotec’s Chief Operating Officer commented: "" *We are very pleased to continue and expand the broad\-based drug discovery collaboration with C4XD. This integrated drug discovery deal showcases our broad target class expertise coupled with our industry leading platform, which perfectly complements C4XD's technology and expertise…*"" **\[I\]**. 

 Recently, C4XD has entered into partnerships with e\-Therapeutics \(05/2018\), Horizon Discovery \(12/2018\) and PhoreMost \(7/2019\) to use the UoM Technology to accelerate co\-development of therapies for Parkinson’s disease and cancer. The CEO of PhoreMost said, “ *We are thrilled to be joining forces with C4XD within this neurodegeneration collaboration, a therapeutic area that has a pressing need for new and better targets… C4XD’s \[UoM Technology\] is ideally suited to use the 3D biological shape information derived from SITESEEKER targets and convert this into small molecules starting points that will lead to the next generation of therapeutics*” **\[A\]**. While the terms of the agreement were not disclosed, it is reasonable to expect that both companies agreed to share revenues on validated targets produced by the collaboration. 

 In 2017, C4XD collaborated with videogame developed Epic Games, developing their 4Sight virtual reality \(VR\) platform using the Unreal Engine **\[B\]**. This incorporates the UoM Technology, as well as C4XD’s Taxonomy3, to allow teams of drug developers to engage in “multiplayer”, real\-time 3D molecular design in a VR environment **\[B\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over the past 20 years we have conducted research and practice development that has focused on developing theoretical frameworks, translation and implementation methods as well as tools and processes for evaluating the effectiveness of efforts to implement person\-centredness in nursing and healthcare.  The implementation of the Person\-centred Practice Framework \(PCPF\) developed because of our research has shaped nursing and healthcare developments in 22 countries.  The systematic and sustained implementation of a theory of person\-centredness in practice continues to result in significant differences in overall quality of patient experience, staff satisfaction and well\-being, as well as better workplace cultures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The PCPF, a mid\-range theory was developed from empirical research published between 2000–2010.  This body of peer\-reviewed research and the detail of the PCPF as a theory can be found in McCormack and McCance \(2010\).  It is this body of research upon which this case study is built. Despite revisions over time, the fundamental building blocks of the framework \(the domains\), and the key elements \(the constructs\), have remained stable over time. Refinements have reflected increased engagement with person\-centred theory, its implementation in a variety of contexts and contribution of this theory to a broad agenda of person\-centred policy, education, practice and research. The PCPF is the most adopted framework for informing the development of person\-centred practices and systems among multidisciplinary and interprofessional teams internationally and has been translated into 10 languages \(c.f. Bing\-Jonsson et al 2018\) \(Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin, Slovenian, Swedish and French\) and tested in multiple healthcare contexts in 22 countries \(c.f. Gruden et al 2020\). The framework and associated tools appeal to a wide range of stakeholders.  Influential participatory research and development undertaken with international partners in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Finland, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, The Republic of Ireland, Australia, South Africa, USA and Canada has resulted in the development of six evaluation instruments *\(The Person\-centred Nursing Index; The Context Assessment Index; the Person\-centred Practice Inventory \(PCPI\) \[with versions for staff, service users and healthcare students\]\)* and one observation tool *\(The Workplace Culture Critical Analysis Tool\).* Through various implementation studies that combine the use of the PCPF with these measurement tools, we have identified key outcomes from the implementation of person\-centred practice. 

 Our collaborative research and development projects in nursing home settings have resulted in improvements to the care environment, greater resident satisfaction, improved staff well\-being, reduction in falls and reduced use of psychotropic medications \(McCormack et al 2010, Buckley et al 2014, Mekki et al 2017; Mayer et al 2020\). In acute care settings, we have produced peer\-reviewed evidence of better engagement between staff and patients as well as improved retention of staff, greater job satisfaction and staff wellbeing \(McCance et al 2008, Parlour et al 2014, Hahtela et al 2015, Laird et al 2015\). In palliative care, our systematic evaluations of practice development programmes have shown improvements in regulator quality indicators, as well as improvements to the quality of the care environment, better and more effective staff communication, increased staff development, and better retention of staff \(Yalden et al 2013, McCormack et al 2018, Haraldsdottir et al 2020\).  An international programme of work leading to the development and testing of eight person\-centred nursing key performance indicators \(KPIs\) and associated measurement tools have been tested through a series of international implementation studies in a range of clinical settings \(McCance and Wilson 2015, McCance et al 2020\). Findings from these studies confirm that using the eight KPIs generates evidence of patient experience that facilitates engagement of nurses to develop person\-centred practice, contributing to an enhanced care experience.  Our ongoing research has led to the development of the first ever Indicators for Person\-centred Healthcare Curricula \(McCormack & Dewing 2019\) that are being tested in an Erasmus\+ pan\-European curriculum development project \(Dickson et al 2020\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research highlights the importance of developing person\-centred cultures in healthcare settings for staff to ‘be the best that they can be’ so that service users can experience person\-centred care.  The PCPF is designed to articulate the relationship between care cultures and care practices to inform targeted developments in care settings that have resulted in four kinds of impact: 

1.  Enhanced Practice Experience for Service\-users and Staff 

1.  Workplace Culture Change 

1.  Quality Improvements 

1.  Transformative Learning and Development 

 **Enhanced Practice Experience for Service Users and Staff**: In the Republic of Ireland, a national programme of development was commissioned by the Health Service Executive \(HSE\) across the Irish health system \(2017\-2020\) focusing on the creation of person\-centred cultures. Two\-hundred facilitators are embedded in the health system facilitating practice change.  Impacts include changes in behaviours among participants towards more person\-centred practices \(e.g. changes to language used in practice, better staff relationships\); more effective communication in and between teams; innovations in practice such as new services and improved quality assessments from regulation authorities \( *Evidence source 1\).*  As a result of this work a ‘practical’ set of Person\-centred Principles were developed and these, along with the PCPF have been integrated into the Health Service Executive’s ‘Health Services Change Guide’\( *Evidence source 2, pages 194\-197\).* 

 **Workplace Culture Change:** Further impact from our research can be demonstrated through the international adoption of the PCPF to facilitate culture change in healthcare settings. In NSW Australia the State Health Department’s ‘Essentials of Care’ Programme uses the Framework to develop person\-centred cultures and systematically change practices, policies and systems *.* Outcomes include improved patient outcomes, increased person\-centred care, more effective partnerships with service users, increased resource efficiency, improved professionalism among nurses as evidenced through the systematic evaluation of the work in one tertiary healthcare setting \( *Evidence Source 3\)*. 

 A programme of research and development focusing on the implementation of a set of 8 person\-centred Nursing Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) by nursing teams has been implemented in the UK, Denmark, Australia and Canada.  The person\-centred KPIs are derived from the PCPF and it is the combination of the KPIs as a mechanism for evaluating person\-centred care and the use of the theory of person\-centredness to drive forward improvements in practice that maximises impact. \( *Evidence* *Source 4 **\).**  Outcomes from this work include increased staff engagement in person\-centred care, a greater focus on improving practice, and increased ability of nurses and midwives to articulate and demonstrate the positive contribution of nursing and midwifery in different settings *\(Evidence Sources 5 and 6\).* 

 **Quality Improvements:** In Austria, the framework has been used to design a model of nursing home accreditation – the first of its kind in Austria.  The accreditation model incorporates the PCPF and the implementation of the model is evaluated using the associated instruments and tools. The framework provides a basis for all care and support processes as well as for organizational, strategic and structural measures at the state level. It also provides the theoretical framework for evaluation. \( *Evidence Source 7\).* 

 As a result of our ongoing research, Health Improvement Scotland \(HIS\), in its national ‘Specialist Dementia Unit’ improvement programme has adopted the *Workplace Culture Critical Analysis Tool \(WCCAT\)* to guide observations of practice and a participatory approach to the making of quality improvements.  One such example is that of Balmore Ward, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’ *\(Evidence source 8a\)*. The work, guided by our person\-centred research has resulted in outcomes including, changes in day\-to\-day practices and relationships with residents, better engagement with carers and implementation of meaningful activities for residents \( *Evidence Source 8b\).* The WCCAT is now integrated into the Scotland\-wide ‘Specialist Dementia Unit Improvement Programme *\(Evidence source 8c\).* 

 **Transformative Learning and Development:** The PCPF forms the core theoretical basis of ‘the Leadership Development Programme in Nursing Development Units \(NDUs\)’ in Germany. One of the outcomes from implementing the Framework has been the development of a new nursing organisational system to support and help embed person\-centredness in the units. The Framework has been translated into German and a guidance book has been developed for use across the health system in the Deggendorf region of Germany.  Nurses use this guidance book to reflect on their everyday practice *\(Evidence Source 9\)*, mapping situations to the framework and keeping notes: this forms the basis of reflection rounds with the team *.* Changes to practice include better ‘knowing’ of the patient and their family, more effective patient handover reports, implementation of a new nursing organisation system and a focus on continuous quality improvement *\(Evidence Source 10\).* The processes and outcomes from this work have been integrated into bachelor of nursing education programmes in Deggendorf Institute of Technology \(academic partner for the programme\) and collaboration extended to Switzerland and Austria. 

 Overall, the reach and significance of the impact, evidenced through these impact themes, demonstrates person\-centred outcomes for service\-users, healthcare staff and health systems.

###  5. Sources to corroborate the impact 

 **Evidence 1** **The National Person\-centred Cultures Programme** brings together a collection of narratives written by participants of the national programme six\-months after they completed the 12\-month facilitator development programme.  The narratives present details of changes to structures, processes and resulting outcomes in a variety of care settings across the Irish health system. 

 **Evidence 2** is a copy of the **Irish Health Service Executive’s ‘Health Services Change Guide’**. This guide was produced by the National Quality Improvement \(QI\) Leadership Team who are responsible for the upscaling of QI activities across the health system.  The team worked with members of the national programme \(evidence 1\) to generate a set of person\-centred principles to be integrated into QI programmes.  This is evidenced in pages 194\-197 of the guide. 

 **Evidence 3 Improving patient and staff outcomes using practice development**  is a peer\-reviewed international publication by Hennessey, C.E. and Fry, M. \(2016\)  [https://doi.org/10.1108/IJHCQA\-02\-2016\-0020](https://doi.org/10.1108/IJHCQA-02-2016-0020) In this paper, the authors provide an overview of the New South Wales State ‘Essentials of Care’ programme which is modelled on the PCPF and associated measurement tools, as well as the outcomes arising from its implementation and evaluation in one of Sydney’s major tertiary healthcare facilities \(The Prince of Wales Hospital/health system\). 

 **Evidence 4 Identifying key performance indicators for nursing and midwifery care using a consensus approach** is a peer\-reviewed international publication by McCance et al \(2012\)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365\-2702.2011.03820.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03820.x) 

 The paper provides an overview of the development of the KPI as a systematic and national project. 

 **Evidence 5 and 6** **Evaluating the use of key performance indicators to evidence the patient experience and Implementing person\-centred key performance indicators to strengthen leadership in community nursing: A feasibility study** are peer\-reviewed international publications by McCance et al \(2015\)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12899](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12899) and McCance et al \(2020\)  [https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13107](https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13107) These papers provide evidence of impact of the implementation of the KPIs in different care settings.  Thus importantly identifying the transferability of this body of evidence and the implementation and evaluation methodologies. 

 **Evidence 7** **Knowing the person of the resident – a theoretical framework for Person\-centred Practice in Long\-term Care \(PeoPLe**\) provides an overview of the significant work that has taken place in the region of Lower Austria to design a person\-centred approach to assuring and accrediting care home quality in that region.  Austria doesn’t have a national quality assurance and accreditation system for care homes and so this work is forming the basis for ongoing national developments. 

 **Evidence 8a, 8b, 8c** **NHS and Health Improvement Scotland policy/guidance documents** provide significant evidence of the impact of quality improvement work in specialist dementia units as part of a National Programme by Health Improvement Scotland, ‘Focus on Dementia’.  It demonstrates the processes used including the use of the observation tool, the WCCAT and together these evidence sources demonstrate outcomes for persons living with dementia, teams and cultures at local and national levels. 

 **Evidence 9** is a **German translation of the PCPF** and applied to the regional Nursing Development Unit programme in that region. Whilst **Evidence 10** is the **transcript of an interview held with the academic partner for that program**me, where she outlines the person\-centred processes used, learning strategies engaged, outcomes arising and key learning to inform ongoing and further implementation activity.

######  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on personalised speech synthesis has led to improved quality of life and commercial impact. A new spin\-out company \(SpeakUnique Ltd, attracting over GBP510,000 investment\), established in collaboration with clinicians, provides personalised synthetic voices for users even when their speech is already degraded \(e.g. as a result of motor neuron disease\). As well improving as the **quality of life** of people who have lost their voice, the research has led to **new legislation** guaranteeing access to communication support for all patients suffering voice loss. King’s research has also underpinned **commercial products and services** offered by leading technology companies ObEN and Papercup. 
","
######  2. Underpinning research 

 The multidisciplinary \(Linguistics and Informatics\) Centre for Speech Technology Research \(CSTR\) is a world leader in the automatic conversion of written language into speech, known as Text\-To\-Speech \(TTS\). Founded in 1984, CSTR currently houses 13 academic staff and 15 PhD students. **King** has been director of the Centre since 2011. Working collaboratively with a number of CSTR academics, notably **Yamagishi**, King has made important contributions to the development of personalized synthetic speech, where the resulting voice sounds like a particular individual \(rather than an “off the shelf” voice\). Key research insights include: 

####  Adaptive statistical parametric speech synthesis 

 King and colleagues have developed novel mathematical methods and implemented them in their free\-to\-use TTS toolkits Festival \[3.1\] and Merlin \[3.3\] which adapt an “average voice” synthesis model \(trained using speech from multiple speakers\) to the voice of a new target speaker using much less speech from the target speaker compared with previous approaches \[3.2\]. 

####  Personalised speech synthesis 

 Using the adaptive framework \(above\), King and colleagues have developed algorithms and software that can automatically create a personalised synthetic voice for a target speaker using just a few minutes of data \(“voice cloning”\). King and colleagues demonstrated this approach by creating thousands of personalised synthetic voices \[3.4\] including for children \[3.5\]. Furthermore, the techniques developed in \[3.2\] work even with lower quality recordings \(e.g. web videos\) than was previously feasible for speech synthesis. 

####  Voice reconstruction 

 King and colleagues built on the above research to develop personalised speech synthesis methods which enable voice reconstruction even when the target speakers already have disordered speech due to a neurological condition such as motor neuron disease \[3.6\]. The resulting synthetic speech repairs the disordered aspects, resulting in normal\-sounding, intelligible, personalised speech.

######  4. Details of the impact 

####  Impact on quality of life for people who are losing their voice 

 Research in CSTR, led by King, has made it possible to blend a range of donor voices to best approximate an individual’s own voice. This allows people to create a personalised synthetic voice, even if their own speech has already degraded. This development is especially useful for people with conditions like motor neuron disease \(MND\), who often experience degenerative speech loss. 

 King’s research developed into a collaboration with the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic at University of Edinburgh. The **Speak:Unique** project – which included a Scottish Government funded \(GBP200,000\) trial run in partnership with 4 NHS Scotland health boards – provided personalised voices to 168 MND patients using Assistive and Augmentative Communication \(AAC\) devices. This figure represents approximately 42% of those living with MND in Scotland in any given year \[5.1\]. Feedback from patients confirms that being able to use a personalised synthetic voice enabled them to **retain a sense of self and dignity** in the face of a devastating and incurable disease: they felt more “like themselves”, less controlled by their condition, more independent, socially capable, and closer to their loved ones. Patients reported: 

 “Where someone has lost their voice through a degenerative condition, um, it \[the personalised voice\] has got to create a more powerful link if it sounds something like the person. Because the emotional bond you have with someone you know, is their voice. It feels different to somebody else’s voice” \[5.2, p. 5\]. 

 “My grandchildren said ‘It sounds just like Gramps\!’” \[5.2, p. 5\]. 

 “I mean, you are your voice, aren’t you? I mean you can sit in a wheelchair, but if you can still communicate then, it’s still you that’s doing the talking. So yeah, it’s really just that it’s ... it’s so your personality as well... it’s a huge thing to be able to still communicate and people know that it’s you that’s doing the talking and not a machine really. With it being your own voice, I think makes it even more you...” \[5.2, p. 5\]. 

 Based on this initial application of King’s research in Scotland, **SpeakUnique Ltd** launched as a standalone spin\-out company in June 2020. SpeakUnique Ltd aims to provide access to personalised synthetic speech for all AAC device users around the world. Users of their service include not only patients with MND, but also sufferers of multiple sclerosis \(MS\), cerebral palsy, Huntington’s disease, and vocal cancer \[5.1\]. Using King’s research, SpeakUnique Ltd is able to simulate all accents of English, including those of people for whom English is a second language, allowing it to be available to any English speaker globally. As of its launch, SpeakUnique Ltd employs 8 people and has attracted over GBP510,000 of investment \(including approximately GBP200,000 in private investment\), as well as awards from Innovate UK \(GBP245,000\); a Royal Society of Edinburgh Enterprise Fellowship \(GBP65,000\); an Emerging Innovation Award from Edinburgh Innovations \(GBP1,500\); and semi\-finalist award in the 2019 Converge Challenge \(winning prize value GBP50,000\) \[5.1\]. 

 Two major MND charities/organisations \(MND Association and MND Scotland\) as well as the UK\-wide charity for people with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy \(PSPA\) have agreed to cover the cost of SpeakUnique’s personalised speech synthesis for people in the UK \[5.1\]. The cost of a synthetic voice can also be reclaimed through NHS Scotland for individuals in Scotland who have or will lose the ability to speak, regardless of their medical condition \( *see change to legislation below*\) \[5.1\]. In addition, SpeakUnique offers a service whereby currently healthy people can record and “bank” their voices, which can subsequently be used to create an accurate synthetic equivalent should they experience vocal loss in the future. From June 2020 to December 2020, SpeakUnique has created voices for people in 8 countries, trained over 150 healthcare professionals; it cannot disclose how many voices it created, but its website received over 35,000 visits and social media adverts have been viewed over 200,000 times \[5.1\]. Individual patients confirm significant benefits to their quality of life: 

 “I feel like I’ve saved an important part of me. Every time I use it \[my SpeakUnique synthesised voice\] it makes me smile.” \[5.1\] 

 “It’s so hard to lose speech, so anything that reduces that sense of loss helps.” \[5.1\] 

 “Several years ago, I participated in a voice banking research project \[Speak:Unique\], and spent an interesting afternoon recording phrases in a soundproof studio. I was motivated to do this partly because it seemed such a great innovation, and partly because I enjoyed public speaking and using my voice. I had no idea then that I would have a personal need of those recordings. But, last year I was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, and my speech has been badly affected. It has been hugely important to me to have been able to get help from the SpeakUnique development team, and to acquire a synthetic voice based on my own voice recordings. It makes such a difference to be able to retain some of my personal identity.” \[5.1\] 

####  Impact on Scottish health legislation and public awareness 

 One of Speak:Unique’s earliest participants was MND patient and celebrated campaigner Gordon Aikman. Aikman, who died from MND in 2017, described how important it is “that patients don’t just get *a* voice, but get *their own* voice back” \[5.2, p. 2\]. Aikman was so impressed with the concept and the technology behind it that he lobbied to bring communication support and voice banking to wider public and policy attention. The result was an **amendment to the Health \(Tobacco, Nicotine etc. and Care\) \(Scotland\) Act 2016** to include routine provision of Communication Aids to patients of all conditions that cause difficulty speaking \[5.3\]. The Scottish Government, in its 2019 progress report on the provision communication equipment and support resulting from the Act, estimated the potential reach of the policy, as of February 2020, as “... around 27,000 benefiting from some type of AAC, with 2,700 benefiting from powered communication aids”. The significance of this policy change has been directly recognised by the Scottish Government, as captured by this tweet: 



 Figure 1 Tweet from Scottish Government \(March 2019\) “Communications equipment and support for those who have difficulty speaking has changed the lives of people like Craig. From 19 March, a new law means anybody who needs it must receive it” 

 Addressing the Scottish Parliament’s Health and Sport Committee on 26 January 2016, the Scottish Government Minister for Public Health said: “I also highlight the on\-going work on voice banking, which is an important development in augmentative and alternative communication \[…\] We thank Gordon Aikman for bringing the \[Speak:Unique\] research work to our attention” \(Maureen Watt, Scottish Minister for Public Health, November 2014 to May 2019\) \[5.4, p. 18\]. 

 The resulting **media coverage** followed not only Aikman, but also other SpeakUnique users. BBC2’s documentary *My Year with MND*, showed SpeakUnique recreate the voice of Rob Burrow, a former Rugby League player diagnosed with MND in 2020; BBC2’s 2017 documentary *MND and 22\-Year\-Old Me* followed self\-confessed “chatterbox” Lucy Lintott; BBC1’s *Breakfast* programme \(2 June 2017\) featured the creation of a synthetic Yorkshire voice for a man with MND; BBC1’s *The One Show* \(20 June 2016\) contained a feature in which Dr Michael Mosley described how Speak:Unique was helping MND sufferers by voice banking \[5.5\]. At least 20 major media articles have covered SpeakUnique’s work, including *The Times*; *The Guardian*; *The Huffington Post; The Metro; ITV News* and *BBC News* websites. This coverage brought personalised speech synthesis research, its benefits to AAC users, and the difficulties faced by people who have lost their voice through illness, to wider public attention \[5.5\]. 

 Since 2016, a digital interactive display on Speak:Unique has featured as part of the **National Museum of Scotland**’s permanent collection \(over 2 million visitors per year\), highlighting the role of personalised speech in the development of communication. The Museum’s Principal Curator of Communications describes how Speak:Unique allowed the museum to meet several aims, including bringing the story of speech synthesis up to date \[5.6\]. 

####  Impact on commercial product development 

 In 2016, King was approached by USA\-based company **ObEN** \(100 employees; established 2014; attracted more than USD23.7million of investment\). ObEN provides personalised digital avatars that “look, sound, and behave like users”. Personalised speech synthesis is “a key part” of their products \[5.7\]. King’s research, including the Merlin and Festival toolkits, “has been crucial in helping us achieve our aim of building a personalised voice interface to work with our projects” \[5.7\]. King’s work on expressive speech synthesis helped them “realise and improve our voice personalisation using a relatively small sample of audio recordings” \[5.7\]. ObEN’s work has been covered in *Forbes*, *Venture Beat*, *Gizmodo*, and *MIT Technology Review*. In 2019, ObEN used technology drawing on King’s research to produce digital avatars for the hosts of China Central Television’s *Spring Network Gala* \(approximately 1.8 billion viewers\). Personal AI \(PAI\) News \(launched May 2019\) is an iOS and Android news application with content delivered by the world’s first virtual anchor; PAI Care \(launched March 2019\) is a virtual assistant designed to monitor patients with congestive heart failure. “The fact that we were able to create these experiences is partly due to King’s research and his expertise in helping us improve our systems” \[5.7\]. 

 King’s research also informed London\-based company **Papercup Ltd** \(67 employees; established 2017; attracted more than GBP10million of investment\). Papercup allows online content creators to translate videos by generating personalised Spanish\-language voices that sound similar to the original speakers. Since their launch, King has provided technical advice, based on his research, on systems and implementation. Co\-founder and Chief Technology Officer confirms that they “would not have been able to build our state\-of\-the\-art speech synthesis system without King’s research and expertise \[...\]” King’s work on “prosody and expressiveness in text\-to\-speech systems gave us inspiration for our own proprietary systems and models” \[5.8\]. As of October 2020, Papercup has translated many thousands of hours of video for its clients, generating over 60 million unique views via digital content channels such as YouTube. Clients include Sky News, with whom Papercup partnered during 2020 to bring a Spanish language version of their news channel to YouTube. In its first 12 months, the new channel has attracted over 96,000 subscribers and over 26 million views, with metrics indicating a long average channel watch time, evidencing significant engagement. Sky News said, “The overall average watch time and completion on our new Spanish Sky News channel is so far above and beyond what we had expected. That’s testament to the quality of the Papercup solution \[…\] We now can get more bang for our buck using our existing content. And translating to Spanish is only just the first step. And it doesn’t stop with news; it can expand to sports, entertainment and educational content” \[5.8\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 “Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation” \(DNACPR\) notices were introduced with the intention of protecting people from an invasive intervention that they would not benefit from or would prefer not to have. University of Cambridge collaborative research has identified many problems with their use in practice, and has helped develop and evaluate a new patient\-centred approach – the “ReSPECT” process – to empower patients to make personalised decisions about their goals of care and preferences for resuscitation. Supported by the Resuscitation Council UK, and endorsed by the Royal College of Physicians, Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and other major bodies, ReSPECT has replaced the system of DNACPR notices across much of the NHS. It ensures that emergency decisions reflect patients’ priorities, it improves conversations around anticipatory care planning, it supports clinicians in emergency situations, and it reduces harms. ReSPECT is valued by patients and staff for its patient\-centred focus and clarity about goals of care. Its positive impacts for the NHS include reduced readmissions to hospital, with associated cost\-savings. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Supporting choices about resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest 

 When someone’s heart and breathing stop, cardiopulmonary resuscitation \(CPR\) can be used to try to revive them. CPR is invasive, involving repeated heavy pressure on the chest, possible use of electric shocks, and other measures. It may not work. Even when someone is resuscitated, and especially if they are already frail, they might live for just a short time longer, and then in a state of great suffering \(e.g. broken ribs\) as a result of the intervention. As not everyone wants to receive attempted CPR, it is important to understand and respect people’s wishes and ensure they are offered a chance in advance to make the choices that are right for them. “Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation” \(DNACPR\) notices were introduced with this in mind, with the aim of guiding those present on the best action to take \(or not take\) should an individual suffer cardiac arrest. However, University of Cambridge research showed that DNACPR notices are often variably implemented in practice, that they may have unintended negative consequences, with patients with DNACPR notices receiving suboptimal treatments, and that a new approach was needed. 

 A new patient\-centred approach to decisions 

 A long\-term programme of University of Cambridge research, much of it conducted in collaboration with the University of Warwick, other universities, and major stakeholders including patients themselves and leading charities such as Marie Curie and the Resuscitation Council UK, has studied DNACPR practices. It identified misunderstandings, variations, and sub\-optimal practices in relation to DNACPR notices and, in response, has developed and evaluated a radically new approach to address this difficult issue. 

 A Cambridge\-led study of a large cohort in a UK hospital was important in establishing that DNACPR notices should not be equated with end\-of\-life: almost half of patients \(49%\) with a notice in place survived to discharge, and 17% were alive a year later \[1\]. Subsequent Cambridge research found, however, that rather than seeing it as a specific instruction that applied *only* in the event of a patient’s heart stopping, staff were inclined to misinterpret DNACPR notices as meaning that treatments other than CPR should also be withheld – they were confusing DNACPR status with end\-of\-life \[2\]. Further research confirmed this finding and identified the potentially stigmatising effects of how DNACPR notices were documented \[3\]. It also found that conversations between clinicians and patients and their families about DNACPR were apt to be avoided or done poorly \[3\]. 

 Prompted by this work, further Cambridge research led to the development of a new patient\-centred intervention known as the *Universal Form of Treatment Options*. It was based on the principle that the patient’s preferences for resuscitation should be discussed and documented in the context of their overall goals of care – not as an isolated decision. In an evaluative study, patients experienced fewer harms, and less severe harms, when the recommendation not to attempt CPR was recorded as part of the person’s overall goals using the *Universal Form of Treatment Options*, rather than on a standalone DNACPR notice \[4\]. The study showed that the approach not only enhanced clarity about goals of care: it also changed the character of handover conversations between staff on hospital wards to focus in a more holistic way on the patient’s condition and overall goals rather than their DNACPR status, suggesting that DNACPR notices were no longer being conflated with end\-of\-life decisions. 

 ReSPECT: the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment 

 The patient\-centred principles established by the research on the *Universal Form of Treatment Options* critically informed “ReSPECT”, a subsequent large\-scale effort to improve treatment and care planning. It was developed to facilitate and record shared understanding of emergency care and planning with patients in a highly personalised way. With leadership from Cambridge, Warwick and others in a collaborative working group, development of ReSPECT was distinguished both by the extent of its stakeholder involvement, including patient advocates and a public consultation that drew over 1000 responses, and by its evidence\-based approach \[5\]. 

 Aimed at empowering patients and carers, the ReSPECT process involves focused conversations between clinicians, patients, and families, with outcomes recorded on a specially\-designed form \[5\]. It supports high quality, patient\-centred discussions about goals of care, with resuscitation recommendations for an emergency identified only after clinicians establish patients’ priorities. The ReSPECT process identifies the patient’s preference for the overall focus of care \(e.g. life\-sustaining treatment *or* symptom control\), tailors clinical guidance to the individual \(e.g. regarding appropriateness of hospital admission\), and highlights interventions that would not help, or that the patient would not want – including, but not only, CPR. The ReSPECT process draws extensively on the *Universal Form of Treatment Options* work \[4\], as the only format for which good evidence exists in documenting treatment goals in this context.

 Advance decisions about resuscitation: a global health and ethical issue 

 Globally, around 60 million people die every year, including about 600,000 in the UK \(World Health Organization statistics\). In high\-income countries like the UK, around half of deaths take place in hospital settings \(Public Health England statistics\). By the mid\-2000s, about 80% of the people who died in UK hospitals had a DNACPR notice in place, directly affecting about 240,000 individuals every year \( *Resuscitation* 2005\). Yet, as Cambridge research helped to show, DNACPR notices were prone to multiple unintended consequences and were often sub\-optimally implemented. This led to the recognition that a more personalised approach to making decisions was needed – one that could reflect the priorities, values and preferences of individual patients and the people important to them. University of Cambridge research has been important both in identifying problems in approaches to DNACPR notices and in developing and evaluating a practical solution – ReSPECT – now adopted at large scale in the NHS. 

 Empowering personalised decisions about goals of care, including resuscitation 

 The ReSPECT process, which links discussions about resuscitation with decisions about other aspects of emergency care and treatment, creates personalised recommendations for a person’s clinical care and treatment in the event of a future emergency where they would be unable to make or express choices because their heart has stopped. It provides greater clarity about patients’ priorities, it facilitates communication, and it reduces harms compared with standalone processes – such as DNACPR – that focus only on withholding resuscitation. 

 Impact on policy 

 Cambridge researchers and collaborators have worked in a highly engaged way with multiple stakeholders, including patients and families, policy\-makers, clinicians, charities, and system leaders to improve processes relating to treatment decisions and to secure their implementation. For example, in January 2015 they provided written evidence on their research to the UK Parliament’s Health Select Committee inquiry into end\-of\-life care and gave briefings to its key members, helping to stimulate understanding of the problems of DNACPR notices and the need for a process engaging broadly with patients’ goals. The Committee recommended *“that the Government review the use of DNACPR orders in acute care settings, including whether resuscitation decisions should be considered in the context of overall treatment plans. This Committee believes there is a case for standardising the recording mechanisms for the NHS in England”* \[A\]. 

 The Department of Health responded positively to this recommendation for improved processes focused on patient goals **.** Later in 2015, it recorded that a *“Working Group, co\-chaired by the President of the Resuscitation Council \(UK\) and the Head of Nursing Practice at the Royal College of Nursing has been established to look into this issue. The aim is to develop a national form that records decisions about CPR and other life\-sustaining treatment in the context of a broader plan”* \[B\] *.* The working group continues to meet regularly, chaired by Dr Fritz since 2018. Dr Fritz has also presented the findings and implications of the research programme \[4\] to other key stakeholder groups with influence on practice – for example to the Royal College of Physicians, General Medical Council and British Medical Association ethics groups. 

 The ReSPECT process, designed with leadership from Cambridge, Warwick and others, supports conversations about goals of care and generates a summary of patients’ wishes recorded on a specially designed form focused on patients’ personal priorities for care and agreed clinical recommendations about care and treatment \[5,C\]. The form is intended to be used in an emergency situation where a patient is unable to make decisions. Importantly, having a ReSPECT form does not automatically mean the patient is not for resuscitation – just that their goals have been discussed and documented, forming the basis for individualised care decisions. 

 ReSPECT is now referenced in influential guidelines and reports. For example, the Royal College of Physicians’ *Talking about dying* makes the recommendation: “ *Consider using a structured tool, such as the ReSPECT process, to support conversations and documentation”* \[D\]. The Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine’s *Care at the end of life* cites ReSPECT as a valuable resource \[D\]. The Resuscitation Council UK has recognised the importance of ReSPECT as a way of ensuring that individuals received appropriate CPR, and has funded a full\-time clinical lead to support its adoption in England and Scotland. It writes that ReSPECT can *“change the culture of both patients and clinicians in a way that will lead to better communication between them and ultimately better person\-centred care”* \[E\]. 

 Changes to organisational policies 

 Launched in 2017, the ReSPECT process \[C,F\] has already replaced DNACPR notices in many NHS organisations, including hospitals, clinical commissioning groups and ambulance trusts. For example, of 227 hospital, mental health and ambulance trusts in England, 87 are now using ReSPECT and 38 are actively working towards adoption \[E\]. These changes have happened even though there is no national mandate or financial incentive for the process, reflecting widespread recognition of ReSPECT’s value in delivering better, more patient\-centred care. 

 Impact for patients and the public 

 People living in areas that have adopted ReSPECT now have the opportunity to document their preferences about goals of treatment – and the clinical recommendations which align to them – on a nationally recognised form that will be respected in an emergency. This means that people are less likely to receive treatments they do not want, and that they would have refused if they had capacity. The ReSPECT process can be used with anyone, but has special relevance for some people who may be especially empowered by being allowed to make their priorities and preferences known – for example those with complex health needs, nearing the end of their lives, or at risk of sudden deterioration \[F\], all groups that are rapidly growing. 

 Evidence from adopters of ReSPECT indicates positive impacts for patients, families and clinicians nationwide. For example, a pilot of the ReSPECT process in NHS Forth Valley \[G\], conducted in 2017–19 and covering 200 patients, found that it led to multiple improvements. Patients and carers felt more involved in decision\-making and rated the process positively \(80% rating their experience as excellent and 20% as good\), and staff were better able to access the information to inform decision\-making in an emergency \[G\]. Usha Grieve, Director of Partnerships and Information at Compassion in Dying, states: 

 *“Evidence from our service users indicates strongly the need for a changed approach around end\-of\-life decision making both in terms of how wishes for care and treatment are discussed and how such wishes are recorded and communicated in emergencies. ReSPECT \[…\] places CPR decisions within the broader framework of a person’s priorities and needs. The impact of both these things is that people’s wishes are more frequently discussed, more easily known about and therefore more likely to be respected in an emergency scenario, and when these things happen it ultimately results in people having a better experience at the end of life.”* \[H\] 

 Impact for professionals 

 ReSPECT minimises confusion and ambiguity for professionals, including first responders during emergencies. Most \(88%\) staff in the Forth Valley evaluation felt that the ReSPECT process would enable them to deliver the most appropriate care for an individual \[G\]. Dr Dhushy Kumar, recent chair of the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee \(JRCALC\), states that *“the research in Cambridge has directly contributed to an overall change in approach to and discussion and documentation of resuscitation decisions: this has made it easier for ambulance clinicians to deliver excellent and appropriate care for patients”* \[I\]. 

 JP Nolan, head of nursing at the Royal College of Nurses from 2012\-2016, states that *“utilising and disseminating the research outputs on UFTO \[Universal Form of Treatment Options\], significant advances in policy and practice have been achieved \[… including\] practice based guidance on decisions related to CPR conducted at RCN and RCN Congress \[and\] improvements to the regulation of Nurses and Nursing related to end of life care”* \[J\]. 

 Impact for the NHS 

 The ReSPECT process has been adopted and welcomed across primary, pre\-hospital and secondary care, and has enhanced communication between these settings \[E,K\]. Evidence from the Forth Valley evaluation suggests that adopting ReSPECT can also improve service\-level outcomes: 27% of patients with a ReSPECT form were readmitted to hospital within three months of discharge, versus 43% of those without \(a statistically significant difference\), possibly because patients with ReSPECT forms have their preferred place of care recorded \[G\]. On average, the number of readmissions within three months of discharge per patient was 0.34 for patients with ReSPECT forms and 0.49 for those without. Assuming a national average non\-elective inpatient stay cost of GBP3,076 \(PSSRU Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2019\), this difference represents a cost saving of GBP461 per patient. During the Forth Valley pilot \(September 2017 to May 2018\), 200 patients received a ReSPECT form, an annual equivalent of 267 patients. Therefore, the total annual cost\-saving associated with use of ReSPECT was GBP123,087 in this one location. Scaled across the many sites now using ReSPECT nationally, the savings amount to millions of pounds annually. 

 ReSPECT and COVID\-19 

 The COVID\-19 pandemic has heightened the relevance and urgency of advanced care planning and thinking about patients’ priorities with sensitivity and compassion, as the potential for rapid deterioration makes anticipatory decision\-making vital. ReSPECT is extensively referenced in the supporting documentation for NICE’s COVID\-19 rapid guideline for critical care \(NG159\) as a means of supporting decisions about care and treatment, and initiating conversations with patients and families in difficult situations \[L\]. The Resuscitation Council UK has produced a webpage to help patients and their families make best use of ReSPECT during the pandemic \[L\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by UCL has shown that reorganising UK hospital stroke services, so that all patients can be treated in large specialist stroke units, results in better care and outcomes. This evidence was pivotal in hospitals across Greater Manchester reorganising their stroke services in 2015, leading to significant improvements in care for approximately 20,000 stroke patients and 340 additional lives saved in the five years since the changes took place, \(approximately 4,000 patients treated and 68 additional lives saved per year\). The research has been central to sustaining London hospitals’ centralised stroke system, allowing them to maintain better stroke care and patient outcomes in this region. It has also shaped national policy in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and influenced regional plans for improving stroke care. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Stroke patients who receive evidence\-based care are more likely to survive and make better recoveries. Centralising hospital stroke services in high\-volume specialist units has been recommended to improve stroke care delivery. 

 In 2010, the NHS in London \(population 8.2 million, approximately 11,000 strokes per year\) and Greater Manchester \(GM\) \(population 2.7 million, approximately 4,000 strokes per year\) centralised hospital stroke services, developing high\-volume ‘hyper acute stroke units’ \(HASUs\) and offering rapid access to specialist stroke care, with local units offering ongoing care nearer home. The systems implemented in the two cities differed significantly: in London, all patients were eligible for HASU treatment. In GM, only patients reaching hospital within four hours of symptom onset were eligible. In 2015, GM adopted a system similar to London’s, with all patients eligible for HASU treatment **\[R1\]**. 

 This research was funded by the NIHR Health Services and Delivery Research Programme from 2011 to 2017, led by Professor Naomi Fulop at UCL’s Department of Applied Health Research, in collaboration with King’s College London and the University of Manchester. It analysed national data, including Hospital Episodes Statistics, Office for National Statistics mortality data, and the national stroke audit \(using other urban areas in England as a control\) to study effects of centralising hospital stroke services in large, urban settings \- on patient outcomes, quality of care, and value for money. It used qualitative data to examine how such changes are planned, implemented, and sustained **\[R1\]**. 

 **Key findings: outcomes, care delivery, and cost\-effectiveness** 

 The initial research analysed care and outcomes from 2008 to 2012. After stroke services were centralised, length of hospital stay in London and GM was reduced more than elsewhere in England \- but only London saw significantly fewer patient deaths than other urban areas \(with 96 additional lives saved per year\) **\[R2\]**. Underlying this, only London patients were more likely to receive evidence\-based care \(for example, rapid access to brain scan, specialist clinician assessment, and administration of clot\-busting drugs if appropriate\) than elsewhere. While HASUs treated 93% of stroke patients in London, GM HASUs treated only 39% **\[R3\]**. Both London and GM centralisations were cost\-effective \(by delivering more Quality\-Adjusted Life Years than stroke services elsewhere in England, at the NICE cost\-effectiveness threshold of GBP20,000 to GBP30,000\) but London achieved this through saving more lives, while GM achieved it through patients having shorter hospital stays **\[R4\]**. 

 The research team then repeated their analyses to examine care and outcomes from 2013 to 2016. This showed that, following further centralisation in 2015, GM HASUs treated 86% of stroke patients, resulting in 68 fewer deaths per year. This research also demonstrated that the effects on care and outcomes across London hospitals were sustained from 2013 to 2016 **\[R5\]**. 

 A limitation of this work is that the UCL researchers could not analyse impact on quality of life directly, as data are not collected sufficiently reliably. However, the UCL team’s cost\-effectiveness analyses modelled quality of life \(drawing on the South London Stroke Register\). Further, research suggests that access to high quality care is associated with better quality of life, and a key effect of clot\-busting drugs is to improve independence and reduce disability, key components of quality of life in stroke survivors. 

 **Key findings: influence of implementation approaches** 

 UCL’s qualitative research showed that London’s simpler, more inclusive referral pathway and single launch date meant ambulance and hospital staff had a clear understanding of the new system and when it would ‘go live’. GM’s more selective referral pathway reduced patient eligibility and its phased implementation caused uncertainty amongst staff. All London’s services had to achieve quality standards, linked to financial incentives and supported by the local stroke network, which ensured that services had the capacity to provide evidence\-based care. In GM, services were not required to meet standards and staff had less hands\-on support, leading to varied capacity to deliver evidence\-based care. These differences in service model and implementation approaches in London and GM contributed to different proportions of patients being treated in HASU and different likelihood of receiving evidence\-based care, in turn leading to more lives being saved in London hospitals **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 This research has contributed to further centralisation and the lives of more stroke patients being saved in Greater Manchester \(GM\). Furthermore, it has supported sustained effectiveness of the London stroke care system; helped shape national policy in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland; and has been cited in documents making the case for regional stroke service reorganisations. 

 **Driving improvements in care delivery and outcomes in Greater Manchester** 

 Between 2012 and 2014, GM hospitals had attempted to centralise their stroke services, but changes were delayed, as a result of national reorganisations of governance and commissioning of healthcare, and local challenges with governance and service provision. UCL evidence **\[R1\]**, **\[R2\]** on patient mortality was pivotal in driving further change in GM. The researchers shared their findings with senior members of the GM Stroke Network in February 2014 at the project steering committee meeting. At GM stakeholders’ request, in May 2014, the UCL team calculated the potential impact of further reorganisation and estimated that an additional 50 lives per year could be saved by doing this. GM stroke leaders used this figure to argue against any further delays. One senior stroke physician stated: “ *being able to go to meetings and say to people ‘We’re looking at fifty excess deaths a year …’ because it was a paper and it was a medical journal, not just another audit report or just another internal report, I think that has had a significant impact*.” **\[R1\]** 

 **Supporting local buy\-in**: The argument that further change would increase access to evidence\-based care, also saving 50 additional lives per year, was central to a large regional publicity campaign, gaining support for the new system from the public, local authorities, commissioners, and providers in GM. This included tweets from local providers and commissioners, an infographic \(see below\) and a briefing, which stated: “ *if a similar approach is taken in GM it could result in 50 fewer deaths each year. The changes we are introducing in GM are based on a strong evidence base that it works*”. 

  

 **Fewer deaths from stroke:  Findings **\[R1\]**, **\[R5\]** showed that, following further centralisation, 86% of GM stroke patients were treated in a HASU, resulting in an estimated 68 fewer deaths per year than if GM had reduced mortality at the same rate as other large urban areas in England \(improvements in other large urban areas are likely to have been achieved through wider efforts to achieve national quality standards combined with public health interventions\). National stroke audit data from July to September 2020 **\[S1\]** confirm that GM stroke services remain among the highest performing in England, with all routinely\-admitting stroke services regularly achieving ‘A’ or ‘B’ national audit ratings – classified as indicating world\-class stroke care as defined by the Royal College of Physicians. 

 **Providing evidence to sustain centralised stroke services in London** 

 Fulop and colleagues presented their clinical outcomes findings to London’s stroke clinical leaders in November 2014. From December 2014, these findings were cited in London’s Stroke acute commissioning and tariff guidance, published by the NHS Strategic Clinical Network. The guidance presents the clinical standards used to assess London stroke services **\[S2\]** and cites the finding from **\[R2\]** that: *“reconfiguration resulted in a significant decline in risk\-adjusted mortality, with approximately 168 lives saved at 90 days after admission, and a 7% reduction in length of stay in the first 21 months”*. Senior management and frontline clinicians have said that the UCL research on outcomes has played an important part in sustaining the London system. For example, a representative of NHS England in London described making the case to commissioners to continue funding the London system: 

 “*The team bringing their findings to the Stroke Clinical Leadership Group was really valuable \[…\] it gave us a really good understanding of the research. This ‘heads up’ was crucial in helping clinical leads understand and share the main messages more widely. Your evidence was instrumental in addressing pushback from local commissioners and trusts \[...\] the fact that we could point to impartial research showing the London system had saved lives and reduced length of stay really swayed CCGs to support the tariff. Your work has also helped London to be seen as an aspirational model or ‘gold standard’ at regional and national level”* **\[S2\].** 

 The research team’s follow\-up analysis **\[R5\]** suggests that, from April 2013 to March 2016, London patients were significantly more likely to receive evidence\-based care than patients elsewhere, and the impact on patient mortality was sustained. National stroke audit data from July to September 2020 **\[S1\]** suggest that London remains a high\-performing system. Like GM, London is amongst the only areas in the English NHS where all routinely admitting stroke services regularly achieve ‘A’ or ‘B’ ratings, which indicate world class stroke care. 

 **Influencing national policy and regional planning** 

 National and regional leadership have used UCL’s work on impact of centralisation of stroke services on patient outcomes **\[R2\]**, **\[R5\]** and quality of care **\[R3\]**, **\[R5\]** as key evidence in their recommendations to centralise hospital stroke services. Findings on the impact on stroke patient outcomes **\[R2\]** have been cited in NHS England’s ‘Five Year Forward View’ **\[S3\]**, the Scottish Government’s ‘National Clinical Strategy for Scotland’ **\[S4\]**, NHS England’s ‘Configuration support guide for stroke services’ \(2015\) and proposals to reorganise stroke services in Northern Ireland **\[S5\]**. Fulop and colleagues’ findings of impact on stroke care delivery **\[R3\]** are cited in England’s ‘National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke’ **\[S6\]**. UCL’s work on both implementation and impact of change **\[R2\]**, **\[R3\]**, **\[R6\]** was cited in the Stroke Association’s position paper on stroke service reorganisation **\[S7\]**, and 15 ‘case for change’ documents across the English NHS, of which three stroke service centralisations – in South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; West Yorkshire and Harrogate; and North Cumbria – have been implemented **\[S8\]**. Finally, the UCL findings of lives saved per year in London **\[R2\]**, and Greater Manchester **\[R5\]**, were cited by change leaders in Kent and Medway in their submission to a judicial review of their proposal to centralise local stroke services into three HASUs; the judicial review ruled in favour of the changes in early 2020 **\[S9\]**. 

 **Shaping the ‘NHS Long Term Plan’**: UCL’s 2014 research on stroke outcomes was one of just 11 documents cited in an internal paper resulting in stroke’s inclusion as a priority in the ‘NHS Long Term Plan’ **\[S10\]**. This followed considerable engagement activity carried out through an NIHR Knowledge mobilisation Fellowship held by Ramsay, who, for example, presented key findings at national workshops for development of the ‘NHS Long Term Plan’. A representative of the team leading its development stated: “ *The research was clearly presented in initial publication, ensuring it was accessible to less academic audiences, with clear messages more easily translated into policy initiatives. This led us to highlight the work as one of a small number of key references within our internal proposal for ‘NHS Long Term Plan’ prioritisation. The research clearly strengthened our case, and helped support its ultimate success. We have subsequently continued to refer back to this research and to reference within further documentation.*”\- Team member, ‘NHS England Long Term Plan’ **\[S10\]**. 

 Prioritisation in the ‘NHS Long Term Plan’ has resulted in additional resources for development of stroke services across England, including the new Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks, which will reshape organisation and delivery of stroke care across the whole of the English NHS over the coming years.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Stories created by, with, and for young people with disabilities and other forms of disadvantage \(e.g. bereaved, in care, with mental ill\-health or living in areas of deprivation\) convey voices of young people seldom heard and have the capacity to enhance well\-being and resilience. The research has enhanced the confidence, capabilities, social and literacy skills of a core group of 13 such young people and around 40 disadvantaged others they connected with directly. The team of academics, young people, Barnardo’s, and community writers co\-produced 48 short fictionalised stories. 100 sets of these have been distributed as print books throughout Barnardo’s, in schools and colleges, and to social workers and healthcare professionals in training and practice in UK settings. Digital audio/video versions are accessible to diverse audiences through five co\-created interactive story\-telling artefacts, a free mobile app, and the project website, leading to changes in attitudes, agency and well\-being in children and families, initially in NW England and now across UK and in international contexts, including Japan, Finland and Indonesia.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Children and young people are seldom taken seriously as experts on their own lives, particularly those who are marginalised due to disability, economic or social circumstances. Such children face discrimination and a lack of opportunities in education and future employment. This interdisciplinary research explores and harnesses the benefits of storytelling as a means of eliciting voice and empowering participants, while producing outputs accessible to wide\-ranging audiences. The work draws together the fields of child and youth participation, health, social work, digital design, literature and creative writing to highlight challenges faced by children and young people with disabilities, learning difficulties, who are in care, young carers, or disadvantaged in other ways, while also harnessing their talents. The co\-produced story outputs are used to help other young people and those who work with them to overcome adversity and challenge stereotypical identities. 

 Stories2Connect was a three\-year AHRC\-funded research project drawing together five academics from three universities and a range of disciplines: Prof Candice Satchwell \(PI\), Prof Cath Larkins and Dr Helen Day, University of Central Lancashire; Prof Bernie Carter, University of Central Lancashire until 2017 then Edge Hill University; Prof Paul Coulton, Lancaster University, and in partnership with Barnardo’s in Lancashire. Stories2Connect involved 13 disadvantaged young people \(age 11\-25\) becoming a group of ‘young researchers’ collaborating with adult researchers. The young researchers interviewed one another and connected with around 40 other young people to collect stories of resilience and transformation. In workshops, which have continued at the University of Central Lancashire beyond the end of the project, the young people learned a range of social and research skills, collaborated in designing story\-telling devices, and helped to co\-write fictionalised stories. 

 From approximately 100 peer\-interviews we co\-produced 43 illustrated short\-story books \[1\], 28 short animated films \[1\], one documentary film about a deaf\-blind child, and five co\-created digital\-story\-telling artefacts comprising: a suitcase, a rabbit in a hat, an arcade machine, an advice machine, and interactive map with free downloadable mobile app \[1\]. These innovative digital machines contain audio\-video versions of the stories to increase accessibility for diverse audiences. The team of adult and young researchers held three public festivals \(AHRC story\-telling festival 2015; ESRC social science festival 2017; Lancashire Science Festival 2016\) and co\-presented at conferences including a community\-university expo in Vancouver and an exchange visit to Japan. Researchers engaged with teachers, children, social workers and other professionals in schools, universities, and community settings; the fictionalised stories in both digital and book forms are available for free distribution in educational and public venues. The research has provided methodological insights into participatory work with young people \[2,6\], and insights for community workers \[4\] and teachers using stories \[5\] for the benefit of both participants and audiences. As a result, we know more about: young people’s perspectives on challenges and resilience \[6\]; literacies engaged in by young people; the meaning and impact of ‘story’ for a range of audiences; advances in co\-design and co\-writing with children and young people \[2,3\]; benefits for health and well\-being associated with narrative research; and creating resources for professionals and educational uses of fictionalised stories \[5\]. The research was designed to have impact through the wider adoption of interdisciplinary approaches, innovative methodologies, and co\-production techniques including the co\-creation of print and digital artefacts for public use. Evaluation activities carried out included trialling story resources: with a home education group \(July 2018\), in a library \(August 2018\), at a Pupil Referral Unit \(2017\), in primary schools \(2017, 2018\), in FE colleges \(2019\), at the Lancashire Science Festival \(2016 and 2017\), and in therapeutic story\-sharing seminars with young people with disabilities \(2017, 2018\). We have helped children, professionals and publics who work with young people to understand some of the challenges that disabled and disadvantaged young people meet, to celebrate their strengths, and to bring about changes which facilitate young people realising their potential, for example, through literacy and PSHE curricula and social work interventions. Further funding \(all PI Satchwell\) has allowed the application of the methodologies in different contexts: two projects on agency of young people planning their careers \(Office for Students and Lancashire County Council funding\); creating stories with deaf children and young people in Indonesia and forging a self\-supporting relationship between deaf communities in Indonesia and India \(internal HEI QR\-GCRF\); autistic children’s responses to nature \(AHRC/NERC\) and marginalised children’s perspectives on landscape decision\-making \(AHRC/NERC\). Using funding from the latter, during the Covid\-19 lockdown in 2020, we delivered arts materials to disadvantaged children’s homes along with food parcels from a local charity and conducted online arts\-based activities which encouraged them to engage with and experience the benefits of the outdoor environment during a period of extreme isolation and deprivation.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> **Working with young people to gain confidence, skills, and develop relationships**</ins> 

 The project worked in partnership with the children’s charity Barnardo’s, whose Children’s Services Manager wrote: **“The workers noted profound differences in the young people over the course of the 3 years of the project, and subsequently as they have continued to be involved in projects at UCLan. In particular the young people have grown in confidence, social skills, literacy skills”** \[C, J1\]. In an evaluation interview conducted by researchers a Young Researcher with autism said: **“I think I've developed amazingly. It hasn't just like made me have fun, it's actually improved who I am”** \[A\]. The young researchers and some of the children and young people with whom they conducted interviews have continued their connections to pursue further research, for example with Youth Councils against Knife Crime. Funding won from EPSRC for Telling Tales of Engagement brings the network of participants together to create a series of short interactive films about the impact of Stories2Connect, giving the young people a platform for telling their stories and demonstrating the impact of co\-produced research \(see S2C website\). A manager at Barnardo’s said: **“Creating a film has undoubtedly given a group of young people who have had many struggles throughout life the chance to see something they worked on become a live and tangible film and given them an absolute sense of achievement. … also inspired other young people to get involved in projects where their voices can be heard … and influence decision makers** \[C, J1\]. 

 Feedback at a celebration event towards the end of the original project included: **“I have grown in confidence and I feel like I can tell people my story better”** \(young person in care\); **She’s gained in confidence, pride and achievement, able to talk more freely to peers and learnt new skills relating to story writing. She has been able to talk about her feelings through her story”** \(parent of child with autism\) \[B\] and the **“Individual impact on the 13 young people has been significant … 3 young people visited Japan and Canada and talked confidently with groups about their role as young researchers and the importance of having their voices heard”** \[C, J1\]. The stories have been distributed throughout Barnardo’s in Lancashire and shared with the National Lead for Participation at Barnardo’s to influence approaches throughout the organisation: **“We use the stories as a tool for children to realise that there are other people facing challenges and they are not alone. We are aware of the power of peer lived experiences in making sense of their own situations and being inspired by other children’s stories.”** \[C, J1\]  A mental health social worker reported: **“The story \[about coping with autism in school\] was a godsend for helping a child to see humour and positivity in her situation”** \[5\]. 

 The methodology has had a therapeutic effect on some young people’s lives: **“When I was first asked to talk about my story I thought, oh no I don’t want to tell anyone because it was such a traumatic and emotional story, but after time I managed to open up to people because of this project”** \(Young person in care\) \[B\]. This young man has since engaged in further education after being disengaged and in trouble at his care home. A parent of a child with Down Syndrome said: **“His talking has really improved and he is getting so much better at having conversations now”** \[B\].  Participants have been empowered to take up new skills and educational opportunities: **“One young person was successful in gaining an apprenticeship and has just completed her Level 3 in Children and young people’s workforce and is intent on working with other young people and enabling them to access the opportunities and chance to develop that she feels she has had.”** \[C, J1\]  A Gypsy Roma Traveller storyteller at a public event we held commented: **“Children from our community are just not represented in books. This is an example of a true collaboration between Traveller and non\-Traveller communities.”** Further, he stated: **“What you've done is create a real launch pad for more innovative collaborative work. The event got people talking and then more seriously discussing ideas, and as such are keen for more. It has had a national impact not just because of the people who came, but through social media afterwards a wider UK and international one too.”** \[I\] 

 The stories and digital\-artefacts produced as Open Access outputs from the project have been well received by children, young people and adults, via our website, YouTube \(1.3k views across 28 videos\), a museum, three libraries, three youth centres, four schools \(including a PRU\) and 16 colleges in NW England. A young person said: **“The project helps people everywhere who have had similar growing up stories \(…\) then they can talk about it and make friends through similarities.”** \[B\] The books have been recommended by parents and support workers as ‘just right’ for teenagers or young adults with learning disabilities. One parent said: **“They are all age appropriate, use language that is easily accessible and have themes that would be good to discuss. There is little of this kind available for young adults.”** \[B\] 

 In the Indonesian follow\-on project, deaf young people in story\-making workshops reported benefits including: **“deaf children will be able to understand our stories”; “It was nice to share our similar experiences”; “I feel proud that we can share our stories on YouTube”** \[J2\]. During lockdown in Lancashire, researchers worked with an artist to engage disadvantaged children in arts\-based activities which charity workers described as therapeutic and calming, and which encouraged the young people to engage with one another socially and to experience the outdoors when they would normally have stayed inside. For one child, it was **“the only thing she engaged with as she refused to engage with school”.** \[G, J3\] The charity workers also claimed that family relations were improved as a result of the study, with parents taking children out to take photos and collect items to make a collage. 

 <ins> **Helping professionals to understand young people’s difficulties and how to help them**</ins> 

 The stories cover themes including mental health problems, bereavement, experiences of the care system, bullying, discrimination, disability, independent living, and job\-seeking, while also enhancing print and digital literacies. Professional authors and members of Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators recognised the significance of working on real\-life stories \[H\], which have been distributed to professionals who work with marginalised young people including child psychologists, social workers and teachers. A headteacher at a Pupil Referral Unit reflected on the value of the stories for developing literacy in young people; while the young people themselves responded enthusiastically to a story about a divided family. Their teacher said: **“You could hear a pin drop. I’ve never seen them like that before.”** On request, an invited talk at a conference for teacher educators from 14 FE colleges \(18.3.19\) provided each college with sets of resources for engaging their teachers and students: the invitation came from a teacher educator who had attended a presentation and said **“The young people represented in the stories are tomorrow’s FE students”**. After receiving a set of resources an FE teacher educator said **: “These stories are useful for the students themselves, but also for trainee teachers learning about diversity.”** Another stated: **“the books are really useful as mini case studies for looking at inclusivity and developing learner profiles.”** \[E\]  The stories are used in teaching social workers and childhood studies students at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland \[J5\], the University of Central Lancashire, and Bristol University \[E\].  A storytelling machine and books at an Equality and Diversity Conference at the University of Central Lancashire resulted in reported increases in understanding from attendees. A Special Educational Needs and Disability \(SEND\) Officer and a Child Psychologist both emailed feedback to us after a staff training day where children from Stories2Connect presented **:** the SEND Officer said that **“The presentation, and its engaging delivery, enabled us to critically reflect on our personal lives, as well as our professional roles and processes. Vitally, it reminded each of us about the power of hearing through the voices and stories of the young people we support, and, how important it is to ensure that they are given a platform and a voice in their local and wider communities. Your Research Project not only meant a great deal to the participants, but also impacted on our SEND Team, who were privileged to witness the empowerment of young people.”** \[D\]  The Child Psychologist noted that **“I felt reconnected with why I became an educational psychologist in the first place. The young people really have blossomed.”** \[D\]  The Practitioner Guide \[5\] we created informs future practitioners about the methodology of collaborative writing with community groups. A range of charity workers and arts practitioners have learned how better to support children through arts\-based activities. The artist employed during the lockdown activities wrote **: “I learnt new ways of using technology to share my creative processes with young people. Above all feeling that the work I was being paid to do was of great benefit to vulnerable young people felt vital, important and meaningful.”** \[F, J4\] This work was shortlisted for the Curious Minds Lockdown Inclusion Award Oct 2020.  The Director of charity Aspired Futures stated: “ **The virtual sessions very quickly demonstrated that although nothing can take the place of face to face contact for creative working, it was possible to bring a group of children together with an unknown adult to them and within 6 weeks have nurtured a safe and respectful professional relationship with the children whereby they are comfortable and willing to share and engage”**.\[G, J3\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by Professor Conway at Royal Holloway addressed the increased administrative burdens faced by Church of England clergy. His research addressed these challenges in the most deprived areas of Sheffield. As a result of Conway’s recommendations, the Sheffield Diocese introduced new administrative support roles, backed by GBP1,400,000 of Church funds, creating jobs for nine ‘Mission Partnerships Development Workers’ to support 30 clergy across 33 parishes. Conway’s evaluation of the new administrative role found – along with independent evidence – that the support workers benefitted clergy by enhancing their quality of life and mission\-related activities, benefitted parishes through introducing new initiatives, improved church performance in the form of fund raising and income, and increased parishioner attendance and participation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Context** 

 The Church of England has faced declining church attendance and clergy numbers each year for the last 30 years. This has led to reduced numbers of clergy, who have to manage Parishes across several sites with reduced volunteer help. The Church of England approached Conway and Dr Mike Clinton, King’s College London, with concerns that clergy callings and quality of lives were being undermined by increasing administrative demands and pressures to reverse dwindling congregations. The research investigated how clergy allocated time to tasks that make up their role, and the impact of different tasks on their calling, quality of life, and effective ministry. These tasks included encouraging parishioner attendance and participation, and parish performance such as fund raising and income generation. Conway and Clinton worked in partnership and contributed equally to designing research materials and analysing the data. Conway led on the theorizing and writing of R1 and Clinton led on the theorizing and writing of R2. 

 **Key findings** 

 A major finding of the research was that Church of England clergy on a daily basis spend more time on administration than practising core aspects of their calling. Time spent on administration had major implications for their wellbeing and motivation, and affected the available time that they could spend on activities more central to their calling, and time they could devote to parishioners \(research R1 is crucial here, which documents the effects of time spent on activities on outcomes; R2\). Administration was clergy’s most time consuming daily task and was ranked 1 out of the 14 surveyed tasks in terms of time spent on tasks \(averaging just over 3 hours per day\), ranked 12 out of 14 tasks in terms of relevance to their calling, and ranked 11 out of 14 tasks in terms of tasks they felt competent doing \(see R1\). In other words, administration was clergy’s single most time consuming daily task, and a task they felt had little relevance to their calling and that they were not very good at relative to other tasks. The underpinning research took place between 2013 and 2015 and findings were based on large scale daily diary studies of clergy perceptions, motivation and self\-reported wellbeing and behaviour. The research led the Sheffield Diocese to introduce a new scheme to support clergy \(Mission Partnership Development Workers Project\). 

 **Research to evaluate the new administrative support scheme** 

 The Sheffield Diocese funded Conway and Clinton in 2016 with a GBP46,000 grant, split equally between Conway at Royal Holloway and Clinton at King’s College London, to evaluate the new administrative support scheme from its onset and over a five year period \(2016\-2020\). The scheme was evaluated along the lines of a job design intervention study and produced a series of reports for the Diocese, based on primary data collection in the form of questionnaire surveys, week\-long daily diary studies at certain points of the year, and qualitative interviews to assess clergy perceptions, activities, wellbeing, motivation and behaviour. The research design often included a control group of clergy who were not receiving administrative support help from the new scheme. The evaluation also collected data before and after the administrative support workers were in post. Finally, the evaluation included secondary organizational data relating to congregational and financial growth to evaluate the effect of the scheme on church performance and parishioner participation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research addressed the main problem that clergy’s quality of life and mission\-related activities was being undermined by administrative demands. The impact occurred over two phases. As a result of the underpinning research the Sheffield Diocese **introduced a new administrative support role \(titled ‘Mission Partnerships Development Workers’\)** to support clusters of neighbouring parishes \(Impact Phase 1\). The administrative support workers **benefitted clergy by enhancing their quality of life, allowing them to spend more time on mission\-related activities**, and **benefitted parishioners and the local community**; parishes with support workers had **improved church performance indicators** including financial growth and parishioner participation \(Impact Phase 2\). 

 <ins> **Impact Phase 1: Informing Church of England Employment practices: Creation of Mission Partnership Development Workers \(MPDW\) Scheme**</ins> 

 The research was presented to the Church of England in the form of internal reports and meetings with senior Church of England stakeholders between 2013 and 2015 \(E1, Section 5\). The research included articulating the problem statement, designing research instruments, collecting quantitative and qualitative data from clergy across the UK, and generating reports and recommendations for the Church. As the testimonial from Sheffield Diocese Mission Partnership Project Manager \(E2, November 2016\) indicates: “ *Mike* \[Dr Clinton, King’s College London\] *and Neil’s* \[Prof Conway, Royal Holloway\] *research provided us with very robust, extensive and compelling evidence. The reports and findings were discussed by the Bishop and his senior colleagues*”. 

 The Church of England accepted the findings that clergy well\-being and mission\-related activities were being negatively affected by their administrative workloads. The Church of England identified Sheffield as a beneficiary of the research because it is a highly socially deprived area as measured by the Government’s Index of Multiple Deprivation. Over three\-quarters of Sheffield Diocese’s parishes have an Index of Multiple Deprivation lower than the national average, and many much lower; within these the most deprived parishes were targeted for administrative support. In such parishes clergy face regular issues relating to poverty, homelessness, drug abuse, migration, and human trafficking. As a result Sheffield Diocese introduced a new administrative support role, Mission Partnerships Development Workers, under a scheme titled the Mission Partnerships Development Worker Project. *“Mike and Neil’s previous and ongoing research has therefore **had a major impact on our decision making and shaping of the MPDW project**”* \(E2, November 2016, Mission Partnership Project Manager\). 

 The Sheffield Diocese’s Mission Partnership Development Workers project was backed by GBP1,400,000 of Church funds and ran from 2015 to 2020. The project provides administrative support to clusters of neighbouring parishes in the most socially deprived areas of Sheffield \(nine partnerships, where each partnership consists of three or more parishes, three to five local clergy, each supported by an administrative support worker\). In total the scheme “ *has **created employment for nine workers** in the new role of Mission Partnership Development Workers, who provide administrative **support to 30 clergy**, across **33 parishes**, serving around **3,000 parishioners** \(about **one\-fifth of the parishes** in the Sheffield Diocese\)*” \(E2, February 2020, Mission Partnership Project Manager\). The intention of the scheme was to relieve clergy of administrative burdens so they could devote more time to their calling, improve clergy quality of life, and connect with parishioners; the new role was also intended to indirectly enhance church performance. A video prepared by Conway promoted the scheme to prospective clergy in the Sheffield Diocese \(E3\). Conway further promoted the scheme through presenting at a practitioner event \(E4\). 

 <ins> **Impact Phase 2: The Benefits of the Mission Partnership Development Workers Scheme to Clergy, Parishes, and Church Performance**</ins> 

 The Mission Partnership Development Workers scheme benefitted the following parties: 

1.  **Enhancing clergy well\-being, mission, and parish activities:** Evidence from Conway and Clinton’s reports evaluating the scheme support its efficacy, where a diary study showed clergy with an administrative support worker \(N=13 clergy respondents\), compared to those without \(control group N=18\), reported being **more satisfied** with the time they spend on mission activities, spent **more time on activities** that they feel **competent** at, and spent more time **working with children/young people** \(Internal CoE report February 2018, E5\). 

 Evidence from interviews with 12 clergy in receipt of a support worker found that the majority reported a notable **increase in time devoted to ministry** and **more calling fulfilment**, which they attributed to being assigned a support worker. Clergy reported that the scheme had plentiful positive impacts including **benefitting the wider community** via novel events and services, and **releasing clergy time to train lay leaders, volunteers, and church wardens**. The support workers were identified as central to acquiring **new income streams** and instigating **cost savings**, by half of the ministers interviewed \(Internal CoE report May 2018, E6\). 

 Increased parish activities was found in 2019, where interviews with 13 clergy in receipt of a support worker found ten clergy who reported an increase in **new activities in the community** \(e.g., new leadership positions, new workshops in the community\), and nine of the ten clergy attributed that these activities were made possible by the support worker \(Internal CoE report October 2019, E7\). A testimonial from a parish nurse at \[text removed for publication\], one of the most deprived parishes in the country, details a prominent example of a new initiative where the support worker \[text removed for publication\] \(Parish Nurse, \[text removed for publication\], E8\). 

1.  **Improving church performance:** The 33 **parishes** with support workers achieved **increases in parishioner attendance, fund raising and income**. An independent evaluation by external consultants in May 2018 \(E9\) concluded from an analysis of objective data drawn from parish accounting records that parishes with a support worker had **21% higher average weekly attendance** compared with a control group. Parishes with support workers also benefited from project management and fundraising skills that translated into **increased fund raising** \(up in 51% versus 32% in the control group\), and **increased income** \(65% versus 31% in the control group\). A testimonial from a church warden details how support workers have a major impact in terms of fund raising and resultant project and event management: \[text removed for publication\] \(Church Warden, \[text removed for publication\], E10\). 

1.  **Enhancing Sheffield Diocese’s organizational knowledge and decision making:** Conway and Clinton’s evaluation of the MPDW scheme generated internal reports \(2016\-2020, E5, E6, E7\) that “ **provided important evidence to support the value of the MPDW project**, …how the Mission Partnership Development Workers have benefitted clergy in receipt of such workers, parishioner attendance and the financial position of their churches \[and\] identified areas where the scheme was not having its intended effects. …The reports have included **numerous detailed and practical recommendations for improving the scheme**. This commentary **has been immensely helpful in informing management thinking and decision making**. … Their expertise and recommendations **have shaped the delivery of the scheme and in doing so benefitted clergy and parishioners**”* \(Mission Partnership Development Worker Project Manager, February 2020, E2\). 

1.  **Creating jobs:** The scheme benefitted the **nine Mission Partnership Development Workers** \(the support workers to clergy; headcount: 9; FTEs: 7.2\) whose jobs were created as a result of the scheme.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Bond and colleagues’ research has led to the development of a novel workplace psychological skills training approach, and associated psychometric instruments, which has contributed to a compelling evidence base on psychological intervention with employees. This, in turn, has transformed the practice of: \(1\) a global community of specialist workplace trainers; \(2\) educators of trainee psychologists on Higher Education \(HE\) courses; and \(3\) a Swedish not\-for\-profit organisation offering free to use self\-development apps. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **General context:** Acceptance and commitment therapy \(ACT\), a strand of cognitive behavioural therapy \(CBT\), was originally developed for use on a one\-to\-one basis to support individuals seeking help in relation to their experiences of psychological distress \(e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosis etc.\). ACT works by enhancing individuals’ ‘psychological flexibility’, which is defined as the ability to act for what one values, even in the presence of difficult thoughts and emotions, which in turn, has been shown to enhance wellbeing and behavioural effectiveness outcomes across a variety of clinical and non\-clinical contexts. The first book on ACT, published by the originator Hayes, was released in 1999 and a growing body of literature supported its efficacy as a therapeutic intervention technology. However, at this point, ACT had not been tested in the workplace, which was surprising because earlier forms of CBT had been adapted for workplace use and had been shown to be highly effective at enhancing employee wellbeing and performance. Furthermore, the construct of psychological flexibility \(the proposed mechanism of change in ACT\) was underdeveloped and the psychometric instruments designed to measure it were often not demonstrating the necessary qualities of sound measurement tools. 

 **Developing an ACT workplace intervention model:** In response to the first lacuna, Bond and Bunce initiated a programme of research that tested the efficacy of ACT as a workplace psychological skills training approach. Using brief exercises and techniques, a group\-based format and a delivery schedule involving sequenced, three\-hour training blocks, their randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) in 2000 tested the efficacy of an ACT intervention that was less focused on addressing psychological distress \(i.e., life limiting mental health issues\) and more focused on workplace wellbeing \(i.e., training professionals to adopt more helpful mindsets for achieving their work goals\). Working with staff within a highly competitive media organisation, Bond and Bunce’s RCT demonstrated that a workplace ACT intervention *did* enhance these employees’ wellbeing and performance, which had not previously been demonstrated using an RCT \[R1\]. Their findings served as the ‘proof of concept’ for dozens of subsequent ACT workplace intervention studies \[R6\] and formed a compelling research base for practitioners and trainers who went on to apply their validated intervention in professional programmes around the world. Bond then authored a book chapter \[R2\] that described the intervention programme in detail and contributed to multiple training protocols and manuals that are now used in the workplace and other non\-clinical contexts. 

 **Developing and measuring psychological flexibility.** Bond and Bunce’s RCT was unique in demonstrating the role of psychological flexibility as the psychological process by which their ACT workplace intervention improved wellbeing and performance \[R1\]. However, at the time of publication, the concept of psychological flexibility was underdeveloped, and the psychometric instrument used to measure its improvement lacked the rigour to satisfyingly assess the construct and thus the robustness of its claim to be a key mechanism of change for ACT. To further develop the concept, Bond’s work refocussed psychological flexibility away from simply a willingness to experience difficult thoughts and emotions, to recognising this skill as being needed *to allow* a person to pursue their meaningful values and goals \[R3\]. It was this recognition, facilitated by the ACT workplace training model, that so readily enabled the application of ACT beyond the clinical consulting room and crucially, allowed other practitioners to tailor Bond and Bunce’s intervention to their own work context. By identifying and leading the effort to solve the conceptual and psychometric shortfalls of the existing measure of psychological flexibility, Bond and colleagues went on to design multiple, well\-validated psychometric instruments. Amongst these is the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\-II \(AAQ\-II\) \[R4\], which has been the most extensively utilised measure of psychological flexibility in clinical, community, and workplace settings since publication in 2011 \(having been cited 3021 times\). A version of this measure designed specifically for the workplace, the Work\-related Acceptance and Action Questionnaire \(WAAQ\) \[R5\], is also widely utilised \(cited 155 times since 2013\). These well\-validated instruments have allowed researchers to robustly define, assess, and enhance their ACT and CBT interventions, with the knowledge that no other psychological mechanism of change has greater empirical support \[R3\]. 

 **Summary.** Bond’s reputation as a pioneer in workplace psychological skills training interventions is demonstrated through the 963 citations of his original research paper \[R1\], and is consistently sustained in his continued research programme \[R2\-R6\]. This work has also resulted in a new understanding of psychological flexibility and ways to measure it rigorously. These achievements have facilitated a suite of training techniques that extends ACT’s effectiveness from clinical settings, by tailoring its exercises so they improve the psychological health *and* performance of people through workplace training.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Bond and colleagues’ research programme has produced both the evidence\-based training approach for improving employee psychological skills, and the psychometric instruments needed to demonstrate how those improvements occur \[R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6\]. This work has impacted the practice of: \(1\) a global community of specialist ACT trainers focussed on improving the lives of people at work; \(2\) educators of trainee psychologists on HE courses who offer specialist training on workplace wellbeing; and \(3\) a Swedish not\-for\-profit organisation offering free to use self\-development apps to create positive change in the lives of individual users. 

 **Impact 1. A global community of specialist ACT trainers.** Evidence of Bond and colleagues’ efficacious ACT interventions in workplace settings has influenced the demand for, and practices of, specialist trainers who can help employees to develop psychological skills for managing the increasing challenges and complexities of their workplace settings. Indeed, Professor Steve Hayes, creator of ACT and a world leader in psychological service delivery, states that “Bunce and Bond’s 2000 research paper, Mediators of change in emotion\-focused and problem\-focused worksite stress management interventions *…*opened the door to a workplace training approach that has had a significant impact on the world of work.” Hayes continues: “His \[Bond’s\] openness to sharing and training helped lead to a world community of ACT trainers. This includes scores who work with employees to improve wellbeing and performance.” Speaking specifically to impact over the REF period, Hayes states “The main ACT association has grown 36% to about 9,500 members; the list of recognized trainers is up over 50%; there are now chapters in 27 countries in addition to the US and the UK and nearly every one of these has someone doing ACT in the workplace. His \[Bond’s\] work on stress in the workplace, on measures of psychological flexibility, and on the relation of psychological flexibility processes to worker effectiveness has given ACT developers and trainers a clear target and a focus they did not have before. Organizational consultants around the world have been influenced as a result.” **\[S1\]**. 

 The world community of ACT trainers discussed by Hayes, consists of approximately 100 accredited ACT trainers, located in 17 countries, and who are listed on the Association for Contextual Behavioural Science \(ACBS\) website \(September 2020\) **\[S2a\]**, where Bond’s research papers, training protocols and psychometric instruments are recommended reading and resources for members **\[S2b, S2c, S2d\]**. 

 Drawing on Bond and colleagues’ research, practitioners and accredited ACT trainers, like Dr Frederik Livheim, CEO  [Livskompass](http://www.livskompass.se/) and Clinical Psychologist at The Karolinska Institute \(KI\) in Stockholm, Sweden have formed consultancy businesses that have impacted thousands of individuals over this REF period, August 2013\-2020. Livheim states “My work…\[has\] been heavily informed by Professor Frank Bond’s research in this field; and, in particular, his work on psychological flexibility, and how he has evolved it to inform the use of ACT in the workplace and for employees. Through his work, I believe that I have been able to help thousands of people.” Livheim describes how Bond’s research has informed both his development of treatment protocols and his professional training activities in his consultancy work, over the last 10 years. Regarding protocol development, Livheim states “I created a detailed treatment protocol…named “ACT \- to promote mental health, resilience and productivity” that works well for adults in their roles as employees and in their other life settings.” Livheim also notes how this protocol has been modified to benefit other recipients: “Given the success of this protocol…I led a team that adapted it to target troubled youth, ages 12\-20 years, titled, “ACT – Living life full out.” Regarding training, Livheim continues that his initial protocol, in turn, has been used “for training more than 2,000 professionals in ACT, in a group format. They have then used this training in their own clinical work, as well as to train other professionals in ACT. In Sweden alone, our records, and ongoing collaborations, lead my team to estimate, with some level of precision, that somewhere between 300,000\-600,000 people have been trained, using this group\-based format.” **\[S3\]**. 

 The wider adoption of Bond’s ACT workplace training methods is further evidenced in a sample of reviews for his practitioner\-oriented books, including *The Mindful and Effective Employee: A Training Programme for Maximising Wellbeing and Effectiveness using ACT Therapy* \(Flaxman, Bond, & Livheim, 2013\) and *The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Stress Reduction: Using ACT to Manage Stress, Build Resilience and Create the Life you Want* \(Livheim, Bond, Elk, & Hedensjo, 2018\). Posted after 1<sup>st</sup> August 2013, readers note: “So far I have used it with one company with very positive results. They looked up to Bond and Flaxman’s research which impressed them.” \(Amazon, reviewed in the UK 17<sup>th</sup> December 2013\); “This was a really amazing book to learn more about how ACT can help employees and organizations...or just how mindfulness practices can help a different population.” \(Amazon, reviewed in the United States, 15<sup>th</sup> April 2019\). **\[S4a, S4b, S4c, S4d\]**. 

 **Impact 2. Educators of trainee psychologists on HE courses.** Industry interest in Bond and colleagues’ ACT workplace training methods and psychometric instruments has led to this work impacting the practices of HE educators of trainee psychologists. For example, Dr Paul Flaxman, Chartered Occupational Psychologist and Reader in Organisational Psychology at City, University of London, states that “Since 2014, Bond’s research into ACT and psychological flexibility has directly informed my teaching on the MSc curriculum.” Flaxman goes on to give specific examples of how Bond and colleagues’ research papers are used in the curriculum of City’s MSc in Organisational Psychology, stating that in their module entitled Employee Well\-Being “students complete an exercise that involves closely examining Bond’s research articles on the measurement of psychological flexibility, both in a general sense \(Bond et al., 2011\) and more specifically in relation to flexibility at work \(Bond et al., 2013\)” and “Bond’s co\-authored article with Hayes and others \(Hayes, Luoma, Bond, & Lillis, 2006\) is considered a major ‘positioning’ paper when teaching about ACT and psychological flexibility. This paper is on our core reading list.” Flaxman indicates the reach of this work when stating that “Each year, we have around 45 MSc students who utilise these publications as part of their training” and concludes “In sum, I can confirm that Bond’s research explicitly informs the training I offer to trainee psychologists” **\[S5\]**. 

 **Impact 3. A** **Swedish not\-for\-profit organisation offering free to use self\-development apps.** Since 2018, Bond has worked with 29k, a not\-for\-profit organisation based in Stockholm, who provide free to use personal growth training programmes to create ‘meaningful change’ in the lives of individual users. 29k have adopted Bond and colleague’s research on ACT training and psychological flexibility to form the core structure of several cutting\-edge wellbeing and self\-development apps that are being created and implemented. Indeed, CEO and co\-founder of 29k, Erik Fernholm, states his appreciation “of the role that Professor Frank Bond has had in informing our ‘group\-based’ training apps, including ones that draw heavily on his research into psychological flexibility and ACT. Indeed, this work has contributed to at least three of 29k’s modules on topics such as stress reduction, Covid\-19 recovery, and coping with distress.” Fernholm continues “Bond’s research has given us a new and fundamental way of measuring and conceptualising psychological improvements for our courses, such as on stress reduction. It also has informed us regarding a lot of content choices, UX\-design, and how we produce our content. In short, working with Bond has significantly increased the scientific rigour and quality of our courses.” **\[S6\]**. 

 As a result of Bond’s contributions, Fernholm describes how 29k have been able to have important real\-world impact. In one major project, 29k implemented a wellbeing intervention for the Swedish government to “counteract rising sickness rates and promote a sustainable working life for all government sectors” **\[S7\]**. Fernholm states that “we have together been able to help the Swedish government implement a scalable, technically novel solution at a moment in time when so many of their employees are suffering.” He continues “10% of the governmental organizations in Sweden have now signed up to the stress reduction course since we launched it three months ago—which shows unprecedented uptake.” Furthermore, Fernholm notes that benefits of the apps go beyond the Swedish state: “As of January 2021, 29k’s app has had 60,000 downloads, and the feedback from the stress reduction courses has had very high ratings for “lovability” \(> 4.5 on a 5\-point scale\), and users highly recommend the course to their peers. Perhaps most satisfyingly, these users also report significantly improved relationships with their colleagues and decreased stress levels.” **\[S6\]**. 

 User reviews of the 29k apps from across the globe indicate their usefulness for helping people to reduce stress and live more meaningful lives. For example, the app “Grow, with others” has user reviews totalling well over 1000. Users note: “This app will guide you within to shed negative self talk and assist in unburdening your soul from deep wounds and giving back to yourself in a way that will make you feel whole.” \(App Store, reviewed 8<sup>th</sup> February 2020\); “This app is exactly what I needed. With the stressors in my life, big and small, I need tools to help me cope.” \(App Store, reviewed 15<sup>th</sup> February 2020\) **\[S8\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Garry’s research has helped shape the democratic decision\-making process in the Republic of Ireland on the highly sensitive issue of abortion provision. Garry served as the only political scientist adviser on the Expert Advisory Group of the Irish Citizens’ Assembly \(2016\-18\), established by the Irish government to consider and make recommendations on the abortion issue \(as well as issues relating to ageing, climate change and political reform\). Based on his research experience, Garry advised on the organisation of citizen deliberation and the measurement of citizens’ policy recommendations. The Irish Citizens’ Assembly recommended a liberalisation of Irish abortion law, and this was subsequently supported in a binding referendum vote in May 2018. The Scottish Government has since established its own Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland which was inspired by the Irish model. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Two core features of a well\-functioning citizens’ assembly are high quality consideration \(deliberation\) of the policy issue by participants, and a fair and balanced measurement of the participants’ policy recommendations. Garry’s research on political deliberation and attitude measurement enabled him to provide the Irish Citizens’ Assembly with appropriate high\-quality evidence\-based advice. 

 **Research on deliberation** 

 Garry has systematically examined the process of citizen deliberation on a range of political topics in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Specifically, Garry has studied how participants can be effectively provided with: relevant information on a topic; balanced sets of arguments in favour or against particular proposals; and the opportunity to engage in a considered way with a wide range of other participants who hold diverse views and perspectives. 

-  For example, Garry analysed one of the very first attempts at organised public deliberation in Ireland. The National Forum on Europe was established by the Irish government in the wake of the public’s rejection of the Nice Treaty in the 2001 referendum. Garry collaborated, in 2006\-2008, with the Director of the National Forum on Europe, Ann Barrington, in a co\-authored academic study of the work of the Forum. The study highlighted how balanced debate in the Forum, including political actors and wider society, increased the quality of public discourse and provided a deliberative model that may be used by other EU states to address the EU democratic deficit **\(reference 1\)**. 

-  Subsequently, Garry examined citizen deliberation on divisive issues in Northern Ireland. As Principal Investigator of an ESRC\-funded academic project \(August 2014 to April 2016\) on citizens’ assemblies in divided places, Garry examined how a randomly selected set of citizens can deliberate effectively on the contested issue of flag display. Garry found that providing citizens with balanced information and arguments and enabling them to consider the viewpoints of other citizens with opposing views resulted in a tendency to find a compromise on this highly contentious issue **\(reference 2\).** 

-  This programme of work on citizen deliberation on divisive issues resulted in two further citizens’ assemblies in Northern Ireland, designed and conducted by Garry \(in collaboration with O’Leary, Pow and Coakley\) and also funded by the ESRC \(April 2017 to March 2019\): on the issue of ‘Brexit’ **\(reference 3\)** and on the issue of a possible referendum on a united Ireland **\(reference 4\).** Both studies demonstrated that even on highly divisive issues, citizens with strongly held opposing views can – via effective presentation of objective information and arguments and careful structuring of citizen discussion – engage in informed policy dialogue. 

 From his research on citizen deliberation, Garry developed expertise on how to structure and organise citizen deliberation on a range of divisive issues: how to provide appropriate neutral information on the issue; how to provide balanced arguments; and how to facilitate citizens in articulating their own views and understanding the perspectives of those with different views **\(reference 1, 2, 3 and 4\).** 

 **Research on attitude measurement** 

 Garry has also conducted many studies which have systematically examined citizens’ social and political attitudes, and policy preferences, on sensitive topics \(including abortion\) in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The studies have been based on the careful and objective measurement of citizens’ views using specially designed questionnaires and surveys. For example, Garry was one of the lead designers \(along with Payne and Hardiman of University College Dublin\) of a large\-scale survey in 2001\-2002 on a wide range of Irish people’s social and political attitudes **\(reference 5\)** *,* and was the sole designer of series of bespoke surveys on sensitive political issues and behaviour in Northern Ireland **\(reference 6\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Between October 2016 and April 2018 Garry served as the political science advisor on all four of the Expert Advisory Groups \(EAGs\) of the Irish Citizens’ Assembly which considered the issues of the 8<sup>th</sup> Amendment of the Constitution \(abortion\), climate change, the ageing population, and fixed term parliaments / the manner in which referenda are held **\(source 1\)**. 

 The EAGs were established to advise the Chair \(Supreme Court Judge, Justice Laffoy\) and the Citizens’ Assembly Secretariat \(led by senior civil servant Sharon Finegan\) on how to plan and run the Assembly. Membership of the EAGs included legal and constitutional experts, a range of medical experts, a philosophy/ethics expert, and a political scientist \(Garry\). The specific roles played by Garry in the EAG were as follows. 

 Drawing on his expertise on political deliberation, Garry provided advice to ensure that the Citizens’ Assembly was informative, fair and balanced in regard to: 

  -  Choice of experts and their presentations of arguments and evidence 

  -  Structure of the citizens’ round\-table discussions and deliberation 

-  Drawing on his expertise on attitude measurement, Garry provided advice on the construction of the questions on the ballot paper used when citizens voted on what recommendations the Assembly should make. 

 Garry had significant influence on all aspects of the Citizens’ Assembly, as publicly stated by the Chair, Justice Laffoy: 

 *“A special mention should go to John Garry who has been on all four EAGs and has provided invaluable advice and support through all 5 topics considered by the Assembly.”* **\(source 2\)** 

 Also, in a written endorsement by the Secretariat: 

 *“…In addition, and perhaps in particular, Professor Garry provided the Assembly with continuous guidance and advice on ensuring we satisfied the criteria that distinguishes a deliberative democracy exercise … Professor Garry made an unprecedented contribution to the work of the Assembly … and his personal input has undoubtedly been one of the reasons for the Assembly’s success.”* **\(source 3\)** 

 One of the citizens participating in the deliberation, Louise Caldwell, described the process in an article published in *The Guardian*: 

 *“As a group of 100 citizens, it felt there was a good mix of men and women with a broad range of age and backgrounds. The atmosphere was friendly but serious – we were proud to have been given an important task. We wanted to take in all the information, help shape the debate and make solid recommendations that were representative of our views at the end of a period of deep learning about the topics.”* **\(source 4\)** 

 The participating citizens, via the balloting at the end of the deliberation process, opted to recommend a liberalisation of Ireland’s law on abortion availability. Their recommendations were considered by the Dáil \(Irish parliament\) and the government initiated a referendum on the issue in May 2018, which resulted in public support for liberalization of abortion law **\(source 5\)**. 

 The impact was threefold. 

1.  Garry played a leading role in the EAG in organising how the citizens participating in the Irish Citizens’ Assembly deliberated and how their recommendation options were structured, hence facilitating them in making clear deliberation\-based recommendations **\(sources 1, 2 and 3\)**. 

1.  The Assembly’s recommendations led to a referendum on the issue of abortion availability which resulted in the amendment of the constitution to liberalise abortion provision and a highly significant public policy change **\(source 5\)**. 

1.  The Irish Citizens’ Assembly is lauded internationally as a model of citizen participation in politics. For example, Scotland has established one, inspired by the Irish model. As First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, stated to the Scottish Parliament in April 2019: 

 **“**I have been struck recently by the Irish example of a Citizens’ Assembly to help find consensus on issues where people have sharply divided opinions. Of course, the circumstances here are different, as are the issues under consideration. But the principle is a sound one and I believe we should make use of it. So, I can confirm that the Scottish Government will establish a Citizens’ Assembly.”* **\(source 6\)** 

 In addition, in 2019, the former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, advocated that the UK should follow the Irish example and conduct a citizens’ assembly as a possible way forward during the highly divisive Brexit debates: 

 *“A year’s extension \[to the Brexit deadline\] would allow us to pursue a British version of Ireland’s successful experience in participatory democracy when they held citizens’ assemblies, to find common ground on deeply divisive issues in advance of a referendum.”* **\(source 7\)** 

 Garry’s work for the Irish Citizens’ Assembly 2016\-18 is part of a range of contributions by Garry to Irish deliberative democracy. In September 2013, Garry's research informed a previous citizens’ assembly the Irish government established: The Convention on the Constitution, 2012\-14. Based on analysis of his own specially designed survey in Northern Ireland, Garry gave a presentation to the Convention on the issue of voting rights for citizens residing outside the state. 

 Garry reported on the significant support a Sinn Féin Irish presidential candidate would attract if people in Northern Ireland from a Catholic community background, who typically identify as Irish, were allowed to vote. The Convention's Chairman highlighted Garry, along with Professor Colin Harvey \(QUB\), as making “very engaging presentations on the implications of the proposal as it might apply to those living in Northern Ireland” **\(source 8\)**. The Convention recommended extending voting rights. The Irish coalition government established in June 2020, in its agreed Programme for Government \(PfG\) **\(source 9, p.113\)**, explicitly committed to holding a referendum on the issue. 

 Also, subsequent to the Irish Citizens’ Assembly 2016\-18, Garry was asked by the Irish government in 2020 to serve on the Expert Advisory Group of a new Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality, 2020\-2021. Garry is the only previous Expert Advisory Group member serving as advisor **\(source 10\).** The Irish government commits, in its PfG to “respond to each recommendation of the Citizens’ Assembly on gender equality” and “informed by the work of the Citizens’ Assembly, consider whether there should be a referendum on Article 41.2 of the constitution” \[on the issue of mothers’ “duties in the home”\] **\(source 9, p.77\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A core goal of UK foreign policy is to stabilise and support fragile and conflict\-affected countries. The cross\-Whitehall unit tasked with this responsibility is the Stabilisation Unit. Dr Cheng’s research into war\-to\-peace transitions highlighted the critical role that is played by ex\-combatant networks and elite bargains \- political deals between elite groups \(those with significant power to make decisions and implement policies that affects wider populations\). This work has been highly influential and has been both championed at ministerial levels and embedded into Stabilisation Unit practice and policy. Dr Cheng’s research has: \(i\) helped to change UK conflict stabilisation policy from ‘liberal peacebuilding’ \(an aspirational approach rooted in democratisation and free markets\) to ‘elite bargains’ \(a pragmatic approach that recognises the distribution of power on the ground\); \(ii\) influenced country\-specific stabilisation policy, analysis and operations; and \(iii\) consolidated the UK government’s position as a global thought leader on conflict and stabilisation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Recent civil wars across the Middle East, North Africa, and sub\-Saharan Africa have devastated the lives of many people, with millions displaced and over 600,000 having died on the battlefield since 2010. According to the World Bank, every civil war in Africa that has begun since 2003 has been the resumption of a previous civil war. The question of why some ceasefires and peace agreements hold, while others do not, has been an enduring puzzle in the study of war termination. To that end, Dr Cheng’s award\-winning research \[1\] conducted at King’s College London asks: How do we create stable war\-to\-peace transitions, and prevent soldiers and rebels from returning to war? 

 **Extralegal Groups** 

 Existing research on post\-conflict transitions has focused on the challenges of UN peacekeeping, democratisation, rule of law, and state capacity. In contrast, King’s research has focused on the critical role of ex\-combatant networks in re\-igniting violence or stabilising post\-war environments. Adopting a political economy approach, Dr Cheng found that ex\-combatants were fulfilling local governance functions \(e.g., dispute resolution, contract enforcement\) to sustain their business interests, creating ‘extralegal groups’ in the process. These groups were deliberately co\-opting local and national authorities to maintain control over natural resource areas. In the process, ex\-combatants themselves became ‘local elites’. The result was the capture of existing elites: whereby a small cabal controlled the community and its economic resources \[1\]. 

 In this new post\-conflict equilibrium, political violence was minimised, but at the expense of long\-term reform of the country’s political and economic systems \[2\]. In Liberia, external actors like the UN, the US, and the EU would routinely make these kinds of trade\-offs, tacitly allowing ex\-combatants and their allies to control natural resource enclaves or valuable government ministries in exchange for an end to war. Dr Cheng’s research found that the power and influence that extralegal groups had on the ground meant that wholesale political and economic transformation would be impossible without destabilising the country and provoking a return to war \[2\]. Her conclusions, which showed how liberal peacebuilding was being implemented on\-the\-ground, posed a fundamental challenge to the transformative liberal peacebuilding agenda that the US, UK, EU, UN, and World Bank had long been championing. 

 **Elite Bargains and Political Deals** 

 Because of her extensive knowledge and understanding in the area, Dr Cheng was, in 2016, invited to co\-lead a project on ‘Elite Bargains and Political Deals’ for the UK government with Prof. Jonathan Goodhand and Dr Patrick Meehan at SOAS. The aim was to determine the conditions under which a political deal between elites would hold \- an ‘elite bargain’. As evidenced by the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war, underlying this aim was a recognition by the UK government that the existing ‘liberal peacebuilding’ approach of transforming all of a society’s institutions at once in the aftermath of civil war had not worked. 

 Elite Bargains and Political Deals was commissioned by the Stabilisation Unit \(SU\), a cross\-government unit drawing on expertise from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\), the Department for International Development \(DFID\), and the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\). The SU was tasked with building post\-war stability and preventing armed conflict in fragile states and coordinating the UK’s policy and program response to countries emerging out of armed conflict or violent extremism. The two\-year research project included a team of 21 case study authors and five members of SU staff, culminating in the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] which analysed and brought ideas together, and offered several recommendations to policy\-making, including: 

-  **The need to accept that trade\-offs are inevitable in war\-to\-peace transitions and should be directly addressed by donors and policy\-makers \[1,2,3\].** The most common trade\-off involves prioritising short\-term gains in political and economic stability over the long\-term, structural reforms to social, political, and economic systems. By ‘selling the peace’ in the short run, external actors end up legitimising a system of entrenched corruption \[2,3\]. 

-  **The idea that policy\-makers and scholars place greater emphasis on informal actors and institutions, rather than focus solely on formal actors and processes \[1,2,3\].** While an understanding of informal power relations is an essential starting point for effective policy and practice, this is frequently lacking amongst external interveners. External actors who drive policy \(FCO, DFID, MOD\) tend to concentrate their efforts on brokering national peace agreements and strengthening the formal institutions of government – constitutional reform, the rule of law, security sector reform, and electoral democracy. However, in many contexts, power and violence are managed through informal, rather than formal, actors and institutions. 

-  **The Elite Bargains Framework.** The core principle of the framework is that political stability is only possible if the distribution of political and economic power agreed upon by warring parties is aligned with the actual configuration of power and influence on the ground \[1,2,3\]. Where the distribution of benefits \(be it in a formal peace agreement or an informal elite bargain\) does not reflect the underlying power configuration, the political transition is unstable and there will be a high risk of a return to war \[2,3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Elite Bargains research and dissemination work was lauded by the SU’s Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor as “a shining example of academic/government engagement and interaction” \[A\]. While the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] was officially launched in June 2018, paper drafts had been circulating within government since Autumn 2017 and had already begun to permeate the thinking of conflict advisors in the SU, the FCO, and DFID. At the launch of the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] on 14 June, 2018, UK Minister of State Alistair Burt used the research’s conclusions to announce a marked change in British foreign policy in war\-to\-peace transitions \[B\]. Previously, a transformative approach to democratisation and free markets \(liberal peacebuilding\) was emphasised, but Minister Burt stated: “We have to get better at recognising that all good things do not come together at the same time. If we force state building and institutional reform before political agreement has been forged, then there is a high risk we will be setting ourselves up for failure… I want to make the case that the international community should apply the lessons of our previous successes more consistently” \[B\]. 

 Building on Dr Cheng’s research on extralegal groups \[1\] and informal actors \[2\] in war\-to\-peace transitions, the Elite Bargains research \[3\] and the synthesis paper subsequently became a foundational source for the UK government’s Dec 2018 ‘The UK Government's approach to Stabilisation: A guide for policy makers and practitioners’ \[C; hereafter the Stabilisation Guide\]. According to its lead author, the Elite Bargains project *“heavily influenced”* \[D\] the Stabilisation Guide, which is described as the ‘one\-stop shop’ for those understanding how the UK ‘does’ stabilisation. They refer to the research \[3\] as one of the foundational projects that highlight the ‘ *policy dilemmas and trade\-offs in stabilisation*’ and stress “ *that political processes should be locally\-led and reflect the reality of local arrangements of power and the elite bargains which underpinned them”* \[C, p9\]. Consequently, King’s research has directly impacted an important group of senior policy\-makers and politicians who decide how the UK government should respond to civil wars fought abroad. Championed by Minister Alistair Burt as “UK thought leadership in this area” \[E\], the research has influenced government policy, from national through to international levels. 

 As a result of the widespread engagement with the project and its application in the Stabilisation Guide, Dr Cheng’s research has: 

#  i. Changed UK conflict stabilisation policy from ‘Liberal Peacebuilding’ to ‘Elite Bargains’ 

 Prior to Minister Burt’s speech \[B\], the UK’s stabilisation policy \(short\-term, post\-war\) advocated a transformative liberal peacebuilding approach \(democratisation, free markets, good governance, human rights, counter\-narcotics\). This did not acknowledge that full and proper implementation of any of these goals could cause political instability during war\-to\-peace transition. In endorsing the Elite Bargains framework, Burt acknowledged that a fully liberal approach without directly addressing the trade\-offs was poor policy practice \[B\]. Dr Cheng’s research \[1\] states this directly, and in doing so, created space for civil servants in the SU, the FCO, DFID, and MOD, to have a more honest debate about government trade\-offs and priorities. As such, King’s research has changed official UK policy so that the default approach is not to sculpt local politics \- especially in authoritarian settings \- into a recognisably liberal form. NZZ, a Swiss newspaper of note, heralded the shift by remarking that realism has made “a comeback in British foreign policy” \[F\]. A government press release for the launch of the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] stresses the vital role of political deal\-making in reducing violent conflict and asserts that the government needs to “keep reviewing our approach in light of experience, and this is what this report seeks to do” \[G\]. 

 Minister Burt highlighted the direct link between the research and shifting policy: it is “important that we’re given academic research that looks very intently at some of the things the politicians do because we don’t get it all right and if we don’t learn lessons, we’re in difficulties” \[B\]. In a letter to parliamentary colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Defence and International Development Committees, he highlighted the publication of the Stabilisation Guide and specifically names the Elite Bargains research. He commended the “strong evidence base” that underpins a new approach outlined that “brings new coherence to our efforts to prevent conflict occurring and reoccurring” \[E\]. 

 In adopting the Elite Bargains Framework, the SU’s conflict analysis practices have changed \(along with the former FCO, MOD, and former DFID\) to now explicitly acknowledge who has “power and influence on the ground” \[G\], accepting that actively displacing these individuals or communities \(e.g., warlords, ex\-combatants, extra\-legal groups\) and pushing for transformative change \- even for good governance reasons \- could lead to a return to war. Official guidance on conflict and stabilisation activity now explicitly warns conflict advisors of the consequences and trade\-offs of pushing for transformative political and economic change \[A,C\]. This push to acknowledge these trade\-offs has been prominent in Dr Cheng’s previous work on post conflict contexts \[1\]. 

#  ii. Directly influenced country\-specific stabilisation policy, analysis and operations 

 The Elite Bargains framework and supporting research was advocated by the Minister of State for the SU directly to conflict advisors and managers in the SU and to analysts working on armed conflict in the FCO, DFID and MOD \[A,C,E\]. It was disseminated to UK government country\-based analysts and is now being operationalised and applied in countries such as Libya, Afghanistan and Mali. In this way, it is indirectly impacting political and economic elites and populations affected by UK stabilisation and humanitarian aid policies. 

 The Elite Bargains research has played a significant role in shaping the way in which the UK government and other stakeholders think about stabilisation interventions and conflict transitions \[A\]. The great impact of the research is evidenced, according to the SUs Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor, by “the entry into the policy lexicon of terms such as elite bargains and political settlements \(and\) the recognition of key policy dilemmas and tensions in our approach in places as varied as Somalia and the Ukraine” \[A\]. A key indicator that the research has made it into the ‘bloodstream’ of stabilisation policy is that the central research narrative was present in submissions made by officials to the \(now postponed\) Integrated Review and planning for a new HMG Conflict department/policy \[A\]. Another example provided by Iain King, former Defense Counsellor in the UK Embassy in Washington, demonstrates how the research was used within Whitehall to provide evidence\-based rationale in responding to President Trump’s decision to favour Turkey over Kurdish militia groups as part of the change in his counter\-Daesh policy \[I\]. 

 The new Stabilisation Guide \[C\] asks explicit questions about the power of informal actors \(i.e., powerful non\-state actors such as influential business leaders, militia, chiefs, criminal bosses\) and whether the elite bargain that is struck includes them within it. As noted by Ed Hadley from the SU, “this links to Dr Cheng’s previous work on the importance of informal actors and how the power of these actors is often unaccounted for in post\-conflict transitions” \[E\]. By allowing government officials to acknowledge that all good things do not go together, the impact of this research \[1,2,3\] has been to promote more realistic dialogue across Whitehall departments and to reduce clashes of UK government policy in conflict\-affected countries. The dissemination of the research and Stabilisation Guide has increased conflict specialists’ awareness of informal \(non\-state\) actors. By providing conflict specialists and analysts with tools to make more accurate security assessments, Minister Burt described the Elite Bargains Framework to parliamentary colleagues as “a ‘handrail’ for officials, experts and international partners, wanting to deliver policy and programming in conflict context more effectively” \[E\]. 

 The UK’s Deputy National Security Advisor asked that the Elite Bargains Framework be applied to numerous contexts, including Libya and Syria \[A\]. The research has been drawn on heavily in Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability assessments for Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Somalia amongst others \[A\]. In Mali, a visit by SU staff in 2018 was undertaken entirely on the basis of the research, and was used to brief an audience of international community members, and to inform and underpin planned analysis and programmes which sought to reduce conflict levels in the centre of Mali. The Stabilisation Guide has been harnessed to inform and challenge programme design being undertaken in the volatile central Sikasso region of the country and the resulting projects have been implemented and are currently being assessed \[A\]. In 2020 the Elite Bargains framework was also used by the international development consultancy firm Chemonics to run training sessions for local Malian analysts and civil society actors working on peace\-building and conflict mediation projects. Adapting the EBPD approach, these localised analysts and peacebuilders are now drawing on global analysis tools to assess their local political economy, with a focus on elite actors. Chemonics have developed an ‘impressive’ training package and toolkit to guide implementing partners in applying the Elite Bargains approach that the SU are considering using in other conflict fragile contexts \[A\]. 

 Building on this research, Dr Cheng was invited to advise the Deputy National Security Advisor on future conflict trends and priorities for spending the £1.26 billion Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund \[A\]. In addition, a session on Elite Bargains has been incorporated into the UK Government’s Conflict and Security training course \(which runs 4\-6 times each year\) for British and international policy and program staff who work on conflict issues **.** Key research findings from Dr Cheng’s book \[1\] and the Elite Bargains Framework were taught in this three\-day UK training course for in\-country conflict specialists and staff from MOD, FCO, the former DFID, and the SU \[A\]. 

#  iii. Consolidated the UK government’s position as a global thought leader on conflict and stabilisation 

 In addition to the public launch of the Synthesis Paper \[3\] at Chatham House, it was also jointly launched by the SU and the FCO to an audience of senior government staff of 80\+ conflict policy makers in a roundtable discussion. The Synthesis Paper has subsequently been presented across UK government agencies, including at overseas missions such as: the UK Embassies in Mali and Afghanistan; foreign policy makers at the Folke Bernadotte Academy, Stockholm; the International Conference for Stabilisation Leaders, Paris; and the Christiansborg Conference on Preventive Diplomacy. Most recently it has been used by the UK Defense Counsellor in Washington to frame conversations with senior US policy\-makers in the Biden administration \[H\]. 

 An annual qualitative assessment of the Stabilisation Unit by the Overseas Development Institute highlighted how the Elite Bargains research provided “ *thought leadership*” on current stabilisation activity \[I\]. By challenging the notion that a liberal transformation is achievable in the short term, the Elite Bargains project has helped the SU fulfill its role to “ *provide a challenge function for conflict and stabilisation activity*” \[I\]. Generating considerable attention and debate from the media \[J1\], including in the widely respected World Politics Review \[J2\], and the charity sector \[J3\], the research has resulted in numerous government\-to\-government exchanges and knowledge sharing, which SU’s Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor describes as “ *consolidating the UK’s position as a thought leader on conflict and stabilisation*"" \[A\]. Former UK Defense Counsellor Iain King has highlighted how the research has enabled him to demonstrate to key US think\-tank officials \- some of whom will go on to define Biden’s foreign policy \- how to craft an approach to conflict engagement in developing countries that is both practical and evidence\-based \[H\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Birmingham City University’s research on complex and multiple birth experiences enhanced clinical care guidance and practice. The first \(2017\) NICE guidance on preterm birth follow\-up care cites BCU research to improve care for the estimated 95,000 babies admitted to a neonatal unit in the UK.  The research led to improved care pathways for multiple birth families at one NHS Trust and to a 10% reduction in post\-caesarean section infection rates at another.  It featured in a BBC video on caesarean sections with over 1.7 million views worldwide and raised public understanding about multiple birth families through the Library of Birmingham’s “Multiple Realities” exhibition seen by an estimated 78,750 visitors. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 More than half of pregnancies that involve multiple foetuses have a preterm birth and a higher percentage of caesarean sections.  Birmingham City University’s \(BCU\) research on these complex and multiple birth experiences has been funded through competitive grants, attracting nearly £2.5 million pounds in external funding from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) \(see Underpinning External Grants detailed in Section 3\). 

 **Complex Births \(Preterm\)** 

 The information needs of parents of preterm infants in neonatal units was not well understood prior to Harvey et al.’s \(2013\) qualitative study \[R01\] for ePrime: Evaluation of MR Imaging to Predict Neuro Developmental Impairment in Preterm Infants \(NIHR funded: RP\-PG\-0707\-10154\). R01 evidenced parents’ need for information about the routine care and interventions their infants receive on the neonatal unit, as well as about the long\-term prognosis of their babies. The study further evidenced the need for health professionals to provide information in manageable amounts because the emotional impact of having a preterm baby affects parents' ability to retain information.  Blackburn and Harvey’s \(2019\) mixed methods study \[R02\] evidenced the lack of support from health and education professionals for parents following pre\-term birth in the UK. R02 recommended health and education services provide more timely support that accounts for both the emotional and practical needs of parents. Such support needs were found to be especially acute for parents not prepared for the possibility of pre\-term birth. 

 **Complex Births \(Caesarean Sections\)** 

 Findings from the PREPS \(2020\) \[R3\] Trial, Vaginal Preparation at caesarean section to Reduce Endometritis and Prevent Sepsis – a feasibility study of Chlorhexidine Gluconate \(NIHR: Research for Patient Benefit, PB\-PG\-1215\-20013\), evidenced the efficacy and acceptability of vaginal cleansing \(in addition to routine cleansing of the abdomen pre\-CS\) in the prevention of surgical site infections \(SSIs\).  SSIs are common infections following CS that contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality. PREPs included the first qualitative study, conducted by Weckesser et. al. \(2019\) \[R4\], focused on women’s CS recovery in relation to infection and infection prevention.  R04 found women undergoing CSs need more information about what constitutes a ‘normal’ post\-operative recovery as well as infection prevention information provided in a written format \(rather than verbally post\-surgery\). It further evidenced how CS stigma, and women’s feelings of guilt for needing a CS, negatively affected their recovery experiences. 

 **Multiple Births** 

 Harvey’s and Denny’s \(2014\) study \[R05\] examined the health and social care needs of mothers of multiples. R05 evidenced an absence of support from healthcare professionals \(including midwives and health visitors\). The study recommended enhanced healthcare professional knowledge about multiples to improve information and support provision for such families. BCU research \[R06\] \(2018\) was the first to investigate health visitors’ experiences, as well as training and professional development needs, when supporting multiple birth families. R06 recommended the creation of an evidence base to inform and improve health visitor practice when supporting multiple birth families. 

 *Collectively, this research \[R01\-R06\] furthered understandings of, and provided robust evidence on, the information and support needs of families experiencing multiple births and/or complex births \(including preterm and CS births\).*

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Preterm Births: Enhancing National Clinical Guidance** 

 Harvey’s ePrime research informed \(2017\) NICE guidance, the *NG72: Developmental Follow\-up of Children and Young People Born Preterm* \[S01\]. Extensively citing R01, the NG72 recommends health practitioners support parents by providing information about “the unit and routine neonatal intensive care unit care,” “care of the infant,” and “long\-term prognosis” of babies, as well as by “giving the right amount of information” \(to not ‘overwhelm’ parents\)  \[S01: p. 468\-493\]. The Chief Executive of Bliss, a charity for babies born premature or sick and a named supporting organisation in the NG72 quality standard \(QS169\), states, “Professor Harvey’s ePrime study informs guidance on the information provision to parents and carers… Babies born premature have the best long\-term outcomes when their parents are fully informed about, and involved in, their decision\-making and care, both during their time on the neonatal unit and in the years afterwards. Having access to clear, evidence\-based information is key to parents being able to fulfil this role” \[S02\].  The NG72, the first of guidance of its kind, provides clear and comprehensive evidence to inform quality standards, setting out a framework for consistent high\-quality follow\-up care for the estimated 95,000 babies born preterm every year in the UK. 

 **Preterm Births: Enhancing Professionals’ Understandings and Practice **                Blackburn and Harvey disseminated pre\-published \[R02\] findings at the \(July 2017\) BCU conference, ‘Born Early: Early Care and Education Experience of Children Born Prematurely,’ attended by health and education professionals.  Anonymous survey feedback reflects professionals’ enhanced understandings of the needs of children born preterm and subsequent practice change \[S03\]. A Perinatal Clinical Psychologist reported they would use their enhanced knowledge to “ease transitions between ICU, HDU and Special Care or to Paediatric ICU” \[Survey Response A16 in S03\]. An education practitioner stated, “As a team we will ask all parents about whether their child was premature, and we will work with schools to educate them more fully about the impact of prematurity on their pupils with physical and neurological disorders” \[Survey Response A10 in S03\]. 

 **Caesarean Section Births: Enhancing Clinical Practice and Public Understandings** 

 PREPS findings informed *Reducing Infections in Obstetrics* \(RIO\), Birmingham Women and Children’s Hospital’s \(BWC\) quality improvement initiative \[S04\]. The BWC Specialty Obstetrics and Gynaecology Registrar involved in the initiative, states the “RIO, informed by findings from PREPS \(PI: Prof K Morris, University of Birmingham; Co\-I’s Dr A Weckesser, Birmingham City University and Dr V Hodgetts Morton, BWC\), entailed the implementation of an ‘Infection Prevention Bundle’” \[S05\]. PREPS evidence on the use of chlorhexidine in vaginal cleansing procedures \[R03\] and patients’ need for written information on preventing infection post caesarean section \(CS\) \[R04\] was incorporated into the Infection Prevention Bundle \[S04: p.2\].  BWC implemented the RIO from January 2019 and “by January 2020 the SSI \(surgical site infection\) rate had decreased by 10%” \[ibid.\]. A reduction of significance as the hospital’s SSI rate \(21.08%\) was twice that of the national average \(9.6%\) in 2018 \[S04: p.1\]. BWC delivers an average of 8,200 babies a year; approximately 30% of deliveries are by CS as the hospital attracts high\-risk pregnancies from across the region. SSIs contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality and disrupt postnatal recovery, breastfeeding and infant\-parent attachment. Reduced SSI rates are key to improving maternal health and neonatal wellbeing. 

 Weckesser featured in a BBC educational video \[S06\], ‘C\-Section Guilt: I felt like I’d failed’, sharing PREPS findings \[R04\] on women’s experiences of stigma and guilt following caesarean section.  The BBC’s Senior Broadcast Journalist who produced the video states: “\[The BBC\] measures success with the discussion arising from the content as this means the audience was really engaged with the video. There were thousands of comments from women who said this video changed their perspective and made them feel less alone” \[S07\].  In September 2020, the video broadcasted on the BBC website, News Channel and social media outlets and “received 1,761,400 views across the BBC UK and international facing website, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram” \[ibid.\]. 

 **Multiple Births: Enhancing Training, Practice and Understandings  ** 

 BCU research \[R05\-06 and more\] led to, and forms the curriculum basis for, ‘The Individualised Care of Multiple Birth Families from Conception to 1 Year,’ CPD module for health professionals \(Levels 6 &7\). As a result of the module, an East & North Hertfordshire Trust \(ENHT\) Midwife created a continuous support pathway for women experiencing a multiple pregnancy within her Trust, for which she won the Chief Midwifery Officer Silver Award \(2020\) and was shortlisted for the Royal College of Midwives’ \(2020\) Johnson's Excellence in Maternity Care & Innovation \[S08\]. The ENHT Midwife states that “the research informed module has been significant in the success in improving our understanding of the unique support required by families of multiples, and has helped to shape and inform how we deliver our provision for these families” \[ibid.\]. 

 BCU multiple births research \[R05\-06 and more\] led to the “Multiple Realities” photography exhibition. For the month of September 2019, the Library of Birmingham hosted the exhibition in the main entrance hall, through which approximately 78,750 visitors pass monthly. Anonymous attendee surveys demonstrate the exhibit improved understandings of the challenges faced by multiple birth families by those who do not have multiples in their immediate family \[S09\].  *“\[T\]he exhibition made me think about the difficulties of raising twins and the loss involved with multiple births...*” \[Survey Response P26 in S09\]. 

 BCU research \[R05\-06 and more\] **,** undertaken with the Elizabeth Bryan Multiple Births Centre \(EBMBC\) founded with the Multiple Births Foundation \(an international authority on multiples\) informed the \(March 2020\) *Supporting Multiple Birth Families: Establishing an Evidence\-Base to Inform Health Visitor Practice.* The CEO of Twins Trust, the only UK\-wide charity dedicated to supporting families of multiples, states “research by Professor Harvey and colleagues identified the need for Standards for Healthcare Specialists for Multiple Births to improve the quality of care provided to families. Their work ensures that the views and experiences of families are included within evidence based guidance” \[S10\].

","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **What is EIT?** *:* EIT provides impedance changes arising from injection of small electrical currents into an electrode array placed on the subject and the measurement of the subsequent voltages.  It can be used to image organ function in real time \(100 images a second\). Compared with existing technology it is highly portable, inexpensive and lends itself readily to remote imaging in order to save lives. The impact described here evolved from a series of specific developments employing Electrical Impedance Tomography. EIT requires the solution to an inverse problem to create the image of organ function in real time. This requires an accurate geometric finite element \(FE\) model, known as the forward model. 

 **First 2D images **\(1996 –2003\)** 

 Prior to REF2014 Prof Bayford pioneered software resulting in successful generation of the first 2D images of impedance change inside the human head using EIT. This led to a range of applications, including neuronal activity, stroke, visual evoked response and localising epileptic activity \[1\]. 

 **Automatically generating subject\-specific FE models **\(2003 –2007\)** 

 The 2D image work led to development of a method of automatically generating subject\-specific FE models through elastic deformation from electrode position data for brain function \[2\]. In collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital, this work subsequently resulted in the application of EIT for monitoring lung development in pre\-term neonates \[3\]. 

 **Further algorithm development **\(2008 to present\)** 

 Prof Bayford developed a wavelet algebraic multigrid and estimated boundary form \[4\]. With an international team of colleagues, he instigated and developed a Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT \(GREIT\). This could then be used as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of future development of EIT algorithms for enhanced monitoring of lung function \[5\]. 

 This was an award\-winning article in *Physiological Measurement* with significant contribution by the research group at Middlesex comprising accurate forward models of adult male and female thorax, but more specifically of an infant’s thorax. These significant developments of EIT led to four significant grants that ultimately allowed this work to be applied in a clinical setting. The first from EPSRC in 2008, resulted in the contribution to the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software project \(EIDORS\). This is a freely available website that provides software algorithms for forward and inverse modelling for EIT and Diffusion based Optical Tomography in medical and industrial settings. This site is also used worldwide to share data and promote collaboration between groups working in this area \(over 2000 downloads and cited on over 100 published papers\). 

 **Clinical translation and hardware development **\(2016 onwards\)** 

 The research described above allowed the team to develop algorithms and hardware for image reconstruction, parameter measurement and boundary form generation \[6\]. This culminated in the first large scale study monitoring the lung function of 200 neonates \(preterm, high risk\) for 72 hours each. As a result of this work the team at Middlesex University led a successful EU funding application \(Horizon 2020\) for €5M in 2016 for a project entitled “Continuous Regional Analysis Device for Neonate Lung \(CRADL\)” leading to a clinical system for use in neonatal intensive care units. Dr Bardill joined the project in 2016 to progress hardware development, create a new wearable device and continues to be part of the team with Prof Bayford and Dr Tizzard going forward. The work continues with follow\-on funding \(£1.8M\) in early 2020 from EPSRC – “Preterm Neonate/neonatal Embedded Universal Microelectronic wearable, Acquisition for Cardiorespiratory Intensive Therapy” \(PNEUMACRIT, EP/T001240\). This project further develops clinical hardware for bedside monitoring of lung gestation of pre\-term neonates.  The research continues to flourish and diversify with the recent award of £700K from UKRI in 2020 to repurpose the hardware and techniques for monitoring Covid19 pneumonia in adult ITUs: COVID Regional Lung Electrical Impedance Tomography \(CoRLEIT, EP/V044036\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  Software and data impact: 

 \(4.1\) The GREIT algorithm with new forward models is being adopted by a manufacturer of EIT systems \(Swisstom/SenTec\)<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup> which will represent a significant improvement for commercial medical EIT systems in product development for EIT\-based monitoring of neonate patient respiration and regional air content within patient’s lungs at the bedside. \(2018\) \(5.1\) It has also been adopted by Emergex to extend EIT for other applications including cancer detection. We have also provided new models for these applications \(See 4.2\) 

 The models generated have also been used extensively by other groups internationally that focus on the development of imaging solutions. For example, Bayford and Tizzard, working with Dartmouth College and Florida State University in the USA, have been developing EIT and optical tomography imaging of both adult and neonate human heads and extensive use is being made of the public domain tool \(eidors3d.sourceforge.net/\) in this work. 

 Further work on the automatic generation of subject\-specific forward models, namely the warping algorithm \(2007\), and with Prof. Janet Stocks, Great Ormond St. Hospital \(2007 – 2009\) which formed the basis of extending the process in the current REF period to imaging lung function specifically in neonates in collaboration with Prof. Andreas Demosthenous, Dept. Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL. This initial impact led to the CRADL project in 2016 \(5.2\). 

 \(4.2\) The creation of the largest data store for EIT clinical data in the world at Middlesex University \(over 50TBytes\). This resource is in use for ongoing clinical studies \(5.4, 5.5 and 5.6\). This resource is also being used by SenTec to improve their user interface and test their system. 

 The work improved breast tumour imaging in collaboration with Dr Andrea Borsic and Prof. Ryan Halter, Dartmouth College, NHR \(2010\), and is based on using elastic deformation to warp standard or idealised geometry – all of which provided extensions of the public domain toolset. 

 *Hardware impact:* 

 \(4.3\) In addition to its clinical use, the group obtained a patent that describes a flexible wearable device to extract boundary information for the warping algorithm. The system dynamically generates and modifies subject specific forward models in real time. This work addresses the urgent need for objective, non\-invasive measures of lung maturity and development, oxygen requirements and lung function, suitable for use in small, unsedated infants, to define the nature and severity. This led to the following: 

 We have signed an NDA with Swisstom \(now Sentec\) to develop the wearable device \[\(H2020 cradlproject.org\)\(5.3,5.3\)\] and have a patent in place \(Filed in 2015,  [WO2015025113A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2015025113A1/en), European patent number 3035846 2020\). A new wearable device was developed with PEL during CRADL and are submitting a patent before arranging a licensing agreement. 

 The group is also working with Emergex to extend the application of EIT for the detection of cancer. A joint patent \(WO/2010/052503, Detection of Cancer\) is in place with this company. This work is also subject to an NDA, which limits the information we are allowed to disclose in this document.  However, the system is presently being developed to locate new COVID vaccines in animal models in the USA. 

 *Clinical Practice impact:* 

 \(4.4\) Our models have been used successfully to monitor preterm neonates in two clinical studies using the CRADL system with the University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Finland, and the  [Department of Neonatology, Emma Children’s Hospital,  Amsterdam](https://www.narcis.nl/organisation/RecordID/ORG1235469/Language/en).  The group’s electrical impedance tomography system has been used to detect ventilation distribution, end\-expiratory lung impedance \(EELZ\) and tidal impedance variation during monitoring of preterm neonates requiring invasive ventilation and repeated surfactant treatment. This study demonstrated a significant effect of surfactant treatment on lung function \(5.4, 5.6\). This has enabled the use of EIT in new studies for adopting into larger clinical use. 

 Creation of the largest data store for EIT clinical data \(> 50TBytes\). This is an available resource for ongoing clinical studies \(5.9\) including Dartmouth and Florida use of EIDORS. It has 

 been used successfully to monitor preterm neonates in four large\-scale clinical studies \(5.3\). The following organisations have benefited from these resources: 

-  Consultant Paediatric Cardiologists and clinical researchers in the PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Finland \(2015 \- on\-going\) \(5.4\) 

-  The Department of Neonatology, Emma Children’s Hospital Amsterdam undertook the clinical study of CRADL \(5.6\) 

-  Dr Karaoli Nicosia General Hospital \(NGH\), Cyprus also undertook the clinical study. 

 Consultant Neonatologists and clinical researchers at the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow,  Scotland are working with the group on a new clinical study related to the PNEUMACRIT<sup>5</sup> project which has been enabled through CRADL \(5.5\). 

 More clinical groups are using EIT as a result of the work at Middlesex and are identifying outcomes for imaging neonate lung function.  The work has led to the recognition that EIT can address the urgent need to improve ventilation strategies in children. It is been clinically used to monitor lung function in neonates and adult patients \(see link to Draeger/Sentec below\) using some of the developments created for neonate imaging \(5.8\). 

 *Industry impact:* 

 \(4.5\) We are also working with PEL \(Printed Electronics Limited\)<sup>7</sup> a UK based technology company providing advanced research and development, concept development and production capability for printed electronics and related functional material structures and systems, to develop print on flexible printed circuits for the EIT neonate system. They are members of the EU Graphene Flagship. PEL has worked with us on the CRADL, PNEUMACRIT and new CoRLEIT projects. PEL 3D printing are working with their commercial abilities to augment those in the Middlesex teams and concurrently we are enabling the company to get new markets and new business opportunities in the future \(5.7\) 

 Cost saving: 

 \(4.6\) EIT estimated cost saving of 928 to 10,705 euros per patient in the Dutch setting or 1,124 to 8,496 euros in the German setting. \(5.10\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sinha’s research examining the international context of financial crime and financial regulation led to direct uptake by the Jamaican Government, which has moved to harmonise implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373 \- related to anti\-money laundering and counter terrorism financing \- with its own domestic legislation. Implementing multiple recommendations made by Sinha, the Jamaican Government amended the country’s ‘Proceeds of Crime Act’, the ‘Terrorism Prevention Act’, and its ‘The Terrorism Prevention \(Reporting Entities\) Regulations’. Signed into Jamaican law in December 2019, the Government brought domestic legislation into conformity with international obligations, adopted a risk\-based approach to due diligence, and is more able to successfully tackle financial crime. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Sinha’s research expertise lies in international law relating to anti\-money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. The laws in these areas are closely inter\-related. Since appointment to Kingston University in 2015, Sinha has produced a body of work that builds on these themes. Following an internal research grant, she expanded her research **\[R1\]** to include an international comparative element that explored the interface between financial crime and financial regulation in the United Kingdom and United States. This subsequently resulted in an analysis around failures of regulatory institutions to successfully tackle financial crime **\[R2\]**. 

 The Government of Jamaica recognised an urgent need to effectively implement United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1373 regarding terrorist financing and financial sanctions in its domestic legislation. Both UN regulations stipulated international requirements for state action against terrorist organisations, brought into focus following Al Qaeda’s attacks on the US in 2001, and the consequent US led war in Afghanistan. Following a ‘Mutual Evaluation Report’ conducted by the Financial Action Task Force \(FATF\), a global inter\-governmental body responsible for developing policies around anti\-money laundering and terrorist financing, several deficiencies were noted in Jamaica’s financial legislation. The report related specifically to financial sanctions and asset freezing. This led Sinha to undertake research around compliance measures that financial and non\-financial entities are required to undertake to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Her research postulates that public\-private partnership is a vital element to avoid compliance becoming a mere ‘tick\-box’ exercise; a principle that was strongly adhered to in her work with the Jamaican Government **\[R2\]**. 

 A key focus of Sinha’s research is the risk\-based approach that is applied in the anti\-money laundering compliance regime in the UK. The true ethos of the risk\-based approach is gradually fading and needs to be re\-instated to fight crime effectively. This risk\-based approach is based on the concept of ‘suspicion’ **\[R2\]**. It has been suggested that ‘suspicion’ as the cornerstone of anti\-money laundering reporting significantly contributes to an inefficient risk\-based approach. The objectives of the private and the public sector are not naturally aligned, which makes it harder to achieve the law enforcement objective that is thrust on the private sector **\[R2\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Sinha’s research at the interface between financial crime and financial regulation in the United Kingdom and United States, influenced the Jamaican government to amend three legislative acts: the Proceeds of Crime Act; the Terrorism Prevention Act; and The Terrorism Prevention \(Reporting Entities\) RegulationsInvited by the Jamaican government, Sinha led high\-level workshops, which included senior ministry officials, as well as members of the United Nations, and resulted in direct uptake of recommendations on how to harmonise Jamaican legal practice with international enacted by UNSC resolutions 1267 and 1373. The former Head of the Legal Unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade **\[S1\]** states ‘ *Sinha provided invaluable advice on the amendment of existing legalisation.*’ At the first workshop, in April 2016, Sinha helped review both UN resolutions 1267 and 1373 and explored how the Jamaican government could harmonise these with the national constitution **\[S2\]**. Sinha’s involvement began through the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre \(VERTIC\) who provide support to governments on compliance mechanisms and national implementation measures.  The International and Industry Liaison Unit of the Jamaican Customs Agency state how the Jamaican government, in collaboration with VERTIC, ‘ *completed two workshops … the first workshop, also organised with the Legal Affairs Unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in co\-operation with the CARICOM\-UNSCR 1540 Implementation Programme, was on the implementation of Financial Action Task Force Recommendation 7 through Jamaica's 2013 United Nations Security Council Resolutions Act*’ **\[S3\]**. VERTIC summarise how ‘ *Sinha took the participants through FATF Recommendation 7 … and made recommendations on possible amendments to Jamaica's UN resolutions implementing legislation to strengthen compliance with FATF Recommendation 7*’ **\[S4\]**. The recommendations were focused on implementing targeted financial sanctions to comply with both UNSR resolutions \(highlighted above\). Resolution 1267 established a sanctions regime associated with Al\-Qaida and the Taliban; Resolution 1373 prevents and suppresses the financing of terrorist acts and associated money laundering. These resolutions require countries to freeze funds or other assets of any person or entity related to terrorism. Sinha’s recommendations focused on the implementation of these resolutions through a risk\-based approach towards compliance. 

 The recommendations made by Sinha to the Jamaican Government aimed to integrate the risk\-based approach as a successful mechanism in the domestic legislation of Jamaica. Also, the Financial Action Task Force \(FATF\), as the global standard\-setter for money laundering and terrorism financing rules, include a risk\-based approach as the first of the 40 Recommendations in their guidance.  Although Sinha’s work had a UK focus, the same principles have been applied to the Jamaican legislation, thus giving her work international significance. Several suggestions made in **\[R2\]** to reform the law were used in the recommendations to the Jamaican Government. 

 Following this, in 2017, Sinha was invited directly by the Jamaican government to lead a second workshop – as the only expert in the room. At this second workshop, participants consisted of a wider group of stakeholders from central government, private financial institutions as well as non\-financial regulated businesses and professions. The idea was to highlight the same issues against a wider canvas that included terrorist financing and anti\-money laundering. **\[S1, S5\]** 

 The second workshop led to a more comprehensive list of 17 recommendations. These were to assist in the legislative review process that the Government of Jamaica needed to undertake. A key consideration for Jamaica was to harmonise the United Nations Security Council Resolutions \(UNSC\) Implementation Act 2013 with the sanctions and reporting requirements laid down in other relevant legislation requiring entities to carry out similar obligations. For this reason, amendments in the following pieces of legislation were suggested: 

-  The Proceeds of Crime Act \(POCA\) and Regulations 2007 and POCA Amendments 2013. 

-  The Terrorism Prevention Act, 2005 \(TPA\) and Amendments 2011, 2012, and 2013. 

-  The Terrorism Prevention \(Reporting Entities\) Regulations \(TPRs\), 2010. 

 ‘*This advice assisted in ensuring that the changes made met the constitutional requirements and could be implemented in a small developing state’* and ‘ *was also used to draft amendments to existing legislations’* **\[S1\]**.  Speaking in October 2019, the Minister of Finance and the Public Service explained how the amendments would ensure Jamaica met global standards, enable targeted financial sanctions, enabling the country to ‘ *take a risk\-based approach to due diligence*’ and ‘ *empower law enforcement*’ **\[S6\]**. 

 The amended Acts and Regulations were signed into law in November and December 2019 **\[S7, S8, S9\]**. Amendments included the stipulation of businesses to establish a risk profile relating to its general operations regarding its products, distribution channels, and size and nature of its business environment, enhanced due\-diligence for business relationships \(such as verification of the sources of customers’ funds\), and the imposition of duty on reporting entities to explain inability to conform to specified standards. These work to minimise the risk of terrorism financing. A further amendment made it a criminal office \(liable to a fine and/or imprisonment\) to contravene the regulations. 

 This significantly changed the law around financial sanctions, asset freezing and terrorism financing, and improved Jamaica’s Anti\-Money Laundering and Counter\-Terrorist Financing regime **\[S1\]**. The recommendations have ensured that Jamaica’s financial regulations are in line with the Constitution of Jamaica and the UNSC resolutions, and so better meet international obligations and protect banking relationships with international partners. As the laws relate to compliance measures, they also directly affect both financial and non\-financial institutions. This protects and maintains the integrity and reputation of the Jamaican financial system, thus having a positive impact on persons holding any amount of financial or monetary assets in Jamaica. In summary, the resulting 2019 Amendment Acts and Regulations ‘ *have been used successfully by the country to assert compliance with most of its obligations*’ and have ‘ *had a positive impact on assessment of the country’s compliance with its PF \[proliferation financing\] obligations’* **\[S1\]**. 

 In February 2020, The FATF stated that ‘ *since the completion of its MER \[Mutual Evaluation Report\] in November 2016, Jamaica has made progress on a number of its MER recommended actions to improve technical compliance and effectiveness,* including by *amending its customer due diligence obligations*’ **\[S10\]**. This is a specific reference to the amendments to POCA, TPA and the TPRs, based on Sinha’s research. 

 These changes to Jamaican law have benefitted the economic situation of local Jamaicans as well as bring the country’s legal procedures in line with UNSCRS 1267 and 1373. Six commercial banks have eased account opening requirements for low\-risk bank accounts. Using the risk\-based approach, whilst remaining compliant, banks offered accounts to the highly informal segment of Jamaican society who previously could not pass the opening requirements \(which were intended to deter terrorism financing rather than local Jamaicans\). When COVID\-19 reduced access to banks, the need for accessible bank accounts increased. A key benefit of this is that it has enabled individuals to receive the government ‘We Care’ grant and remittances from relatives overseas as soon as possible, thus avoiding financial pressures and debt. This was only achieved through the new, efficient risk\-based approach, which allowed such accounts to be opened and thus increased financial inclusion in a time of great need **\[S11\]**.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Amid a phenomenal pace of technological change, stubborn social, economic, and territorial divides remain between those who are digitally connected and those who are not. In the UK, as territorial remoteness and population sparsity increases, the commercial investment case for broadband provision weakens, thereby increasing the likelihood of those territories having no or very poor broadband connectivity. The households and businesses affected are referred to as ‘the final few’ \[R1, R2\]. Against a policy backdrop of UK Government efforts to improve mobile and fixed network infrastructures and coverage, coupled with a prevailing ‘Digital by Default’ public services agenda, the ‘final few’ pose a problem. The research project \(Rural PAWS\) addressed this problem by enabling internet connectivity for a commercially ‘hard to reach’ rural area \(UK\) \[R1\]. A longitudinal evaluation of subsequent internet connectivity experiences and user behaviour has led to a better understanding of the needs and requirements of remote rural users, which in turn has informed broader policy narratives concerned with digital exclusion \[R3, R4, R5\]. 

 Dr Fiona Williams joined the University of Chester as a full\-time Senior Lecturer in Human Geography in February 2016. Prior, Williams was a Senior Post Doctoral Research Fellow \(PDRF\) on Rural PAWS \- a two\-year \(2013\-15\) interdisciplinary \(Geography and Internet Engineering\), University of Aberdeen dot.rural  project aiming to facilitate digital inclusion. This project also involved Professor John Farrington and Dr Lorna Philip \(Geography and Environment, University of Aberdeen\), Dr Althaff Mohideen and Professor Gorry Fairhurst \(School of Engineering, University of Aberdeen\). A commercially hard to reach rural community in South Shropshire provided the trial case study area, the English context making the project unique in the mainly Scottish dot.rural suite. Narrow sampling parameters required a high degree of local knowledge to recruit suitable participants. Williams, with links ‘in situ’, proved invaluable in the recruitment and retention of participants \- those meeting the study criteria, that is, exhibiting technical connectivity barriers \(e.g. inadequate or no broadband provision\) and non\-technical connectivity barriers \(e.g. low levels of computer literacy but with access to family / friends support networks\) and collectively illustrating variable remote rural connectivity household and business scenarios. Dot.rural project funding ended in 2015. The University of Chester supported Williams in developing research and evaluation activity extending well beyond the Rural PAWS project funding and remit. A productive publishing relationship with Philip \(Aberdeen\) was also maintained. Support to  participating households and businesses, and the longitudinal evaluation of them, was funded and formalised in 2016, via a series of internal \(University of Chester\) research grants totalling £3,500 \[section B3\]. Williams, employed by the University of Chester and located in the study area, continued to work with project participants \[R4\], managing the transition to alternative internet providers and monitoring user practices. Understanding the ongoing needs of users and the shifting landscape of internet provision enabled Williams to engage with, and inform the decisions of, the policy community \[R3, R5\]. 

 The Rural PAWS project provided participants with free access to a satellite\-based, rate\-limited \(for bandwidth\-hungry functions\) broadband service. The study examined the extent to which local demand for improved connectivity could be stimulated to bring ‘hard to reach’ communities online and allow previously digitally excluded people to enter a digital society \[R1, R2\]. Avanti Communications plc, a global satellite provider, was an industry partner, providing hardware, installation, and bandwidth for experimentation purposes. Satellite broadband technology was deployed at no cost to eight participating households \(17 permanent users and four occasional users\), previously unserved or underserved by broadband connectivity; six of the participating households ran micro\-businesses from home in sectors representative of the community being studied. The subsequent digital behaviour and internet experiences of participants was examined via a series of ‘in situ’ qualitative household interviews \(pre, during and post Rural PAWS deployment plus longitudinal follow\-up interviews\), user diaries and a researcher diary \[R1, R4\]. 

 At the outset, the underpinning research revealed significant territorial connectivity barriers in the case study community, with households either unserved or underserved by broadband infrastructure \[R2\]. The Rural PAWS model uncovered a range of additional digital participation barriers: motivation, levels of digital literacy, perceived utility and value of the internet, and the capabilities and limitations of available internet services \[R1\]. Initial perceptions of the free Rural PAWS service varied considerably according to household and business context, although on decommissioning Rural PAWS, and with the assistance of Williams, all participants elected to pay to remain connected to a commercial Internet Service Provider \(ISP\). Demand for digital connectivity was stimulated, benefitting an alternative local service provider \[R3\]. Significant behaviour change was observed by Williams, aligned with user experiences and the perceived quality of broadband provision \[R4\]. Participants were highly embedded in the locality \(necessarily as a result of rural business activities, or through a strong desire to live in a rural context\), negating any option of relocation to areas with better broadband \[R4\]. Greater utility of the internet, and the perceived added value attributed to internet use, was apparent among household businesses and those working from home. Digital engagement and digital literacy among older generation households was encouraged and enhanced through internet availability. Insights gained by Williams into the changing behaviours associated with internet adoption, use, and progression in the rural context have made a significant contribution to a growing body of academic evidence and associated policy developments \[R3, R5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This project contributes to address wider global concerns surrounding rural disadvantage in relation to digital connectivity. Direct beneficiary groups of the underpinning research and associated dissemination activities include: a\) project participants – <ins>connected households and businesses \(attitudinal change and capacity</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>building</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>leading to social and economic wellbeing</ins>\); b\) the <ins>wider rural resident and business community</ins> in Shropshire <ins>who benefitted from market stimulus \(for improved connectivity\)</ins>; and c\) the <ins>policy community in receipt of evidence\-based contributions to the policy process</ins>. 

### 1.  Direct impact on project participants 

 The study had direct and significant social and economic impacts on the eight households / six micro\-businesses \(17 permanent users and four occasional users\) who were provided with broadband access and the facilitation of its use. 

-  The <ins>positive economic benefits of internet connectivity</ins> to the micro\-businesses are illustrated by a couple who said that “…access to a paid broadband service that meets our requirements \[…\] it’s revolutionised the way we do things. *”* Specific efficiency and cost\-saving examples include those relating to internet banking and ‘digital by default’ administrative functions, saving approximately £300 p.a. on birth notifications \(of pedigree sheep\) alone. Specific productivity gains attributable to online marketing and promotion in 2020 are reported to include new customer purchases totalling £3,200 \[S1i\]. The financial impact reported by this participating micro\-business exceeds that estimated in an independent Department for Digital, Culture, Media & and Sport \(DCMS\) Evaluation of the Economic Impact and Public Value of Superfast Broadband \(2018\), which said “that subsidised coverage raised the turnover per worker of firms by 0.38 percent \[…\], equivalent to £1,390 in GVA per firm per annum \(p.6\) \[S1ii\]. 

-  Behaviour change is evident. The project <ins>facilitated upskilling in the digital literacy of participants through broadband access and device use</ins>. All participants, including older generation households, remained online, transitioning to a paid alternative internet service. Broadband use has become part of the household norm, increasing \(subjective\) personal wellbeing through browsing, internet shopping, and staying in touch \[S2i\]. An older generation beneficiary provides examples of how internet access and use can overcome feelings of isolation, particularly through video\-calling family members: “We speak every day and it makes such a difference to ‘see’ each other – it lifts both of us” \[S2ii\]. Some evaluations quantify the wellbeing uplift associated with a subsidised upgrade. For instance, an Ipsos Mori report for DCMS \(2018\) equates this as “… equivalent to £222.25 per year for the average premise” \(Subjective wellbeing analysis of the Superfast Broadband programme, Annex C p.4\) \[S2iii\]. 

### 1.  Local\-scale impact on the wider resident and business community in rural Shropshire 

 The provision of free, rate\-limited broadband to local households <ins>enabled</ins> <ins>participants to overcome barriers</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>access and literacy that had previously excluded them</ins> from digital engagement. Through demonstrating opportunity, and potential to overcome barriers, <ins>the study created an appetite for better broadband</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and stimulated the market</ins>. During the initial project phase, the study area in south\-west Shropshire \(SY7 8 postcode area\) was not part of a Broadband Development UK \(BDUK\) phased ‘intervention area’ to improve access to fixed\-line broadband. However, at the end of the study, residents and businesses in this location were eligible for the Better Broadband Scheme \(2015\-19\), which subsidised the installation and access costs of alternative broadband provision. Williams <ins>stimulated uptake of the voucher scheme in this area</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>with the commercial provider Secure Web Services</ins> \(SWS\) being the main beneficiary, as evidenced by Connecting Shropshire and SWS data \[S3\]. The free Rural PAWS provision ceased in July 2016 \(nine months after the dot.rural PAWS project end\) and supported by Williams, project participants then secured alternative broadband provision \[S1, S2\]. Wider awareness of the Better Broadband Scheme support subsidy, and the services offered by SWS, was generated through word\-of\-mouth recommendation \[S3iii\]. 

-  156 voucher applications were processed by Connecting Shropshire for the SY7 postcode area in the 12\-month period August 2016\-July 2017, 44 of which were coded to the SY7 8 postcode \(study\) area \[S3i\]. 

-  Of the SY7 8 postcode applications, three\-quarters \(n=33\) of the subsidised broadband connections were installed by the commercial provider SWS in the post\-PAWS 12\-month period August 2016\-July 2017 \[S3ii\]. 

### 1.  Evidence\-based contributions to national policy 

 Since 2016, Williams has disseminated the work via nine international conference / research meeting presentations and two invited Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) seminars \[R3, R4\]. Dissemination, and corresponding publishing activity, has <ins>underpinned a number of evidence\-based policy contributions, the recommendations of which have recognised</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>barriers to digital inclusion</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and called for the improvement of digital services to remote rural areas</ins>. The contribution and corresponding impact of Williams’s research can be evidenced as follows: 

-  At an international scale, Williams provided <ins>evidence for the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development</ins> \(OECD, which comprises 35 countries worldwide\) in their Policy Brief for Home Based Business \[R3\]. The research was used as a case study \(referenced at p30\), with the OECD report identifying ‘digital connectivity’, the provision of fast, affordable broadband, as ‘crucial’ if the diverse home\-based business sector is to participate and thrive. 

-  Williams provided an <ins>expert interview for the</ins> <ins>Public Health Wales NHS Trust and Mental Health Foundation \(2019\) report, ‘Supporting farming communities at times of uncertainty</ins> – An action framework’, with a notable contribution to Key challenge 3: Regulation, administration and digitalisation. Recommended actions identified for prevention and protection, include “…the provision of fast internet connectivity, especially in rural areas, alongside addressing gaps in digital skills and literacy” \(p14\) \[S4\]. 

-  The research contributed to the <ins>House of Commons Select Committee \(2019\) update to the Broadband and digital\-only</ins> <ins>services inquiry \(2015\), via written evidence</ins> provided by Williams’s co\-author Dr Lorna Philip \[S5i\] and referenced at paragraphs 22 and 25 in the House of Commons report \(published 18 September 2019\) \[S5ii\]. The 2019 update recommends that “the Government honour its commitment to its ‘outside\-in’ approach to ensure hard to reach rural areas are prioritised” \(paragraph 67\);  “Any new digital public service platforms should be trialled and assessed by rural stakeholders prior to roll out to ensure they are user friendly” \(paragraph 31\); and that “the Government commit to an immediate review of the USO \[Universal Service Obligation of 10 Mbps\] as soon as possible to ensure it is suitably ambitious for rural areas” \(paragraph 47\) so the USO is not obsolete soon after introduction. 

-  Expert witness Professor Claire Wallace \(University of Aberdeen\) provided <ins>oral evidence \[S6i\] to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Rural Economy \(2018\). Drawing on Williams’s research findings</ins> \[R1, R2\], the evidence was referenced in the Select Committee report \(published 27 April 2019\) ‘Time for a strategy for the rural economy’ \(chapter 4 of Digital connectivity, paragraphs 242 and 243\) \[S6ii\]. Related conclusions contributed to the House of Commons Select Committee 2019 update and recommendations \(above, \[S5ii\]\) including: upload and download speeds were too modest in the USO commitment; and local and national governments must do more to realise the potential of improving digital skills in rural areas.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Professor Ian Martin introduces new ways to forecast the behaviour of stock markets and currency markets. His approaches have been used by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee in formulating their views on exchange rates; by the European Central Bank in their monetary policy discussions; and by global asset management companies to improve aspects of their asset allocation and to inform their approach to foreign currency exposure. As well as improving understanding of risk premia, the research has informed changes in key aspects of financial practice in both the public and private sector. By helping investors take better\-informed risks, supporting the development of more robust monetary policy, and helping central banks to spot destabilising market “bubbles”, the work supports efforts to maintain stable financial systems in the UK and elsewhere. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning impacts described here was published between 2013 and 2020 in a series of papers introducing new ways to forecast a different type of financial asset. Several conclusions emerge from the papers, the most important of which is that risk premia are substantially more volatile, both over time and across stocks, than the literature has previously acknowledged. 

 Research carried out between 2013 and 2017 \(published in **\[1\]**\) defined a new index of volatility \- the SVIX index. This is similar to the VIX index created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange \(CBOE\), a real\-time market index that represents the market's expectation of 30\-day forward\-looking volatility. Derived from the price inputs of the S&P 500 index options, Martin’s SVIX index provides a measure of both market risk and investors' sentiments. The distinctive feature of the new index is that it has a natural application to measuring the expected return on the market \- the so\-called “equity premium”. The properties of the index were studied empirically using the OptionMetrics database of historical option prices to construct the index for the period 1996\-2012 \(at that time the full period for which option price data was available\). This showed that the equity premium is \(even\) more volatile than had previously been understood. 

 A second paper **\[2\]** reported on work carried out from 2015 to 2018. This built on research published in **\[1\]** to derive a formula for the expected return on a stock, based on observable option prices. Martin and his co\-author Christian Wagner \(Professor of Finance, WU Vienna University of Economics and Business\) then constructed the relevant option price indices called for by that new formula; that is, they extended the indices constructed in **\[1\]** to cover individual stocks. Specifically, the new approach supplies an inherently forward\-looking measure of expected returns at the stock level, rather than the market level. This both outperforms other standard measures and makes distinctive predictions that challenge the conventional wisdom by showing that risk premia are extremely volatile across stocks \(as well as over time, as was clear from the research reported in **\[1\]**\). The model introduced in this paper can be contrasted with the Capital Asset Pricing Model \(CAPM\), which uses betas to make quantitative predictions about a stock’s returns. However, CAPM betas are estimated over an historical horizon and are difficult to pin down during turbulent markets. Conversely, the option\-based model set out in **\[2\]** can be estimated in real time because it *only* uses option prices; it also performs well empirically, unlike CAPM. 

 In parallel work conducted with PhD student Lukas Kremens between 2016 and 2018, Martin made new theoretical and empirical contributions to the classic \- and notoriously difficult \- challenge of forecasting exchange rates. The resulting paper **\[3\]** was published in 2019. Much of the existing literature in this field is organised around the theory of uncovered interest parity \(UIP\), which states that the difference in interest rates between two countries will equal the relative change in currency foreign exchange rates over the same period. The strictest form of UIP supposes risk neutrality, such that risk premiums should be identically zero. UIP is appealing for three reasons: 1\) it is based on asset prices alone \(so is observable in real time\); 2\) it has no free parameters \(so does not require estimation\); and 3\) it has a straightforward interpretation \(as the expected currency appreciation perceived by a risk\-neutral investor\). In **\[3\]**, Martin and Kremens propose an alternative benchmark, the quanto theory, which shares these three features without also making the empirically highly implausible assumption that investors are risk\-neutral. Their quanto theory model predicts that risk\-neutral covariances between currencies and global stock markets should forecast excess currency returns. They demonstrate how to use a certain kind of derivative contract \- quanto forward contracts \- to measure these quantities. The resulting measure was shown to work very well empirically, outperforming the standard competitors \(UIP, Random Walk, and PPP\) in forecasting differential currency movements out\-of\-sample. 

 A fourth paper **\[4\]** resulted from research conducted jointly in 2018\-2019 with Can Gao, a PhD student at Imperial College London. It provides a real\-time, forward\-looking measure of “bubbliness” in stock markets. Martin and Gao define a new sentiment indicator that exploits two contrasting views of return predictability and studies its properties. The indicator, which is based on option prices, valuation ratios, and interest rates, was unusually high during the late 1990s, reflecting dividend growth expectations that the researchers proposed were unreasonably optimistic. They interpreted this as helping to reveal irrational beliefs about fundamentals. This paper demonstrates that their measure is a leading indicator of de\-trended volume, and of various other measures associated with financial fragility. The research published in **\[4\]** also makes two methodological contributions. First, it derives a new valuation\-ratio decomposition that is related to the Campbell and Shiller \(1988\) log\-linearisation, but which more closely resembles the traditional Gordon growth model, as well as having certain other advantages. Second, it introduces a volatility index that provides a lower bound on the market’s expected log return. 

 A fifth paper **\[5\]** extends the novel framework introduced in papers **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** in a different direction. It provides an index of stock market return autocorrelation using yet another kind of derivative security, namely forward\-start options.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** introduces new ways to forecast the behaviour of various financial asset markets. A distinctive feature of these new methods is their reliance only on observable asset prices, making the resulting forecasts observable in real time. This is in contrast to forecasts based on, say, macroeconomic or accounting data, which can only be exploited by investors or policymakers with a lag. The methods have been widely used by public and private financial institutions, including central banks, national investment funds, and global investment and asset management companies. Immediate impacts include the generation of a new debate about ways to forecast financial assets; an improved understanding within financial institutions of risk premia; and changed approaches to key aspects of professional practice including asset allocation and the forecasting of exchange rates. The use of the research in these contexts helps investors take better\-informed risks. The research also supports the development of more robust monetary policy, including by providing monetary authorities with a more accurate and timely indication of market sentiment. By helping central banks to spot destabilising market “bubbles”, the work contributes to efforts to maintain stable financial systems in the UK and elsewhere. 

 **Catalysing debate and changing practice in central banks:** the principal insights of research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** have been shared widely across and within both private and public financial organisations. High\-profile examples include the invited presentation of research published in **\[2\]** and **\[4\]** at central banks including the Bank of England \(BoE\), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \(the Fed\), and the European Central Bank. Work published in **\[2\]** has also been shared with Banca d’Italia. In April 2019, **\[4\]** was one of six papers selected for presentation to and discussion by members of the Behavioural Finance Working Group of the National Bureau of Economic Research \(NBER\), a non\-profit research organisation ""committed to undertaking and disseminating unbiased economic research among public policymakers, business professionals, and the academic community"". It was also included in a  [Bank of England blog post](https://bankunderground.co.uk/2020/10/29/hubble-bubble-valuation-trouble/) published in October 2020. 

 As well as generating discussion and debate, Martin’s research has directly supported changes in thinking and practice in the central banks with which he has worked. The work has, for example, provided central banks with **new tools to support the notoriously difficult task of forecasting exchange rates**. The research set out in **\[3\]**, which provides a new way of approaching this, was presented at a conference at the BoE in June 2017. Separately, Martin was asked by the BoE in February 2017 to provide data required to compute the currency appreciation measure proposed in **\[3\]**, so that forecasts based on the measure could be supplied to its Monetary Policy Committee \(MPC\). 

 As a result of these activities, the work has been used by the MPC in formulating its views on exchange rates **\[A\]**. Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the MPC, reports using insights from the research, including **\[3\]**, *“on numerous occasions in the discussions with other members of the Monetary Policy Committee to promote a more rigorous understanding of exchange rates and risk premia, arguing against the simple UIP framework which is still commonly used, but which fails both theoretically and empirically, as \[Martin’s\] research shows”* **\[A\]**. 

 Vlieghe further notes the “ *broader impact of influence \[Martin’s\] research has had within our institution by influencing work by staff that feeds through to policymakers”*. He particularly cites work published in **\[1\]**, which has “ *been the subject of internal staff workshops”*, and **\[4\]**, which “ *is to be incorporated into the staff’s toolkit on equity valuations”*, as well as forming the basis of a staff note **\[A\]**. 

 **Supporting the development of robust monetary policy:** the impacts of Martin’s work on thinking and practice in central banks extend to its use to develop robust monetary policy. The use of his work at the **European Central Bank**, for example, is described by its Head of Capital Markets/Financial Structure \(Directorate General Monetary Policy\) as having had both conceptual and practical effects on the ways in which financial market briefings are prepared for monetary policy discussions: 

 *“On a conceptual level we started to think about the term structure of the equity risk premium \(ERP\) as a useful indicator for monetary policy… \[which\] provides us with additional information relevant for monetary policy. On a practical level we implemented several versions of SVIX\-like indicators, developed by Ian Martin, for different jurisdictions. We regularly monitor the developments in these indicators…to detect changes in market perceptions on the economic outlook and report this analysis regularly to the policymakers.”* **\[B\]** 

 The real\-time, forward\-looking measure of “bubbliness” in stock markets set out in **\[4\]** is also proving useful for monetary policymakers. Martin presented that work at the **Bank of England** in September 2019 and discussed it further in a series of follow\-on meetings with staff there. According to a senior advisor at the BoE, it was clear that the indicator developed in **\[4\]** could be particularly helpful to the work of the Bank’s Financial Stability Strategy and Risk \(FSSR\) directorate, which monitors indicators of asset valuation for signs of bubbles inflating. Most of these are valuation ratios, which often fail to give a particularly clear signal because they can be explained by other factors: high price\-to\-earnings ratios, for instance, might be explained by low discount rates, rather than signalling a bubble. The particular qualities of Martin’s indicator, by contrast, mean that any bubble signals suggested by it could, the BoE believes, “ *be received with a high level of confidence”* **\[C\]**. 

 Martin took on a formal role as an academic consultant to the BoE in 2018\-19 and is now helping its staff to operationalise the indicator developed in **\[4\]** for regular use in the Bank. This work includes computing the indicator for the FTSE 100 index \(and possibly later for sector indices such as technology stocks\). These sorts of indicators are used by policymakers in the BoE, including the Financial Policy Committee \(FPC\), in assessing risks to the UK financial system and considering whether policy measures are needed to strengthen its resilience. Martin’s measure is expected to “ *join or replace some of the existing asset\-valuation measures”* used to make these policy decisions **\[C\]**. By helping them to more accurately detect asset pricing bubbles in real time, the research contributes to efforts to maintain stability in the financial system. This contribution is confirmed by Vlieghe, who acknowledges “ *how much impact \[Martin’s\] work has had in furthering our understanding of the link between asset prices and macroeconomic fundamentals, and helping us implement practical tools can allow us to make up\-to\-date asset price assessments for financial and monetary stability purposes*” **\[A\]**. 

 **Promoting a more rigorous understanding of risk premia and forecasting financial assets in private financial institutions**: beyond its contributions to the work of central banks and monetary policymakers, the research has also been used by some of the world’s biggest private financial organisations. It has been shared with and used by global investment management corporations including BlackRock \- the world’s largest asset manager \- and quantitative investment giant AQR Capital Management. In 2017, the latter named **\[2\]** as one of five finalists for its Insight Award, which recognises “ *papers that provide the most significant, new practical insights for tax\-exempt institutional or taxable investor portfolios”*. Investment funds, including the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, have also engaged with the work, which Martin presented to them on 30 June 2017. In June 2016, it was discussed at a  [conference at the University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en/school-business-economics-law/centre-for-finance/seminars-and-conferences/conferences/cff-ap2-conference-june-7-2016), organised by one of Sweden’s public pension funds. 

 Part of the interest in these organisations has been in the implications of the work for understanding risk premia. The equity premium \- the difference between expected returns on risky portfolios or investments and the certain return on risk\-free securities or portfolios \- is one of the central quantities of finance and macroeconomics. Standard theories such as the CAPM and its successors imply that it is a central driver of asset prices, and hence one of the most important determinants of aggregate investment in a macroeconomic sense. The more accurate appraisal of forward\-looking risk premia proposed by Martin makes an important contribution to the work of financial institutions as a critical component of investment processes within asset management firms. 

 The “ *meaningful impacts”* on industry of Martin’s research are explained by Dr Brandon Bates, a former senior portfolio manager at BlackRock, who says his work: “ *teaches us* how *to think about markets,* how *to impose structure on a problem with formidable complexity”* **\[D\]**. During his seven\-year tenure at BlackRock, Bates “ *witnessed regular discussion, adoption, and adaptation of \[Martin’s\] ideas, especially \[his\] research programme of imputing measures of market expectations from derivative instruments”* **\[D\]**. 

 The work also informs more specific aspects of understanding and practice which, because of the scale at which BlackRock and others operate, have very far\-reaching effects. Examples identified by Bates include the application of the model described in **\[1\]** by staff at BlackRock in the context of asset allocation \- the division of capital across asset classes \- which Bates describes as “ *the principal driver of long\-run investment returns”*. Recognising that “ *the dynamism of \[Martin’s\] measure suggested a much richer opportunity set for tactical asset allocation than anyone at BlackRock previously thought…at least two groups at the firm created a live monitor for the measures to use in their investment processes”* **\[D\]**. 

 Paper **\[2\]** “ *also generated notable excitement…Above the direct application of using \[Martin’s\] results as a stock\-level return forecaster, it inspired an entire research agenda within the group of deriving model\-free estimates of just about every key parameter”* **\[D\]**. 

 Bates further acknowledges the use of Martin’s work at BlackRock in the context of foreign currency exposure. This he describes as being, after asset allocation, “ *the most important consideration international investors weigh”*, with currency movements explaining “ *somewhere between 20% and 40% of returns in international equity portfolios”*. He continues: 

 *“What this means is that even modest skill in forecasting currencies promises meaningful improvements in portfolio\-level performance. With approximately USD300 billion in international active equity mandates, you can imagine why \[Martin’s\] paper* \( **\[3\]**\) *…generated excitement at BlackRock…I knew of two independent replication efforts. Additionally, two prominent investment banks created and then began circulating currency return forecasts based in part on \[Martin’s\] methodology.”* **\[D\]** 

 An asset manager’s strategy for deploying planned trades to the market is informed by time series dependence in returns. In a mean\-reverting market, it is best to wait for a favourable bounce to create better entry points; in a trending market, on the other hand, it is better to complete trades sooner. Many systematic investment strategies formalise this idea by using the degree of serial correlation in returns as a central parameter in trade\-timing models. Typically, practitioners estimate this parameter using historical data, which is necessarily imperfect. According to Bates, paper **\[5\]** “ *fills an important gap in practice by providing the first forward\-looking estimate for this parameter*”. When he left BlackRock in 2019: 

 *“…several research threads were underway to productionalise \[Martin’s\] insight for assets where the options market was sufficiently liquid to support forward\-start options. If an improvement in model calibration improves returns in trade\-timing performance by even 0.01 percentage points, the gains for BlackRock’s active equity clients would be approximately USD50 million per year.”* **\[D\]** 

 Because it supports more efficient allocation of capital, this sort of improvement in appraisal ultimately delivers broader macroeconomic benefits, as well as benefits to investors.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Assessment of animal pain and quality of life is critical to veterinary practice. UofG statistical research underpinned the development of robust, psychometrically valid tools to measure acute pain, chronic pain and health\-related impacts on quality of life in dogs and cats. The SME Newmetrica Ltd. was formed in Nov 2013 to commercialise these UofG tools, changing veterinary practice in  both assessment of pain and quality of life, and support for decision\-making by owners and veterinarians. Animal healthcare companies also use the tools to support regulatory approvals for new products and markets. The Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale \(CMPS\) is considered the gold standard for assessing acute pain in dogs in clinical settings as recommended in World Small Animal Veterinary Association \(WSAVA\) pain guidelines. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** 

 The assessment of pain and quality of life for companion animals is strongly subjective and the need for psychometrically valid statistically designed tools has been long recognised. These tools are essential in facilitating assessment of analgesic strategies and therapeutic agents to improve animal welfare. Statistical models and experimental design principles were developed by Prof. Marian Scott \(Mathematics and Statistics\) in collaboration with Prof. Jacky Reid, Prof. Andrea Nolan and Lesley Wiseman Orr \(Veterinary Science\) and have underpinned 2 clinical tools to assess acute pain and 2 owner\-centred tools to assess chronic pain and health\-related impacts on quality of life in dogs and cats. 

 **Acute pain tools for dogs and cats** 

 UofG statistical research led the development of structured questionnaires, designed and implemented surveys, and formulated psychometrically valid scoring models \(using item response theory, principal components and factor analysis\). Together, these underpin the creation of the tools. Statistical research has been instrumental in demonstrating the tools’ validity and reliability, essential properties for any tool used in clinical practice and in joint decision making between owners and veterinarians. The original Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale \(CMPS; 2001\) measured acute pain in dogs using psychometric methodology to a level of precision suitable for clinical trials. Statistical measurement theory was used to analyse the six behavioural categories associated with vocalisation, attention to wound, mobility, response to touch, demeanour and posture/activity. 

 For routine clinical use, where the emphasis is on speed, ease of use, and guidance for analgesia provision, a short form \(CMPS\-SF\) was developed \(2007\) \[3.1\]. Subsequently, the acute pain cat tool \(CMPS\-Feline\) was developed in 2014, initially using the same statistical approach as for the CMPS \(for dogs\) but also incorporating analysis of facial expressions around the eyes, ears and mouth. UofG statistical research used spatial, shape and landmark analysis to identify anatomical landmarks that discriminate between pain\-free cats and cats in pain to deliver the simplified facial elements of the tool \[3.2\-3.4\]. UofG research, with a focus on the communication and interpretability of the tool outputs, led  in 2017 to the development and quantification of intervention using discriminant analysis techniques, to inform clinical decision\-making \[3.4\]. The resulting measurement scales \(for both dogs and cats\) have been validated in different medical and surgical conditions \(surgery, cancer, osteoarthritis, obesity\), using statistical methods for optimal design and analysis and are now being used to validate the analgesic efficacy of pharmaceutical products in clinical trials. 

 **Chronic pain and health related quality of life \(HRQL\) tools for dogs and cats** 

 The original Health Related Quality of Life \(HRQL\) tool for dogs was a paper\-based assessment with 109 different questions and was too long for owners to easily and routinely use. In 2013 UofG statistical research led to the shortening of the tool to first 46 and then 22 items, and demonstrated the validity of a refined shortened assessment, VetMetrica Canine \[3.5\], which is superior to the original instrument in its ability to distinguish between healthy and unwell animals. The shortened tool was then validated in different medical and surgical conditions \(cancer, osteoarthritis, obesity\), using statistical methods for optimal design and analysis \(including time trend analysis and mixed effect analysis of variance\). Both canine and feline tools can be accessed via a mobile phone app for UK/Europe\-based veterinary surgeons and pet owners. Subsequent statistical work  in 2019 focussed on the creation of population norms for the HRQL dog and cat tools, and in providing alerts for vets and pet owners \[3.6\]. The feline generic quality\-of\-life tool was developed in 2018 \(HRQL\-Feline/VetMetrica Feline\), co\-funded by Newmetrica and a SMART grant from Scottish Enterprise. Subsequently, disease\-specific HRQL tools have been developed as bolt\-on modules for clinical assessment \(the first disease being osteoarthritis\) \[3.7\].

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Pain is a vital sign and veterinarians widely recognise its central role in animal care and welfare. However, pain assessment in companion animals is challenging due to the inherent barriers to communication, and the species\-specific response to and presentation of pain. The UK companion animal population included an estimated 10.9 million cats and 9.9 million dogs in 2019, many of which at some point in their lives may encounter pain through injury, chronic disease or surgery. 

 **Commercialisation** 

 In November 2013, Prof. Reid founded NewMetrica Ltd. \(newmetrica.com\) to promote the commercialisation and wider adoption of the UofG pain assessment tools within the veterinary community. UofG research knowledge was acquired by NewMetrica through Easy Access IP \[5.1\]. Further development of the tools and knowledge transfer has been facilitated through NewMetrica with applications in the UK and internationally. Prof. Scott has continued to work with the company as a scientific advisor, developing the methodology for constructing pain and welfare scales based on the creation of single, composite indicators from distinct observable components. NewMetrica has grown to become a recognised leader in the field of pain and HRQL research \[5.1\] through commercialisation of the tools in two major markets: \(A\) NewMetrica’s commercial licence arrangements with veterinary pharmaceutical companies have focused on service provision \[5.2\] to the veterinary community, capacity\-building through continuous professional development \(CPD\) training, fundamental research and development in clinical trials and driving pharmaceutical sales; \(B\) NewMetrica issues online licences for non\-commercial use of both their dog and cat acute pain tools \[5.3\], supporting clinical and academic research. 

 **Change in professional practice within veterinary profession** 

 International and national impact is evidenced in the change in professional practice as a result of first paper\-based, then web\-based and now app\-based, pain and quality of life assessment tools. The acute tools are widely used in veterinary practices \[5.2, 5.3\] and veterinary hospitals around the world. The acute dog tool has been translated into Italian, German, Spanish, Norwegian, French and Swedish, addressing the absence of validated pain assessment tools in these languages. Each translation required cross\-cultural validation \(e.g. Italian in 2018 \[5.4\]\) to define behavioural expressions. These are available via NewMetrica. The English\-language version has been reproduced in the WSAVA Guidelines for the Recognition, Assessment and Treatment of Pain, published in May 2014 and endorsed by veterinary associations in 67 countries \[5.5\]. The full text of the WSAVA pain guidelines have been accessed 38,595 times \(with 13,842 PDF downloads\) since publication. Our paper \[3.3\], presenting the introduction of facial aspects to clinical pain assessment acute pain in cats, was recognised for its outstanding contributions in the field of small animal veterinary practice at the BSAVA awards in 2016; Prof. Reid and UofG were recognised for their “Outstanding Contribution to Animal Welfare” at the Ceva Animal Welfare Awards in 2019” \[5.6\]. 

 The chronic pain/health related quality of life assessment tool for dogs, having undergone significant practical improvement from its original paper\-based version, is now available as a web\-based app \[5.7\] and on the Zoetis PetDialog platform \[5.8b\]. Additional statistical modelling has delivered an alert system to inform owners at stages when veterinary advice should be sought \[3.6\]. Additionally, a new online tool for cats has been developed, with a new design, in modular form, with a generic Quality of Life \(QoL\) module, and bolt\-on additions for disease\-specific characteristics \[3.7\]. 

 **Capacity\-building**: CPD delivered to drug companies and their partner veterinary practices has been a key impact pathway for the uptake of the tools into clinical practice. For the cat acute tool \(CMPS\-Feline\), CPD meetings supported by Boehringer and in partnership with NewMetrica, have been conducted in 630 different practices and to 3,779 veterinary professionals \(vets and vet nurses\) in the period January to December 2016. The Glasgow Feline CMPS was very well received, with the majority of attendees adopting it for use in their practices \[5.8a\]. Boehringer Ingelheim offer an online version of this tool as part of its Metacam® \(meloxicam\) drug support \( [www.metacam\-painscale.co.uk](http://www.metacam-painscale.co.uk/)\), and the accompanying five education webinars, which have been collectively viewed 2,800 times as part of their Boehringer Academy \[5.8a\]. Similarly, AnimalCare Ltd. offer their own branded versions of the Glasgow CMPS tools for cats and dogs within ‘The PAC’—their ‘Practice Assistance Centre’ available to their network of veterinary practices. Other licensees of cat and dog tools include CEVA Animal Health \(2016–2018\) and Dechra \(2017\) \[5.2\]. Zoetis have also incorporated both HRQL tools in their online platform, PetDialog\) \[5.8bi\] to allow owners to build a profile of their pet and to track their wellbeing. 

 UofG HRQL domains are included in a Zoetis Petcare Osteoarthritis checklist for owners \[5.8bii\] used in clinical veterinary practice. The development of the first psychometrically validated acute pain and chronic pain assessment tools for cats and dogs has stimulated and reframed the debate around how pain assessment should be conducted. The acute pain tools are widely used in clinical practice \[5.2, 5.3, 5.4\]. Online licenses issued between January 2016 and December 2020 for the CMPS\-SF tool \(dogs\) number 2,455 in 76 countries, with the greatest volume in the UK, USA, Spain, Australia and Canada; 90% were specifically for vet practice usage. Over the same period, licenses for the CMPS\-Feline tool number 2,206 in 67 countries, primarily USA, UK, Spain and Canada; 93% were specifically for veterinary clinic use \[5.2\]. These numbers reflect changing practice in veterinary clinics, such as in the use of analgesics. 

 Vetmetrica is the brand name for NewMetrica’s portfolio of structured questionnaire instruments to measure HRQL in animals. Since launch in January 2014, Vetmetrica.com has registered 169 veterinary practices and 2,179 owners \(N.B. pharmaceutical companies also count as a single owner\). The tools allow vets to involve owners with clinical follow\-up, or to monitor an otherwise healthy pet and alert to a change in health status. To date, 12,194 owner assessments and 2,428 vet assessments have been completed \[5.6\], showing active engagement with the tool. The chronic pain tools have raised awareness in owners of subtle changes in pet behaviours, thus extending the reach beyond clinical practice to the wider community of pet owners, raising their awareness of pain and welfare issues. **“ **\[Vetmetrica’s\] real time monitoring allows for early identification of problems leading to quicker intervention and the results can be used to help guide owners’ decisions and monitor responses to treatment.”** \[5.9a\] 

 The Zoetis Petcare Osteoarthritis Checklist now forms part of a North American Vet Tech course \(NAVTA Course\) \[5.8biii, 5.9c\] 

 **Regulatory changes: FDA and medicines approval** 

 Since its incorporation Newmetrica has worked closely with the US FDA Center for Veterinary Medicines \(CVM\) to ensure compliance with the US government’s 21 CFR 11 standard for electronic data capture. This also ensures that the data resulting from the web\-based apps and the subsequent statistical modelling meets the stringent quality assurance needed by the FDA CVM \[5.10\], opening the market for wider use in US clinical trials. These tools have provided the pharmaceutical industry with valid, reliable and responsive outcome measures to assess the efficacy of analgesic compounds in clinical trials. The tools have a role in supporting regulatory approval and are also used in the official documentation that accompanies veterinary products. 

 Recognising the benefits of HRQL assessment, a number of pharmaceutical companies have also used the UofG/NewMetrica\-developed HRQL tools in clinical trials to bring new products to market. 

 **Clinical trials** 

1.  During 2017–18, Royal Canin \(Gard, France\) used VetMetrica\-Canine in clinical trials of their SATIETY weight management product. Canine overweight and obesity affects nearly 60% of dogs in the UK, reducing quality of life. Use of the tool showed a significant improvement in HRQL as a result of weight loss in dogs on the diet product, which was launched in November 2019 \[5.11a\]. 

1.  In 2016 and 2017 Elanco Animal Health Inc \(Indiana, USA\) used CMPS\-SF to gain regulatory approval from the FDA for three different preparations of the non\-steroidal anti\-inflammatory <ins>robenacoxib</ins> for dogs \(both oral and injectable\) and cats \(oral\), demonstrating their effectiveness in the relief of postoperative pain \[5.10b\]. The same studies were also described in a post\-authorisation approval \(tablet and injection\) from the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) for a new indication of postoperative pain and inflammation in dogs \(2019\) \[5.11b\]. 

1.  Aratana Therapeutics similarly used CMPS\-SF to demonstrate product effectiveness to gain regulatory approval from the FDA for their novel local anaesthetic, bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension \(NOCITA\) for cranial cruciate ligament surgery. The slow\-release formula addresses  [an unmet need](https://todaysveterinarypractice.com/nocita-dogs-cats/) for postoperative pain control post\-surgery in the home environment. The  [Massachusetts Society for the Care & Protection of Animals](https://www.mspca.org/angell_services/nocita/) stated, “ *The introduction of NOCITA into the veterinary market has allowed us to greatly improve how we provide post\-operative analgesia to our patients*”. Between 2016–2018, Aratana earned USD10.8 million specifically for the NOCITA product with year\-on\-year growth. \[5.11c\] 

1.  Kindred Biosciences, Inc have used the HRQL\-Feline tools to demonstrate improvement in QoL in anaemic cats treated with epoCat, \(KIND\-510a\), a long\-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin in a 6\-week pilot field trial. Cats rapidly increased mean haematocrit and demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all three health\-related QoL domains. These results are critical to ongoing clinical trial discussions with the FDA \[5.11d\]. 

 **Conceptual and cultural impact\- assessment of pet health and wellbeing**: The development of the validated HRQL assessment tools for cats and dogs have stimulated and reframed the debate around how pain assessment and its impact should be conducted. Since the HRQL tools are used by owners in their own home, this has raised awareness in owners of subtle changes in pet behaviour \[5.8b, 5.11b\] and when combined with the alerting system, these tools enable owners to seek veterinary support in a timely manner.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peritoneal Dialysis is used to treat 380,000 people with kidney failure nationally and internationally. Our research has contributed to sustained improvement in their survival in the US and Europe, almost double that seen for in\-centre haemodialysis treatment. We have identified two types of peritoneal membrane injury which require different approaches to improve fluid management, while avoiding excessive harmful exposure from glucose in dialysis fluids. This has informed international guidelines for membrane assessment and improved prescription of peritoneal dialysis, including optimal time on treatment. Our findings have also indirectly contributed to increased global demand for non\-glucose fluids, benefitting commercial suppliers.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

####  Peritoneal dialysis \(PD\) provides a home\-based treatment choice that enables people to survive with kidney failure. For over 20 years Keele has been a world leader in PD research, demonstrating that peritoneal membrane function is associated with survival and that exposure to dialysis fluid, especially a high glucose concentration, can cause damage and reduce the ability of the membrane to remove fluid. This in turn causes overhydration of the patient which is strongly associated with reduced survival. Since 2000, a series of cohort studies and clinical trials led, or co\-led, by Keele researchers has expanded understanding of this problem and shown how different approaches to prescribing PD can improve fluid removal and avoid membrane injury. Studies include the European Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Outcome Study \(EAPOS\) \[3.1\]; Global Fluid Study \(GFS\) \[3.2\]; Stoke PD Study \[3.3\]; Peritoneal Dialysis Competitive Risk Analysis For Long\-Term Outcomes \(PD\-CRAFT\) \[3.4\]; European Icodextrin Trial \[3.5\]; and UK\-Shanghai Bioimpedance Trial \[3.6\]. 

 Progressive damage of the peritoneal membrane by glucose is of two types: firstly, there is a longitudinal increase in the speed of small solute transfer across the membrane \[3.1\], which we previously showed to be an independent predictor of worse survival because it reduces fluid removal. We have now demonstrated that this is mediated by local inflammation \[3.2\]. Secondly, there can be disproportionate reduction in the efficiency of fluid removal by the membrane due to thickening that increases the risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis \[3.3\]. This rare but severe complication of PD prevents the gastro\-intestinal tract from working properly, causing pain and malnutrition and sometimes requiring major surgery, which has a significant mortality risk. We demonstrated that the risk of this condition is negligible for older patients with more comorbid conditions due to the competing risk of death from other causes, but for younger patients, this risk of peritoneal sclerosis over time is important \[3.4\]. 

 Benefits of alternative approaches to high glucose prescription. There are three ways in which membrane injury and associated survival risk can be mitigated: *\(1\)* Using automated peritoneal dialysis \(APD\) which increases the efficiency of glucose in removing fluid \[3.1\]; *\(2\)* use of the polymer, icodextrin, as an alternative to glucose \[3.1,3.5\]; *\(3\)* avoidance of unnecessary increases in glucose to remove fluid by maintaining residual kidney function, which also keeps fluid status stable \[3.6\]. Use of icodextrin and APD in EAPOS \[3.4\], a study conducted in 21 European countries, mitigated both types of membrane injury and the mortality risk from fast membrane solute transfer was eliminated. In a trial comparing the use of glucose with icodextrin \[3.5\] we demonstrated that fluid reabsorption across the peritoneal membrane could be prevented when using icodextrin, improving overhydration while reducing glucose exposure of the peritoneal membrane. The UK\-Shanghai trial \[3.6\] used bioimpedance assessment of body composition to guide and improve management of fluid status. Results showed that when residual kidney function was maintained, patients did not become overhydrated, obviating the need for increased membrane glucose exposure. Taken together, these studies provide clinicians with alternative strategies to manage fluid status, with the potential to improve survival while avoiding excessive exposure of the peritoneal membrane to glucose.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>Evidence of a relative and sustained improvement in survival on peritoneal dialysis compared to haemodialysis since research was published</ins> 

 Survival analyses from the US Renal Data System \[5.1a\] show that “adjusted all\-cause mortality in prevalent patients receiving hemodialysis decreased from 192.9 per thousand in patient\-years in 2009 to 164.6 in 2018. The decrease was even greater in patients receiving PD, in whom the mortality rate decreased from 164.2 to 131.5. Median survival among incident hemodialysis patients improved from approximately 37 months in 2003 to 42 months 2008 and to 47 months in 2013 **\(Figure 5.7\)** \[5.1a\] **.** The improvement was even greater for patients initiating PD”. 

 In 2016, the European Renal Registry reported on sequential cohorts starting dialysis in which survival used to be equivalent for these different types of dialysis, but progressively has been disproportionately better for those treated with PD \[5.1b\]. The authors of this publication argue this was not due to changes in patient selection, suggesting that improvement in survival on PD, amongst other things, is likely to reflect better fluid management, appreciation of the value of residual kidney function and the greater importance of fluid versus solute removal. Research at Keele has focussed primarily on these issues and we have consistently shown that peritoneal membrane function, which is crucial to fluid removal, predicts survival \[3.2\]. This early survival benefit for PD is still evident in the most recent annual European Registry report \(2018, **Figure A.5.1**\) \[5.1c\]. 

 <ins>How our research has influenced guidance on peritoneal dialysis prescription</ins> 

 Evidence\-based guidance on dialysis prescription worldwide is led by the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis \(ISPD\). Their regular publications of guidelines are highly cited, downloaded and viewed \[5.2\]. Our research is well represented in the most recent, as well as previous, iterations of this guidance, including prescribing high\-quality PD \[5.2\] for people with cardiovascular disease, guidance on how long patients should remain on peritoneal dialysis \[5.3\] and, most recently, the evaluation of peritoneal membrane function \[5.4\]. Specifically, our research has contributed to this guidance in the following ways: 

 \(a\) Our research on membrane function \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\] informed a new framework for classifying types of membrane dysfunction and recommendations on how membrane function is evaluated in the clinic \[5.4\]; the avoidance of excessive use of high glucose concentrations \[3.1; 3.3\] \(and replacement with icodextrin if available\) \[5.2; 5.2; 5.4\]; and how to assess the risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis \[3.2; 3.3; 3.4 – data used by the guideline committee and published subsequently\] taking competing risks into account \[5.3\]. 

 \(b\) Use of icodextrin to improve ultrafiltration: our trial \[3.5\] \- the first to show that icodextrin improves fluid removal and hydration status in people with fast membrane solute transfer \- is included in all systematic reviews of trial evidence \[5.5 \(Cochrane Review\); 5.6, “Our systematic review demonstrates substantial clinical benefits for icodextrin based on high level evidence”,\] used to underpin the ISPD guidelines \[5.2; 5.4\]. 

 \(c\) The value of residual kidney function in maintaining stable fluid status was demonstrated in our trial \[3.6\], the only longitudinal study linking these parameters \[5.2\] 

 <ins>Evidence this guidance has impact through adopted practice and patient benefit</ins> 

 \(a\) The use of *automated peritoneal dialysis* to mitigate the mortality risk in patients with fast membrane transport, a strategy that follows directly from our research, was associated with a partial reduction in mortality and hospitalisation risk in a study of >10,000 patients treated by a Large Dialysis Organisation, \(Davita, based in the US\) \[5.7\]. 

 \(b\) A report of data from the international Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study \(PDOPPS\) shows that across the world *icodextrin* is preferentially prescribed in people with fast membrane solute transport. This has also translated into less use of high glucose concentrations and a maintenance of equivalent fluid removal \[5.8\] 

 <ins>Supporting shared decision making</ins> 

 Funded by Kidney Research UK and in collaboration with Hilary Bekker \(Professor of Medical Decision Making at Leeds University\), we have ensured that our research supports shared decision making through the development of a Dialysis Decision Aid, first made available in 2015 and recently updated. This decision aid, developed in collaboration with nurses and patients, including those at our affiliated clinical unit \(University Hospital of North Staffordshire\), supports patients in choosing the type of dialysis they will have, and the choice between home and hospital\-based treatments. Used in 1/3 of kidney units, the tool is also available to patients on the Kidney Research UK website \[5.9\] \(typically 600 patient downloads per year\). It is endorsed by NICE, European Best Practice Group, quality tested by the International Decision Aid Library Inventory System and included as an online decision aid on  [https://www.thinkkidneys.nhs.uk/ckd/tools\-for\-change/patient\-decision\-aids/](https://www.thinkkidneys.nhs.uk/ckd/tools-for-change/patient-decision-aids/) and international Med\-Decs  [https://www.med\-decs.org/en/kidney\-failure](https://www.med-decs.org/en/kidney-failure) websites. It has also been translated into Spanish \(by the Spanish Society of Nephrology\) and Italian \(by the Italian Association of Kidney Patients\). Incorporated in the Dialysis Decision Aid is information derived from our research on the risk of developing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, which is extremely low for older patients \[3.4\]. 

 <ins>Impact on industry</ins> 

 Baxter HealthCare, the largest global company producing PD solutions and the exclusive manufacturer of icodextrin \(commercially called *Extraneal*\) have used our research to demonstrate the added clinical value of this product. They have now obtained licences for its use across the world \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Oxford into methods and algorithms for the non\-contact monitoring of vital signs led to the development of the Oxevision system, the main product of Oxehealth, a spin\-out from Prof. Tarassenko’s research group. Oxevision is the world’s first CE\-marked continuous medical\-grade contact\-free vital\-sign monitoring system using low\-cost digital video cameras. The Oxevision software turns video cameras into health monitors, allowing real\-time estimation of heart rate and breathing rate with clinical\-level accuracy. Computer vision algorithms enable the patient location \(static monitoring\) and motion \(dynamic monitoring\) to be determined and quantified. From this, indices relevant to the care of the patient, for example the likelihood of a fall for an elderly patient, are derived. 

 Oxevision has been installed in 30% of mental health NHS Trusts in England and two separate sites in Scandinavia \(1,277 patient rooms in November 2020, GBP2,080,000 Annual Recurring Revenue for Oxehealth\). The resulting installation has resulted in better patient safety \(e.g. 82% decrease in harmful falls for elderly patients\), less intrusive observations \(disturbance rate at night decreased by 98%\) and improved patient privacy \(e.g. 86% of patients on an acute psychiatric ward felt a greater sense of privacy\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Current patient monitoring systems available to track changes in vital signs \(heart rate/pulse rate, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation\) require adhesive electrodes or sensors to be in direct contact with the subjects. Most patients outside of the Intensive Care Unit \(ICU\), where they are often sedated, find the probes difficult to wear over prolonged periods of time. 

 From 2010 onwards, Prof. Tarassenko’s team in the Institute of Biomedical Engineering developed new methods and algorithms for the non\-contact monitoring of vital signs using a video camera positioned several metres away from the patient being monitored. Most of the prior work reported in the literature \(from 2005 onwards\) had been with human volunteers in controlled environments. \[ **R2**\] 

 Prof. Tarassenko and his group developed robust methods to estimate the heart rate/pulse rate and breathing rate of patients being nursed in *clinical* environments, by \(a\) cancelling out aliased frequency components caused by artificial light flicker, using auto\-regressive modelling and pole cancellation; \(b\) identifying valid data using novel signal\-quality algorithms; and \(c\) using smart machine learning algorithms. \[ **R2, R4**\] 

 Heart rate and breathing rate estimation was shown to be sufficiently accurate and robust for the Tarassenko group technology to be clinically useful. It was evaluated in patients undergoing haemodialysis in the Oxford Kidney Unit \[ **R4**\], in adult intensive care and in neonatal intensive care, in a clinical study involving the continuous monitoring of pre\-term infants, for at least four consecutive days, in the high\-dependency care area of a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit \(NICU\) \[ **R3, R1**\]. Prof. Tarassenko’s group was the first in the world to report \(in 2014\) the non\-contact monitoring of changes in *oxygen saturation* \(a third vital sign, important in respiratory disease\) in patients using only ambient light and a single video camera. \[ **R1**\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Oxehealth was set up as a spin\-out company in 2012, and spent until 2015 evaluating the non\-contact vital\-sign monitoring technology and algorithms developed in Prof. Tarassenko’s lab in applications such as baby monitors. From 2015 onwards the company decided to concentrate on patient monitoring in mental health settings, as there was a market\-led demand, as well as a clinical need, for such a product. Baby monitors, on the other hand, were assessed by the Oxehealth Business Development team to be a niche application. The Oxevision product developed by the company based on the IP transferred from the University has previously been called the Digital Care Assistant. Prof. Tarassenko and Dr Villarroel \(the senior post\-doc researcher in his University lab on the camera research\) have continued to act as technical consultants to the company. 

 Oxevision uses an “optical sensor” \(video camera \+ infrared illumination in a secure housing mounted on a wall\) to monitor a patient in a bedroom/seclusion room 24/7. No equipment is in contact with the patient, and staff interact with the system via a monitor in the nurses’ station and portable tablet devices. \[ **S1**, **S2**\] Clinicians can: 

-  take medical\-grade cardio\-respiratory measurements remotely \(i.e. no need to enter the patient’s room to obtain the pulse rate and breathing rate of a resting patient\); 

-  access cardio\-respiratory trends from the last 24 hours to understand if a resting patient’s physical health may be deteriorating; 

-  receive real\-time alerts to high\-risk activity, prompting a safety check \(for example, if a high\-risk psychiatric patient spends a prolonged time in the bathroom or leaves the room, or if an elderly patient known to be at risk of a fall gets out of bed\); 

-  view objective patient activity reports \(daily, weekly\) to support clinical decision\-making. 

 Oxevision is a Class IIa Medical Device, and it has been validated with over 1,000,000 room\-hours of live running on mental health wards in the NHS, including Broadmoor Hospital. It is currently installed in 30% \(16\) of England’s NHS mental health trusts, including: West London, Kent and Medway, Oxford Health, Berkshire Healthcare, Nottinghamshire Healthcare, South West London and St George’s Mental Health, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership, Hertfordshire Partnership University, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys, Essex Partnership University, and Midlands Partnership \[ **S3**\]. 

 The economic and health impacts of Oxevision are now reviewed below. 

###  *Economic Impact – Exploitation of the video\-based software through the spin\-out company Oxehealth* 

-  Oxehealth was set up in 2012 as a spin\-out company, with GBP500,000 seed funding from IP Group, to exploit the video\-based non\-contact monitoring technology and software developed in Prof. Tarassenko’s research group. The company has grown year on year from 4 employees \(headcount: 4\) in August 2013 and now has more than 60 employees \(headcount: 60\) on the Oxford Science Park \[ **S4**\]. 

-  The technology was transferred through the software code, know\-how and exclusive licensing of patent applications \[ **S5**\]. Prof. Tarassenko, as Founder Director, continues to be actively involved in the company, primarily as a member of the Board of Directors and technical consultant. 

-  Oxevision generates GBP2,080,000 Annual Recurring Revenue from UK and Scandinavia. It has been deployed in 16 NHS Trusts \(30%\). It is also deployed in two separate sites in Scandinavia \(1,277 patient rooms in November 2020\) \[ **S4**\]. 

###  *Health Impact 1 \- Patients in mental health wards: elderly patients with conditions such as dementia* 

 Elderly patients on dementia wards are at a high risk of falls, which increases at night. Conventionally, regular checks are carried out on the patients in their bedrooms, yet incidents of falls still occur. If the fall is not observed \(the overwhelming majority of cases\), the clinical teams must treat it as moderate, i.e. needing an A&E visit. Oxevision allows the staff to monitor the patients remotely, without the need to disturb them physically to check their status, giving the patient privacy and peace. Oxevision also allows the staff to replay the video of a fall, and follow an appropriate course of action upon that review. 

 <ins>Benefits for elderly patients \(as documented by Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust findings in a 22\-month clinical study – interim results after 8 months</ins>\) \[ **S3**\]: 

-  48% decrease in falls at night 

-  82% decrease in harmful falls 

-  68% decrease in visits to A&E 

-  49% decrease in emergency service call\-outs 

-  71% decrease in enhanced observations, equalling 7,800 clinical hours saved per year. \(This represented a potential cost saving of GBP154,000 per year for their 24\-bed dementia ward.\) \[ **S1**\]. 

 “*Falls have reduced massively on the ward because of the system. \[Oxevision is\] our sixth member of staff on the night shift*”. 

 Ward Manager, Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \[ **S3**\] 

 “*I couldn’t imagine not having the system now in place. It’s something that makes us feel more secure and we feel it sets up safety for the patients.*” 

 Deputy Ward Manager, Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \[ **S3**\] 

###  *Health Impact 2 \- Reducing safety incidents and improving patient well\-being on Acute & Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit \(PICU\) wards* 

 Patients on PICU and Acute mental health wards require close monitoring as they often pose a danger to themselves, or to staff monitoring them. However, the repeated checking \(usually every hour, but up to every 15 minutes at night\) by staff can prove distressing and disruptive for the patient and their recovery. These disturbances can lead to aggression towards staff and the need for physical intervention to restrain the patient. Oxevision gives staff the ability to monitor patients safely and remotely and make judgement calls on treatment to avoid escalation when the patient is agitated, even when the patient is in seclusion. Where the patient has existing conditions that need monitoring or is administered medications with side\-effects which need monitoring, the system can be used to conduct health checks without the need to distress the patient via in person visits, resulting in a better standard of care for patients and a safer working environment for staff. Ben’s case below demonstrates the success of Oxevision in a PICU ward: 

 *“When Ben \[a pseudonym has been used to maintain patient anonymity\] came to the ward, he was very low in mood. He had been trying to ligate and refused to use his Continuous Positive Airway Pressure \(CPAP\) machine \[to help him sleep better\]. He didn’t feel that he could keep himself safe at that time, so we nursed him on close observations, but he found this really difficult and it really impacted his sleep. He was spending most of his time in bed because he was tired and feeling increasingly low in mood. We reduced observations as we knew they were causing Ben distress. Having the \[Oxevision\] system allowed us to check his pulse and breathing rate remotely and alerts us to certain activity if there is cause for concern. Ben’s mood has steadily improved and we can see from the system’s activity reports that he is spending much less time isolating himself in his room.”* 

 Deputy Ward Manager, PICU, Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \[ **S6**\] 

 <ins>Benefits for patients in mental health wards \(as documented by Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust\)</ins> \[ **S7**\]: 

-  PICU – 26% reduction in bedroom assaults and 40% decrease in rapid tranquilisation, medication to calm or lightly sedate the patient \(related to assaults\) 

-  Acute – 22% decrease in bedroom self\-harm; for female patients 66% and 15% decrease in bathroom and bedroom ligatures \(respectively\), and overall 15% decrease in bedroom assaults 

 <ins>Benefits for staff monitoring patients \(as documented by Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust\)</ins> \[ **S3, S7**\]: 

-  83% of staff identified incidents they would otherwise not have known about 

-  91% feel they can make better care or clinical decisions 

-  91% feel it improves safety between checks 

-  68%, 61% and 55% reported that the system had enabled them to prevent \(a\) potential self\-harm; \(b\) patient\-patient incidents; and \(c\) contraband\-use incidents, respectively. 

 “*Over the 23 years I’ve been in nursing, this is the best nursing innovation I’ve seen. You don’t have to go and wake up somebody or disturb their very important sleep to know that they are safe. You are reassured they are not in danger*.” 

 Deputy Ward Manager \(PICU\), Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \[ **S7**\] 

 *“We had just completed our level 2 checks, but I had an instinct that a patient was going to self\-harm. I used the Oxehealth system \[Oxevision\] to do a spot check and I could see her lying on the floor. I got the ligature cutters and the team went straight to her room. She had tied a ligature and it was pretty bad. We quickly cut it and transferred her to the local hospital to be treated. Had we waited any longer, she might not be here today. We often use the system to monitor patients’ pulse and breathing rate, but in this instance, we saved a life.”* 

 Healthcare Assistant \(Female Acute Ward\), Swanswell Ward, Caludon Centre, Coventry & Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \[ **S7**\] 

###  *Health Impact 3 \- Younger patients admitted to acute psychiatric wards being monitored in seclusion rooms \(where video cameras are already fitted\)* 

 <ins>Benefits for Group 3 \(as documented by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust\)</ins> \[ **S3**\] and \[ **S8**<ins>\]</ins>: 

-  Only 1 out of 275 night\-time observations required patient disturbance \(3\-week clinical study on a mental health ward\). Without Oxevision, all 275 night\-time patient observations would have required patient disturbance. 

-  Night\-time observation rounds completed in half the usual time, and 100% of staff felt that they disturbed the patients less. 

-  100% of patients surveyed felt safer at night and that they slept better, 86% feeling that their privacy at night had improved. 

 “*I sleep better \[in the room with Oxevision\] than the other room where the lights are turned on and the shutters are opened a lot of the time.*” 

 Patient testimonial, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust \[ **S3**\] 

 *“The way that nursing observations have taken place, with nurses checking patients in person, has not really changed for decades and can be incredibly disruptive to patient sleep. Working with Oxehealth is transforming the patient experience at night while providing reassurance to staff that the patient is safe.”* 

 Deputy Chief Operating Officer, Oxford Health, NHS Foundation \[ **S8**\] 

###  *Health Impact 4 – Keeping staff safe, and COVID\-19 patients monitored* 

 The Oxevision technology has been used to support inpatient services to manage positive and suspected cases of COVID\-19 for those on mental health wards. The technology and algorithms were used \(from April 2020 to December 2020, and beyond\) to minimise avoidable clinician contact with those patients needing to be isolated, through monitoring the patient’s cardio\-respiratory vital signs and their activities in their room. Oxevision kept the staff safe, the patient monitored, and the amount of direct in\-person treatment to a minimum, thereby minimising the exposure of the staff to the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus \[ **S1**\]. 

 “*We check Mary is safe and take her pulse and breathing rate measurements to avoid unnecessary contact. Having the system has been incredibly useful to help monitor Mary’s health, enabling us to respond in time if her physical health deteriorates while minimizing the team’s risk of exposure to COVID\-19.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The implementation of a much\-needed update to the UK railway infrastructure has gathered momentum over the past decade. Among the new infrastructure, signalling software is a key technology to increase capacity and automation. However, verifying the safety of this software is a challenge for the railway industry. Swansea University has developed novel safety assurance processes for signalling technologies, using new formal methods that are now in use by Siemens Mobility, a global leader in signalling. Our new processes, which improve error detection, motivated Siemens Mobility to invest in a new verification team in Chippenham to accelerate the development of their next\-generation digital interlockings. Similarly, the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board has incorporated our research on formal methods in guidance they provide to their members. Internationally, we have created a new European community of practice on formal methods in railway control. 
","
###  2. Underpinning researchSince 2007, the Railway Verification Group at Swansea University and Siemens Mobility have been collaborating \[R1 to R6\] to formulate and answer questions concerning safety and network capacity to improve the development of railway signalling software. Swansea’s work in this field has grown to enable international collaborations, with the Swansea Railway Verification Group being recognized as an international leader in the verification of signalling systems. 

 **2.1 Engaging with the railway domain** 

 Our sustained collaborations have been pursued using our industry\-focused engagement model \(Figure 1\): 



 Figure 1: Swansea Railway Verification Group engagement model. 

 Collaborating with the following industry partners and standards bodies, the application of this model has identified research problems and led to fundamental computing research \(listed in 2.2 below\). 

-  **Siemens Mobility UK \(formerly Invensys Rail, formerly Westinghouse\)** \(Steps 1 \- 4\) 

-  **Railway Standards and Strategy Board** \(RSSB\), who oversee and inform the UK rail industry's work to achieve continuous improvement in safety \(Steps 1 \- 3\), 

-  **Verified Systems International Germany** \(Steps 1 \- 2\), 

-  **The State Railway Thailand** \(Steps 1 and 4\), and 

-  **Chinese Railway** \(Steps 1 \- 2\). 

 The Railway Verification Group has also launched \(2015\), and still chairs, the **European Technical Working Group on Formal Methods in Railway Control**, which brings together academics and industry across Europe to fuel research in this emerging domain. The group’s reach is broad and includes 7 universities, 6 companies and industrial bodies \(Section 4.3\). 

 **2.2 Fundamental computing research** 

 In terms of Computer Science, our work has delivered new research in: 

1.  Formalization of industrial concepts \(domain engineering\) \[ **R3**\]. 

1.  Methodology for faithful modelling of industrial concepts \[ **R3, R4**\]. 

1.  Abstractions with soundness proofs allowing for tackling of state space explosion \[ **R4**\]. 

1.  Real world applications of modelling and verification for railways \[ **R1\- R4**\]. 

1.  Encapsulating formal methods in user\-friendly industry tools \[ **R3**\]. 

1.  Establishing a body of engineering knowledge on formal methods for use for railways. 

 We have undertaken this research using a wide range of formal methods, e.g., CSP, CSP||B, CASL, Real\-time Maude \(all in the OnTrack toolset \[ **R3, R4**\]\), and SAT based verification algorithms \(in the Siemens Ladder Logic Verifier \[ **R2**\]\). 

 **2.3 Research within Software Engineering for Railways** 

 Our research has directly addressed the problem of formal safety assurance in an industry that is under pressure to increase capacity and efficiency through the implementation of new automated and autonomous railway networks. Specifically, our research has focused on formally modelling and verifying: 

1.  **Implementations** of signalling systems at the level of program code written in ladder logic, a programming language standardized as IEC 61131 \[ **R1\- R2**\]. 

1.  **Designs** of signalling systems using visual specifications common in industry \[ **R3 \- R5**\]. 

1.  **Standards** for control systems \(European ERTMS; Chinese CRTMS\) replacing fixed, physical signals with dynamic, virtual signalling which utilises radio communication \[ **R6**\]. 

 Concerning **implementations**, Siemens and Swansea University have completed all four steps of the above engagement model. Concerning **designs**, RSSB, Siemens, Network Rail and Swansea University have completed the first three steps of the engagement model. Concerning **standards**, Siemens and Swansea have completed the first step of the engagement model and are working towards completing the second.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1 Impact within Siemens Mobility **\(Steps: inception through deployment\)** 

 *“Over the past decade our close association with Swansea University and their work on Formal Methods has contributed to a fundamental paradigm shift in our vision for signalling design. We have employed 2 full time verification engineers from Swansea Railway Verification Group to form part of our new verification research team at Chippenham. We have also chosen to integrate Swansea’s LLV tool into our interlocking development process, supporting rapid verification, reducing the testing effort and saving time and money.”* \[Project Manager, Siemens Automation, **C1**\] 

 In the REF period, Swansea University, through the Swansea Railway Verification Group \[ **C2**\] and Siemens have systematically explored novel verification techniques that scale to industrial practice \[R1, R2, G3, **C2**\] \(Steps 1 and 2\), as discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Building on this, through co\-creation, a verification toolset was developed \[G2\] \(Step 3\). This led to the embedding of Swansea’s formal verification techniques into a new signalling system implementation process at Siemens \(Step 4\). 





 Figure 2: Siemens\-Swansea Ladder Logic Verification tool. Green properties have been proven, the yellow property is currently being checked, and white properties are to be checked. 

 Our research has led to the following impacts within Siemens \[ **C1**\]: 

-  **Tool deployment:** Swansea’s ladder logic verifier LLV \[R1, R2\] is being used by Siemens Rail staff \(Figure 2\) as part of their interlocking development process and has verified 4 interlocking systems thus far. 

-  **Process change:** Siemens has changed the way that they test signalling systems in order to include formal methods developed by our team \[R2\]. Siemens has replaced a highly manual testing process with our automated tools, which enhance software quality by quickly finding errors including those that are often missed with manual testing. The time required for checking over 320 safety properties has been reduced from several weeks to approximately 2 hours using our verification process. 

-  **Job creation:** To support process changes, a new verification team has been formed at Siemens Chippenham, including 2 full\-time positions which have been filled by post\-graduates from the Swansea Railway Verification Group. 

-  **Knowledge Transfer: Through a 50% FTE secondment \[G2\], Dr. Phillip James has been involved in overseeing process change within Siemens. 

-  **Innovation diffusion:** Based on the deployments by Swansea, Siemens is transforming a number of their development methods to include formal methods, e.g., Axel counter control systems \(adapting Swansea’s LLV tool\). 

 **4.2 Impact across the rail industry through the RSSB and Network Rail **\(Steps: inception to tooling\)** 

 RSSB, Siemens, Network Rail and Swansea have completed the first three steps of the engagement model. Together in the SafeCap project, we developed new domain engineering \[P3\] and modelling and verification techniques for real\-world designs \(e.g., in CSP, CSP||B and CASL \[R4\]\). We were the first to provide proven abstraction techniques including covering \[R4\] and finitisation \(Steps 1 and 2\). Continuing this, the DITTO project \[G4\] embedded these results into a new toolset OnTrack \(Step 3\). OnTrack allows rail engineers to draw track plans, automatically transform them into a range of formal specifications, and to verify these with a range of provers, thus automating novel model transformations \[R5\].   These scientific advancements have contributed to a deeper awareness and understanding across the UK Rail Industry, as described below. 

 **Providing new guidance to RSSB on formal methods** 

 *“An essential part of our strategy for safely increasing capacity is guidance from Swansea University in 2017 on using formal methods for signalling analysis \(e.g. in the FuTRO: DITTO Project \- Summary of Findings \(T1071 Report\)\)”* \[Director of Research, RSSB, **C3**\] 

 RSSB maintains the SPARK rail knowledge hub for the rail sector to share knowledge and promote innovation. SPARK has over 16,500 active users from the international rail profession \(as of October 2019\). In total, Swansea has contributed five articles \(2015 to present, **C3**\) that have presented scientific arguments for the use of formal methods \(see **C4** pgs 7\-9 for Swansea’s core contribution\). 

 **4.3 Co\-creating with industry a new body of knowledge in Europe** 

 Swansea is co\-creating with other academics and industry a new body of knowledge on applying formal methods to railway systems. 

-  *Founding a New European Industrial Railway Forum:* The Swansea Railway Verification Group has formed the European Technical Working Group on Formal Methods in Railway Control. We brought together seven European groups and their industry partners, including ProRail \(via Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Twente\), Ansaldo STS \(via Universita' degli Studi di Firenze\), DSB, Verified Systems, VSI \(via Technical University of Denmark\), Siemens Mobility, Network Rail and RSSB \(via Swansea University\) and Verified Systems DE \(via Swansea University\). 

 *“VSI welcomes Swansea’s initiatives to organize and coordinate rail research groups. After a week\-long workshop in 2019 with 5 academics from Swansea University, we were able to strengthen the competitive edge of RT\-Tester by applying it to new ERTMS models provided by the working group”* \[Managing Director VSI, **C5**\] 

-  *Building a Community of Practice:* Swansea is at the centre of the creation of a community of practice, contributing to events by: 

  -  Hosting a RSSB Futro Board meeting in October 2017. 

  -  Running a one\-week railway verification workshop involving 4 universities \(Universita' degli Studi di Firenze, Twente, Coventry, Swansea\) in 2017. 

  -  Hosting an online international railway verification workshop as part of BCTCS 2020, with 50% industrial speakers, and 92 participants from both Europe and Asia. 

 Swansea has also published a handbook for the engineering domain with an illustration from the Railway Safety Domain \[ **C6**\] 

  1.  **Impact across international railways \(Thailand and China\)** 

 **Training and Education:** The Swansea Railway Verification Group delivered a week\-long workshop on the use of formal methods in railways \(using Swansea’s OnTrack\) to upskill 16 senior engineers within the Thailand State Railway. This has changed their procurement process to include formal methods. 

 *“we now take formal methods in account when we are purchasing new signalling systems.”* \[Superintendent Engineer State Railway Thailand, **C7**\] 

 **Inception and Exploration:** The Swansea Railway Verification Group has collaborated with the Tongkong Institute \(Anhui\) Ltd, applying Swansea’s Ontrack verification toolset on a large Chinese railway design with the intention to roll out Swansea’s technology. 

 *“From Swansea we have learned the benefits of formal methods, in particular for error checking of scheme plans, and plan to apply them to further designs in 2020/2021, with the ultimate aim of having Swansea formal methods integrated into our design tools for the Chinese railway”* \[Board Chair, Tongkong Institute, **C8**\] 

 **4.5 Public Outreach**The Swansea Railway Verification Group regularly engages with railway enthusiasts and the general public. The group has developed a model railway exhibition that shows how formal methods can solve safety problems. This has been an educational resource for the Didcot Railway Centre \[ **C9**\], the British Science Festival 2016, Science days \(2017\-2019\) for the National Museum of Wales, school visits and Technocamps in their outreach activities to all schools across Wales. 

 *“It was impressive to see that no matter how young children interactively controlled trains using 3D printed controllers, Swansea’s methods for ensuring safety always stopped the trains from colliding thanks to the verified control system”.* \[Swindon Panel Society Chairman, **C9**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research, conducted at SOAS, led to the development of a robust analytical method for distinguishing between Mainstream Islam, Ideological Islamism and Islamist Extremism. Expert Witness reports and examinations in UK court trials related to Islamist or Far\-Right extremism helped judges and juries distinguish between healthy, destructive and illegal religious and ideological acts, and to convict criminals guilty of acts of terrorism carried out on false religious pretexts. The research was also used for judicial training of High Court Judges and to inform the work of Counter\-Terrorism officials at the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Office, as well as UK Ambassadors and Government Ministers. The research thus allowed a fairer, fuller and more accurate understanding of Islam and Muslims at senior levels of the government and the judiciary. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The rise of the so\-called ‘Caliphate’ of the Islamic State group \(2013–2017\) in the context of the Syrian Civil War \(2012–present\) resulted in terrorist cases being prosecuted in English courts against British nationals who were alleged to have travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State group and other militant groups active in the war. This in turn created an acute problem in adjudicating in court what does and does not constitute normative and legitimate Islamic practice, and in understanding the nature of theological evidence that was adduced to justify terrorist activity. 

 The research of Dr Matthew Wilkinson, Senior Research Fellow in Contemporary Islam, developed at SOAS \(2015–2018\) drew on traditional Islamic theology as expounded in the traditional Sunni and Shia Muslim Schools of Law \(madhahib\), Critical Realist philosophy and Worldview theory to address the problem of distinguishing between Mainstream Islam, Islamism and Islamist extremism. 

 Islamic theology was used to explain the basic contours of Islamic practice and belief. Worldview theory showed how different types of Islam and Islamism are worldviews: integrated ways of being\-in and knowing\-the\-world that draw together facts \(and fictions\), laws, norms, generalisations, answers to ultimate questions to form a consistent idea of the self and its relationship to the world. Critical Realist philosophy was used to characterise different worldviews in terms of unity and diversity, and similarity and difference. Wilkinson’s research has identified and described these different worldviews as \(Fig 1\): 

 **1. Traditional Islam**, which falls within the general category of Mainstream Islam. This is the worldview of unity\-in\-diversity generated by the religious practice of those who accept and follow, to the best of their ability, the basic injunctions of the Qur’an and the Customary Prophetic Behaviour \(Sunna\) of the Prophet Muhammad, in a way that is appropriate to their circumstances without their aspiring to effect change in the political space. 

 **2. Activist Islam**, which falls within the general category of Mainstream Islam. This is Mainstream Islam as characterised by diversity\-in\-unity, practised to effect transformative personal change and/or transformative structural change in the public space according to Islamic principles. 

 **3. Ideological Islamism**, which falls within the category of Islamism. This is Islam as revolutionary political ideology directed at overthrowing, rather than transforming, existing political structures and replacing them with an Islamic State governed by Sharia Law. It is the worldview of exaggerated Muslim vs. non\-Muslim separation. 

 **4. Non\-Violent Islamist Extremism**, which falls at the intersection of Islamism and Islamist Extremism. This is Islamist ideology as it sharpens antagonistically into an absolutely divided, Manichean Us vs. Them Worldview that stresses the absolute difference between the ‘true’ ideological Muslim ‘in\-group’, and the non\-Muslim and ‘wrong’ Muslim ‘out\-groups’, who are afforded a less human or sub\-human status. 

 **5. Violent Islamist Extremism**, which falls within the category of Islamist Extremism. This is the absolutely divided, Manichean Us vs. Them Worldview by which the cosmos is constructed as a manifestation of the Eternal Struggle between Islam and Unbelief \(Kufr\). The non\-Muslim and ‘wrong’ Muslim, who do not struggle violently to establish a global Islamic state, are construed as eternal enemies of ‘true’ Islam and therefore fit to be exterminated. 



 Fig 1. The Worldviews of Mainstream Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism 

 Thus, Wilkinson’s research has for the first time addressed effectively and comprehensively a problem that has dogged policy makers and jurists for the last twenty years: how Mainstream Islam differs legally and practically from Islamism and Islamist Extremism. The research was made accessible through the publication of his 2018 monograph The Genealogy of Terror: How to Distinguish Between Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism, which was praised by high\-ranking legal practitioners/officials.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Wilkinson’s research on distinguishing between Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism informed a number of trials related to Islamist or Far\-Right Extremism; contributed to capacity building in the education of judges and senior barristers \(judicial training\); and influenced the work of the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, FCO and UK Government Ministers. This led to a fairer and more rigorous legal system. Max Hill QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, said that the research was ‘of enormous value to practicing criminal lawyers and to the interested “lay” reader’ **\[5.1\]**. 

####  Trials related to Islamist or Far\-Right Extremism 

 The ideas developed in Wilkinson’s research facilitated the decision\-making of judges and juries and barristers in 12 significant terrorism and hate crime trials \(2015–2019\) \[5.2\], helping them understand the nature of the Islamic or Islamist theological ideas that may be used to justify criminal acts and behaviour. Sir David Calvert Smith, former High Court Judge in charge of the Terrorism List and Chair of the Parole Board 2012–2016, stated ‘I have witnessed first\-hand, and had confirmatory reports about them from former colleagues, the impact and clarity that Dr Wilkinson’s research has brought to the understanding of Islam\-related evidence in terrorism cases’. He considered that Wilkinson’s monograph **\[3\]** ‘should be required reading for judges and lawyers tasked with handling cases of alleged “Islamic” terrorism as well as for the representatives of the media which report on them.’ **\[5.7\]** 

 Wilkinson was told by the Crown Prosecution Services \(CPS\) that his work had directly informed the understanding of the CPS in their decision\-making about which terrorism cases to prosecute or not. For example: 

 1. In November 2015, in Regina v. Rehman & Khan – instructed by the CPS – the defendants were convicted of terrorism offences, specifically of plotting to detonate a bomb in the Westfield Shopping Centre in West London. Wilkinson’s research \[5.2a\] was important since it showed that the communication of ideology by phone and social media between the defendants was consistent with their preparation of acts of terrorism. The Counsel for the Defence Zafar Ali QC, who had also acted as such in another terrorism trial – Regina v. Kamali \(2019\) \[5.2i\] – expressed his view that ‘Dr Wilkinson's ground\-breaking research in developing a method to make robust and clear distinctions between the Worldviews of Mainstream Islam, lslamism and lslamist Extremism was vital in both cases for clarifying to the Court whether evidence was extremist and/or terrorist or not’. He concluded that ‘Dr Wilkinson's research was instrumental in both cases in greatly assisting the Court’. **\[5.6\]** 

 2. Wilkinson’s research was used in the Central Criminal Court in Regina v. Kamran Hussain \(2017\) to show that evidence was consistent with the worldview and actions of the violent Islamist extremism of the so\-called Islamic State Group, and that the Defendant – a British Imam – had been encouraging his congregation to support the so\-called Islamic State group and its worldview. The research contributed to the conviction of the defendant for encouraging terrorism by showing that the teachings of 10 out of 17 sermons that were served by the prosecution as evidence strayed significantly from the teachings of Mainstream Islam into the worldviews of Islamist Extremism. **\[5.2i and 5.3\]** 

 3. In the 2017 Regina v. Burton Hate Crime Case– instructed by the CPS – the defendant was convicted of hate crime against a Muslim activist for harassing the complainant online with far right extremist taunting about the Islamic doctrine of Taquiyya \(dissimulation\). Wilkinson’s research \[5.2h\] showed that the ideas of the complainant were derived from the worldview of Mainstream Activist Islam and were not in any way extreme, and therefore not liable to the online vilification to which the complainant had been subjected. This meant that the complainant could continue his work documenting instances of anti\-Muslim prejudice and advocating institutional change unhindered by online abuse. **\[5.4, 5.5\]** 

 4. In a 2016 civil defamation case instructed by the BBC \(Shakeel Begg v. BBC\), the research showed that the ideas and preaching of the claimant were derived from the worldview of Violent Islamist Extremism and its exponents. The Hon. Mr Justice Haddon\-Cave’s judgement in this trial drew extensively and directly from Wilkinson’s Expert Witness report which became the basis of a legal test for Islamist Extremism. This was a highly unusual degree of impact in the legal space for a scholar of Islam, and The Hon. Mr Haddon\-Cave commended ‘the remarkable lucidity’ of Wilkinson’s oral evidence based on this research. **\[5.5 p69, clause 292\]** 

####  Capacity building of judges and senior barristers \(judicial training\) 

 As well as its direct impact in court, Wilkinson’s research was used by judges and senior barristers in the UK to build sustained capacity in the understanding of the procedural and theological relationship of Islam and Muslims to the Criminal Justice System. This was so that Muslims who appear in court can be treated fairly but not naively. 

 In November 2015, approximately 80 High Court judges attended Wilkinson’s lecture at the Serious Crime Conference and were empowered to know that the core Common Law principles of Equality before the Law, Mens Rea and Actus Reus, had their counterparts in Islamic Shari'a Law and therefore were not, in principle, contradictory with Islam. As a result of this lecture, Judge Richard Marks, the Common Serjeant of London, said that Wilkinson’s research ‘had helped judges reflect upon best judicial practice in crimes involving Islam and Muslims’ **\[5.9\].** 

####  Influencing the work of the Home Office, FCO and UK Government Ministers 

 This research had an impact on the deeper and more nuanced understanding of Counter\-Terrorism officials from the Home Office and Foreign & Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) in the distinction between the worldview and behaviours of Mainstream Muslims, Islamist Muslims and Islamist Extremists. In March 2017 and September 2018, Wilkinson gave a briefing to approximately 40 officials from the Home Office and Foreign Office, including 20 senior Counter\-Terrorism officials, to enable them to distinguish between the worldviews of Mainstream Islam, Ideological Islamism and Islamist Extremism, and to distinguish between healthy, destructive and illegal religious and ideological behaviours. The Head of the National Security Research Group at the FCO, described how ‘colleagues from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other Whitehall Departments have found the clarity and insight of Dr. Wilkinson’s analysis most helpful for developing our understanding of this field and for the practical work of diplomacy.’ **\[5.8\]** 

####  Informing the work of media reporting on Islamist Terrorism 

 Wilkinson’s monograph, The Genealogy of Terror: How to Distinguish Between Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism **\[3\]**, was also picked up by the mainstream media – in particular BBC News and ITV News – and used to inform explanatory discussion around terrorist incidents. For example, in the aftermath of the murder of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones on London Bridge on 29 November 2019, the framework from Wilkinson’s research informed discussion on the BBC Radio 4 Today **\[5.10\]**, BBC News, ITV News and BBC Newsnight programmes of 2 December 2019 **\[5.11\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Stirling research into The Daily Mile, a 15\-minute \(\~1 mile\) primary school physical activity programme, is helping fight the child obesity and inactivity epidemic. The research has led to an increase of over 4\-fold across the UK in the number of primary schools doing The Daily Mile \(an increase of 6,333 schools\). This means that at least \~1,700,000 additional children have benefitted from The Daily Mile who may not have benefited without our research. This sudden increase was achieved primarily through providing evidence on the significance of the health, wellbeing, and learning benefits of taking part in The Daily Mile, which led to changes to Scottish and UK Government policies, and underpins promotional campaigns. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 **What is The Daily Mile?** 

 **Figure 1.** Children doing The Daily Mile with their teacher. 



The Daily Mile \(Figure 1\) is a physical activity programme created and made popular by a school in Stirling, Scotland. It is promoted by government and overseen by The Daily Mile Foundation \(an independent charity, registration number 1166911, supported by INEOS;  [thedailymile.co.uk](http://www.thedailymile.co.uk/)\)  and has growing popularity nationally and internationally. The aim is that each day, during class time, pupils run / walk outside for 15 minutes \(\~1 mile\) at a self\-selected pace. It was anecdotally reported to have a number of benefits. These included improvements in physical activity, sedentary time, physical fitness, body composition, sleep, diet, concentration, attainment, behaviour, wellbeing and obesity levels. However, no study prior to ours investigated these reports. 

 **The Daily Mile improves fitness, fatness, physical activity and sedentary behaviour** 

 In our physiology study \[R1\] co\-led by Drs Moran and Brooks, we assessed some of the anecdotally reported benefits of The Daily Mile in 389 pupils \(aged 4\-12\) in two local primary schools measured at two time points \(between Oct\-2015 – Jun\-2016\). One about to start The Daily Mile \(intervention school\) and one not \(control school\). We assessed fitness by bleep test; body composition by skinfolds; and, physical activity / sedentary behaviour by accelerometer. The **key findings** were that The Daily Mile significantly improves fitness \(5% increase\), fatness \(4% reduction\), physical activity \(15% increase in moderate to vigorous physical activity\) and sedentary behaviour \(5% reduction\) compared to a control school. The Altmetric score of this article places it in the top 5%. Notably two thirds of associated Twitter mentions \(67%\) have been by members of the public rather than academics. 

 **Self\-paced exercise \(a Daily Mile\) improves children’s cognitive scores** 

 In our cognition study \[R2\], a large citizen science project, co\-led by Dr Moran and Dr Booth \(University of Edinburgh\), and supported by grants G1 and G2, we partnered with the BBC Terrific Scientific team. Between Aug\-2017 and Oct\-2017, we asked primary school pupils \(aged 8\-12\) to do online cognitive testing before and after completing one of three different intensity activities: \(1\) sitting outside \(control\); \(2\) self\-paced activity \( *i.e.* – a Daily Mile; intermediate\); or \(3\) a bleep test \(near exhaustive\). Almost 12,000 children took part in the research. One third of UK primary schools \(\~8,000\) engaged with the Exercise Investigation through the research, interactive quizzes and a Live Lesson \(2<sup>nd</sup> highest viewing figures of Terrific Scientific – *i.e.* 8,000 schools\). Our report to the BBC was covered in over 30 online newspapers/outlets including Time magazine. It was additionally listed as one of the top 5 ideas in the World by the Aspen Institute on 4<sup>th</sup> January 2018. The **key findings** were firstly, that exercising at their own pace significantly improved children’s cognitive scores more than control or near exhaustive exercise; and secondly, that despite anecdotal concerns near\-exhaustive exercise did not result in worse cognitive scores than sitting around doing nothing. We observed relative improvements in verbal memory, alertness and wellbeing \(all 7%\) and a 7 ms decrease in reaction time coupled with a 16% reduction in errors in the self\-paced activity compared to the control. 

 **How to successfully implement The Daily Mile** 

 In our implementation study \[R3\], led by Dr Ryde and Professor Gorely, we conducted semi\-structured interviews \(Dec\-2015 – Mar\-2016\) with senior teachers from four primary schools who had significant roles in attempting to implement The Daily Mile in their schools. We also spoke to the \(retired\) founder of The Daily Mile. Interviews were designed to cover implementation, barriers, and perceived benefits. The **key findings** were that for successful implementation in a primary school: \(1\) The Daily Mile should be 15 minutes and not until all pupils complete 1 mile; \(2\) it should be at pupils’ own pace although running is encouraged; \(3\) it is social and should be done in normal school clothes; \(4\) it should be completed on at least 3 days per week and there must be flexibility with other activities in the school schedule; and \(5\) classroom teachers must have autonomy over when to deliver The Daily Mile. 

 Dr Moran and Dr Booth \(University of Edinburgh\) became members of the Daily Mile Foundation Research Advisory Group in March, 2018.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Overview** 

 University of Stirling research is directly linked to the rapid growth in the number of schools and pupils doing The Daily Mile with reach throughout the UK and to a lesser extent abroad. In the UK, our research is linked to improved health and cognition in at least an additional **\~1.7 million schoolchildren** based on data collected by the Daily Mile Foundation \[S1\]. These schoolchildren are the main beneficiaries of our research. **Their parents, their teachers and Governments** benefit indirectly through the children and directly through having the information to make informed choices about the value of The Daily Mile to health and learning \[R1, R2\] as well as knowledge on how to successfully implement The Daily Mile \[R3\]. Our research has led to varying degrees of impact through four primary pathways described in detail below: \(1\) The ITV advertising campaign; \(2\) Government policy; \(3\) Recruitment of partner organisations to The Daily Mile Foundation campaign; and \(4\) Support for Daily Mile Foundation promotion nationally and internationally. 

##  1. Rapid increase in schools and pupils doing The Daily Mile through contribution to ITV advertising campaign 

 Prior to publication of our research only 9% \(1,900\) of UK schools were doing The Daily Mile despite promotion by the Scottish Government, Welsh Government, several organisations in England and the UK\-wide Daily Mile Foundation. Our research showed how to successfully implement The Daily Mile \[R3\], and established the significant physiological \[R1\], cognitive and wellbeing \[R2\] benefits. This was critical in convincing ITV to run an advertising campaign with reach across the whole of the UK and was communicated to The Daily Mile Foundation in March 2018 prior to publication and with permission to share with ITV \[S1\]. Trustee of the Daily Mile Foundation, John Wyllie, corroborates this: 

 “\[the research\] was fundamental. It really was, because ITV, it was a big contract for us, and it cost a lot of money, so it had to be right.  And what they had said to us was, ‘…we like the idea of the Daily Mile. But, we need to be sure in our own minds that what we are backing is a valid activity.’ And, when the research came out, that was it. It just convinced everybody.” \[S2\] 

 Our research also shaped the ITV advertising campaign: 

 “…it \[the research\] was fundamental, and without it, I don’t think that contract would have been signed off the way it has.” – John Wyllie \[S2\] 

 “…they \[ITV\] changed it \[the strapline\] to “The Daily Mile works for children” once they had the research.” – Founder of the Daily Mile, Elaine Wyllie MBE \[S2\] 

 
By December 2020 \(32 months after the campaign launch\), there was a greater than 4\-fold increase in UK schools doing The Daily Mile \[S1\] ranging from a 1.4\-fold increase in Scotland to an almost 7\-fold increase in England \(see Figure 2\). This means that at least an additional \~1,700,000 children are benefiting from The Daily Mile who would not otherwise have had the opportunity \[S1\]. Note that this is a conservative estimate  as it only includes schools registered on the Daily Mile Foundation website and does not account for children who have progressed to secondary school. 


 **Figure 2.** Change in participation in The Daily Mile with ITV campaign for each Home Nation. 


##  2. Impacts on UK and Scottish Government policies on or including The Daily Mile 

 <ins> *The UK Government*</ins> Childhood Obesity Strategy \(2018\) includes a recommendation that they “ *will promote a national ambition for every primary school to adopt an active mile initiative, such as the Daily Mile*” and specifically references our research \[R1\] to support this intention \[S3\]. Our research had originally been confidentially shared with the Health Select Committee at the House of Commons in October 2016 \[S4\] and Public Health England in December 2017 \[S5\] prior to full publication and in advance of this strategy. In 2020, our research \[R1\-R3\] was included in Public Health England guidance on Active Miles in primary schools \[S6\]. 

 <ins> *The Scottish Government*</ins> encouraged implementation of The Daily Mile to all primary schools on the 7<sup>th</sup> November 2015, despite only anecdotal evidence for its efficacy. We confidentially shared our research \[R1, R3\] supporting their policy with the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland in April 2017 prior to full publication \[S7a\] and presented our research \[R1\-R3\] at an event organised by the Scottish Government in April 2019 \[S7b\]. This was used as evidence to support creation of a Daily Mile Programme Manager for Scotland post \(cost \~GBP50,000\) and fed into Scotland’s Daily Mile Nation Strategy \[S9\] published in October 2020 which aims to take the Daily Mile beyond primary schools and make Scotland the first Daily Mile Nation \[S7b, S7c\]. 

##  3. Recruitment of key organisations to support The Daily Mile Foundation 

 Our research findings \[R1\-R3\] are regularly discussed by members of the Daily Mile Foundation when promoting the Daily Mile to potential new partner organisations who increase visibility and help promote the Daily Mile, *e.g.* Sport England, The London Marathon, Ireland Athletics and the Scottish Rugby Union. 

 “They’re really interested in the Daily Mile, because they can see that it’s an initiative that links with their kind of world of physical activity, it’s critical in being completely inclusive, there’s no one left out. So, why are we, you know, working with the SRU?...it’s because Stirling’s research, once again, gives people in positions of authority, within organisations, that confidence that they can do it.” – John Wyllie \[S2\] 

 “Sport England were waiting, literally waiting for the research, and then they said, “Okay, how can we help you to get the Daily Mile into the schools in England?” … So they committed £1.5 million over 18 months to support 12 coordinators to go into schools across England, particularly in certain areas where they felt there was the greatest need.” – Founder of the Daily Mile, Elaine Wyllie MBE \[S2\] 

##  4. Support for The Daily Mile Foundation promotion of The Daily Mile nationally and internationally 

 The Daily Mile reaches into >12,000 schools in 79 countries \[S1\]. Our research \[R1\-R3\] is regularly used by members of the Daily Mile Foundation when promoting the Daily Mile to new schools and organisations both nationally and internationally: 

 “…when Stirling University finally published that evidence, it was like a dam burst for us.  Because, all of the people that we had been talking to over the last two years suddenly were saying, ‘This is fantastic, it’s what we’ve been waiting on, and it allows us to go forward and start to introduce it in different ways within our organisation.’” – John Wyllie \[S2\] 

 “It was international as well, because it began to mean that we could talk – we have partners all over the world – we could talk to people all over the world and show them what they wanted to see as well.” – John Wyllie \[S2\] 

 A downloadable guide, produced by the University of Stirling in October 2018, aimed at teachers and parents and known as the ‘How to – Why to’ Guide \( [http://stir.ac.uk/2xj](http://stir.ac.uk/2xj)\) has been key to this. It has been downloaded directly from the University of Stirling website and The Daily Mile Foundation website >150 times \[S8, S9\]. However, The Daily Mile Foundation also provide it to all schools and organisations interested in introducing the Daily Mile in the UK and abroad. For example, The Daily Mile Foundation have shared it with diverse organisations such as The Sports Institute at the University of Washington, the Portuguese Athletics Federation and the Vienna City Marathon \[S1\]. 

 “Now that \[guide\], basically, defines the Daily Mile…the research that the University of Stirling did pinned down what The Daily Mile was and the best way to implement it…all our partners across the World… have it \[the guide\]… our website has been translated into many languages and, in their own language, the first thing that our partners get, and then the schools get, is the How to – Why to Guide…written by the University, and that was key.” – Founder of the Daily Mile, Elaine Wyllie MBE \[S2\] 

 **Who benefits?** 

 “…I mean, we would say the children. There’s no question about it.  They are the centre of the whole thing. I think it’s those people who, like us, believe that children’s health is important, and, as adults, we really have to do something about it, we can’t sit on our hands, and the research gave them a – gave them and us – a kind of key to open things up and get it going.  Because the people we depend on to promote The Daily Mile come from all walks of life, and they need something that they can say to their own team, “This works for children, it’s been shown to work,” and we can go out there with confidence and say to people, “This is good for the children.”  So, it’s been a very broad church, but they have all benefited from it \[University of Stirling research\], because it’s like a key to talk to people properly about it.” – John Wyllie \[S2\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Rachael Clawson and Rachel Fyson’s ground\-breaking research on forced marriage of people with learning disabilities is the first of its kind either in the UK or internationally. Their work has influenced policy through its impact on practice guidelines in the UK. It has led to new statutory guidance, to changes in how the Government collects data on forced marriage, and to improved frontline practice. It has also made a substantial contribution to raising public and professional awareness of forced marriage of people with learning disabilities, both in the UK and internationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

-  **2009**: £20,000 *Forced Marriage of People with Learning Disabilities – Understanding Motivators and Consequences* – funded by Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit: Domestic Programme Fund. R. **Clawson – PI**. 

 This study was the first anywhere in the world to examine the phenomenon of forced marriage of people with learning disabilities. It used snowball sampling to identify professionals with experience of involvement in such cases  and resulted in the hypothesis that men with learning disabilities were as likely as women to be subject to forced marriage, with the main motivator being family members seeking long\-term care for their loved one \(R2, R3\). The impact of this work was that Clawson wrote the Government guidelines \(R1\) on preventing forced marriage of people with learning disabilities and the Forced Marriage Unit \(FMU\) agreed to start recording whether victims of forced marriage were disabled. 

-  **2012**: £9,976 Forced *Marriage and Learning Disabilities Practice Guidance: Having a National Impact?* – funded by Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit: Domestic Programme Fund. R. **Clawson – PI**. 

 This study examined the extent to which adult safeguarding boards \(the statutory bodies charged with oversight of adult safeguarding within each local authority\) were aware of, and engaging with, the Government guidelines \(R1\). It found that few had incorporated the guidelines into local policy or practice \(R4\). As a result, in 2014, the guidelines were incorporated into new statutory guidance, therefore requiring local authorities to comply. 

-  **2014:** £11,000 *The Hidden Truth* \- funded by Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit: Domestic Programme Fund. R. **Clawson – PI**. 

 Findings from the earlier research led the FMU to fund a third initiative, organising and facilitating eight conferences across England to raise awareness of the issue of forced marriage of adults with learning disabilities amongst frontline practitioners with a safeguarding role. Professionals, including police, law, social work, health, education and NGO staff attended these events, resulting in raised awareness of the practice guidelines. 

  

-  **2016\-18** £232,953 *Forced Marriage of Adults with Learning Disabilities: Developing Knowledge, Policy and Practice to Keep People Safe* – NIHR School for Social Care Research. R. **Clawson – PI**. 

 This primary research further developed knowledge, policy and practice to safeguard people with learning disabilities from the risk of forced marriage. It involved analysis of FMU data and engagement with diverse stakeholders to explore their understandings of consent, capacity and forced marriage. The work not only confirmed the unexpected gender distribution first hypothesised in 2009 but also identified a five\-fold heightened risk of forced marriage for people with learning disabilities \(R5, R6\). It also revealed a lack of understanding about the legal meaning of consent and capacity. Findings have led to a website with open resources for use by lay and professional stakeholders to raise awareness of forced marriage of people with learning disabilities and support better understanding of relevant legal issues \(B\). It has also resulted in political engagement with these issues and interest from other Government departments including the Attorney General and General Registry Office.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The cumulative impact of research and associated knowledge exchange activities is evident in engagement, policy and practice, both in the UK and internationally. **Engagement** involves **increased awareness** of the issues amongst diverse stakeholder groups, including **politicians and policymakers, practitioners**, and the wider communities through **media coverage**. Direct impacts include **changes to policy** and evidence that the resources, developed by Clawson and Fyson, are being used in **practice** to prevent forced marriages. 

 **Increased awareness.** Over the past decade, Clawson and Fyson have spoken about forced marriage of people with learning disabilities at over 60 events, attended by over 3,000 professionals, families, policy makers, politicians, academics and people with learning disabilities \(A1\). Knowledge exchange work has been further enhanced by the *‘My Marriage My Choice*’ website which provides **free resources** \(B\) including:  guidance and workbooks to enhance the knowledge of people with learning disabilities, family carers and professionals; tools for professionals to use when assessing capacity to consent to marriage; and a 30\-minute film available **in English, Hindi, Urdu and Sylheti** \(B\). The film was **launched in the Houses of Parliament** and has been screened at 14 events, attended by 237 people, with post\-show discussions that **challenged misunderstandings around capacity to consent** \(B, A2\). 

 **Engagement of politicians and policymakers.** The film was launched in the Houses of Parliament, sponsored by an MP; this resulted in questions in the House of Commons** \(C\) and invitations from other politicians followed. In October 2018, Clawson met with the **Attorney General**, QC, MP and Head of Policy at the **Crown Prosecution Service** who has asked for the existing toolkit \(B\) to be developed into guidance for prosecutors about working with people with learning disabilities and other vulnerable adults. In November 2018, Clawson met with **Home Secretary** and the MP **Minister for Communities, Safeguarding and Vulnerability** who were interested in the research findings. 

 These political connections led to **international policy links**, including participation in the European Symposium on Female Genital Mutilation and Forced Marriage hosted by the Home Office in 2018; and a Foreign & Commonwealth consular reception in 2018. Interest in this research has been shown by the **Australian** Attorney Generals’ Office \(who Fyson met in 2016\); the **Canadian  High Commission \(who Clawson met in 2019 and 2020\); and the **Swedish** Health Minister \(who Clawson met in 2019\). These connections have led to impacts on international cases \(D\). 

 **Media coverage** \(E\) has raised public, professional and political awareness of this issue. The research, and its implications, have been widely reported in both mainstream and specialist media, in the UK and internationally. Clawson has been interviewed on multiple occasions for news media. **Television** includes live interviews on ITV Evening News and NottsTV. **Domestic radio** includes BBC Radio 4 \(2012; 2013\); BBC Asian Network \(2009, 2012, 2013 and 2018\); Gem FM \(2018\); and BBC Radio Leicester \(2018\). **International radio** includes BBC World Service \(2009\) and TBS eFM South Korean primetime radio news \(2016\). **Mainstream UK newspapers** includes The Times, The Sunday Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Independent. **International news media  includes outlets in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. **Specialist media** includes Eastern Eye; The Conversation; Learning Disability Today; and Community Care.  Clawson has also written Community Care Inform guidance on Forced Marriage of People with Learning Disabilities \(F\). 

 **Changes to Government policy and guidance.** This work has led directly to changes in Government policy. Clawson wrote the initial Government practice guidelines in 2010 \(G1\) and these were **incorporated into the statutory guidance** issued in 2014, which now explicitly addresses forced marriage of people with learning disabilities \(G2 and G3\). The 2014 statutory guidance is currently under review \(January 2020\) and Clawson has been asked help write the updated version \(H\), which will include a link to the resources on our ‘ *My Marriage, My Choice’* website \(B\). 

 Within the FMU, this work has led to **changes in recording practices**, so for each reported case of forced marriage the presence or absence of disability is now recorded \(I\). Most recently, Clawson has been campaigning for a **legislative change** in: i\) how registrars should be trained to identify cases of incapacity to agree to marriage, and ii\) that notices of forthcoming marriages and civil partnerships should be published online \(the Guardian, 9.10.2020, E\). This campaign was embraced by the FMU \(H\) and the Parliamentary Under\-Secretary of State of Justice, who confirmed that Clawson’s work on predatory marriages has already been introduced to policy officials in the Ministry of Justice \(J.\) The UK Law Commission is currently reviewing the law on weddings. In November 2020, Clawson submitted **a report to the Law Commission’s consultation** on this matter. 

 **Impact on practice**. The above policy changes have had a **substantial** **capacity building impact** **and transformed daily practice for professionals** who are safeguarding vulnerable people in the **UK and internationally** \(A3, D\). Clawson is often called upon to give case advice to the FMU \(H\). Engagement with professionals from a diverse range of backgrounds including not only those working in health and social care but also police forces, immigration judges and marriage registrars \(A3\) has led to impacts on frontline practice. Such changes in practice have, in turn, led to an **increased number of cases reported to the FMU \(R5\), meaning that more people are being safeguarded.** 

 For example, a Senior Occupational Therapist of the North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust shared that she’s been using the *‘My Marriage My Choice’* web\-based resources in her tutorial activities and has been encouraging her students to further promote these resources. The films and the resource booklets for clients and families are also **used in everyday practice** with individual clients \(A3\). The Deputy Chair of Enable Disability and Carers Community DCC at West Midlands Police \(WMP\) explained: *“…The toolkit is also included in our WMP aide memoire for officers and staff and has been shared regionally with other forces….“Without question this research and toolkit will **have a huge impact upon the safeguarding response to dealing with forced marriage and learning disabilities from both police forces and partners alike as there is nothing like it**“* \(A3\). 

 The Designated Migration Officer at the Canadian High Commission referred to a refused application due to the sponsor’s \(in\)capacity to consent to marriage, acknowledging that: *“I referred the Hearings Officer to **your internet tools** and he found them **extremely helpful…we won that appeal and therefore we have prevented a Canadian Citizen from being forced to live with an unwanted spouse.** It would be easy to forget that there are individuals involved but this is an example of where your work has made a huge difference to an actual victim”* \(D\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research on public perceptions of aid, co\-produced with the Strategic Insights Team at the Department for International Development \(DFID\), changed DFID’s communication strategy and how it – and now its successor, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office \(FCDO\) – conducts messaging research. In particular, the research provided new analytical tools that allowed DFID to identify how specific development aid messages resonated with particular segments of the public. This led to alterations in how DFID carries out research as well as changes to DFID’s communication strategy so as to maximize aid support by framing public communications in ways that better connect with public expectations. As a result, this research contributed to the evidence\-base for the UK government’s efforts both to maintain public support for aid spending and pursue national interests associated with being the second largest bi\-lateral aid donor in the world. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The commitment to aid as a crucial part of its foreign policy has made the UK a global leader in international development, placing it at the forefront of responses to global challenges such as climate change, poverty alleviation, and health, while also increasing the UK’s global influence and reach. However, both the commitment and the cost of aid are controversial, therefore it is important to understand what specific segments of the UK public think about aid spending and priorities, and how messages help influence more positive attitudes towards it. 

 This impact case study is underpinned by two interconnected research streams examining public attitudes to aid. Research by Prof. Simon Lightfoot \(2011\-12\) highlighted the challenge faced by government in maintaining support for aid commitments in the face of scepticism and hostility in public opinion and the mainstream media **\[1\]**. This qualitative research identified that the government needed to better communicate the relevance and importance of aid commitments to the public. It argued that, contrary to DFID’s assumptions, a focus on results\-driven communications could be counter\-productive, ultimately weakening development commitments to poverty reduction. These findings overlapped with those of a 2009\-12 ESRC\-funded study by Profs. Graeme Davies \(Leeds\) and Robert Johns \(Essex\) on British public attitudes to foreign policy **\[a\]**. This research included unique survey questions that asked respondents whether British foreign aid should be allocated on the basis of recipient need or UK national interest. Significant results suggested a greater resonance with national interest narratives **\[2\-4\]**. These projects came together via a co\-authored blog post in 2015 **\[5\]** and a joint conference paper given at the University of Essex in 2016 **\[6\]**, where the national interest/need question attracted the attention of the then DFID Head of Strategic Insights. 

 Contemporaneously, the November 2015 government white paper ‘ [UK aid: tackling global challenges in the national interest](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest)’ set out a new strategy for UK aid with an explicit focus on the ‘national interest’. DFID had to ensure they communicated the national interest aspect of this new strategy. As a result, DFID commissioned a bespoke co\-produced research project with Lightfoot, Davies and Johns \(funded by Leeds and Essex Impact Acceleration Accounts **\[b\]**\) to test its current narratives about aid, and to identify and refine a more effective communications strategy around national interest. 

 To investigate the problem of communicating value\-for\-money versus national interest framing, the research team drew upon earlier experimental methodologies developed by Davies and Johns, which demonstrated that communication strategies are well\-placed to influence public opinion \(and informed the DFID research design\) **\[a\]**. These experiments provided a well\-validated method to test the effect of those messages **\[2\-4\]**. The research tested Lightfoot’s theoretical assumptions about the role of messaging **\[1\]**, showing how the presentation of information by the government has a significant effect on public attitudes towards international affairs **\[2\-4\]**. This research formed the foundation of the subsequent co\-designed research collaboration with the Insight Team and the Communications Insight and Evaluation Advisor at DFID in 2016\-17 **\[b\]**. Via a series of consultations with DFID, Lightfoot contributed to the research question design whilst Davies designed the final survey and led refinement efforts related to national interest narratives and the messages DFID wanted to test. The team conducted analysis and presented the findings to DFID, with Lightfoot and Davies leading continued engagement efforts, resulting in the impact detailed below. Recommendations derived from the research included that DFID should avoid messages discussing its budget, value for money, expenditure justifications, complex aid rationales, or the need to relate all aid back to internal UK outcomes. Instead, communications should focus on tangible aid outcomes, positive stories, and health aid; and that it should be targeted to apprehensive audiences/media outlets with national messaging related to aid and security, which was seen to generate higher public approval with aid\-sceptics and those only ‘marginally engaged’.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The main beneficiary of the underpinning research has been DFID, which: i\) changed how DFID conducted messaging research, and; ii\) influenced its communication strategy, helping it to better make the case for aid spending to the UK public. The co\-produced research provided evidence that was used to justify internal resource allocation at DFID and beyond, with the research recommendations incorporated into toolkits on how to communicate about aid and national interest, which, the then Director of Communications at DFID explains, are *‘now used as part of \[DFID’s\] guidance to those who work on aid communications across government’* **\[A\]**. 

 **i\) Changing research practices and building capacity at DFID** 

 Close and sustained co\-operation between the academics and the team at DFID was crucial for providing the Department with the necessary capacity for designing, implementing and analysing public opinion research, and has offered a new model for how it conducts research and creates evidence\-bases for policymakers. As part of the research design phase, the research team introduced DFID to new experimental designs **\[a,6\]** that could allow pinpointed testing of various demographic groups so as to test specific messages in relation to those particular audiences. This allowed for greater nuance in determining how various groups respond to aid messaging, which had not been available previously to DFID’s Insight Team. In response, DFID invited Davies and collaborators to co\-produce a customized survey with DFID’s Insight Team. Between 17 February 2016 and 16 March 2017, Davies led two survey design meetings, one additional remote meeting, and over 50 email exchanges with DFID so as to develop experiments that reflected their exact communication interests. DFID worked closely with the academics at every stage – designing the project, drafting the questionnaires, analysing the data, and reporting the results. DFID invited Davies and Johns to lead additional refinement efforts to test out various narratives for DFID, specifically those related to economic interests, international leadership, health security and related messages. 

 By the end of this period the research team jointly produced a series of messages that were then used in a pilot study which was fielded by Prolific \(a company which recruits survey participants\) amongst a section of the British public **\[B\]**. A report on these initial findings led to further refinement of the messages that were then tested in a nationally representative sample in January 2017 by the public opinion firm BMG **\[C\]**. According to the Director of Communications at DFID, this research was *‘invaluable in helping address a specific need for our communications strategy, namely to better understand how we create messaging that demonstrates the benefits of spending aid to the UK’*. Since DFID itself did *‘not have the budget to gather insight’*, and therefore lacked institutional capacity, the Director adds, *‘without the support of these academics we would not have been able to undertake this testing to inform our message development’* **\[A\]**. Furthermore, DFID’s Communications Team’s approach to carrying out research and using research data was impacted, with the Director stating, *‘as a result of this project we were able to make a case to secure funding from another government department to gather further insight on the topic’* and that the methods they would take from the research team would enable this future research to help them further understand *‘how we can best land these messages with the UK public’* **\[A\]**. The insights generated, along with the subsequent research mentioned above, has also been used to train and upskill government communications colleagues for use in social media, ministerial statements, and press lines **\[A,H\]**. 

 **ii\) Changing messaging on national interest at DFID** 

 The research subsequently influenced DFID’s framing of aid in terms of national interests and led to changes in their messaging, enabling challenging audiences to be reached. The findings were communicated at meetings at DFID \(October 2017\) and via a presentation to DFID’s communication team on the 15 December 2017 **\[E\]**. This meeting included the Head of Strategy and Insight, the Insight, Evaluation and Branding Advisor, and the Senior Communications Manager. In response to recommendations from the team, DFID changed their messaging strategy as detailed below. 

 The research highlighted the importance of a focus on health security, since this has the greatest overall public approval results. A former Communications Insight and Evaluation Advisor at DFID explains that this insight *‘was shared with the \[Communications\] division to help understand how communicating about health security could contribute to ministerial priorities to discuss the national interest, reinforcing existing insight, and adding further understanding to how the department can use health security messaging to talk about UK aid in the national interest’* **\[F\]**. This was put into practice during the 2019  [\#100WaysAidWorks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100WaysAidWorks?src=hashtag_click) social media campaign, where specific examples of health security narratives were used by the Secretary of State for International Development to highlight benefits to the UK **\[A,G\]**. Key indicators of the successes of the \#100WaysAidsWorks campaign were an average of 21,617 impressions per tweet \(range of 4,201\-45,691\) with an average 1.033 engagement rate \(range of 0.39\-2.46\). There was also engagement internationally across country offices – 432 retweets from country offices or international stakeholders and the messages prompting stakeholder participation including: Centre for Disease Control Group, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Unilever, British Council, GAVI Alliance, London Zoo, Gates Foundation, VSO, UNICEF and more. According to DFID, this number and range of engagement was *‘higher than the average engagement with DFID Twitter content’* **\[G\]**. 

 The research recommendations outlined that targeting certain audiences, namely the ‘marginally engaged’ on aid, with national security messages is very productive in generating their approval. This group is generally sceptical about aid yet can be won round by messages that focus on threats to the UK. This was *‘a new insight’* for DFID and added to guidance for communicating with this core audience **\[F\]**. Additionally, there is a need for positive narratives about specific projects with tangible outputs, without foregrounding budgeting and expenditure. The former Communications Insight and Evaluation Advisor explains that this ‘reinforced current insight \(…\) indicating that focussing on storytelling on an individual level works more effectively than \[a focus on\] money spent’  \[F\]** *.  The study also found that some messages previously used by the DFID team were too indirect to be understood by the public. For example, the causal linkage between aid in Ethiopia and jobs in the UK was too complex to communicate effectively. These research recommendations informed the production of national media\-targeted campaigns picked up by national newspapers in 2019, where DFID’s 'major headlines'  \- those issues and messages highlighted as having greatest resonance with the public \- were repeated. This led to increases in social media traffic supportive of the UK government maintaining and justifying its aid commitments. DFID has provided examples from this campaign **\[H\]**, including stories about spending its overseas aid budget on the fight against child sex tourism, which was reported in the *Times* \(April 2019\), and how British law enforcement is accessing the overseas aid budget for countering extremism in Africa, linked to the terrorism threat in the UK, which was reported in the *Sun* \(March 2019\). The *Sun* article maintained a focus on national security, the primary concern of the marginally engaged, and on a specific project, whilst only making general claims about the benefits to the UK. Meanwhile, the announcement of the ‘What Works – Impact at Scale’ initiative funded by DFID, which aims to scale up effective interventions, test innovations, and influence a more effective global response to preventing violence against women and girls, resulted in an article in the *Guardian* \(November 2019\) with a strong national interest headline, where expenditure is mentioned only in the subheading \(reflecting study recommendations\), and a positive in\-depth article about multiple UK aid successes **\[H\]**. 

 The research recommendations have been incorporated into *‘a specific “communicating in the national interest” pack. This has been presented to the communications division and discussed with other departmental colleagues, with the core message for the division being to focus on making national interest messaging credible’* **\[F\]**. This guidance directly informed the work of approximately 50 staff working in DFID communications as well as communications teams in other departments drawing on the overseas aid budget, together with relevant teams, such as DFID colleagues working on jobs and prosperity programmes in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Trade. Thus, the impact of this research can be understood to have affected the day\-to\-day work of the Department in drafting ministerial statements, media lines, and providing advice to special advisers, Cabinet Office, and relevant ministers **\[D\]**. The new Secretary of State for International Development was briefed using the revised guidance when starting at the department in 2019, improving their understanding of how both they, and the Department, can effectively communicate in the national interest \(see ‘\#100WaysAidWorks’ above\) **\[A\]**. 

 Following the merger of DFID with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office in 2020, a Communication Manager at the new Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office \(FCDO\) explains that *‘the insights gained via this research now inform the wider comms strategy of the FCDO and are as relevant as they were before, potentially more so given emphasis in the prime minister’s announcement of the merger of showing how aid is spent in the interests of the UK’* **\[I\]**. The Prime Minister remarked: *‘we must mobilise every one of our national assets, including our aid budget and expertise, to safeguard British interests and values overseas’* **\[J\]**. To that end the research insights are now being shared and used in the new FCDO, including in training those working on aid spending **\[A\]**. 

 Overall, the impact reach of the project can be seen in the fact that all staff writing government lines and ministerial statements are briefed on the national interest via the Communication Division’s guidance, which has shaped aid messaging to the benefit of the UK government **\[A\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Leeds researchers first proposed and tested the concept of pharmacist\-led clinical medication review and showed its effectiveness in care homes – leading to a collaborative study on medicines safety in care homes, showing seven out of ten residents had at least one medication error on any given day, with an estimated 98,000,000 errors/annum. As a direct result, there was a ministerial\-led summit, and the Department of Health \(DH\) issued a ‘Health Alert’ requiring NHS trusts to act immediately, citing our findings. The research subsequently led to, and significantly influenced the design and implementation of the GBP20,000,000 NHS England Medicines Optimisation in Care Homes Programme, as well as recommendations in the 2019 NHS Long\-Term Plan. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Leeds researchers \(including **Alldred** and **Raynor\)** first proposed and tested the concept of ‘clinical medication review’ by pharmacists of people living in their own homes. This research showed that the approach could reduce the number and cost of medicines without adverse effects such as increased use of services. We subsequently successfully tested this model in the care home setting where frail older patients are commonly prescribed multiple medicines with an increased risk of adverse drug events. The study of 661 patients in 65 care homes in Leeds confirmed that the prescribing of medicines in this setting was sub\-optimal, leading to a loss of potential benefit and an increased risk of harm \[ **1**\]. 

 In 2005, a Department of Health \(DH\) call for research into improving safe use of medicines in care homes led to a collaboration with the University of London School of Pharmacy and University of Surrey to undertake the *Care Homes’ Use of Medicines Study* \(CHUMS\). This combined Leeds research expertise in medicines use in care homes \( **Raynor** and **Alldred**\) with medicine error research from London and ergonomics expertise from Surrey. 

 **Alldred** was the Project Co\-ordinator for the three sites in the study, which comprised 55 care homes in Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire and London. Researchers undertook clinical medication reviews, scrutinised GP and care home records, visited pharmacies, observed medication administration and conducted 89 interviews with GPs, pharmacists and care home staff. The analysis showed seven out of ten patients experienced at least one medication error on any given day with errors occurring throughout the system, from prescribing to dispensing to medicines administration. The research showed that factors contributing to errors included: doctors who were not accessible, did not know the residents and lacked information in homes when prescribing; staff workload, lack of medicines training and drug round interruptions; lack of team work among care and health professionals; inaccurate medicine records and reliance on verbal communication \[ **2**, **3**\]. 

 We made several recommendations to reduce the risk of medicines errors, including that each home have a lead GP to co\-ordinate prescribing and monitoring of medicines; that clinical pharmacists regularly review residents to identify and rectify errors; and that pharmacies and homes should review how they order and dispense medicines. We also recommended that within Primary Care Trusts in England, the Chief Pharmacist should take responsibility for ensuring safe systems. These recommendations subsequently led to policy and practice changes nationally. 

#  Following this, a Cochrane systematic review led by Alldred with Kennedy ‘Interventions to optimise prescribing for older people in care homes’ \[4\] was undertaken in 2013 and updated in 2016. Along with the underpinning research described above, this review contributed to the successful GBP2,000,000 NIHR Programme Grant for Applied Research application for the Care Homes Independent Pharmacist Prescribing Study \(CHIPPS\) with Alldred as co\-applicant, work package lead and Principal Investigator for Yorkshire and Humber and Daffu\-O’Reilly as Research Fellow. CHIPPS is testing the effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of pharmacist prescribing in care homes \[5,6\]. Such prescribing allows efficient implementation of the recommendations from CHUMS, including someone taking overall responsibility for medicines in care homes, e.g. a pharmacist.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 There are 370,000 older people living in 10,000 care homes in England, many being frail, vulnerable and taking many medicines. Work at Leeds \(2006\) introduced the concept of clinical medication review in care homes and led to collaboration with teams in London and Surrey to carry out the DH\-commissioned CHUMS study. We showed that for 70% of care home residents \(taking on average eight medicines per day\), there was one or more medication error on any given day, resulting in an estimated 98,000,000 errors/annum in the sector. Errors were found in prescribing, monitoring, dispensing or administration, and there was a lack of teamwork from the health and care professionals involved. The publication of the report led to a ministerial summit with Alldred and others, to discuss the findings and develop a way forward. 

 In 2010, the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer and the Director General of Social Care jointly wrote to all Directors of Adult Social Services and PCT Chief Pharmacists drawing attention to CHUMS as “an important research study” which “strongly indicates there is considerable scope for improvement” in how medicines are used in care homes. At the same time an ‘immediate action’ DH Alert was issued citing the findings of CHUMS, requiring PCTs to work with care home staff, GPs and pharmacists to determine how medication errors in care homes can be reduced. This led to changes in practice and the commissioning of new services across the country. 

 The Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education \(CPPE\) developed learning programmes prompted and informed by CHUMS and this has been delivered to over 2000 pharmacy staff across England as of 2019 \[ **A,B**\]. 

 Commenting on the significant impact the CHUMS study has had on the development of these learning programmes, the CPPE Director, Head of National Pathways, and Senior Pharmacist for the CPPE Medicines Optimisation in Care Homes training pathway said: 

 “*The findings of your CHUMS research heavily influenced how the content of the learning programmes was created. We looked at the findings and issues in your research and addressed these systematically throughout the pathways...Your research has undoubtedly had a positive impact on how medicines optimisation roles in care homes are being carried out and has been vital in improving the safety and care in care homes throughout the country”* \[ **B**\] *.* 

 In March 2014, NICE published ‘Managing medicines in care homes’ \[ **C**\]. Alldred was a member of the Guideline Development Group and the guidance cited five papers from our research. In addition, NICE published a Quality Standard \(QS85\) along with other resources. This standard cites CHUMS  [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs85/chapter/Introduction](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs85/chapter/Introduction). The Care Quality Commission use this guidance when inspecting care homes nationally and assessing quality of care provision. 

 In 2016 our underpinning research which identified integrating clinical pharmacy as part of the solution to reducing medication errors in care homes \(and improving medicines use more widely\) directly led to the conception of the GBP20,000,000 NHS England Medicines Optimisation in Care Homes \(MOCH\) Programme \[ **D,E**\]. Alldred sat on the NHS England Steering Group and shaped the development of MOCH by presenting evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacists working in care homes based on CHUMS, the Cochrane review and CHIPPS. Alldred significantly contributed to the model of clinical pharmacy provision for the programme and the logic model for MOCH was based on the CHIPPS logic model \[ **E**\]. Launched in 2018 across every Sustainability and Transformation Partnership/Integrated Care System, MOCH has integrated 356 new pharmacists and pharmacy technicians into existing primary care and social care teams across England. Alongside the programme, a bespoke national training pathway for 600 care home pharmacy professionals was introduced. The CHIPPS Core Outcome Set contributed to the development of the programme’s evaluation plan and Alldred has had ongoing input as an expert adviser into the evaluation plan. 

 According to the NHS Care Homes Pharmacy Lead for NHS England: 

 *“\[CHUMS\] was a call to action for the system to urgently develop solutions to solve widespread issues facing care home residents such as prescribing errors and lack of structured review. The CHUMS study helped shape many initiatives across the country… Your research identified major areas of concern in the prescribing pathway and through pilots across England and then the NHS England Vanguards, we now know that integrating clinical pharmacy into care homes improves quality of care and reduces risk of medication harm/ errors in care homes…The MOCH programme led to England wide support for care homes residents with medicines optimisation through structured medication reviews, which now feature as a core part of the new Primary Care Network Enhanced Health in Care Homes Framework and service. Your work directly aligns to the fact that over the last few years medicine organisation reviews improve the quality and care and safety of care in residents across the UK”* \[ **E**\]. 

 The influential 2019 NHS Long\-Term Plan \[ **F**\] stated that all care homes will be “ *supported by a consistent team…including named general practice support*” and “ *care home residents will get regular clinical pharmacist\-led medicine reviews where needed*”. There is a direct thread between these plans, and the findings of the CHUMS study, including our recommendations for a lead GP to co\-ordinate prescribing and monitoring of medicines, and for clinical pharmacists to regularly review residents \[and their medicines\]. These recommendations will now be enacted nationwide through Primary Care Networks as specified in the GP contract 2020\-2024 \[ **G**\]. 

 The influential report on the *Prevalence and Economic Burden of Medication Errors in the NHS in England* used CHUMS as the index study to estimate that there are 98 million medication errors in care homes per annum, with 91 million administration errors \[ **H**\] \- this represents 40% of errors in primary care. NHS England's Medicines Safety Improvement Programme \(MSIP; 2019\-2022\) is part of the NHS Patient Safety Strategy \[ **I**\] and is a specific response to the WHO Medication without Harm Global Challenge \[ **J**\]. Due to the error rates found in CHUMS, the MSIP has prioritised reducing medication administration errors in care homes and Alldred has provided expert advice to the project lead for the 15 English Patient Safety Collaboratives \(PSC\) to design a national project, informed by CHUMS and CHIPPS, to achieve a reduction in such errors in 2020\-21. This advice contributed to the investigatory work the PSC undertook in 1102 care homes and the planning on how to test interventions to make medicines use safer. 

 The instrumental role of CHUMS and CHIPPS in informing the work of the MSIP has been confirmed by the Clinical Improvement Lead for Medicines Safety for NHS England and NHS Improvement: 

 *“\[Alldred’s\] research allowed us to understand that there was a gap around how the administration of medicine in care homes could be supported and improved. This directly led us to design a national project with the Patient Safety Collaborative, and the Academic Health Science Network was commissioned to look for positive interventions that could make a significant difference to the administration of medicine in care homes. The Patient Safety Collaborative produced a national report, and this report in addition to the CHUMS and CHIPPS research was instrumental in our understanding the situation. Most recently we have commissioned the Patient Safety Collaborative over the next 18 months to take forward tests of interventions that can be done in care homes, all aimed at administration in medicine, and your research is to thank for this. If your research into CHUMS and CHIPPS had not been carried out, we would not be investing the amount that we are investing in medicine safety in care homes over the next 18 months. It has been instrumental in changing the safety of medicine administration in care homes both now and in the future”* \[ **K**\] *.*

","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Anitha has researched and published widely on violence against women and girls \(VAWG\) including forced marriage **\[3.1\]**, domestic violence **\[3.2, 3.3\]**, dowry\-related abuse **\[3.4\],** and transnational marriage abandonment \(TMA\) **\[3.5\].** 

 Anitha’s research has led to a recognition and understanding of previously undocumented forms of violence and abuse such as transnational marriage abandonment \(TMA\) and dowry\-abuse across transnational spaces **\[3.4, 3.5\]** and generated new knowledge on problems such as forced marriage. This research has improved our understanding of the nature and impact of VAWG and gaps in current policy and practice and led to new or more effective responses; it has also broadened the conceptual lens utilized to understand such violence beyond relationship/family to the broader structural factors including state policy. 

 Her British Academy funded research \(2013\-2016\) was the first systematic study on the problem of ‘transnational marriage abandonment’ \(a term she coined\).  This refers to the abandonment of wives across national borders by men to deprive them of financial and settlement rights and evade the criminal justice process for domestic violence. Abandonment within the context of marriage has hitherto not been regarded as a form of domestic violence. However, this research argued for the first time that within the transnational context, abandonment constitutes a form of violence as it is intended to deprive women of their residence and financial rights arising from their marriage and is enabled by gender\-blind transnational formal\-legal frameworks which enable men resident in the West to abuse marriage migrant women with impunity. 

 This study documented the nature and consequences of TMA whereby: 

 a.  in the context of ongoing domestic violence, a marriage migrant may be deceived/coerced into returning to her country of origin and abandoned there; 

 b.  a bride may be left behind in her home country awaiting sponsorship\-only to be ousted from her marital home without any financial settlement for herself or any children, following a period of abuse from in\-laws. 

 Based on life\-history interviews with 57 abandoned wives in India, and interviews with 21 practitioners, this research documents for the first time, the nature and patterns of abuse and abandonment in transnational marriages in the UK and India. The findings suggest that by strategically abandoning their wives in their home country, transnationally mobile men deprive their wives of their financial rights such as an equitable settlement upon divorce, child custody and recovery of dowry. 

 As a consequence of this research, TMA is beginning to be recognised in academic, practice and policy communities as a form of coercive and controlling behaviour that needs to be addressed in policy and law. Apart from publications in academic journals, Anitha has been invited to contribute the first\-ever chapter on TMA in the forthcoming Routledge Handbook on Domestic Abuse. 

 Anitha’s research on forced marriage **\[3.1\]**, domestic violence faced by women with insecure immigration status **\[3.2**\] and economic abuse **\[3.3\]** including dowry abuse **\[3.4\]** has improved understanding and informed policy and service responses to these forms of VAWG.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Anitha’s research \[3.1\-6\] has addressed and closed a number of gaps in our understanding of and policy/practice responses to VAWG, in national and transnational arenas. 

 There has been direct and demonstrable impact through: 

-  changes to national policy; 

-  changes to international policy; 

-  change to professional understanding and service delivery; 

-  change to public awareness. 

 The beneficiaries have been survivors of VAWG, frontline practitioners, policy makers and the general public in the UK and Middle East. 

 **Changes to national policy:** 

 Following her research, Anitha set up a working group \(with Southall Black Sisters and lawyers\) to respond to TMA as a legal problem for the first time in the UK. The President of the Family Division of the High Court of England & Wales **\[5.1\]** invited Anitha to present the research evidence and provide training for judges on the issue of TMA at the 2017 ‘President’s conference’. The working group was invited to suggest changes to the Practice Direction 12j \(PD12j\) which sets out what the Family/High Court is required to do in family proceedings where there is domestic violence **\[5.1\].** 

 As a direct result of the research \[see 5.1\], the definition of domestic abuse within the PD12j was expanded in 2017 to include: “dowry\-related abuse and transnational marriage abandonment; \[where\] “abandonment” refers to the practice whereby a husband \[…\] deliberately abandons or ‘strands’ his foreign national wife abroad \[…\] in order to prevent her from asserting matrimonial and/or residence rights in England and Wales.” This significant change—which follows verbatim the recommendation given by Anitha’s working group—is the first recognition of TMA as a form of domestic abuse in the law anywhere in the West. 

 A legal precedent was established when the Court of Appeal \(A\(Children\) Re \[2019\] EWCA Civ74\) set out a guide to the law on TMA **\[5.2\-para 70\-78\].** The significance of this change has been noted by law firms **\[5.3\],** as judicial remedies and Legal Aid is now available to survivors of TMA for the first time. 

 According to Sulema Jahangir, an international family solicitor: *“…TMA is widespread but has sadly attracted little attention from policymakers. Dr Anitha’s research is ground\-breaking, detailed and extremely useful \[…\] has been instrumental in shaping legal remedies.”* **\[5.4\],** an assessment that has been reiterated in various blogs by law firms **\[5.5\].** 

 Alongside instrumental changes via change in law, this research has stimulated policy debates and recognition of TMA in the UK and beyond, where none existed earlier, through: written parliamentary questions in House of Lords on government actions in relation to TMA; references to this research on TMA in Australian Senate report on dowry abuse; UK Home Affairs Select Committee Report on Domestic Abuse, UK’s  Shadow Report to CEDAW, Fawcett Society’s Sex discrimination law review and New Zealand Law Society’s Council brief **\[5.6\].** 

 **Changes to international policymaking:** 

 Based on her ongoing research on VAWG, Anitha was invited to contribute to a summit of the Coalition of Women MPs from Arab Countries who met to draft the Arab Convention to Combat Violence against Women, the first in the region. As a direct result of Anitha’s contributions, Coalition members amended their Tunis Declaration **\[5.7\]** to broaden their existing definition of violence to “ensure the protection of the rights of all victims”. This change incorporates categories of victims hitherto excluded, e.g., child brides and women with unregistered marriages. Anitha was subsequently invited to write the introduction to the forthcoming ‘Report on the status of violence against women’ by the Coalition of Women MPs to further policy responses to VAWG within the Arab League of Nations. 

 **Improving professional understanding and transforming service delivery:** 

 Since 2017, Anitha has delivered training to over 600 frontline practitioners in England & Wales– including social workers, police, domestic violence and health practitioners on domestic violence, TMA, forced marriage and dowry abuse. Positive feedback identified enhanced knowledge: “improved understanding of forced marriage, honour\-based abuse and transnational abuse” and “improved confidence in working with survivors”; new knowledge to inform practice: “will ‘identify warning/signs/red flags”; and planned wider dissemination to fellow practitioners “will set up practice session to discuss topic more widely” **\[5.8\].** 

 **Improving public understanding**: 

 Anitha’s research has attracted considerable media coverage which has raised public awareness and understanding of this hitherto little\-known problem. BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme based on this research has received 3.1 million views on YouTube **\[5.9\]**. A news item on the TMA research was among 10 most read on BBC News; and other media coverage included the Times, Times of India, New York Times and the Sun **\[5.9\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Art, Conflict & Society thematic group at Ulster engages with legacies of division, politicised urban planning, and socio\-economic deprivation that persist in post\-conflict Northern Ireland \(NI\). The research articulates unique multidisciplinary perspectives on complex issues and creates impact in three areas: 

1.  Among arts organisations, museums and members of the public nationally and internationally by enhancing understanding of the precarious nature of peace and reconciliation in a post–conflict society, through the artistic medium of video and photography. 

1.  Among practitioners and institutions by advancing new forms of artistic expression in the representation of conflict, through the production of contemporary cultural artefacts and engaging artistic expression. 

1.  Among communities affected by deprivation as a legacy of the conflict by influencing community regeneration and development, leading to job creation, inward investment, urban regeneration and increased community capacity, through community co\-creation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research carried out by Doherty, Wylie and Coyles from 2007 to 2018 engages with some of the so\-called legacy issues following the signing of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in 1998. These issues include unsolved murders, compensation and support for victims, housing policy and an agreed process of memorialisation, that were not resolved as part of the Agreement and continue to put pressure on the fragile peace in this post\-conflict society. The research interrogates how processes of memorialisation are expressed within the public and private spheres. The research provides insights into how specific architecture and sites, associated with past acts of violence, surveillance and control, continue to resonate in collective memory and imagination and may undermine reconciliation processes. Doherty’s *Ghost Story,* 2007 \( **R1**\) single\-screen video installation, forefronts the use of video and narrative fiction to explore the trauma triggered by revisiting sites where memories of violence continue to resonate. *Ghost Story* unfolds in several rural and urban locations accompanied by a voiceover that suggests the presence of a lingering residue of pain embedded within the landscape itself. 

 Wylie’s *Outposts*, 2011 \( **R2**\) and *North Warning System*, 2014 \( **R3**\) interrogates the role photographic art has in the preservation and memory of historical military architecture sites.  These two volumes were published as the Tower Series which included one earlier volume *Watch Towers* \(2004\), focused on Northern Ireland, with photographs recently acquired by National Museums Northern Ireland \(NMNI, 2017\) and the Tate \(2020\). *Outposts* \( **R2**\) and *North Warning System* \( **R3**\) extends the transient nature of military architecture beyond NI to Afghanistan and the Canadian Arctic. As global challenges evolve in response to the ‘War on Terror’, military structures are now designed for flexibility and are ultimately transient in nature, leaving little or no trace of their former presence. 

 Further research engages with the negative impact of military planning of housing policy during the 1970s and 1980s in NI. It provides insight into how poor\-quality social housing has had a detrimental effect on individuals, families and communities living with high levels of economic deprivation. The insights show how continuing intimidation and violence have further exacerbated this situation. Doherty’s *Remains,* 2013 \( **R4**\) is filmed in several housing estates in Derry. These places have been used as sites for ‘kneecapping’, a form of punishment shooting, since the 1970s. The work highlights the generational nature of cycles of violence, retribution, coercion and control. Coyles and Wylie’s *Housing Plans for the Future, 2018* \( **R5**\) and Coyles’ *Journeys through the Hidden City, 2017* \( **R6**\) reveal the impact of military planning of Housing Policy during the 1970s/80s. Between 2010 and 2018, the Arts & Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) funded Hidden Barriers research programme \(Grants **G1** and **G2** below\) provided new evidence of a little\-known but expansive body of physical interventions put in place between 1976 and 1985 to permanently segregate Catholic and Protestant communities in Belfast. The research revealed how these Hidden Barriers were created during a confidential process of security planning undertaken by the UK Government. This research maps Hidden Barriers across Greater Belfast and analyses their impact on social and physical division through collaborative research engagement across six case\-study communities. The findings demonstrate that these Hidden Barriers considerably extend the scope of extant conflict\-era architecture that continues, promoting social physical division, enforcing ethnic segregation, restricting mobility of neighbourhood residents and reinforcing divisive cultural attitudes and behaviours. Coyles disseminated preliminary findings to the Irish Government Department of Foreign Affairs, UK\-Irish Secretariat working group \(2016\), advising on policy for ‘Implementation and Reconciliation’ set out in the Stormont House Agreement \(2014\). Wylie’s invited talk at the Business & Investment Conference New York \(2019\), represented the arts on the *Alternate Histories of the Future* panel with a focus on social change in Belfast.

 Through an established relationship with the Ulster Museum NMNI, Doherty and Wylie’s research has had a significant impact on their visitors through acquisitions, exhibitions and public engagement. Doherty’s **R1** and **R4** have featured in the following NMNI exhibitions: The Art of the Troubles \(Ulster Museum, 2014\), The Troubles and Beyond permanent gallery \(2018\-present\) and the Making a Future Project \(2019\). Senior Curator of Art at NMNI states that **“through the research and artworks by Willie Doherty and Donovan Wylie it** **allows National Museums NI the capability to examine our recent past while moving forward as a post\-conflict society”** and, through **“the use of their artworks the** **Ulster Museum has been able to interpret and enhance the public’s understanding of the legacy of the Troubles in a post\-conflict society”** \( **C1**\). The Art of the Troubles attracted **65,000 visitors.** An evaluation carried out by NMNI found that: 27% were overseas visitors; 37% were under 25 years old and had no first\-hand experience of the Troubles; **Doherty’s R1 and R4 **“were continually mentioned in the feedback, becoming the second most recorded impactful artworks in the exhibition”** \(C1\); 52% learned something new;** and **50% said it made them think differently about the relationship between art and the Troubles.** One visitor expressed that **“art is very important in healing, understanding and forgiving”** and another how **“art is helping put the troubles into perspective and make it less painful”** \( **C1**\). An NMNI evaluation of Troubles and Beyond \(2019\) showed that: 46% were overseas visitors; 45% were under 25 years old.; **96% said that it had an emotional impact on them** \( **C1**\). 

 NMNI, along with a consortium of leading cultural organisations including the Nerve Centre, Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and Linen Hall Library, launched a EUR1,820,000 \(01\-2019\) EU\-funded project under the PEACE IV Programme \(2019\). *Making the Future* 2019\-2020 is a cross\-border North/South Ireland cultural programme with the aim to empower people to use museum collections and archives to explore the past and create a powerful vision for future change. The exhibition has been shown at the Ulster Museum, then toured to cross\-border venues including Lisburn, Enniskillen, Monaghan and Armagh. Data collected by NMNI shows a diversity in visitors with both sides of the community represented; **11,000 people had viewed to date** and one visitor said the exhibition **“highlighted the difficulty in expressing complex trauma and its legacy, personally, politically and socially** \[and\] **the almost impossible task of expressing personal experience of trauma and the effect of longstanding conflict and observed effects of conflict which echo into near generations” \( **C1**\) *.* **R1, R2, R3 and R4** have been acquired by **11 museum’s permanent collections** internationally including **5 books within the Martin Parr Foundation collection**. The collective research has been exhibited extensively with **42 exhibitions** in a variety of national and international contexts ranging from national museums and regional venues. The Collections Curator at the Irish Museum of Modern Art \(IMMA\), home to Ireland’s national collection of modern and contemporary art, states Doherty’s work \( **R4**\) **“is consistently featured among practitioners and institutions aiming** **to advance the understanding of a post\-conflict society”** \( **C2**\). IMMA’s Engagement and Learning Programmes Curator adds that “ **Doherty’s practice has been central to artistic and public discourse in Ireland has enhanced understanding of the precarious nature of peace and reconciliation in a post\-conflict society”** \( **C2**\). 

 Doherty’s *Remains* \( **R4**\), uses the authentic lived experience of specific location \(The Creggan, Derry\) and indicative events such as kneecapping \(punishment shooting\) to directly represent societal experiences in cycles of violence, retribution, coercion and control. IMMA has included *Remains* in seven exhibitions since its acquisition in 2014: nationally at the IMMA Collection: A Decade exhibition \(2016/17\), attracting **73,420 visitors;** and internationally at Art Sonje South Korea \(2017\) and currently at *Where / Dove*, Fondazione Modena Arti Visive, Modena, Italy \( **C2**\). De Pont Museum \(Netherlands\) has collaborated with Doherty on multiple projects including exhibitions and educational outreach programmes around themes of conflict legacy. A solo exhibition *UNSEEN* in 2014/15 in partnership with Matt’s Gallery, London and The Nerve Centre, Derry was attended by **21,910 visitors \(4,974 of which were children and students born after the conflict ended\)** \( **C4**\). *Conflict and Struggle,* an educational programme with secondary schools in the Netherlands, extensively featured Doherty’s work \( **R4**\), **allowing the children to address the conflict in NI, a chapter of history that is not part of the regular Dutch curriculum.** Head of Education, and Curator of the De Pont Museum Exhibition, has stated with confidence that * **“Willie Doherty’s work has made a significant impact on the museum and its audiences in advancing the understanding of the complexity of conflict and the situation in Northern Ireland in particular**. **His work** **painfully makes us understand why a conflict does not easily become a thing of the past”** \( **C4**\). 

 <ins> *I</ins><ins>2</ins><ins>:</ins> <ins>Among practitioners and institutions by advancing new forms of artistic expression in the representation of conflict*</ins> 

 One of the most critical aspects of Doherty’s and Wylie’s outcomes from their research \(R1\-R4\) has been that **“they have allowed the Ulster Museum to interpret the Troubles in a way that our audiences can engage with, consider and ultimately learn about our recent past”.* Doherty’s and Wylie’s work are described **as exemplary** and allowed * **“National Museums NI the capability to examine our recent past while** **moving forward as a post\-conflict society”** \( **C1**\). IMMA acquired Doherty’s *Remains* \( **R4**\) in 2014 under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 \(TCA 1997\), which **“marked one of the most significant acquisitions to the Collection”* \( **C3**\). The TCA provides tax relief to taxpayers who donate heritage items to Irish national collections. This acquisition recognised Doherty’s work as **“an outstanding example of the type of item involved, pre\-eminent in its class, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of Ireland’s accumulated cultural heritage”** \( **C3**\). It was recognised by a committee made up of the Directors of the National Cultural Institutions, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Department of Finance that *Remains* \( **R4**\) constitutes a remarkable and vital contribution to the cultural heritage of Ireland. **C3** states that *Remains* addresses some of the most complex and difficult aspects of contemporary Irish history and society with great sensitivity. Commenting on the acquisition, Director of IMMA stated “ *These major works by one of Ireland’s most lauded and influential contemporary artists **make a unique contribution to the National Collection of Modern and Contemporary art by consolidating the importance of video art as a new form of artistic expression in the representation of conflict”* \( **C3**\). The Museum has testified that the work is **internationally acclaimed for its depiction of post\-conflict NI** and that the range of media employed by Doherty has advanced new forms of artistic expression in the representation of the conflict \( **C3**\). 

 Wylie’s work is unprecedented in representing conflict. It is highly unusual for any photographer to spend time in a military setting, especially for research purposes. Wylie who the IWM describe as ** **“one of Britain’s leading contemporary photographers”** \( **C5**\), has significant prior experience in conflict photography. This empowered a collaboration between the IWM and the National Media Museum **“to embed Wylie in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, at the point of the Canadian forces withdrawal, making him the first IWM official photographer to work in a war zone since the end of the First World War”.** \( **C5**\). This Canadian link continued with North Warning System \( **R3**\), the third in his Towers series. Based in the Artic, these Canadian cyber radar stations contrast military suppression with a focus on conflict avoidance yet represented similar to Outposts in situation and purpose. **Two photographs were acquired for the permanent collection \(2015\)** by the National Gallery of Canada. Commenting on the uniqueness of his decade of research, the IWM outline how ** **“Wylie’s practice as an artist and photographer has allowed him to use his own power as an observer, to reveal mechanisms of control through understanding and communicating his vision to others”** \( **C5**\). In 2020 the IMMA exhibited *Northern Lights,* from the promised gift acquisition by *The David Kronn Photography Private Collection*, a significant archive of 1,100 images depicting Northern Ireland’s conflict, positioned with an international context. The exhibition includes works from Wylie \( **R2, R3**\) and colleague Paul Seawright, with IMMA describing their photographs as **“a new tradition of ‘art\-documentary”** \( **C6**\). Similarly, the IWM describe Wylie’s work as **“a new perspective on how we view conflict and architecture”** \( **C5**\).

 Hidden Barriers \( **R5** & **R6**\) involved a series of skills workshops, including preliminary work \(2012/13\) with the majority from 2015 \( **G2**\), led by Coyles in collaboration with EastSide Partnership, a Belfast\-based Non\-profit Organisation and AHRC project partner. These activities engaged with local community workers from the Diamond Project, a grass\-roots community development organisation based with the inner East, a designated Neighbourhood Renewal Area in Belfast, and an **area placed within the ‘top 20’ most deprived in Northern Ireland by the NI multiple deprivation measures**. These workshops helped to **empower the Diamond Project** through research findings to generate new community\-based knowledge **leading to GBP30,000 seed funding from the NI government** \(2015\) for physical enhancement of The Mount area. This initial funding unlocked **over GBP2,000,000 investment, bringing about demonstrable impact** \( **C7**\). A permanent full\-time project officer, several social enterprises targeting long\-term unemployment \(such as local cleaning and maintenance services\) and educational and training programmes that specifically target disadvantaged young people \(including a local ‘Health Hub’\) were established. The Health Hub offers a community gym and bike workshop providing training for young people interested in pursuing careers in personal training and fitness, with trainees gaining the opportunity of part time employment. A derelict apartment block was renovated in 2017 to provide 4 three\-bed houses, 4 one\-bed apartments and a community youth hub for summer schemes or after school activities organised by the Diamond Project. Several Hidden Barriers have been renovated, alongside the upgrading of local roads, footpaths and landscaping, providing physical enhancement to The Mount area. A range of historic sectarian paramilitary political murals have been removed and replaced with non\-sectarian community\-based murals, reflecting positive changes in local attitudes and behaviours. One resident stated **“our place was a dump and a dumping ground \- nobody wanted to live here. Now it is great. I am proud of our area and want to bring up my children here”** \( **C7**\).

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Prof Hörnle has led a team at Queen Mary University of London to produce research responding to the significant and prolific risks of online gambling—including addiction, minors playing, indebtedness, fraud, money\-laundering and manipulation of sports. Funded by the European Commission, Hörnle and her team have examined how to reduce these risks by strengthening the regulation of online gambling. 

 The team’s research strengthened regulation and its enforcement throughout Europe, reducing the harms of online gambling. In particular, the research has benefited player protection and improved regulation in countries worldwide through five key impacts: 

 capacity building for the benefit of regulators \(including setting regulatory priorities\) 

 influencing legal frameworks 

 assisting regulators to adopt more effective enforcement practices for better player protection 

 providing evaluation tools for assessing the effectiveness of regulation 

 creating a framework for international co\-operation. 

 By informing and equipping regulators in this way, the research has enabled the safeguarding of online players using approaches that have not been considered or available previously, and contributed to new policies and regulations. 
","
# 1.  Underpinning research 

 Since 2010, researchers at Queen Mary have produced a body of work focused on effective regulation frameworks for online gambling \[3.1, 3.2\]. The research found that the internet has completely changed the enforceability of existing gambling regulations and exposed the limitations of the current regulatory regimes. Before the internet, unregulated gambling existed on a local basis and was regulated locally; by contrast, remote, online provision cannot be regulated in this way. Professor Hörnle has focused on the challenge of cross\-border enforcement in cases where online gambling is provided remotely from a foreign country. A key line of enquiry pursued in the research is how can state A enforce its online gambling regulation in respect of online gambling services provided from state B and protect players in state A? \[3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8\]. 

 Online gambling services can now be provided remotely, by operators establishing themselves \(their personnel and physical equipment\) in geographically distant states with a permissive legal regime. In Europe online gambling services have been provided remotely from offshore locations \(such as Alderney, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, Malta\), with operators avoiding a physical presence in the states whose citizens they target. The research demonstrated that gambling operators locate their services in permissive states, which has created a *de facto* impunity \[3.1, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.10\]. This has resulted in a large percentage of online gambling services in a specific country originating from a foreign, locally unregulated, gambling operator \[3.1\] – for example, 55% in Sweden before its reforms in 2017, and almost 80% for certain types of gambling in Germany. This regulatory arbitrage has undermined traditional approaches to law enforcement which are territorially bound \[3.1\]. 

 In 2017, due to her established research in this area, Hörnle was awarded a significant grant by the European Commission \(EC\) and led a team of four researchers to prepare the first major EU Report on this complex issue \[3.3\] **.** The research was carried out in close consultation with national regulators and the EC, in order to develop best practice standards to improve player protection. A reiterative dialogue with regulators and policy makers was a significant part of the research, and Hörnle’s team interviewed 19 national authorities and 16 other stakeholders \(e.g. affiliates, legal advisers, payment services, industry associations\). The researchers met the EC and the national regulators four times in Brussels during 2018. 

 The report, which was published by the EU in January 2019, evaluated regulatory tools available for enforcing online gambling rules and based on this analysis, offered recommendations to EU Members States on how to improve gambling regulation \[3.3\].  It recommended three strategies for creating effective regulatory frameworks: 

1.  using local, domestic intermediaries *within* the country that wishes to regulate; for example, local payment providers blocking payments for unregulated online gambling, and local internet access providers being responsible for blocking unregulated gambling websites 

1.  controlling/prohibiting online advertising of gambling 

1.  strategic, international co\-operation. 

 The research led to several follow\-up publications \[3.4\- 3.8\]. Together these publications: 

-  demonstrated how the internet has changed advertising \(social media influencers; affiliates\) and analysed how advertising should be contained. The research argued that regulation cannot be limited to imposing obligations on gambling operators but should include obligations imposed on social media platforms and use data and artificial intelligence to prevent harm, for which a different set of regulations are required \[3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]. 

-  provided evaluation tools for assessing the effectiveness of regulators’ frameworks, and showed the need for capacity building of regulators, and international co\-operation of regulators with tech\-companies, and other regulators \[3.3\-3.7\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The research was designed from its inception to have impact on the regulation of online gambling in the Member States of the EU, and beyond. The European Commission Report \[3.3\], ‘Evaluation of regulatory tools for enforcing online gambling rules and channelling demand towards controlled offers’, has been widely used \(with 1,137 downloads as of 1. October 2020\). It has led 11 countries \(Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Malta, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden\) to take measures to protect local players and contributed to the movement in the UK for a reform of gambling regulation \[5.13\]. 

 Hörnle has presented the key findings at various international fora, including the International Association of Gambling Regulators \(IAGR\) Conference in Copenhagen in September 2018 and the Gambling Regulators European Forum \(GREF\) in Cyprus in 2019. The recommendations have also received attention in industry specific journals \[3.7, 3.8\] and media outlets with a wider public audience, such as the Conversation, BBC Radio Digital Planet, Wired and The Daily Mail \[5.14\]. The report, and subsequent discussions with regulators and stakeholders of its key findings and recommendations, were welcomed across the industry. 

 Five key impacts have arisen from the research and its dissemination. 

#  Capacity building for the benefit of regulators including setting regulatory priorities 

 Regulators who lack the resources to do research have used the report as evidence to justify the need for regulation. The Ministries of Finance in Estonia and Poland said the report was an authoritative evidence\-base to justify their strategies and build enforcement solutions \[5.5, 5.8\].  The Chief Policy Officer of the giant software company Playtech, who was Italy’s former gambling regulator, described it as ‘the most remarkable and serviceable study in the field of gambling that I have read in my 12 years of experience in the sector’. He described the innovations recommended as a ‘catalyst for change and improvements’ in gambling regulation \[5.3\] and that the research was of ‘high benefit to European regulators and beyond who are not all so well resourced or equipped to carry out such \[research\]’ and described the report as the ‘reference handbook for every current regulator’ \[5.3\]. 

 Furthermore, the research provided under\-resourced regulators with legal instruments to enforce player protection against the tide of unlicensed online gambling offerings from abroad. For example, in Norway the research assisted a small regulator in protecting consumers against foreign, multi\-billion\-dollar interests. In a case brought by several well\-funded gambling operators challenging the Norwegian regulation, the Norwegian Court quoted the research extensively to confirm the legality of the payment ban. In this way the research helped to protect players in Norway by giving the regulator the instruments it needs to enforce the law \[5.7\]. 

#  Influencing legal frameworks \(changes in law\) 

 The research has improved legal frameworks for enforcement and progressed initiatives for legal change in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the UK. Hörnle gave oral and written evidence to the UK’s House of Lords’ Select Committee, which informed four recommendations forwarded in the Committee’s final report \[5.13, paras 149, 177, 381, 515\]: 

-  The Committee approved the finding that online gambling companies are in a position to control overspending by gamblers on the basis of the data they collect \[5.13, para 177\]. 

-  It also approved the recommendation that a duty of care, enforceable in the civil courts, would provide an incentive for gambling companies to comply with best practices of player protection \[5.13, para 381\]. 

-  The Committee referred to the finding that prohibition of online advertising of gambling should be considered \[3.2, 5.13, para 515\]. 

-  It accepted the recommendation that the largely ignored problem of foreign unlicensed gambling in the UK must be better addressed \[5.13, para 149\]. 

 These recommendations have now garnered strong support by the UK Parliament and the UK government. Additionally, it has had a tangible effect on legal frameworks in other countries: 

-  Finland’s Interior Ministry stated that the report was instrumental in overhauling the Finish enforcement model. In Finland the gambling monopoly is mainly enforced through criminal law \(which is slow and cumbersome\). As a consequence of the report, the government is, for the first time, implementing other forms of enforcement as an alternative to criminalization \[5.4\]. 

-  In Belgium, Hörnle’s research influenced a royal decree adopted in late 2018, which introduced new restrictions on online gambling advertising. Belgian’s gambling regulator confirmed that this research has provided it with novel enforcement solutions \[5.10\]. 

-  In Norway, the judgment in the aforementioned case changed administrative law by confirming that two types of enforcement methods are a legitimate exercise of power by the Norwegian regulator: the ban on payments made to unlicensed online gambling operators and co\-operation with social media companies \[5.7\]. Estonia’s Ministry of Finance said that it relied heavily on the Report when amending the country’s Gambling Act and its enforcement methods \[5.5\]. 

-  In Sweden, the Gambling Authority confirmed that the Report inspired changes in secondary law and guidelines \[5.9\]. 

 Denmark’s newspaper Videnskab published a summary of Hörnle and colleagues’ research article \[3.4\], influencing the debate on targeted marketing and social media advertising there. In consequence of this and media voices, Denmark’s Tax Ministry announced regulatory action against such advertising. 

#  Assisting regulators to adopt more effective enforcement practices for better player protection 

 The report has assisted regulators in strengthening their enforcement practices in Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden \[5.1, 5.2, 5.5\-5.12\]: 

-  Belgium’s regulator said that the research provided new perspectives for its policy on the use of website and app blocking. The report’s recommendations contributed to the development of an effective gambling policy to protect players. In particular the finding that ‘regulators should have a wide range of sanctions at their disposal, ideally ranging from criminal sanctions to informal sanctions such as regulatory notices, dialogue between the regulator and tech industry, and voluntary requests for information’ led them to recalibrate their practice accordingly \[5.10\]. 

-  Sweden’s Gambling Authority confirmed that the report had a direct impact on its policy and strategy discussions in the field of enforcement. Furthermore, it stated that the research is shaped its new payment blocking power \[5.9\]. 

-  Australia’s regulator, the ACMA, stated that the report’s analysis of where foreign, illegal gambling websites are hosted had been particularly useful, and provided new strategic insights. In particular, the research on social media influencers introduced the ACMA to ‘an aspect of the online gambling industry and its promotion which they had not seen canvassed before’. The report’s analysis of new advertising technology assisted the ACMA in its own policy decisions \[5.6\]. 

-  Malta’s Gaming Authority pointed out that the ‘insights in respect of social media/influencer advertising show that a new regulatory approach is needed’ \[5.11\]. 

#  Providing evaluation tools for assessing the effectiveness of regulation 

 The research has given regulators the tools to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of their regulation and develop best practices by comparing their standards to those of regulators in other countries. Dialogue with regulators established that such evaluation tools had been missing previously.  For example, Spain’s Finance Ministry stated, ‘your research is a clear benchmark for new regulations all around Europe’ and ‘really helped us to contrast our current regulation and enforcement measures with regards to other European regulators, which is something very valuable by itself.’ \[5.12\]. Regulatory authorities in Australia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Spain, and Sweden also confirmed that they will use the report to benchmark the effectiveness of their regulation \[5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 5.9, 5.11, 5.12\]. 

#  Creating a framework for international co\-operation between regulators and with tech companies 

 Gaming authorities in Australia, Belgium, Finland, Norway and Sweden said the report inspired them to share more information and seek contacts with gaming authorities in other countries with a view to international exchanges \[5.4, 5.6, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10\]. For example, Australia’s Communications and Media Authority has stated that recommendations on strategic cooperation with like\-minded regulators were useful and had provided the Australian regulator with approaches to implement \[5.6\]. Similarly, Belgium’s Gaming Commission said the report changed its view on international co\-operation, both in respect of regulators in other countries and international co\-operation with tech and social media companies \[5.10\]. Co\-ordination between regulators across state borders represents an entirely uncommon practice and is significant, because online gambling and tech companies operate across national borders and urgently require a co\-ordinated approach to player protection.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Housing affordability presents an urgent problem in many countries, especially for younger households in larger cities. LSE research underpins policy reforms aimed at improving land and housing market efficiency and affordability. It has fed into policy debates and informed public discussions in countries including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. In the USA, Belgium, and Canada it has directly informed policy reforms, including of the Mortgage Interest Deduction in the USA \(2017\), the mortgage interest and capital deduction in Flanders \(2015\) and Brussels \(2017\), and the Ontario Housing Supply Action Plan \(2019\). Across these three  countries, reforms influenced by the research are relevant to some 137 million households; they directly affect around 54 million home\-owning households with mortgages in the USA and Belgium. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 LSE research was the first to recognise and rigorously estimate the impact of planning policies on the price, quality, and affordability of property, primarily through the \(intentional\) constraint that these policies exerted on the supply of land for development. Initial work focusing on the UK was later extended to explore related constraints on the supply of housing elsewhere in the world. Key strands of this body of research are outlined here. 

 **The effects of planning policies on house prices in the UK:** early work by Cheshire in 2002 shed new light on the impact of planning land supply restrictions on the price of internal space in houses and external space in gardens. The analysis considered price both in financial terms and in terms of economic welfare, measured as equivalent income together with the value of planning\-produced amenities. This allowed an estimate of the net welfare impact of planning policies in different city contexts \(see, for example, **\[1\]**\). The work provided the basis for Cheshire’s development of a model to estimate the change in the real price of housing resulting from any given decision on the supply of land, both by region and for England as a whole. Insights generated by this model supported the publication of specific policy recommendations for reform of the planning system, intended to reduce its economic costs while \(as far as possible\) retaining the value of the amenities it generated \(see **\[2\]**\). This work was conducted with Stephen Sheppard \(now Williams College; previously visiting Senior Research Fellow, then Research Affiliate in the UoA\). 

 Hilber and Wouter Vermeulen \(formerly CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis and VU Amsterdam, now SEO Amsterdam Economics\) extended this research to provide powerful evidence for the causal role of more restrictive local planning policies in raising local housing costs **\[3\]**. 

 **The effects of tax incentives on acceptability of development:** local tax revenues can provide an important incentive for local authorities \(LAs\) to permit new residential or commercial development. In joint work on planning policies and the supply of office space, Cheshire and Hilber showed that the move to the Uniform Business Rate in 1989 effectively removed any incentive for LAs to permit commercial development and that, as a result, they became significantly more restrictive **\[4\]**. The subsequent reduction in the supply of office space cost businesses more than any feasible Business Rate could ever have done. 

 **The effects of planning policies on UK productivity**: Cheshire and Hilber have continued to develop their research on the impacts of planning policies on productivity and commercial space costs. Between 2008 and 2015, ESRC funding supported the continuation of their research in the LSE Spatial Economics Research Centre \(SERC\) and, since 2015, within the Urban Programme of the LSE Centre for Economic Performance. This ongoing research first explored and quantified the costs of restrictions on the supply of office space in London, comparing these to other major office locations **\[4\]**. It was further extended to explore the effects of the Town Centre First \(TCF\) policy on the supermarket sector, finding a very substantial \(32%\) loss in Total Factor Productivity stemming directly from the application of TCF **\[5\] \[6\]**. In research published in 2017 **\[7\]**, Hilber and SERC Research Officer Lyytikäinen also provided strong evidence that the UK Stamp Duty Land Tax \(SDLT\) significantly reduces short\-distance and housing\-related moves but not long\-distance moves or moves related to jobs. It further aggravates the housing affordability crisis by discouraging downsizing and impeding growing families from expanding housing consumption. 

 **Mortgage Interest Deduction \(MID\) in the USA:** the growing affordability crisis has led to a decline since the early 2000s in owner occupation as a tenure in both the US and the UK. One popular policy response is to boost aspirant homeowners’ purchasing power \(demand\) by making mortgage interest tax\-deductible. A central finding of Cheshire and Hilber’s UK research, however, had been the critical role of the supply side of this equation. Previous US research had already shown that a subsidy to mortgages favoured higher\-income homeowners. In work with Tracy Turner \(Iowa State University\), Hilber explored spatial variation in the unintended effects of the MID on US housing. Exploiting variation in the subsidy \(arising from changes in the MID within and across US states over time\) and employing a panel fixed effects approach, their study **\[8\]** yielded two novel insights. First, the net effect of the policy on individual homeownership turned out to be essentially zero. Second, the impact was shown to vary enormously across space. In locations with flexible land use regulation and responsive housing supply, the MID has little effect on house prices and so has the desired positive effect on homeownership. However, in locations with tight control and unresponsive supply, the MID lowers homeownership. Hilber and Turner therefore concluded that the MID is an ineffective policy to promote homeownership and improve social welfare.

 Insights from the research outlined here have stimulated wide\-ranging policy debates amongst both practitioners and policymakers. Aspects of the work have also directly informed specific changes to housing policies in the UK and internationally. 

 **Informing UK housing and planning policy** 

 **Catalysing and informing public policy campaigns:** UK impacts have been achieved, in part, through meetings with ministers and presentations of the research, including at: the Prime Minister’s Implementation Unit; the Department for Communities and Local Government \(now the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government \(MHCLG\)\); Her Majesty’s Treasury \(HMT\); the National Audit Office; and the Bank of England, as well as for government economists. Cheshire and Hilber have also submitted expert evidence to various Parliamentary Select Committees. They have further maximised engagement with their work by publishing on blogs for non\-academic audiences. In a 2014 SERC blog post, “ [<ins>Building on Greenbelt land: so where?</ins>](http://spatial-economics.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/building-on-greenbelt-land-so-where.html)”, Cheshire set out proposals to permit development on Green Belt land near to stations, giving access to London Zone 1 within 45 minutes. The post catalysed the “ [London’s Non\-Green Belt” campaign](https://www.citymetric.com/politics/build-million-new-homes-london-green-belt-siobhain-mcdonagh-mp), started by Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh in May 2018 with  [support](https://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Homes-on-the-Right-Tracks-Greening-the-Green-Belt.pdf) from the Centre for Cities and others. This generated substantial national media coverage, \(re\-\)igniting public debate about the use of Green Belt land **\[A\]**. The proposal to build on such land close to stations was included in the original \(2017\) draft Housing White Paper. While deleted from the final version, it remains in the policy debate. 

 Work on the UK Stamp Duty Land Tax \(SDLT\) published in **\[7\]** has also had a significant impact on public and policy debate, and has ultimately led to a reduction in the taxes paid by first\-time buyers. Hilber reported the findings of **\[7\]** in testimony to an HMT Select Committee in an Inquiry for the 2016 Budget **\[B\]**; he also cited it in written evidence to that committee. He reiterated the case for reform in evidence to the House of Lords \(HoL\) Select Committee on Intergenerational Fairness and Provision \(6 November 2018\). **\[7\]** was subsequently widely referenced as key evidence in favour of reform in a media campaign calling for changes to SDLT following the 2017 Autumn Budget. On 9 August 2017, for example, the top story on the front page of *The Telegraph* cited **\[7\]** as central evidence for its claim “ [Stamp duty killing house sales](https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-daily-telegraph/20170809/281487866443860)” **\[C\]**. The Budget that followed on 22 November 2017 announced that relief from SDLT would be granted to first\-time buyers paying up to GBP500,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The media campaign citing **\[7\]** played a vital role in securing the removal of SDLT for first\-time buyers. 

 **Increasing mortgage lending and delivering savings to first\-time buyers:** in 2018, following the announcement of the SDLT reform, the UK recorded its highest number of first\-time buyers \(FTBs\) in 12 years, with mortgage providers advancing GBP62 billion to enable 370,000 newcomer mortgages to complete. The level of lending in 2018 was 4.9% higher than 2017, implying 18,130 additional FTBs **\[D\]**. It is not clear to what extent this increase is attributable to the SDLT reform as opposed, for example, to access to Help to Buy or to wider, macroeconomic factors. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the stamp duty relief contributed to this significant uptick in FTB mortgages. The change in stamp duty offers those FTBs important savings, up to a maximum reform\-induced saving of GBP5,000. So, for the 370,000 FTBs recorded in 2018, it might have generated up to GBP1.85 billion in total savings. Given that most buyers outside London will save much less than GBP5,000, and the tax relief may be capitalised into higher prices \(partially\) offsetting the savings, a more realistic estimate might be an average saving of GBP2,500 per FTB. This would still deliver total FTB savings of GBP925 million in 2018. 

 **Improving assessment of housing and economic needs in the UK**: ideas published by Cheshire in another SERC blog post, “ [<ins>Land Prices: the dog that’s lost its bark</ins>](http://spatial-economics.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2013-01-01T00:00:00Z&updated-max=2014-01-01T00:00:00Z&max-results=48)” \(December 2013\), were instrumental in ensuring the reinstatement of the UK’s series on land prices. Estimates of land prices, which are vital if price signals are to be used efficiently to inform planning land allocations, had previously been published by the Valuations Office Agency but were discontinued in 2010. The blog post was accompanied by a letter drafted by Cheshire to the then\-Chancellor and Secretary of State of the DCLG, calling for the series to be re\-instated. They duly *were* re\-instated as “information” from 2014/15 **\[E\]**. The introduction of price signals into decision\-making about land allocations, originally suggested in **\[2\]**, was also discussed by the HoL Select Committee, which concluded that the government should investigate it. The revised National Planning Policy Framework \(2019\) guidance includes an explicit recommendation to use price signals to inform land allocations in the planning process **\[F\]**. An August 2020 White Paper, *Planning for the Future*, likewise recommended using price signals in land allocations **\[F\]**. The same paper echoes Cheshire and Hilber’s recommendations to move to a “rules\-based” planning system and replace negotiated developer contributions of “affordable housing” with a levy on the value of new housing. 

 Cheshire’s contributions to UK housing and planning were acknowledged by his receipt of a CBE in the 2017 New Year’s Honours list for services to economics and housing. 

 **Reform of the USA Mortgage Interest Deduction \(MID\):** the research published in **\[8\]** suggested that the MID \(like the MICD, see below\) is an expensive policy that does not always achieve its goal of increasing homeownership. In 2017, the USA passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This dramatically reduced the cost of the MID from USD60 billion in 2017 to USD25 billion in 2018. The motivation for this reform was “empirical evidence \[that\] indicates there is no significant positive effect of the MID on homeownership rates”; **\[8\]** is cited as a central piece of the supporting evidence for this **\[G\]**. A working paper version of **\[8\]** was also prominently quoted during the political debate that led to the reform, in hearings before the US Senate Committee on Finance and the US Senate Budget Committee. 

 **Reform of the Mortgage Interest & Capital Deduction \(MICD\) in Flanders and Brussels:** in 2014, the Belgian Government transferred the MICD from the federal to the regional level, allowing regions to reform it differently. In 2015, the region of Flanders all but abolished its MICD, using **\[8\]** as a blueprint: the paper was used extensively in a report commissioned by the Flemish Government to investigate the effectiveness of the MICD and suggest reforms **\[H\]**. One of the authors of that report confirms that: “ *Hilber’s work provided evidence…which was of vital importance for the policy reforms”* **\[J\]**. 

 A subsequent independent review of the economic impact of the reform showed that, consistent with predictions in **\[8\]**, the reduction of the MICD significantly lowered house prices and led to an increase in homeownership attainment **\[I\]**. According to the Flemish Government, the reform directly affected some 1.5 million people, a significant share of the region’s taxpayers. Not only have homeowning taxpayers seen their subsidies fade out, the wider populace has also benefitted from increased tax revenue supporting better public services \(or lower public debt\). By making housing more affordable, the reform has delivered particular benefits for younger buyers. The Federal Government estimated the total MICD subsidy for the whole of Belgium prior to the reforms in the three regions was approximately EUR1.8 billion **\[J\]**. 

 In 2017, the Brussels\-Capital region passed an even more far\-reaching reform, completely eliminating the MICD for new mortgages. In so doing, the regional government was advised by academics from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. The consultation report commissioned from them by the Fiscal Authority of Brussels again refers prominently to **\[8\]** in justifying the reform **\[K**, Section 1.2.1 **\]**. 

 **Supporting the development of Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan:** in October 2017, Cheshire and Hilber were contacted by a former student, then working as Associate Director of Research at Canadian think tank, The C. D. Howe Institute. He asked them to comment on a draft report \(subsequently published by the Institute in May 2018\) which drew extensively on insights from **\[1\]**, **\[3\]**, **\[4\]**, and **\[6\]** \(see **\[L\]** and **\[M\]**\). In particular, the Ontario\-specific methodology followed the theoretical and empirical framework described in **\[3\] \[L**, p.12, *n*.16 **\]**. 

 The report provided a basis for new legislation passed by the Ontario Government in June 2019 to tackle the state’s housing crisis. The Ontario Housing Supply Action Plan was the most ambitious set of policies ever passed by a government in Canada to promote the supply of housing. Its development was led by Cheshire and Hilber’s former student in a new role as Director of Policy, Budget and Fiscal Planning for the Ontario Premier. Research published in **\[1\]**, **\[3\]**, **\[4\]**, and **\[6\]** guided his diagnosis of the underlying causes of the housing crisis, including calculating the regulatory burden on housing prices in Toronto. It was also instrumental in designing new policies to increase housing supply **\[M\]**. A key aim of the new legislation is to stimulate the faster construction of new housing near transit. The reform’s primary focus is on simplifying planning procedures, creating more incentives to build and allowing homeowners to create residential units above garages, in basements, and in laneways. Another focus of the reform is on development charges. The main aim is to better align costs and benefits of development and reduce uncertainty in the development process. 

 The C. D. Howe Institute is now hoping to provide evidence for the British Columbia Government to devise and implement similar reforms aimed at increasing the supply of housing in Vancouver, where regulatory costs are even higher **\[M\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This project has shaped resettlement policy and service provision in two ways: 

1.  Promoted a system change agenda by: establishing innovative resettlement practices within HMP Liverpool and Merseyside Community Rehabilitation Company; enabling ongoing learning/collaborative working through the Merseyside Reducing Reoffending Group, practitioner forums and a webinar series engaging senior managers with emergent issues/evidence. 

1.  Enhanced knowledge, decision making and service provision among national bodies/organisations responsible for: shaping resettlement policy through contribution to Justice Select Committee and incorporation into their findings; the oversight/delivery of resettlement policy/practice through production of material for Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service and the Effective Probation Practice – Performance Directorate. It also informed those campaigning for policy change \(Reform; National Association of Probation Officers\). 

 The overall impact of the changes instigated by the research led to a significant improvement in service delivery thereby enhancing the resettlement experiences of some of the 6,000 prisoners released into the Merseyside area annually. This was evidenced externally in the inspections conducted by HMI Prisons and Probation which saw the work of the prison moving from ‘inadequate’ to ‘excellent’ and from ‘requiring improvement’ to ‘outstanding’ in the case of HMP Liverpool and Merseyside CRC respectively. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2015, the UK government reformed resettlement provision for short\-term prisoners via a Through the Gate \(TTG\) scheme introduced as part of its Transforming Rehabilitation \(TR\) agenda. A Ministry of Justice Analytical Report in 2019 estimated that the total yearly economic and social cost of reoffending by adults who had received a prison sentence of less than 12 months was £5,013,000 \(MoJ, 2019\). The challenges of supporting ex\-prisoners to resettle and re\-integrate into their communities and reducing the financial cost of re\-offending underpinned the wide scale reform of offender management services set in motion by the TR programme. The research explored how these reforms were implemented at the local level and, by investigating the experiences of resettlement provision, highlighted gaps in services including timely access to support \(R1,2,3\). Prisoners’ experiences of resettlement were negative despite the intended effects of government reforms \(R5\). The research illustrated that the voluntary sector organisation who were contracted to provide services had limited training and lacked the resources necessary to undertake their expanded role \(R4\). The combined research outputs demonstrated that one of the key policy intentions underpinning the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms \(i.e., the requirement to provide resettlement support for short\-term prisoners\) was not being achieved \(R 1,2,3,4\). 

 The study’s ‘action research’ design enabled the research team to provide reports at designated stages and allowed us to facilitate forums to engage partners with emergent findings and enabled collaborative discussion of future policy and practice \(R1; R2\). This ‘real\-time’ feedback shaped the ongoing delivery of resettlement orientated service provision, which saw a marked improvement. Following a series of damning inspection reports that had culminated in HMP Liverpool being labelled the worst prison in England, and TTG services in Merseyside as ‘requiring improvement’ \(Clarke, 2017; HM Inspectorate of Probation, 2017\), the researchers made a series of recommendations \(R1; R2; R3\) that were considered and implemented by both management within HMP Liverpool and Merseyside Community Rehabilitation Company \(CRC\). This contributed to a remarkable turnaround in which resettlement provision within the prison was subsequently rated as ‘excellent’ \(HM Inspector of Prisons, 2019\) and TTG provision provided by Merseyside CRC as ‘outstanding’ \(HMI Inspector of Probation, 2020\). 

 The research was a collaboration between HMP Liverpool, Merseyside CRC, the National Probation Service \(NPS\), and LJMU. This exploratory case\-study, conducted in three phases over an 18\-month period \(January 2016 \- June 2017\), included observational and interview/focus group research, engaging 154 individuals involved in the delivery/consumption of resettlement services. The project provided empirical insight into the operational deployment of practice reform from the perspectives of staff, prisoners and their families \(R1/R2/R3\), documenting how the structures, processes and operation of in\-prison based resettlement service provision changed over time \(R4\) and examined the views of those who implemented, managed and engaged services both within and outside the prison \(R5\). 

 This study is part of a series of studies conducted by the researchers that have explored the challenges and tensions for criminal justice partners in delivering effective and impactful rehabilitation support services to ex\-prisoners.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research outputs generated by the project explored the changing structure of in\-prison based resettlement services; explored how working alliances/relationships were formed; and examined how partners reconciled operational priorities. A series of policy and practice recommendations, made by the research team, have materially affected the structures in place to deliver resettlement provision and improved provision for prisoners at both regional and national level. 

 **Impact on regional policy and practice** 

 The project team produced briefing reports and ran research\-led workshop events that brought all multi\-agency partners together to collectively discuss emerging findings and identify pathways to enhance the efficacy of service provision. These workshops were conducted at the mid\-point of the research, prior to its conclusion and six months after the completion of the research. The real\-time dissemination of findings was significant and had a catalytic effect in facilitating changes to resettlement policy and practice at a regional level in the following ways: 

 A new resettlement hub in HMP Liverpool – The research highlighted the fragmented nature of resettlement provision within the prison setting \(R1; R2; R3\). The research team recommended the establishment of a resettlement hub, which was adopted by the prison management approximately 12 months after the dissemination of the findings of the research through the written reports and workshops. The resettlement hub overcame these issues \(i.e., fragmentation, poor communication and poor through the gate coordination\) through its co\-location of resettlement services and a more focussed induction process thereby saving time and resources. Testimonials by senior managers evidence that this has led to a clearer understanding of partner roles, services being offered, reduced the duplication of effort, and enhanced the processing and delivery of resettlement services \(S6; S7; S8\). This was confirmed by the inspection of resettlement services within HMP Liverpool classifying them as ‘excellent’ \(S7/8\) with 75% of prisoners reporting they were receiving help with preparing them for release compared with 47% and 41% in previous inspections. 

 A new resettlement practice model operated by Merseyside CRC was introduced in April 2019 – The research identified a lack of joined up working between the provision of resettlement services within the prison and the management of ex\-prisoners on their release into the community \(R1; R2; R3\). Related to the renewal of service delivery within the prison through the resettlement hub, a new model of practice, rooted in the evidence provided by the research \(S6\), was established. This was directly informed by the research and through workshops with senior practitioners organised by the research team. This has led to enhanced working relationships within and between organisations both within and outside HMP Liverpool \(S6; S7; S8\). Improvements in service provision include increases in the numbers accessing resettlement services with 56% of released prisoners utilising such provision in the first six months of the scheme’s operation and 23% of prisoners leaving with a mentor to provide ongoing support \(S9\). Within the Inspection Report \(S8\), activity to support resettlement was rated as ‘sufficient’ in 81% of cases and resettlement was coordinated effectively in 84% of cases. According to the Director of Operations, Merseyside CRC \(S6\), the research ‘sharpen\[ed\] the focus on where blockages were occurring’ and ‘helped play a part in the wider collective push to reinvigorate resettlement services’. 

 **Impact on national policy and practice** 

 The focused case study approach of the research has also served to stimulate practice reflection/development beyond Merseyside and has had a wider application for policymakers, in the following ways: 

 Enhancing knowledge and influencing policymaking – In a series of research outputs, the project team identified systematic failings in the TTG model and TR agenda \(R4, R5; R6\) and identified the need for a strategic consultation around the contractual obligations of the CRCs \(R3; R4; R5\). These outputs were strategically fed by the research team into Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service \(the national body responsible for the oversight of this policy who had helped facilitate the research through facilitating access\) \(R3\) and formed the basis of written and oral evidence by members of the research team \(S3\) submitted to the Justice Select Committee \(JSC\) consultation on TR \(where, in the JSC’s final report produced in June 2018, the research was cited\) \(S4\). The Select Committee’s review of the TR reform programme has been the catalyst for the government’s decision to reunify probation services from June 2021 and the team have been involved in advising REFORM, a leading Westminster think\-tank on a publication detailing how to improve TTG services within this future framework \(S5\). 

 Enhancing knowledge and service provision – The team worked alongside the Trade Union, Professional Association and campaigning organisation for Probation and Family Court staff. \(Napo\) \(S1\) and the Effective Probation Practice – Performance Directorate \(S2\) to produce material, informed by the research, to engage probation practitioners regionally and nationally. Through a series of practitioner forum events jointly delivered with NAPO \(December 2016, June 2018\) and the recording of a short video for the Effective Probation Practice – Performance Directorate, the research team has been able to disseminate the emerging lessons from the research directly to practitioner communities. One testimonial \(S1\) explains how this was empowering, providing ‘a voice to front\-line practitioners like myself who can be ignored by policy makers when their policies are enacted at the local level’. Another testimonial \(S2\) describes the short video produced in January 2019 as ‘resonating well with staff in helping to better understand the academic work that can influence wider change to the organisation’. 

 The legacy of this knowledge\-transfer activity is sustained through the continued engagement with the Merseyside Reducing Reoffending Group, where a member of the team \(Ragonese\), as a direct result of the research at HMP Liverpool, has been co\-opted to the group, a role which includes facilitating a rolling webinar series through which regional senior managers of key agencies co\-engage with emergent issues and empirical evidence to assist this group in formulating their priorities and strategies for the coming years with an emphasis on resettlement and release practices. In an impact testimony \(S9\) the Chair of the Merseyside Reducing Reoffending Board describes how this has ‘enhanced the work of the Board and helped influence senior stakeholders and support conversations which challenge and help drive system change’.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The academic\-led Centre for Materials Discovery \(CMD, University of Liverpool, Chemistry\) ran from 2007 until the 2017 launch of the £81 M Materials Innovation Factory \(MIF\), into which the CMD capability was subsumed. Automated material discovery programmes in the CMD delivered impacts on commerce and the economy as demonstrated by: 

1.  Materials developed in the CMD generated product sales \(>€500 M p.a. 2018 \- current\). 

1.  A doubling in productivity for industrial scientists embedded in the CMD. 

1.  Significant acceleration of molecule discovery to product launch \(< 2 yrs\), leading to 3 global product launches during the REF period \(Q4 2013, 2015, 2017\). 

1.  New collaborative strategies being adopted globally by CMD industrial partners. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The CMD \(Cooper, Director\) was an academic\-led facility that was developed to accelerate the identification, development, and testing of new materials. At the CMD core was a 1600 m<sup>2</sup> open\-plan high\-throughput laboratory with robotic synthesis, formulation, and automated analytical facilities. The scientific methodologies deployed and the specialist high\-throughput equipment of the CMD was enabled by the underpinning body of research and established academic excellence in materials and automated/high throughput chemistry of Cooper and Rannard \[references 3.1–3.7\]. 

 Specifically, from 2000 onwards, the academic research of Cooper in chemistry delivered advances in the core areas of high throughput apparatus and accelerated/combinatorial studies, polymer chemistry and surfactant chemistry \[3.1–3.4\]. During this period, a productive collaboration between Cooper and Rannard \(2002, then Unilever\) was also established to expand their joint interest in automated materials chemistry \[22 publications in total represented by references 3.6, 3.7\]. The aim was to move beyond traditional combinatorial approaches based on random materials screening to a hypothesis\-led focussed screening of smaller numbers of materials \(10s–100s\) at much higher mass per sample \(gram scale\). In the workflows that they developed, the increased mass per sample enabled accurate characterisation of samples prior to performance evaluation, which delivered discoveries in a faster and more reproducible way than traditional approaches. At the same time, the large number of well characterised samples produced allowed for the identification of subtle structure\-function relationships in systems with interdependent variables \[ *e.g.*, 3.1\]. This methodology, using customised, and in some cases home\-built \[3.1, 3.7\], high throughput platforms, became the core concept of the 

CMD, as demonstrated in reference \[3.7\]. Here, the effect of end\-group composition on the lower critical solution temperature and solution composition for libraries of phase change polymers was studied using custom designed high throughput apparatus. Alongside the methodology development, research on rapid synthesis \[3.2, 3.7\] and characterisation \[3.1, 3.3\] also provided new automated platforms and capabilities for the CMD. The underpinning body of research was funded by a range of EPSRC grants to Cooper including “High\-Throughput Discovery of Next\-Generation CO<sub>2</sub>\-Philic Polymers” \(GR/S16744/01\) and a Royal Society Industrial Fellowship \(2005\) held at the University of Liverpool, Department of Chemistry, by Rannard. 

 Recognising the potential impact of this approach on both academic and industrial materials research, Cooper and Rannard sought financial support for the CMD. The CMD was established in 2007 following a successful proposal supported by the ERDF, the NW Development Agency, and joint funding from the University of Liverpool and Unilever \(£11 M total\). Prior to funding the project, Unilever carried out a “ *comparative analysis of other internationally available academic teams who were active in advanced materials, chemistry and formulation*” to identify partners to co\-develop new approaches to automated materials discovery \[Evidence 5.1, letter from the VP Science and Technology, Unilever Home Care R&D\] leading to the choice of the Department of Chemistry at Liverpool. The Centre was available to other industrial collaborations across materials and chemical sciences including the identification of novel catalysts using underpinning CMD approaches. The CMD would not have been funded \(and by extension, the present Materials Innovation Factory\) without the excellence and body of academic research in accelerated synthesis, characterisation and testing \[3.1–3.6\] that was generated by Cooper and Rannard within Chemistry at Liverpool.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Between 2007 and 2017, the CMD co\-located academic and industry staff in an “open\-collaboration environment”, providing industry partners with access to academic\-led bespoke facilities, equipment and expertise. Unilever was a founding partner of the CMD and substantial impacts on commerce and the economy have been generated during the REF period through the Liverpool Chemistry–Unilever collaboration. This impact is demonstrated through: 

      -  The sales of new consumer products based on polymers discovered \(>€500 M pa\) 

      -  A doubling in productivity of industrial scientists embedded in the CMD 

      -  A change in business practice for a multinational company, Unilever, and adoption of new processes, creating the confidence ultimately to invest in the £81 M Materials Innovation Factory. 

 A case\-study from the University of Lancaster examined open\-innovation within the Unilever Structured Materials & Process Science Expertise Group. In this study, the Vice President Science and Technology \(Unilever Homecare\) explained how the company collaborated and benefitted from the academic expertise in advanced materials of Cooper: *“what Liverpool do provide uniquely here is evoking that facility to be the best in the world in its area and to be able to help us to be good enough to utilise it to its capability. What we bring is the knowledge of our consumers and our brands and our challenges to turn that stuff into things we can then turn into technologies that benefit consumers”* \[5.2\] 

 **New product discovery and increased revenue:** The CMD has delivered economic impact through the discovery of new molecules leading to multiple global product launches by Unilever as a result of collaborative work within the CMD with Cooper on high\-throughput methodologies and polymer chemistry. “ *Unilever has benefitted from collaborative work at the CMD in the area of polymer research, leading to a number of newly synthesised molecules. This included Texcare UL \(a laundry soil release polymer, commercialised in 2013\), Acusol WR \(a thickening polymer commercialised for launch in EU flagship laundry liquid in 2015\) and Acusol LA \(a thickening polymer commercialised in 2017\)”* \[5.3\]. 

 These three global product launches have led to substantial sales within the REF period which are described as “ *of a significant economic scale to Unilever* \(2018 turnover >€51 Bn\) *and its commercialization partners*” \[5.1, point 6\]. <ins>Revenue figures from one product launch alone have “</ins><ins> *increased rapidly over a</ins> <ins>3 year</ins> <ins>period from first launch \[2015\] to exceed €0.5 Bn per annum of recurring revenue*</ins><ins>” \[</ins><ins>5.1</ins><ins> **,**</ins> <ins>point 7\].</ins> Commercial sensitivity prevents disclosure of the polymer structure and full value, but Unilever confirm that the polymer which is incorporated into the product is vital for its manufacture and performance and was derived directly from IP created at the CMD. \[5.1 point 7\]. 

 This case focuses on the impact arising from the Unilever\-University of Liverpool collaboration in the CMD, but we highlight that access to the CMD was not restricted to Unilever; >80 companies benefited from collaboration with the CMD, with 12 of these interactions occurring during the REF period ranging from SMEs to large multinationals \[5.4\]. IP was retained by the partner companies, allowing for de\-risking of commercially sensitive activities within an academic facility. Non\-Unilever projects led to a filing of 36 new patents and 9 patent families that are currently active \(October 2020\) the maintenance of which can be reasonably interpreted to indicate economic value and commercial impact. 

##  Increased productivity and reduced time to market: 

 The workflow and customised high\-throughput platforms developed by Cooper and Rannard, demonstrated in \[3.1, 3.2, 3.7\], have led to a step\-change in the way that Unilever undertakes materials discovery and to unprecedented short timescales to market for new products \[5.1, point 1\]. This is confirmed in the support letter which states “ *The incorporation of the CMD into our R&D process has led to a significant acceleration of our end\-to\-end innovation speed*”, \[5.1, point 6\]. Furthermore, the Vice\-President for Open Innovation has stated: “<ins> *The University \[Liverpool\]*</ins> <ins> *has enabled a transformation in the way Unilever approaches a traditional and established field such as chemistry*</ins>”. \[5.5\] Products containing Acusol WR were launched less than 2 years after the concept for the molecule was initially proposed \[5.1, point 7\]. This represents a remarkable idea\-to\-innovation timescale for the chemistry industry, giving CMD users a significant commercial advantage. The speed of development of Acusol WR was a direct result of the high\-throughput, hypothesis\-led approaches and the automated facilities of the CMD, which allowed for a far greater volume of studies to be carried out compared to conventional manual approaches. The automated systems were applied during the initial discovery stages and they also facilitated the scale up studies carried out at the CMD by Unilever supply chain partners \(Dow chemicals\) during product development \[5.1, points 6,7\]. 

 The improved productivity of embedded scientists within the CMD also led to a doubling of patent outputs per researcher \[5.6\]. Until its replacement by the Materials Innovation Factory \(MIF\) in 2017, Unilever had 10 flexible research seats within the CMD, allowing rotation of numerous scientists to benefit from the facility and academic expertise. The supporting letter confirms the gain in productivity and links this to the automated synthesis and testing developed in the body of underpinning work described in section 1: “<ins> *Unilever employees we located in the CMD labs at the University of Liverpool were able to make a step change in their productivity and delivery to business led R&D programs, The shift from 100% manual working to fully integrated lab automation</ins> <ins>and rapid testing has enabled significant skills growth</ins> in individuals, and also across the wider teams they are part of.”* \[5.1, point 5\]. 

 **Business strategy – the “Liverpool Model”:**  Unilever is a multinational FMCG company \(with a research budget of \~€1Bn p.a.\) with 6000 staff world\-wide in R&D \[5.7\]. The CMD has led Unilever to change their working practices world\-wide. The VP for Science and Technology, Unilever Home Care R&D states in his 2020 letter that “ *In addition to the specific impacts the CMD has had on materials discovery, the approach has had a profound impact on Unilever R&D internal practices, our focus on Innovation Ecosystems, and our approach to working with academic groups globally*.” \[5.1, point 3\]. 

 Unilever has articulated the “Liverpool Model” at numerous UK events and has encouraged its adoption more widely. The Liverpool model is based upon its experiences of interacting with Cooper and the CMD. It describes the benefits of basing an investment and strategic partnership at sites of academic thought leadership where differentiated research cultures, methodologies, and equipment platforms can be developed and jointly exploited \[5.1, point 4\]. In line with this approach of investing at sites with demonstrable bodies of outstanding academic expertise, Unilever made a £25 M investment into the Materials Innovation Factory \(MIF\) at the University of Liverpool, their largest single investment in academic R&D in the 150\-year history of Unilever. The £81 M MIF opened in 2017 and co\-locates academic groups from chemistry \(including Cooper & Rannard\) alongside up to 100 industrial researchers to exploit the automated, high\-throughput materials synthesis and testing approaches developed at Liverpool, alongside new, emerging approaches such as mobile robots \(Cooper\), ensuring that the original ethos of the CMD continues into the future.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Radiocarbon \(<sup>14</sup>C\) is the most frequently used approach to dating organic artefacts from the last 55,000 years. However, all radiocarbon dating requires calibration to transform <sup>14</sup>C measurements into calendar ages. The IntCal Working Group \(IWG\) is an international team of 27 scientists formed in 2001 to establish criteria for calibration data and methods for curve construction. Sheffield researchers conducted the key research that gave rise to the curve being developed. The IntCal calibration curve has international reach as the global standard for radiocarbon calibration, being used by all major commercial <sup>14</sup>C laboratories. It has underpinned global climate change policy, and impacted archaeological practice and planning and development decisions in the heritage sector. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Radiocarbon dating relies on the simple idea that, while alive, organisms take in carbon from their surroundings and so have a ratio of isotope <sup>12</sup>C to <sup>14</sup>C that is in equilibrium with their atmosphere. Once an organism dies, it stops taking in new carbon, the stable <sup>12</sup>C remains but the <sup>14</sup>C decays at a known rate. Measuring the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C left in a sample therefore provides a dating technique. 

 If the concentration of atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C had been constant throughout history, this would be straightforward. However, it has fluctuated significantly. In order to date organisms precisely scientists need calibration curves, which provide a reliable historical record of this <sup>14</sup>C variation to accurately transform their radiocarbon measurements into calendar ages. Uncalibrated radiocarbon measurements differ substantially from the best estimates of actual calendar dates and so are of little interpretive value. Sheffield researchers, together with their international collaborators, provide the globally ratified standard for this calibration via the series of IntCal calibration curves. 

 The IntCal Working Group \(IWG\) is an international team of 27 scientists formed in 2001 to establish criteria for calibration data and methods for curve construction. Sheffield researchers have been members since 2001. The key research that gave rise to the impact was undertaken at the University of Sheffield, between 2001 and 2014, by Professor Caitlin Buck, and Professor Paul Blackwell and Dr Tim Heaton \(UoA 10\). It involved development of a fully probabilistic modelling framework for estimating radiocarbon calibration curves and a suite of Bayesian implementation methods that can be extended as new data structures become available. 

 Sheffield models and methods have been used for all IntCal curve updates since 2004. The group produces three regularly updated curves dependent upon the environment where the object to be dated obtained its carbon: IntCalXX \(where XX represents the year of release\) for the Northern Hemispheric atmosphere, SHCalXX for the Southern Hemisphere, and MarineXX for the world’s oceans. These updates \(in 2004 **\[R1\]**, 2009 **\[R2\]**, 2013 **\[R3\]**\) replaced the previous curves and were made as our understanding of the Earth system advanced and new data sets, such as tree rings, plant macrofossils, or corals, became available. Each update provided new challenges for the Sheffield team members as the unique elements of the calibration data led to modelling complexity. These required bespoke solutions and close collaboration with co\-authors to ensure their expert knowledge was incorporated. The 2009 update provided an extension of the calibration curves back from 24,000 \(their previous limit\) to 50,000 years before present, allowing calibration for the full limit of the radiocarbon technique for the first time. This required Sheffield to provide a careful statistical synthesis of a variety of new reference data sources and novel uncertainty quantification **\[R4, R5\]**. For the 2013 curves, Sheffield identified previously unconsidered sources of uncertainty in the reference data and developed new approaches to quantify and incorporate them **\[R6\]**. 

 The IWG crosses interdisciplinary boundaries and key to the construction of all the curves are the modelling and statistical analyses, by Sheffield researchers, which are required to combine the diverse data sets, each with their own specific attributes, into each of the IntCalXX, SHCalXX and MarineXX curves.

 All radiocarbon dating requires calibration to transform <sup>14</sup>C measurements into calendar ages. IntCal curves are the internationally agreed standard for the radiocarbon calibration \- everyone in the world who uses radiocarbon dating depends upon the IntCal curves to calibrate their radiocarbon dates. There are currently at least  [<ins>141</ins>](http://radiocarbon.webhost.uits.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/Labs-2019_Sep19.pdf),%20a) laboratories around the world with facilities for radiocarbon dating, all of which use IntCal13, SHCal13, and Marine13 calibrations \[S1\]. Published laboratory codes from 14 major labs indicate that over 120,000 samples were dated per year between 2013 and 2018. Of these, over 93% are calibrated using IntCal curves. There are currently no competitors to the curves provided by the IntCal Working Group and without curves the laboratory results are not interpretable as dates. At a cost of £350 per date this equates to over £42 million per annum generated for commercial laboratories. Without the curves the revenue generated for commercial laboratories by radiocarbon dating would be considerably lower. 

 The ability to obtain accurate and precise dating is fundamental, as it informs many of the economic and professional decisions relating to the protection, conservation, and understanding of the Historic Environment. As the global standard for radiocarbon dating, the IntCal curves provide a consistent chronology that enables accurate measurements and verification of findings across the globe. They provide validity and enable cross checking and comparison of dates and discoveries. IntCalXX delivers “ *robust, reliable, and readily comparable chronologies between, and within, projects*” **\[S1\].** 

 The President of Beta Analytic, the largest commercial radiocarbon laboratory in the world, describes the IntCal curves as “ *the recognized standard for radiocarbon age calibrations*” and recommends recent updates “ *as the primary \(and preferably only\) curves used for radiocarbon dating calibrations*” **\[S2\].** Time and monetary constraints would not otherwise allow for such robust statistical methodology and curve refinement within the commercial environment without the findings from the IWG **\[S2\]**. In addition, the frequent updates to the IntCal curves have generated improved understanding by allowing for over a million previously produced radiocarbon ages to be reviewed and updated, thus producing ‘new and exciting interpretations’ of historic events **\[S2\].** 

 Accurate and reliable radiocarbon dates calibrated with IntCal09 and IntCal13 have therefore had an impact in a wide range of different social and economic areas since 2013. The following examples have been chosen to demonstrate the variety of fields in which these dating methods are used, and the breadth of impacts that have affected a diverse range of beneficiaries. 

 Impact on global climate change policy 

 A precise understanding of our past climate is needed to understand, predict, and mitigate potential, current, and future changes. The IntCal curves enable the comparison of environmental records on radiocarbon timescales with other key independent timescales \(e.g. ice\-cores\). 

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) is the United Nations body responsible for assessing climate change science. Used by policy makers to understand risks, and plan adaptations and mitigations, its reports are the most authoritative documents influencing understanding of international climate change. In September 2013, 259 experts from 39 countries published ‘Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis’, a comprehensive assessment of evidence of climate change. 80 publications cited in this assessment relied on the IntCal curves for their calendar dates **\[S3\]**. 

 This assessment formed the scientific basis for the 5<sup>th</sup> IPCC report \(published in 2014 and agreed by governments of all IPCC member countries\). This was described by the vice\-chair of the IPCC’s Working Group 3, which deals with measures to mitigate climate change, as “ *the most important report the IPCC has ever produced”* **\[S4\]** as it underpinned the United Nations climate talks in Paris in 2015. These talks led to the formation of the  [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), the first\-ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, adopted December 2015 and formally ratified by the EU in October 2016 **\[S5\]**. 

 Regents’ Professor, Northern Arizona University, and lead author of Chapter 2 of the 6<sup>th</sup> IPCC report testifies that the IntCal curves have “ *been critical for providing a perspective on past climate \[…\] essential for our understanding of the climate system, and a baseline for modelling future changes*”. IntCal curves are “highly relevant” to policy development as they provide new understanding on the carbon cycle and the processes in the Earth’s climate system **\[S6\].** 

 Impact on developers and practitioners in the protection and appreciation of the historic environment 

 The IntCal curves provide a reliable, rigorous, international, industry\-wide standard that is vital to the commissioning and delivery of commercial archaeology **\[S1\].** The comparability and consistency provided by the IntCal curves, together with improvements in the precision and accuracy of these curves, ensures clear value for money for the construction and land development industry. This funds the great majority of archaeological investigation \(a market currently worth an estimated £200 million annually in England, and €2 billion annually across Europe\) **\[S1\].** 

 The Bayesian approach used to compile the IntCal curves allows integration with the standard use of Bayesian chronological modelling in the archaeological sector. Within the archaeological sector, calibrated radiocarbon dating, using the IntCal curves, is frequently a required step in the planning process when archaeological work is commissioned for new construction development including large\-scale projects **\[S1\]**. The National Head of Research at Historic England states that radiocarbon dating and calibration using the IntCal curves, in combination with Bayesian chronological modelling are “ *fundamental elements of archaeological specifications issued as part of the planning process*” **\[S1\]**. 

 Thus, the IntCal curves provide essential infrastructure that enables developers to commission archaeological work to standards that meet regulatory guidance in the UK and beyond **\[S1\].** 

 Increased public awareness in the historic environment 

 The Heritage Sector is an important economic sector. In England, in 2019, it directly provided £14.7 billion GVA and 206,000 jobs. Knowledge is critical to public enjoyment of the Historic Environment and is often underpinned by accurate radiocarbon dating. In England it provided new insights into the construction of Stonehenge. This knowledge has been incorporated into displays in the Stonehenge visitors’ centre and accompanying recreation of Neolithic houses, both opened in December 2013. IntCal09 enabled “ *novel insight*” that “ *fed directly into the presentation of the Stonehenge site*” **\[S1\].** 

 In China, IntCal13 provided evidence for the earliest water\-management site in Liangzhu City. IntCal13 calibrated dates were subsequently used in its application, and 2019 inscription, to UNESCO’s World Heritage List.  Having a site inscribed on the World Heritage List increases the prestige of the site and helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for the preservation of that site. This increased awareness facilitates a rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties. Countries can also apply for financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites. 

 The site provides new insights into Chinese history by ‘ *authentically and credibly demonstrating the degree of development of the rice\-cultivating civilization \[…\] in the Neolithic’* **\[S7\]**. Use of IntCal13 on artefacts from Liangzhu City provided scientific confirmation for the first time that ‘ *Chinese are the inheritors of a 5,000\-year\-old unbroken cultural tradition’* **\[S7\]**. These results are used in 2019\-20 Chinese history and mathematics textbooks, an act the president of the Chinese Archaeological Society states helped ‘ *foster a cultural confidence among young people’* and improved ‘ *their awareness of cultural protection and heritage’* **\[S7\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research into human\-robot interaction, in which the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems \(CRNS\) plays a leading international role, has demonstrated the significant benefit of social robots for technological support in domains where personal interaction is essential. Funded by 11.9 million GBP in large\-scale European grants, Plymouth’s innovative social robotics research developed and promoted applications of social robots for personalised and long\-term interaction. Responding to societal challenges \-specifically the need to address population ageing, the need to deliver personalised education, or the need for novel mental health support\- the centre collaborates with leading manufacturers, such as Softbank Robotics, and transnational policy makers, to shape societal, governmental and industrial decision\-making to invest in social robots, having an impact on the nascent social robotics market valued at over 1B USD. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research at the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems \(CRNS\) hinges on the observation that people, from children to adults, treat robots as social agents. Both the robots’ appearance and behaviour promote the attribution of social characteristics, and it is the latter that the CRNS focuses on. Using techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and signal processing, the team builds social robots that can be used to support children, adults and the elderly in a range of settings. While the research often is foundational, the methods and insights gained are applied to force breakthroughs in application domains ranging from therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorders \[3.1\], to education \[3.2\], and support for the elderly \[3.3\]. 

  

 The CRNS is interdisciplinary and consists of computer scientists, engineers, cognitive scientists, and healthcare workers, which allows a smooth collaboration with medical professionals, pedagogists, linguists, psychologists and service users and providers often across international borders. 

  

 The CRNS take a two\-pronged approach to Human\-Robot Interaction: working on the technical aspects as well as on the cognitive science underlying HRI \[3.4\]. In the latter, for example, the CRNS studied trust and social influence between people and robots, looking at which cognitive mechanisms are at play and what elements of the robot lead to changes in trust and social peer pressure \[3.5\]. This is complemented with technical research, for example the interactive machine learning work for social robots \[3.6\] or the deep learning for social signal processing \[3.7\]. Finally, most of the research has had applied impact, with research results forming the foundations for applications in healthcare, elderly care, education and edutainment. As such, the CRNS’ research output not only captured the attention of international colleagues in academia, but was also picked up by policymakers, national and international industries working on automation and robotics and has had an impact on public attitudes towards social robots. 

  

 The research in social robots at Plymouth attracted 11.9 million GBP in funding since 2014, the majority of which came from large research projects initiated and coordinated by the CRNS. The FP7 ALIZ\-E project, the H2020 L2TOR and the EPIC Regional Development Project introduced the use of robots as social support mechanisms in healthcare, education and regional elderly care respectively. Our research was noticed far beyond national borders, with the US Air Force investing in research on trust in social robots through the THRIVE project, or Softbank Robotics Europe headquartered in Paris initiating a doctoral training collaboration with Plymouth through the H2020 APRIL European Industrial Doctorate network. 

  

 Next to these initiatives, the University of Plymouth also was a key partner in several other high\-profile projects. For example, the FP7 DREAM project studied the use of social robots for Autism Spectrum Disorder therapy, FP7 ROBOT\-ERA focused on social human\-robot interaction to support independent living for the elderly, and the H2020 SECURE Initial Training Network studied the safe physical interaction with robots.

 **Commercial robots** 

 The CRNS, under the lead of **Belpaeme** and **Cangelosi**, has thriving knowledge transfer partnerships with key players in the social robotics industry. The recent work for example in the H2020 L2TOR project, which studied the use of social robots to support children in education, has led to considerable commercial interest. Embodied Inc., a start\-up in the California, has based its Moxie robot on Plymouth’s research \[5.1\] and Softbank Robotics Europe \(SBRE\) adopted robot tutors in their strategic vision, showcasing the use of robot tutors in their Paris headquarters as a future market for their social robots \[5.2\]. Plymouth has a longstanding relation with SBRE, who developed and sell the two most popular social robot platforms, the Nao and the Pepper humanoids. SBRE and Plymouth have collaborated since 2010 through four EU projects \(FP7 ALIZ\-E, FP7 DREAM, H2020 L2TOR, H2020 APRIL\) which SBRE match funded for a total of 522,717 EUR, demonstrating a sustained relationship with the global leader in commercial social robotics. 

 The centre also has long\-standing relationship with Zorabots, a leading social robot solutions provider based in Belgium. The company sells robots which consist of imported hardware with bespoke social robotics software. The collaboration, which originated in 2014 during a joint EU research project, continues with Zorabots relying on research from Plymouth to steer their commercial offer. Zorabots collaborates with Plymouth to scout application areas and to procure or develop technical solutions and AI to support social interaction on robots. In 2019 Zorabots, when employing 15 people FET, attracted a VC injection of 10 million EUR spread over 3 years by Versluys group allowing it to invest in new robots and development of software. Tommy Deblieck, co\-CEO, says “ *We relied on the expertise of the Plymouth team and Prof Belpaeme specifically to expand into social robotics, a nascent market which was brought to our attention by Plymouth’s research*.” \[5.3\] 

 Zorabots achieved worldwide attention during the Covid\-19 crisis, when they made their social robots available to care homes for free to use as a telepresence robots and to monitor for Covid\-19 symptoms and the correct wearing of PPE. In 2020, the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) purchased Zorabots robots to distribute to understaffed hospitals in Rwanda to support their Covid\-19 efforts. Again, these applications are an outcome of the collaboration started with the CRNS, as software and expertise was used in the robot deployed during the pandemic \[5.3 & 5.4\]. 

 Finally, Gaudl works for borobo Ltd, a UK\-based robotics and design start\-up founded in 2018 in London with the aim to develop novel interaction and design concepts to enrich user experiences. In 2019, borobo was attracted to the Southwest due to the support and strong connection to the research of the University of Plymouth through the EPIC project. Borobo collaborates with Plymouth and Edinburgh Robotics. Their current robot, Maah, marketed as a “sentient domestic artefact” and part of their Konpanion brand is designed as a low\-cost social robot that offers companionship and investigates ways of helping with isolation. 

 **Robots for therapy and care** 

 The work in the ALIZ\-E, DREAM, and EPIC projects involved evaluating social robots in medical and healthcare settings. This required a mentality shift in the institutions we worked with \(for example, San Rafaelle hospital  in Milan, Italy, Kernow Health, UK, The patients association, UK and the Meander Ziekenhuis in Amersfoort, NL\), and has resulted in a culture change across many healthcare and care institutions. Plymouth’s work on social robotics in healthcare is showcased in professional periodicals and medical conferences \(e.g. in 2019 Belpaeme was keynote speaker at the Innovation in Paediatrics Symposium, Amsterdam, and in 2020 he lectured on the potential of social robots at the ORSI Academy in Melle, Belgium\). These efforts have helped move attitudes from cautious scepticism to active participation in social robotics trials and deployments \[5.5\]. For example, Thill and Belpaeme were involved in the first randomised control trial proving the effectiveness of robot therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorders \(ASD\), which relied on a collaboration with the Babes\-Bolyai clinic in Cluj \(Romania\) to test 70 children with ASD \[5.6\]. The focus on healthcare not only has a long\-term horizon, but has immediate effects, such as the prompt adoption of robots in healthcare during the Covid\-19 crisis \[5.4\]. 

 The EPIC projects \(E\-health Productivity and Innovation in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly\), funded by the European Regional Development Fund project and involving Belpaeme, Cangelosi and Gaudl, looked at how social robotics and eHealth can serve to meet the needs of fragmented care, as for example found in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Due to its expected positive impact on healthcare, the project received a new round of funding running until 2023 of £4.15M, including investment of £255,000 from local SMEs. As part of EPIC, two robotics companies were founded and 97 additional SMEs were closely engaged and supported, based on the environment created through the University of Plymouth. One of the new companies is Robotriks Ltd., founded in 2018 by Plymouth graduate Jake Shaw\-Sutton Gibson and employing 2 staff, which designed and built the social robot ComPet in collaboration with the CRNS. 

 **Public awareness and policy** 

 The Organisation on Economic Cooperation and Development recruited Belpaeme and other thought leaders in smart education to author a policy document for their OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation. The document is used to support OECD member governments in future proofing education \[8\]. The joint work between Plymouth and Zorabots resulted in an invitation to shape the EU’s Civil Law Rules on Robotics initiative chaired by Mrs. Maddy Delvaux \(MEP\), for which both parties were regularly consulted and invited to the European Parliament \[5.9\]. 

 Foundational insights and research have had considerable impact beyond academia. The work on social peer pressure by robots attracted widespread media attention in 2018 following the publication of the research results in Science Robotics. The news was picked up by over 150 global news outlets, including Science, BBC, and New Scientist. The topic was debated during a Facebook Live event of Science magazine which was viewed by 6.3K viewers and led to invitations for keynotes to Belpaeme at public events. Based on the work with start\-up borobo, Gaudl was invited to present the 2019 IET Christmas lecture on the future of robotics. Since 2014 the work on social robotics has featured in dozens of international media outlets, including printed press \(New Scientist, Le Monde, the Guardian, Scientific American, …\) and television \(BBC, NBC, CNN, National Geographic, …\) and was part of a 4D video installation at the London Science Museum’s blockbuster exhibition on robots in 2017. 

 **Belpaeme** and his team contributed to several TV\-programmes for UK television, including Channel 4’s “The robot will see you now”, in which Belpaeme presented the science of social robots and their use in therapy, and BBC2’s “Six robots and us”, which aired in two parts during the primetime evening slot over Christmas 2017. The programmes showed how robots will integrate in our lives in a not too distant future and what the potential applications of robots are in care and retail.

 Research by Dr Joyce \(Zhe\) Jiang, a specialist in employment relations at the University of York, increased understanding of the plight of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\) as a form of modern slavery. It also demonstrated how ‘participatory art’ can help groups such as MDWs mobilize themselves and acquire collective identity and purpose. MDWs in London worked with Jiang to develop a video documentary highlighting their experiences, which was exhibited at galleries and museums across the UK. Through participatory art, Jiang has helped MDWs: raise public awareness of their plight; empower themselves and their associations towards improving terms and conditions; and advance the campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system.

 Research by Jiang at the University of York \(UoY\) has significantly contributed to understanding the experiences of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\), and how they might use participatory art to collectively organize themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions and influence policy. In the UK, there is growing concern that the decline in traditional labour organizing and collective bargaining has left large numbers of workers vulnerable to intensified forms of exploitation. This is especially the case with MDWs, such as, nannies, cooks and cleaners who live in accommodation provided by their employer. Typically, MDWs are not members of unions and do not benefit from the protection of domestic employment laws. 

 Drawing on insights from employment relations and the sociology of work, Jiang’s research has helped to understand the experiences of these workers as a form of modern slavery. A survey of MDWs conducted in early 2019, by Jiang at UoY, revealed that 59% suffered from physical, verbal or sexual abuse at work, and also that a majority of employers did not comply with the National Minimum Wage **\[A\]**. In the employment relations literature, it is often assumed that groups such as MDWs, isolated in the homes of their employers, lack a collective identity and are hard to organize in conventional ways that could improve working conditions, for example, through membership of unions. However, in earlier work \(prior to joining York in 2016\), Jiang \(with Korczynski, University of Nottingham\) had challenged the assumption that MDWs were ‘un\-organizable’ and highlighted ways in which these workers can mobilize themselves to articulate their shared experiences and pursue collective interests. 

 Research conducted at York by Jiang built on these ideas to explore how ‘participatory art’ can be a powerful tool in collective organizing. Key ideas were developed in *‘The art of labour organizing’*, published in the leading journal *Human Relations* **\[B\]**. Jiang explores the role that ‘participatory art’ can play in supporting and enhancing *‘flat organizing,’* which she defines as a process that emerges from social relationships between workers interacting with each other in the wider community. Examples include social movements or grassroots protest groups that \(initially at least\) have no formal leadership or structure. In the employment context, flat organizing might occur when groups of workers come together informally and develop a sense of community, initially without the help of trades unions. Jiang’s interest in participatory art was partly inspired by the critical mass of researchers at York, led by Professor Stephen Linstead, interested in the role of aesthetics for understanding organizations and the relationships between art and research. Using an in depth case study, Jiang uncovered how ‘art practices’ \(e.g. workshops on singing, drawing, painting, writing, acting and constructing and presenting satirical sketches\) can have a significant impact on the ability of groups such as MDWs to associate and develop a collective sense of purpose. Based on these observations she developed an ideal type model for understanding the ‘ *art of flat organizing’* consisting of six elements: participatory art practices; tutor activist roles; distributed leadership; safe spaces; knowing and questioning through art; and empowerment through art. 

 In 2019, Jiang applied and further refined her ideas about the art of flat organizing through a co\-produced project with The Voice of Domestic Workers \(VoDW\), for whom she acts as a trustee. This project involved a participatory video in collaboration with Tassia Kobylinska \- a filmmaker from Goldsmiths \- and a group of MDWs associated with VoDW **\[C\]\[D\]**. Funded by an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant awarded by UoY, twelve MDWs were trained in video production. Organised by Jiang and Kobylinska, this group co\-produced a short documentary video, *Our Journey* **\[D\]**, and curated exhibitions *\(My Home is Not My Home\)* that presented a combination of video installation, photography, artworks and documents in different museums and galleries across the UK \(including: in London, L’etrangere, Stephen Lawrence Gallery, Cubitt Gallery Goldsmiths and Unite the Union; in York, Norman Rea Gallery; and in Manchester, People’s History Museum\). As a form of ‘participatory art’ in action, the co\-produced film, *Our Journey* **\[D\]** and the associated exhibitions helped MDWs organize themselves and to articulate their interests to politicians and public audiences. 

 In research terms, observations and insights from the VoDW project enabled refinement and increased understanding of the process and outcomes of ‘participatory art’ in supporting flat organizing and the working lives of MDWs **\[E\]\[F\]**. Most recently, this work has continued with additional funding awarded in 2020 by Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women \(GAATW\) to further research the plight of MDWs, their experiences of modern slavery and the ways they are organizing themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 To date Jiang’s research has had an impact in three key areas: **\(a\)** raising public awareness of the plight of MDWs; **\(b\)** using participatory art practices to empower MDWs and help them organize to improve their terms and conditions; and **\(c\)** informing the ongoing campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system. 

 <ins>Enhanced public awareness</ins> – Following exhibitions in multiple galleries and museums between 2019 and 2020, Jiang’s research has helped to raise public and media awareness of the plight of MDWs. By December 2020 Jiang’s exhibitions had attracted 1,300 visitors nationally, despite the cancellation of events after March 2020, due to the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[1\]**. Evidence from feedback interviews and surveys reveals that the exhibitions have improved public understanding of the plight of MDWs and the need for reforming the system **\[1\]**. In exhibition questionnaires, a majority of visitors \(in some cases 100%\) responded positively to questions such as: *‘I felt moved or inspired’, ‘I was exposed to new ways of thinking about things’, ’It made me want to know more about what I was seeing’ and ‘I will use/share things learnt today*’ **\[1\]**. Words that recur in visitor’s comments’ books and interviews are *‘moving’, ‘important’, ‘enlightening’, ‘insightful’, ‘powerful’, ‘shocking’ and ‘informative’*. Some visitors expressed astonishment that ‘modern slavery’ still existed in the UK. One visitor, for example, stated: *‘I think it’s so surprising and disgraceful in this age that people are treated in a way that these workers have been treated. They are not considered as workers really. They are considered as slaves in modern society.’* A different visitor remarked on how it was: *‘a really shocking exhibition. I had an idea of what has been happening…\[the\] abuses, but not to this extent’*, while, according to another, it was: ‘ *A very inspiring and mind\-blowing exhibition that reveals an aspect of modern life that has always been overlooked’*. Others were able to connect the exhibition to their own immediate family experiences and recognised the importance of collective organizing: *‘my mum left the Philippines as a domestic worker – I don’t think she has had the opportunity to share her story and her pain with people who have been through the same – I can only imagine how much it helps to join in solidarity through organisations like VoDW’* **\[1\]**. An article published in the *Guardian* on the L’Etrangere exhibition and a feature on Resonance FM radio both assisted in raising public awareness of the exhibition and the issue **\[2\]**. 

 <ins>Empowering MDWs through participatory art</ins><ins>:</ins> In line with her foundational research **\[B\]**, the participatory art project directed by Jiang to produce the documentary video and exhibitions has supported ‘flat organizing’ by giving the MDWs a voice \- as individuals, through unionization and by connecting them to non\-traditional actors, such as museum curators. 

 First, it helped to empower the 12 individual MDWs who were directly involved in the art project, raising their willingness and ability to campaign on behalf of other co\-workers. Feedback suggested that for many it was a transformative experience which significantly improved their skills and confidence. A typical comment from participants was: *‘We learnt a lot. It's priceless, knowledge and bonding every week.*', while another remarked: *‘to be part of this project…I was so grateful because at last, we can express ourselves. We let other people hear our voices, our struggles.*' **\[3\]**. Five participants subsequently became active campaigners, representing their community by volunteering and speaking at public events. As the chair of VoDW stated: *‘Some women have developed important media skills from the participatory video series. They have become very active in representing the community in various media platforms. The skills learnt in the workshops have been spilled over to other progressive activities.*' **\[4\]**. 

 Second, the video and exhibitions helped to raise the awareness of a wider constituency of MDWs, mobilising support for the VoDW which campaigns for equal employment rights and reform of the visa system \(see below\). Jiang’s research helped boost membership of VoDW to 1500 by December 2020. This is confirmed by the VoDW Chairperson, who noted: *‘The video training has attracted…new members for us. We have also received enquiries from domestic workers who wanted to join our organization after visiting Joyce’s exhibition.’* **\[4\]**. Amongst these new members are the 12 MDWs involved in the video, one of whom is now leading the media and communication working group within VoDW. 

 A further way in which Jiang’s research has helped to empower MDWs is by facilitating union membership and changing the way that unions engage with this group: As the VoDW Chairperson explained: *‘Joyce’s research has informed our discussion with Unite the Union to establish a domestic worker branch within the union...Without her research, this will not happen so quickly’* **\[4\]**. These discussions led to a week\-long event \(starting Monday 9 March 2020\), just prior to the first Covid\-19 lockdown, hosted by Unite the Union at Unite House in Holborn \(London\). This event, attended by Unite Executive Council members, included a screening of the film followed by presentations by Jiang and MDWs themselves. Feedback from it noted how the exhibition had raised awareness and also advanced Unite’s own campaign to organize MDWs and achieve equal employment rights. According to the National Officer for the Hospitality Service Sector within Unite the Union: *‘This video will increase awareness and elicit wider support for their campaign to be afforded the same fundamental rights as any other worker’* **\[5\]**. The Unite Assistant General Secretary also writes: *‘This event raised awareness and strengthened union organisation, demonstrating to migrant domestic workers that they are not alone, and that they are supported by the union alongside a wide alliance of organisations and individuals.*’ Furthermore, she notes how: *‘The film has played, and is playing, a vital role in union campaigning with migrant domestic workers...supporting union organising...and bringing together all those who want to make change’* **\[5\]**. The impact of Jiang’s work in helping to empower and mobilize MDWs is further acknowledged by a spokesperson for the Trades Union Congress, who states: *'Allowing domestic workers to tell their stories themselves in her \[Jiang’s\] video starts to give these workers the power to challenge the injustices they have suffered and shows how workers organising in unions has helped to overcome their exploitation’  \[10\]**. Overall, Jiang’s work is significant in helping to broaden the focus of unions which, traditionally, had not sought to recruit and organize marginalized groups such as MDWs. 

 Third, the research directly supported flat organizing by helping to forge new links with non\-traditional actors such as gallery and museum curators who are now supporting the work of VoDW. As the curator from Cubitt Gallery stated: *‘The film brought new audiences and conversations to Cubitt and is a great example of how art can work across and with different communities.’* **\[6\]**. Cubitt gallery and Raven Row gallery have also agreed to provide free venues for VoDW’s meetings and workshop activities in the future. Curator of the Cubitt gallery stated, *“studio spaces have been made available to support the group’s \[VoDW\] ongoing work”* and this *“sharing space at Cubitt is key to developing forms of solidarity and knowledge exchange in relation to work, education, precarity and collective organizing”* **\[6\]**. 

 <ins>Campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system:</ins> Jiang’s research and work on the video has informed and energized a wider campaign led by VoDW, Unite the Union, Kalayaan and Anti\-slavery to reinstate the pre\-2012 Overseas Domestic Worker Visa \(ODW visa\). Before 2012, MDWs were allowed to renew their visa provided that they would be continuously hired as full\-time domestic workers and, after five years, apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventually UK citizenship. However, in 2012, the UK Government removed these rights to renew, greatly increasing the insecurity and vulnerability of MDWs. The campaign to reverse this decision has achieved national media attention, partly as a result of the film and exhibitions that have raised awareness **\[2\]**. Jiang’s survey report, commissioned by VoDW **\[A\]**, provided robust evidence of modern slavery which also directly informed this campaign. Specifically, the exhibitions and film increased politicians’ awareness of the plight of MDWs in the UK. As the EU & Europe manager of Anti\-Slavery International noted, ‘ *The film gives space to individuals to tell their story in their words, with dignity...it is also a homage to all that domestic workers themselves have achieved and continue to fight for’* **\[7\]**. Similarly, the former Labour MP Fiona MacTaggart noted: *‘the wonderful thing about this exhibition and the video…is a very intimate description of the horrible exploitations which so many migrant domestic workers are subjected to. They are forced to a form of slavery which is not acceptable in the UK today. All of us should do more to help them.’* **\[8\]**. 

 As a result of increasing publicity arising from Jiang’s report **\[A\]**, the participatory art project and growing media attention, in late 2019 Jiang was asked to help draft a Parliamentary Briefing to inform MPs and policy makers of the vulnerability and marginality of MDWs in the UK and the problems associated with the current ODW Visa **\[9\]**. This led to Jiang being invited to speak at the campaign launch event hosted and chaired by Labour Party MP Jess Phillips. Originally planned for April 2020 in the House of Commons, this event was postponed due to Covid and finally held, virtually, on 17 November. It was attended by 115 people including MPs and the Prevention Policy lead of the Modern Slavery Unit within the Home Office. Feedback from the meeting further highlighted the impact of Jiang’s work in raising awareness and how this was helping to boost the campaign to reinstate the ODW visa. Jess Phillips \(MP\), for example, remarked: *'It has been incredibly insightful ... we will certainly try to improve the situation which I don't know how anyone who hears this could think it's not wrong.'* **\[10\]** The Policy Officer \(Rights, International, Social and Economics department\) for the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) further commented on how *‘Joyce Jiang's video and research’* not only represented *‘an important resource’* to raise awareness, but also ‘ *supports the TUC's advocacy to change UK law to end the tied overseas domestic workers' visa and end the criminalisation of undocumented workers.'* **\[10\]**. Although this campaign to reinstate the visa was interrupted by the pandemic, it is regaining momentum and political support following the parliamentary event in November. This is due in large part to Jiang’s research and wider public engagement. As the Director of VoDW stated: *''Joyce presented her research findings and video on migrant domestic workers in our online parliamentary event chaired by labour MP Jess Phillips on Nov 17 2020. We have also used Joyce's policy report in our call to action in writing letters to MPs to support the reinstatement of rights of domestic workers. **Joyce's study has significantly improved parliamentarian awareness of the plight of migrant domestic workers in the UK, mobilised wide support and advanced our campaign on the Overseas Domestic Worker visa''** **\[10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Independent community news outlets play an important democratic role in UK communities left behind by the decline in traditional print media. Cardiff researchers identified challenges faced by this sector, including economic precarity and a lack of training and support. Through the Centre for Community Journalism and the Independent Community News Network \(the UK’s only formal body representing the sector\), the research led to: changes to Scottish and Welsh Governments’ funding of hyperlocal publications, including new sustainability funding during the pandemic; the development of key resources for community news outlets; and growing media literacy across all Welsh primary schools. The team’s training on sustainable community journalism was used by more than 32,000 learners from 131 countries. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Work on community journalism stems from the School of Journalism, Media and Culture’s longstanding research on media and citizenship **\[**e.g. **3.1\]**, tracing the way in which the decline of local and regional newspapers has created a democratic deficit **\[3.2\]**. More recent work explored the potential of a new generation of independent local community news outlets \(currently around 260 across the UK\) to counter this trend. Some of the key research in this case study was funded through the £1.1M AHRC\-funded ‘Media, community and the creative citizen’ project **\[G3.1**, 2012\-2015 **\]** led by Cardiff. Williams was Co\-Investigator \(with Harte from Birmingham City University\) on a project strand on hyperlocal news, where he led on large\-scale content analysis, interview and survey design. 

 **2.1 Value of hyperlocal news** 

 Cardiff research – including the largest content analysis to date of hyperlocal content – established the high civic, community and political value of community news outlets **\[3.3\]**. The team also found evidence of community news playing important social roles, including: providing a route to participation in the public sphere; supporting everyday active citizenship **\[3.4\]**; and directly encouraging and facilitating both online and offline interactions and mutual aid **\[3.5\]**. 

 **2.2 Economic challenges faced by the sector** 

 The research team found that hyperlocal outlets struggle to generate income, making their existence and potential growth precarious **\[3.5\]**. Most are sustained by volunteers and lack the support to expand or professionalise. Only around one in four generate enough income to cover their costs and only a small proportion can pay editors or contributors. Local advertising spend is the dominant form of income generation, but in a competitive and shrinking market **\[3.4\]**. 

 **2.3 Supporting the sector** 

 Williams highlighted the need for systemic intervention to sustain this emerging sector **\[3.2, 3.4\]**. He recommended: 

-  public subsidies for non\-profit local and community news. Once established with initial start\-up funds, outlets could then run on hybrid business models, part\-supported by public money and by targeted hyperlocal advertising **\[3.2\]**; 

-  levelling the playing field in terms of public/government subsidy, which largely shut out newer community outlets in favour of legacy local newspaper companies **\[3.4\]**. 

 Community journalists also lack non\-financial support. A survey \(Williams & Harte for the Media, Community & Creative Citizen project, alongside colleagues from the University of Westminster\) produced the most comprehensive empirical analysis to date of the practices, funding, staffing and outlooks of those who run hyperlocal sites **\[3.6\]**. It showed that: 

-  79% of hyperlocals surveyed would like to expand the size and scope of their site; 

-  63% would like help generating revenues; 

-  42% wanted more technical support; 

-  9% would appreciate legal support when reporting legally sensitive issues; 

-  23% wanted to be able to access training. 

 Wahl\-Jorgensen further investigated – through in\-depth interviews and a survey of practitioners – the sector’s experience during the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[G3.2\]**. She found that the pandemic represents an existential challenge to outlets as they lost significant local advertising revenue and were unable to benefit from government schemes, including furlough and advertising support. 

 Cardiff’s research identified the importance of community journalism and highlighted the challenges facing the emerging sector. Following these findings, Cardiff made two externally\-facing investments to strengthen the sector: 

-  The Centre for Community Journalism \(C4CJ\) was established in 2014 to provide training, support and capacity for the sector, and is a focus for collaborative action\-research with sector stakeholders. As one of the University’s three flagship engagement projects, it was part of a wider strategic investment in transforming communities. C4CJ has since attracted additional external funding \(£300,000\) from the AHRC, Welsh Government and Google. 

-  The Independent Community News Network \(ICNN\), run through C4CJ, was established in 2018 as a formal entity to advocate on behalf of UK community publishers. It is the only representative body for the sector and represents 125 titles \(as of November 2020\) across all four UK nations. Current estimates put the online reach of ICNN membership at over five million people per month across the UK, with a collective circulation of 150,000.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Through the Centre for Community Journalism \(C4CJ\), and the Independent Community News Network \(ICNN\), the research led to: increased advocacy for the sector, resulting in additional income and resource; capacity building for the international hyperlocal sector, leading to new and more sustainable outlets; and critical support to sustain the sector throughout the COVID\-19 crisis. 

 **4.1 Advocacy for the sector** 

 **a. Funding for hyperlocals in Wales** 

 The news industry crisis has particular implications for Wales, where a high penetration of London\-based news creates a serious democratic deficit. Williams and the C4CJ team gave evidence \(2017\-2018\) to the Senedd Cymru \- Welsh Parliament’s year\-long inquiry into News Journalism in Wales **\[5.1\]**. Drawing on our research **\[3.2, 3.5\]** contestable public funding was recommended to help Wales’ hyperlocal sector become sustainable. As a result, Welsh Government provided funding of £200,000, over two years, for hyperlocal publications **\[5.2\]**. The C4CJ team co\-authored a report \(funded by Welsh Government\) on delivering the scheme. ICNN membership was used as a qualifying criterion for access to the Independent Community Journalism Fund and the ICNN team were expert advisors on the application panel. The seven successful applicants are spread across Wales. Their feedback was strongly supportive, including **\[5.3\]**: 

-  *“\[ICNN’s work with Welsh Government\] has been invaluable to me … I had no funding to advertise / promote Inksplott, update the website, update the brand or professionalise the service. With the grant funding received through ICJF, I have achieved all of this... making revenue from advertising more likely in future”* – Lynne Thomas, editor of *InkSplott;* 

-  *“The funding went directly to improving our internal IT infrastructure through the employment of a software developer … \[it\] also went on training, a move to a larger office space and marketing materials”* – Richard Gurner, editor and publisher of *Caerphilly Observer*. 

 **b. Ensuring access to the BBC’s Local Democracy Initiative** 

 In 2016, the BBC’s planned investment of £8m in employing 150 local democracy reporters focused on traditional news providers, taking little account of the community news sector. C4CJ’s advocacy in planning discussions led the BBC to include community\-owned publications in the initiative. Matthew Barraclough, Head of Local News Partnerships at the BBC, confirmed that *“C4CJ was able to represent the needs of the smaller independent news providers to ensure that they could take full advantage of the content generated and \- where possible \- become suppliers themselves”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 As a result, 58 community outlets across the UK now have access to a free daily democracy news wire and four employ a Local Democracy Reporter **\[5.4\]** and news editorial resources can be directed elsewhere **\[5.3\]**. Barraclough further noted that “the establishment of the ICNN was also very helpful to the BBC’s project as, by bringing in common editorial standards and practical support for members, it made it *“easier for a large news organisation such as the BBC to interact and consult with a dispersed and diverse part of the news eco\-system”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.2 Capacity building for the hyperlocal news sector** 

 C4CJ worked throughout the REF period to establish, support and build local news outlets through a sustained programme of training, resource development, advice and outreach. Some examples of impacts from this programme of work include: 

 **a. Web resources:** C4CJ and ICNN resources have helped hyperlocal outlets to survive and grow. For example, access to a suitable web template is a barrier for many wanting to set up a digital news publication. C4CJ created the world’s first free, bilingual, Community Journalism WordPress template. It has been used approximately 100 times to date and over 50% of these uses have been by new start\-ups needing an online platform. Eirwen Williams, publisher of *Pobl Y Fenni*, confirmed that the web template is *“one of the most significant resources we have used”* and that WordPress training provided by C4CJ “ *upskilled our volunteers and saved us thousands of pounds on paying a web designer”* **\[5.5\]**. C4CJ’s advice and digital resources made *Pobl Y Fenni* *“a leading example of how the rest of the Papurau Bro \(Welsh language community newspapers\) can follow in our footsteps…which will help keep this valuable network alive”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 **b. Legal advice:** C4CJ’s free legal advice service for ICNN members has been used approximately 100 times since the network was established in 2018. *The* *Guildford Dragon* said that by using the service *“we have saved money by not having to source costly external legal advice” and “settled legal threats before they escalated”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **c. Training for the community news sector worldwide:** C4CJ provided training to over 38,000 individuals since 2015. For example, its MOOC on community journalism taught more than 32,000 learners from 131 different countries including India, Brazil, Nigeria, Australia, United States, Russia and Spain. *Inksplott* was one of at least 11 new hyperlocals established as a direct result; its editor confirmed that the course taught her *“both journalism skills…and the technical skills required to set up a hyperlocal news website and social media platforms”* **\[5.3\]**. Ken Skates, then Wales’ Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Infrastructure, wrote: *“the high number of international learners reached through the C4CJ’s Community Journalism MOOC helps to enhance Wales’s reputation in this field”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **d. Toolkit to develop media literacy in pupils**: C4CJ and ICNN have also contributed to capacity\-building for future generations of journalists in communities across Wales, which *“has been crucial in forming the strategy for boosting Media Literacy across Wales”* **\[5.8\]**. Following a pilot project in a socially deprived community in south Wales, C4CJ developed a media literacy resource for teachers **.** This toolkit, created with the National Education Union \(NEU\) Cymru, was launched across all primary schools in Wales in November 2019. It is a train\-the\-trainer pack of ten hands\-on sessions. Beth Roberts, NEU Cymru, confirmed that the toolkit *“equips pupils with the basics for news reporting, teaches them to examine news critically, and creates the next generation of engaged citizens”* **\[5.8\]**. 

 **4.3 Sustaining community news outlets throughout the Covid\-19 crisis** 

 Community outlets struggled during the pandemic in 2020 as local businesses – their main source of advertising income – closed down. C4CJ and ICNN worked to deliver resilience and sustainability for the sector. 

 **a. Proving status during lockdown** 

 ICNN enabled its members to work unobstructed during lockdown by quickly providing them with letters of verification and membership cards \(most members are ineligible for press cards\). Editor and publisher of the *Guildford Dragon*, Martin Giles said: *“Without this verification, I have no doubt that many journalists would not have been able to perform their roles, this will have been particularly true during the COVID\-19 lockdown”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **b. Protecting hyperlocals from loss of advertising income** 

 **i. Wales:** At the beginning of the lockdown, C4CJ lobbied Welsh Government to release the remaining money in the Independent Community Journalism Fund. Consequently, all Welsh members of ICNN received £8,000 in emergency grant revenue funding. Richard Gurner, *Caerphilly Observer*, confirmed that *“without ICNN the COVID\-19 funding would not have existed, let alone been reallocated, and without it I believe Wales would have seen some independent media shrink, or even close”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In July 2020, Emma Meese \(C4CJ Director\) gave evidence to the Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament’s Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee’s inquiry into the pandemic’s impact on news media. The Committee’s report cited her recommendation to allow hyperlocal and online news outlets to publish statutory notices \[which are currently only required to be published in printed newspapers\] \- a significant source of income **\[5.9\]**. This directly influenced the Committee’s subsequent recommendation that *“The Welsh Government should urgently identify the changes necessary to enable statutory notices to be published by hyperlocal and online providers”* **\[5.9\]**. 

 **ii. Scotland:** Meese, on behalf of ICNN, made similar recommendations in Scotland to ensure that community titles benefitted from Government advertising campaigns. This led to the Scottish government’s agreement to place public health adverts in eight ICNN titles. Following a successful first phase in August/September 2020, ICNN secured a second round of advertising to run for two weeks in November 2020. Edinburgh Reporter editor Phyllis Stephen said that this money *“is absolutely crucial to us as an independent news publisher. We have watched the ‘big boys’ getting support in the form of advertising all across the UK, and thought all was lost until ICNN stepped into lobby on our behalf”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 **iii. England:** ICNN worked to get members access to funds under the Government’s £35m ‘All\-in, all together’ public health advertising campaign. *Wokingham Today*, the only ICNN member publishing a physical newspaper, was partnered with the scheme as a result. The title’s publisher, David Riley, confirmed that: *“This regular stream of income helped us to avoid making any redundancies during the pandemic and to ensure that we could continue to publish in both print and online… \[ICNN’s\] campaigning work over the last six months has been a lifeline to ours and to so many publications across the UK”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In summary, the Cardiff team developed research findings on community journalism in tandem with vehicles \(C4CJ and ICNN\) designed to maximise their impact, through advocacy, representation, training, advice and resources. This has allowed Cardiff research to play an integral role in ensuring both the survival and the ongoing development of this valuable emerging sector.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Autism Centre Education and Research \(ACER\) has **challenged the prevalent misconception that autism is a disorder, rather than a different way of being**. In so doing, we have empowered teachers to see autistic children and young people \(CYP\) as having different and distinct learning needs, rather than being ‘faulty’, ‘problematic’ and in need of ‘fixing’ \(as the ‘deficit’ view assumes\). We have impacted education practitioners in a way that protects the education rights and interests of autistic children and young people. Together with the Autism Education Trust \(AET\), we have: 

1.  **Transformed how education stakeholders nationally and internationally understand and value autistic pupils;** 

1.  **Systematically enabled teachers to adopt improved, pupil\-centred approaches** which transform the educational experience of autistic pupils **;** 

1.  **Enabled the AET to position themselves as a key authority on best practice for national Autism Education;** 

1.  **Transformed the infrastructure and organisation of autism support and provision in** **England.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 There are over 120,000 autistic pupils in England’s schools, of which over 70% are educated in mainstream provision. In England, autistic children and young people \(CYP\) are three times more likely to be regularly and unlawfully excluded from school for a fixed period than children who do not have special educational needs. Autism is a complex condition that impacts daily functioning. Therefore, autistic CYP require distinctive support to be successful at school \(R1, R2\). But without research\-based knowledge of autism, staff in education settings often apply generalist understandings of ‘good’ education to autistic learners, without making adjustments \(R2, R3\). This problem is compounded by gaps between research evidence on autism, education and teachers’ everyday practices \(R4\). There is a significant and pressing need for educators to access and use the best evidence and guidance available to support autistic CYP to succeed. In short, education staff need support to develop better understandings, attitudes towards and classroom practice for autistic pupils \(R3\). ACER’s research has contributed conceptually and empirically to informing practice and policy on ‘good autism education’. This has included the development of a distinctive pedagogy for autistic pupils \(R1–R6\). Findings that shaped this distinctive pedagogy include, but are not limited to: 

 **F1.** **Strengths:** Good autism practice shifts the focus on to autistic people’s strengths, rather than emphasising their deficits. This includes viewing autism as a different, rather than disordered, way of being \(R5\). 

 **F2.** **Differences:** There are four key areas of difference that inform how autistic CYP learn. These are: interacting and developing relationships; processing information; taking in and perceiving sensory information; and communicating, understanding and using language \(R6\). 

 **F3.** **Inclusion:** Instead of adapting an existing curriculum to accommodate autistic pupils, the curriculum needs to be inclusive of all at its root. Teachers must accommodate autistic CYP’s distinctive needs into the curriculum by making changes to the physical, sensory and social environment, and by prioritising the above four areas of learning difference \(R1, R6\). 

 **F4.** **Participation:** Autistic CYP must be engaged in decisions affecting them, and good education outcomes will engage each individual’s needs and aspirations \(R2, R4, R3\). 

 **F5.** **Pupil\-centredness:** Knowledge of each individual pupil is vital to developing good autism education practice \(R3, R4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **ACER has developed a distinctive conceptual framework and pedagogy** \(F1–F5\). The framework is a key component of the **Autism Education Trust’s \(AET\) continuing professional development programme \(CPD\)**, co\-created by ACER and the AET \(S1\). This partnership has to date **trained 275,000 education staff** across England \(S1\). The CPD programme consists of \(1\) a **set of autism standards** \(for educational settings to assess autism practice in education\); \(2\) an **autism competency framework** \(guidance on the knowledge, skills and competencies needed by practitioners\) and \(3\) **autism training for** **educators**. The roll\-out of this programme has produced a step\-change in autism education practice demonstrated in the following four impacts. We have: 

1.  <ins> **Transformed how education stakeholders nationally and internationally understand and value autistic C</ins><ins>hildren and</ins> <ins>Y</ins><ins>oung</ins> <ins>P</ins><ins>eople**</ins> 

 The AET programme **champions a strengths\-based approach**, rather than a deficit\-based approach, to meeting the needs of children and young people in their education \(F2\). This is attested to by a trainer who confirmed the programme has “changed the way we conduct training for staff. We now focus on the differences and strengths of pupils with autism rather than their deficits” \(S2 p.30; F3\). 

 This programme is not simply changing how *individual* educators understand and value autistic CYP. It is also **setting the standard for** **best practice nationally**. As described by Pam Simpson, AET Lead in Birmingham City Council: “we now have a structured and consistent response, based on research principles and aligned to key legislation, supported by the DFE” \(S2, p.16\). The programme is the only CPD programme referenced in the 2014 Special Educational Needs and Disability Code of Practice \(S3 p.276\) and signposted as key training \(S2\). It is now the largest national training programme on autism in England for education\-based staff \(S1\). 

 The most recent intervention is the **development of eight principles of good autism practice** and detailed case studies of good autism practice in eight schools. These were produced by ACER and funded by the AET \(2018–2019\) \(S1\). These principles have been endorsed by the AET Young Persons Panel, feature as a framework for a large postgraduate professional development programme for autism practitioners and are used in the AET’s bite\-size messages regarding good autism practice. They are currently being used as a framework for a re\-development and update of the AET professional development programme \(S4\). 

 **ACER has also challenged conventional medical** **conceptions of autism in Italy and Greece**, again shifting narratives from ‘disorder’ to a ‘different way of being’. That understandings were effectively changed is confirmed by a Greek participant, who stated “I was impressed by the different approach towards autism and autistic people: the approach was very different compared to the Greek medical model of understanding autism. It changed the way I understood autism \[…\] I felt very excited thinking that autism needn’t be considered a tragedy \(as it commonly is perceived in Greece\)” \(S5 p.10\). We achieved this impact through work with 110 Schools in Greece and 200 staff in Italy, funded by the EU \(2014–2017\) \(S6\). The **Greek Ministry of Education have endorsed the provision of the \(translated and adapted\) professional development programme** throughout Piraeus and Athens \(S6 p.17\). 

 **\(2\) <ins>Systematically enabled educators to adopt improved, pupil\-centred approaches which transform the educational experience of autistic pupils**</ins> 

 Leadership in schools is **better informed about autism, more able to address the professional development needs of staff and have a framework for auditing existing practice, as well as providing a good local offer for pupils with autism** \(S2 pp.15\-26, S7; F1–F6\). This research\-informed professional leadership has been highly effective in raising the capacity of schools to meet the needs of CYP on the autism spectrum \(S7, S8; F1\). One participant reported that they “now used visual prompts and provided simple instructions. She felt she could adapt her teaching to individual student needs now, could prevent crisis and manage difficult situations and that the child had reduced meltdowns and collaborated more with others as a result of her improved practices” \(S6 p.53\). 

 **We have established a shared baseline of knowledge which changed planning at school\-wide level** using a strategic and collaborative approach \(S2 pp.15\-26, S5\). For example, in one nursery, where all staff had been trained, the head teacher said: ‘the standards were just amazing for us and we audited not just the resource base but the entire school. \[…\] During that first year what we also did was use the standards to set performance management objectives for the staff who were then based in the resource base. That gave a very clear indication of where we needed to go as a school’ \(S8 p.68\). Targeted and specialist support within their settings is reported by staff across four training hubs \(networks of schools, local authorities and the voluntary sector\), thereby meeting the needs of all children \(S7; F1–F6\) and facilitating educators in acting on their new understanding of pupil\-centred approaches. Improved knowledge and understanding have allowed assessments that accurately reflect the child’s needs, gain the views of CYP and use these to make reasonable adjustments in schools \(S8 pp. 81\-129; F2, F4\). In 2018, two thirds of those who had received the AET training stated they were still using practical ideas and guidance from the training \(S1\). Case studies of two schools in Greece and Italy, undertaken two years after the CPD had taken place, show teachers continuing to take account of the distinctive learning needs of autistic pupils in developing enabling environments \(S5\). 

1.  <ins> **Enabled the AET to position themselves as a key authority on best practice for national Autism Education**</ins> 

 ACER’s collaboration has enabled the AET to position themselves as **a trusted national leader and valued government** **lobbyist** for matters concerning Autism Education. That AET is so regarded is evidenced by its receipt of £1.5 million funding from the UK’s Department of Education \(DfE\) between 2011 and 2013. The funding supported the development and delivery of the AET professional development programme to staff in mainstream Early Years settings and schools. The AET has secured over £2 million of subsequent funding from the DfE every two years to date. Further evidence of the AET’s standing comes from the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Autism \(APPGA\) report, which described the AET as having a “strong track record in developing training materials and delivering good quality training to schools. The AET has also published a set of national standards on good autism practice. This should have a key role in contributing to the delivery of the new ITT framework and to ongoing training for teachers and other school staff” \(S9\). In addition, the AET won Corporate Vision magazine, Private Education and Development Awards Best Autism Education Training Company in the UK in 2019. The AET Director described ACER as being “instrumental in the development of the AET programme. The content of the AET programme, developed by ACER, is of high standard. ACER embedded their research and distinctive pedagogy in the AET programme and were a leading organisation in the development of the AET partnership” \(S1\). 

 **\(4\)  <ins>Transformed the infrastructure and organisation of autism support and provision in**</ins> <ins> **England**</ins> 

 Local authority \(LA\) provision to support autistic CYP has undergone a step\-change in both the organisation and cost\-effectiveness. **The training now reaches 50% of the 24,821 schools in England** due to the strategic changes in organisation outlined below. **Cost\-effectiveness has also been improved**, as the reduction in exclusions of autistic CYP in one Local Authority has also led to a reduction in the cost of their education \(S10\). Given that the Institute for Public Policy Research \(2017\) estimates the costs of exclusions at around £370,000 per young person, economic modelling indicates that the Communication and Autism team in Birmingham alone potentially saves the public purse approximately £169 million by embedding the AET programme and reducing exclusions \(S10\). In addition, Communication and Autism team data shows that the number of pupils that have remained in mainstream education has risen as a result of the implementation of the training across the LA. Between 2016 and 2019, 4% more pupils were educated in mainstream rather than specialist provisions. As the average cost of specialist provision in the LA is £67,000 per year per child, a 4% increase equates to a saving of £11 million \(S10\). Examples of infrastructure change to improve autism provision include: 

-  **Training ‘hubs’ have been introduced in which training providers work together** on delivery \(S1\). Hubs consist of a range of organisations, including local authorities, the voluntary sector and schools. When the AET programme was launched, seven hubs were involved in delivering training between 2011–2013. As of 2019, **73 out of a total of 150 LAs across all of the nine regions of England** are involved in the AET programme. Staff across four training hubs surveyed by the AET stated that the programme framework has enabled staff to develop their knowledge and skills to deliver universal, targeted and specialist support within their settings, thereby meeting the needs of all children \(S6 p.39; F1–F6\). 

-  **The AET programme is now core LA training **.** Case studies of four of the LAs that deliver the programme found that 82% of schools in Leicestershire have undertaken the training \(S6\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Polar Regions are transforming. Melting of sea ice and power struggles involving China, Russia and the United States are two drivers of change. The scale and pace of change is poorly understood. Dodds’ research used interviews, specialist roles and public engagement to reveal geopolitical trends and knowledge gaps in polar governance. The impacts of research are: 

-  Enhancing policy planning on the Polar Regions by providing specialist advice on futures and scenarios to Parliament and UK government departments including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) and the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\) 

-  Advising diplomatic professionals and government organizations to better understand the importance of drivers of change; 

-  Greater understanding and representation of the Polar Regions in the heritage sector, education and media. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research addresses key knowledge gaps in polar governance: uncertainties over the scale and pace of climate change, strategic intentions of third parties, trade and resource opportunities for the UK, and opportunities for polar science diplomacy. Increasingly, the role and intent of newer polar parties such as China, India and Korea are of ongoing concern to policymakers in the UK and US. 

 Led by Professor Klaus Dodds at RHUL, the research involved academics in Canada \(Professor Mark Nuttall \(University of Alberta\), UK \(Dr Richard Powell Cambridge, Dr Duncan Depledge Loughborough\), USA \(Professor Phil Steinberg Florida State University\) and Singapore \(Professor Chih Yuan Woon\). This research strategy made it possible to better understand the geopolitical dynamics of the polar regions, and the role that the UK as a non\-Arctic state could play in shaping commercial, defence, governance, and scientific agendas and priorities. 

  

 There are three main strands of research. The first focused on the drivers of change affecting the Polar Regions using interviews with policy\-makers and civil servants, high level participation in ‘closed events’, ethnography in the Arctic and professional engagement with UK and international stakeholders. Dodds and his team discovered was that there were not scrambles for territory and resources but there was evidence of concerted investment in knowledge\-generation, projection of influence and commercial investment. What was revealed was multiple futures; resource scrambles, ecological collapse, great power conflict, great power rivalries and new settlement/development \(R2 and R4\). 

 The second strand of research brought together researchers from around the world working on polar geopolitics and Asian polar geopolitics \(R1 and R6\). The UK’s polar community, academic and non\-academic, is scattered, and heavily biased towards the natural and environmental sciences, so the aim was to integrate the contribution made by social science and humanities, including heritage and education. This multidisciplinary approach revealed gaps in knowledge about indigenous communities and leaderships but also presented opportunities to build networks with newer polar actors. If policymakers and publics in the UK and elsewhere are ill\-informed about Arctic geopolitics \(including the fact that the Arctic is a homeland to 4,000,000 people\), encouraging the next generation of polar social science researchers is integral to improving understanding. 

 The research integrated academic knowledge into national level decision\-making and wider public cultures. It demonstrated that the UK government’s Arctic policy framework has been criticised by third parties for failing to take into account Scotland’s distinct Arctic interests, and not giving enough recognition to the defence and military imperatives in an era of Russian resurgence. The term ‘Ice’ was used to investigate how ice has become ever more politicised in an era of ongoing climate change. The research shows how Indigenous and western perspectives on sea ice and permafrost often diverge over how ice is conceptualised as risk, as critical infrastructure, as security challenge, and as a platform for environmental campaigning. 

 Dodds’ research was enabled by participation in parliamentary enquiries, research interviews with policymakers, professional engagement with UK government departments and NATO, high\-level invitations to participate in special programs, including Norway and the High North Study Visit in 2012, and participation in public engagement activities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research revealed that there was an urgent need to better understand the scale and pace of geopolitical and environmental change in the polar regions. This was true not only within governments, but also in public settings, including the media, the cultural sector, and in schools. 

 The impact of the research is in three areas: Policy, Public Understanding, and Education. It is built on over a decade of collaboration with policymakers, UK Parliamentarians, professionals, and other academics. Beneficiaries include government agencies, parliamentarians, museum curators and visitors, teachers, and NGOs. 

1.  <ins> **Shaping Policy Conversations**</ins> 

 Dodds is an acknowledged and in\-demand expert in the field of polar geopolitics. His research findings are used by Parliament, specialist bodies, and the UK government. James Gray MP, Chair of the All\-Party Parliament Group for the Polar Regions: “ *there is no doubt that Parliament’s interest in the polar regions over recent years has never been higher… and this is in large part because of Professor Dodds’ many contributions*”. \( **E 1,** James Gray MP 4<sup>th</sup> July 2018\). He was appointed as Honorary Fellow by British Antarctic Survey in 2019 in recognition of \[text removed for publication\]. \( **E 7,** \[text removed for publication\] 25th April 2019\), and serves as UK representative for the International Arctic Science Committee’s Social and Human Working Group \(2019 to 2022\). This contributed to the polar social sciences being recognised as pivotal to future UK polar diplomacy and wider science policy planning. 

 Dodds’ research expertise led to his appointment as specialist adviser to the House of Lords Select Committee \(2014 to 2015; House of Lords Hansard 3<sup>rd</sup> November 2015\), and specialist adviser to the House of Commons Environment Audit Committee’s Arctic enquiry in 2019. The House of Lords used his research expertise to inform their understanding of Artic geopolitics: “ *His role was to give expert advice to the committee, help compile questions to witnesses \(including ministers\), ensure there were no blatant gaps in our work, prevent any errors of fact in our report, and give advice to me as chairman*” \( **E 2,** Lord Teverson, 23rd January 2017\). At the House of Commons Dodds research on international relationships with the Arctic states informed a report \(HOC, *The Changing Arctic* 2018\): \[text removed for publication\] **\(E 9**, \[text removed for publication\], 29th April 2019\) 

 These roles led Dodds to advise the FCO and MOD on polar matters, including invitations to participate in closed workshops and informal briefings \( **E1\).** In March 2020, Dodds was appointed to the DEFRA COVID\-19 futures advisory group after earlier briefings to DEFRA on Arctic futures in April 2019. Dodds participated in closed workshops and advised on DEFRA’s post\-COVID food security planning, with a particular emphasis on governance and global risk. 

 <ins>Policy Recommendations</ins> 

 Dodds’ public roles and advisory work helped to establish a new network of polar social science expertise dedicated to policy\-making. As a member of the House of Lords Select Committee, Dodds recommended that co\-ordination and collaboration with Arctic partnerships should be improved.  He advised the setting up of a new NERC Arctic Office to achieve this, a policy that was implemented in 2015. A workshop sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2016 brought together Norwegian, Canadian and UK stakeholders, and used Dodds’ research as the basis of a discussion paper at this  [significant event](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Scenarios-for-Arctic-2045.pdf). The event influenced subsequent work by the MOD on Arctic futures. Dodds was asked to convene an expert group to write a follow up report. **“** *Klaus’s support and expertise throughout the study was invaluable. He helped develop the main purpose of the study, provide expertise and coordinate the contributing authors*”  \( **E 6,** Paul Norman, DCDC MOD 27th November 2017\) This MOD report provided the basis for the Chief of Defence Staff’s Strategy Forum in 2018 and developed a clear set of conclusions about the technological, environmental, resource\-led and geopolitical challenges facing the Arctic and how the UK would need to develop a more explicit Arctic strategy with security objectives such as evaluating the strategic intentions of China and Russia in particular. 

 Dodds’ research also informed the FCO Diplomatic Academy where junior diplomats are required to study his expert briefings on the South Atlantic and Antarctic presented in podcasts.  This is one example of how Dodds’ research is used in the UK to enable diplomats to better understand the geopolitical and historical context of lingering conflicts \( **E 6,** \[text removed for publication\] 24<sup>th</sup> December 2020\). 

 <ins>Briefing Parliament</ins> 

 Dodds advised the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s  [parliamentary briefing](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-0568) on 

 Science Diplomacy and participated in the POST annual reception on the same topic in January 2019.  “ *Our office had not looked at science diplomacy before, and we are grateful for your input at the research stage, and your comments on the draft that was sent for external peer review were particularly useful to us when we were making the final editorial changes*” \( **E 8,** Dr Grant Hill\-Cathorne 11 October 2018\) This directly led to knowledge exchange activities including the American Geophysical Union  [requesting a blog about how Arctic geopolitics informs policymaking](https://blogs.agu.org/onthejob/2019/03/07/putting-arctic-geopolitics-to-work/). This was the first time the AGU published a piece on polar geopolitics. He also contributes to POST and RUSI polar events and spoke at the House of Commons Antarctic Parliamentarians Conference \(2019, c. 200 in attendance\). 

1.  <ins> **Informing Public Understanding of the Polar Regions**</ins> 

 Dodds’ research conducted on the Arctic and Antarctic has contributed to the reformation of UK policy conversations about polar geopolitics \(R1, R2, R6\). Historically, public discourse on the polar regions have favoured exploration, heritage and science. The underpinning research has informed an explicitly geopolitical hue, showing that scrambles for knowledge, influence and strategic advantage matter. 

 <ins>Working with specialist polar science agencies</ins> 

 Research conducted by Dodds on Antarctic geopolitics and governance informs how the UK’s main public polar stakeholder, BAS, makes sense of its strategic role. In 2015, the website of BAS re\-wrote its description of the Antarctic Treaty to  [account for geopolitical factors](https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/antarctica/the-antarctic-treaty/the-antarctic-treaty-explained/). Dodds’ research expertise paved the way to formal recognition that the social sciences have an important role in complementing natural sciences as sources of advice to UK polar policy, in 2019 Dodds became first social scientist to be appointed an Honorary Fellow of BAS in recognition of this impactful work. \[text removed for publication\]  \( **E 5**, \[text removed for publication\] 11th April 2019\). 

 <ins>Informing Exhibitions, Museum Curators and Public Audiences</ins> 

 Dodds’ research on polar geopolitics has informed major exhibitions, inspired curators and visitors.  He served as expert adviser to the British Library *Lines in the Ice exhibition* \(2014\), and to the Polar Worlds gallery of the Royal Museums Greenwich \(2018\). Dodds’ expertise was cited as major factors in their planning and curation; both exhibitions and the accompanying books *Lines in the Ice* \(British Library Publishing 2016\) used Dodds’ research findings on the contested geopolitics of the Arctic and Antarctic. The British Library’s exhibition received approximately 114,000 visitors– the second highest British Library exhibition attendance figure: “ *Using Klaus’s support and expertise the exhibition communicated ideas about the complex history and modern geography of the Arctic to visitors*”. \( **E 3,** Philip Hatfield 31<sup>st</sup> January 2017\). \[text removed for publication\] of the Polar Worlds gallery at the Royal Museums Greenwich commented: \[text removed for publication\] \( **E 4,** \[text removed for publication\] 23 November 2018\). 

 In addition to these major exhibitions, Dodds regularly advises galleries, libraries, learned societies and museums about polar geopolitics, including speaking at public events at the National History Museum, the Science Museum, Royal Institution, Dulwich Picture Gallery, RGS, British Library, British Science Association, and National Maritime Museum. Between August 2013 and December 2020, he delivered 18 public lectures, chaired three British Library panel discussion, with average audiences of 250 to 300 people. The British Library staff \(including Dr Hatfield and Jon Fawcett, Head of Events\) sent emails to Dodds confirming very positive feedback from the audiences. 

 <ins>Working with Media</ins> 

 Regular media writing and public broadcasting has enabled Dodds’ research on polar geopolitics to reach wider audiences. On 4<sup>th</sup> February 2015, the *Washington Post* \(circulation c. 250,000\) published a piece ‘What Antarctica teaches me about politics’ and referenced an output of Dodds as recommendation: “ *In preparation for this trip. I read Klaus Dodds’s primer “* [*Antarctica: A Very Short Introduction”*](http://www.amazon.com/Antarctic-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions-ebook/dp/B00BP6U5EO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423048290&sr=1-1&keywords=Klaus+Dodds%E2%80%99+Antarctica%3A+A+Short+Introduction). In January 2019, Dodds appeared on BBC World Service’s ‘The Forum on North Pole’ \(aired 29 January, 41 minutes, 1.3 million total listeners for BBC World Service per week\). On 21 August 2019 *Financial Times* referenced Dodds three times on a story about Trump and Greenland \( *Financial Times*, circulation c. 105,000\). Dodds was referenced four times for a BBC Future piece on ‘The rush to claim an undersea mountain range’ \(BBC Future 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2020, BBC describes ‘BBC Future’ as having one million fans on Facebook\). 

 Between 2014 and 2020, Dodds has written a monthly column for the *Geographical Magazine*. As the \[text removed for publication\] noted \[text removed for publication\] \( **E 10,** \[text removed for publication\] 13<sup>th</sup> November 2019\). He contributed to multiple podcasts such as Polar Geopolitics \(2019\), UK Antarctic Heritage Trust \(2020\) and John Hopkins Podcast on Foreign Affairs \(2020\). His 2019 invited google talk on geopolitics was watched over 25,000 times. 

1.  <ins> **Informing Education on the Polar Regions**</ins> 

 Dodds was appointed to the A Level Advisory Content Board \(ALCAB\) in 2014 to advise on polar geopolitics and the governance of the global commons \(which includes the oceans\). His research changed the A Level Geography syllabus from 2016 by including developing new teaching materials for the global commons. In response to that change, he produced a briefing note for the Royal Geographical Society\-IBG which won a highly Commended award from the Geographical Association in 2016. 

 The education company AQA, which has about 45% of all entries for A level \(approximately 12,000 candidates in 2020\) recommends that briefing in their Global Systems and Global Governance  [scheme of work](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/geography/specifications/AQA-7037-SP-2016.PDF). Multiple invitations to lectures and publishing in the teaching\-led journals, such as *Teaching* G *eography* \(distribution of 2,600 schools/colleges\) and *Geography Review* \(c. 10,000 subscribers\) gives further evidence of beneficiaries. These lectures and papers have specifically targeted teachers worried about developing case studies for this compulsory element of the A Level curriculum. Since 2015, 14 lectures to CPD events organized by the Prince’s Teaching Institute and GA\-sponsored events have been delivered, with audiences ranging from 20 to 100 teachers. The author was asked to participate in CPD days for the Geographical Association \(2014 to 2020, group sizes from 15 to 40\). 

 His *Geopolitics: A Very Short Introduction* \(three editions\) has sold approximately 35,000 copies and translated into 10 languages. It is read by both university and school students and public readerships around the world.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our impact falls into three mutually reinforcing categories. Since 2014 our research has: 

 1. Enhanced public understanding of the Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site \(WHS\), through the development of permanent and temporary displays at 5 major museums \(combined annual visitor figures over 600,000 per annum\) and a free online course ‘Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier’ developed with FutureLearn \(reaching 64,563 registered users in 170 countries\). 

 2.  Provided data feeding directly into decisions about the management of Scheduled Ancient Monuments and to inform land management discussions with local landowners based on our analysis of the WHS at 10 sites through non\-intrusive surveys, excavation, standing building survey and conservation/repair. 

 3. Democratised heritage practice by running training specifically for local communities, equipping them to contribute to WHS conservation. This work has included the National Lottery Heritage Fund ‘Hadrian’s Wall Community Archaeology Project’ \(WallCAP\) and its 270 registered volunteers, at least 37 of whom were first engaged through our FutureLearn course. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research conducted by the Newcastle team has resulted in a thorough re\-evaluation of the archaeology and history of Hadrian’s Wall and the communities who have lived in its shadow. The work has led to new knowledge of the Wall zone’s buildings, structures and landscapes, but also of the associated material culture and social practices. 

  

 Allason\-Jones’ pioneering research, for example, explored the way that small finds and epigraphy could offer fresh insights into the lives of frontier communities. Her work pioneered an informed archaeological approach to the study of women’s lives in an area previously dominated by male narratives and debates about soldiers and strategies \( **PUB1**; Grant 6\). Haynes, whose work has sought to refocus research on life in communities created directly and indirectly through the Roman state, drove forward new work on ethnicity and identity amongst those who occupied the Wall zone. This was undertaken through studies of groups associated with units that garrisoned the Wall \( **PUB2**\) and through work on personal adornment in the frontier zone. In the latter case, this involved looking at the way that glass, created as a raw material far from the frontier, was refashioned into objects of adornment in the frontier zone \(Grant 4\). Collins initiated research into the longer history of the Wall, employing the close study of small finds alongside a reappraisal of structural archaeology to enrich understanding of those periods of Wall history that had consistently been neglected or indeed ignored, notably the late 3rd\-5th centuries AD and after \( **PUB3**; **PUB4**\). Much of this work was brought together in the ‘Summary of Excavation and Research’ published in 2019 \( **PUB5**\). 

 The Newcastle team has undertaken research in several ways, including substantial excavations in extra\-mural areas, large\-area geophysical surveys of entire settlements, UAV surveys, overarching surveys of stone sourcing and monument building and digital 3D\-capture. Crucially, all these research approaches have been tied to programmes that train and engage volunteers from outside the University sector. Large\-scale excavations at Maryport directed by Haynes have revolutionised understandings of cult areas beyond the fort walls \( **PUB6**; Grant 1\). At Beckfoot and Corbridge \( **PUB5**; Grant 3\), extensive geophysical and UAV \(drone\) survey directed by Haynes \(Grant 3\), has extensively characterised the scale and organisation of two major settlement areas revealing a range of extra\-mural spaces and cemeteries. On\-going research by Collins as part of WallCAP \(Grant 2; Grant 5\) has conducted survey and excavation at 10 sites to date. Research and fieldwork by WallCAP is also directly linked to physical improvement of the fabric and condition of the monument, as well as improved knowledge of historic risks to the WHS.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research impact falls into three mutually reinforcing categories and serves several overlapping groups of beneficiaries. 

 *1. Building public understanding of the Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site \(WHS\)* 

 Most visitors who encounter the WHS do so via one or more of the museum displays located at sites along the length of the Wall. Since 2014 5 museums have incorporated our research into redesign of displays which receive over 600,000 visits a year. At Corbridge Roman Town our field survey results were incorporated into the new museum display, conveying information that the Curator described as ‘fundamental to our interpretative approach in the museum and … on site’, while also noting that our laser scanning work was ‘essential’ for production of a replica ‘vital in communicating ‘colour’ and vibrancy of the Roman period to our museum visitors’ \( **IMP1**; **PUB5**\). Our work has also informed new exhibitions at Vindolanda \(small finds\) \( **IMP2**; **PUB3**; **PUB4**\) and at Birdoswald, where our analysis of data excavated in a joint project with English Heritage provided what the curator terms a ‘key part’ of the new display \( **IMP1**; **PUB1**; **PUB5**\). The Chairman of the Senhouse Museum Trust observes that our excavations at Maryport ‘provided the Museum with data to underpin the redisplay of our collection that will be crucial to our success as an institution in the post\-Covid world’ \( **IMP3**; **PUB6**\). The Great North Museum in Newcastle \(managed by the University\) is the gateway for the WHS and is integral to our engagement strategy. It provides a key venue for temporary exhibitions based on our research, such as the GlobalGlass project’s ‘Frontier Fashion: Glass Bangles of the Roman North’ \(5,045 visitors, October 2017 – January 2018\). By working in partnership with the museum team our research has reached wider audiences through talks, blogs and our FutureLearn course, emphasising especially our work on epigraphic material and how material culture was used in negotiating frontier identities \( **PUB2**; **PUB5**\). 

 Our free massive open online course \(MOOC\) ‘Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier’ ran in partnership with FutureLearn from September 2014\-July 2020. Based on our research, the course introduces the complexity of the Wall communities in Antiquity \( **PUB1**; **PUB2**\), the dynamic nature of the Wall’s development \( **PUB3**\), and the methodologies, from finds research \( **PUB4**\) to excavation \( **PUB6**\) and landscape survey \( **PUB5**\), that continue to transform our understanding of the WHS. The MOOC culminates in a discussion on the challenges of managing the WHS designed to encourage participants continue to interact with the Wall, its study and management. This 6\-week course attracted 64,563 registered users from 170 countries \(approximately 60% of participants were from the UK, 20% from other EU countries, 18% from North America\). Detailed analysis of participant questionnaires indicates 95% satisfaction with the course. Over 98% of active learner participants believed that they learned something new and 85\-95% had shared their learning with others. A survey of participants \(n=3823\) revealed that after the course around 70% pursued further interest in Hadrian’s Wall: some were inspired to take degree programmes whereas a majority visited museums or pursued further reading \(80%\). 35% reported purchasing these reading materials, 30% of whom spent more than GBP30 \( **IMP4**, 6.5.2\). Most participants reported that the course inspired them to visit Hadrian’s Wall itself \(60%\); testimonies provide indirect evidence of the regional financial benefit stimulated by the MOOC \- ‘So, after the FutureLearn course I have spent money buying books, employed local travel agents, some b&b’s and restaurants and found Britain as a travel destination again ... Also our local adult education center thought about organizing a hiking trip there’ \( **IMP5**\). 

 *2. Provided data which feeds directly into Scheduling decisions and land management discussions with local landowners* 

 Our field research has informed strategies for management of 10 sites, 6 of which \(\*\) were listed on Historic England’s \(HE\) ‘Heritage At Risk’ register in 2014: Maryport; \*Beckfoot; \*Rock of Gelt; Cam Beck; Birdoswald; \*Walltown Crags; \*Mucklebank turret; \*Steel Rigg; Cats Stairs; and \*Corbridge. 

 Our UAV \(drone\) and geophysics surveys, together with building fabric analyses, have provided high\-resolution mapping and structural analysis pertaining to both the study of the ancient use of the Wall and to contemporary management and conservation.  Methods were developed in conjunction with the County Archaeologists and Inspectors of Ancient Monuments responsible for the care of the WHS. For example, experimental work undertaken as part of the ‘Cultural Heritage Through Time’ \(CHT2\) project developed an approach which integrated geophysics and digital photogrammetry to monitor the impact of farming practices at Scheduled sites. According to Historic England our collaborative research focussed on Beckfoot, Birdoswald and Corbridge has ’…greatly increased understanding of the extent and complexity of these sites… feeding into discussions about their future management and revisions to their legal protection through scheduling’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 Our Structure\-from\-Motion photogrammetry survey of the Written Rock of Gelt preserved\-by\-record exceptionally important Roman graffiti that is naturally eroding; the site was removed from Historic England’s ‘Heritage At Risk’ register following successful conclusion of the project \( **IMP6**\). The results of the research reached diverse audiences through the mainstream press \(including all UK broadsheets, many EU papers and US outlets including CNN\), and popular media \(e.g. 59,000 likes on ‘Lad’s Bible’ website\). Complementing this, WallCAP has undertaken capital conservation of approximately 660m<sup>2</sup> of degrading or collapsed fabric of the Wall in 2020 at Walltown Crags, Mucklebank turret, Steel Rigg and the Cats Stairs, resulting in applications for 3 of the sites to be removed from the HE ‘Heritage At Risk’ register. 

 *3. Democratising Heritage Practice* 

 The development and delivery of specialised training designed specifically for members of the public has been at the heart of our strategy for research impact. Training activities are directly informed by our research and include participation in our projects. For example, at Maryport 70 members of the public were trained in archaeological excavation techniques between 2011\-15. We subsequently trained 3 of these participants to provide ongoing monitoring of coastal erosion at the nearby Roman cemetery of Beckfoot, where irregular weather and erosion events require year\-round ‘patrolling’ which can only be undertaken by local volunteers. The Chair of the Senhouse Museum Trust \(which has collection responsibility for Beckfoot\) notes that the University’s work ‘led to the recording of the Beckfoot material being put on a more regular and sustainable footing – to the great benefit of the archaeological resource’ \( **IMP3**\). 

 The WallCAP project organised events throughout 2019 and 2020 for members of the public, professional audiences and its 270 registered volunteers. 111 events were attended by 1,564 individuals \(not limited to registered volunteers\), with 73 events coordinated for volunteers resulting in 833 engagements \( **IMP7**\). For example, at Corbridge 71 volunteers participated in a training excavation in 2019 that built on the knowledge many had gained through the Hadrian’s Wall MOOC. The skills and knowledge which volunteers developed by participating in these research\-led events is summarised in the table below. 

| **Theme** | **Skills Learned** | **Testimonial \(participant quote\)** \( **IMP7**, 16\-18\) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Archaeological fieldwork / training**  Attendees: 416 | Geophysical survey; topographic survey; archaeological excavation; standing buildings survey;  archaeological illustration; IT skills; photography | “I enjoyed finding out about LIDAR. I learned how to excavate a site methodically and appreciate how much work goes into organising such an event.”  “\[I learned\] how to decide whether a particular site should be investigated and how to determine exactly where to focus and the best method to carry out further work \- even knowing that nothing is there is useful\!”  “Discovery of local previously unknown \(by me\) interesting sites to visit and share with family...who are all of course as interested as I am.” |
| **Theme** | **Skills Learned** | **Testimonial \(participant quote\)** \( **IMP7**, 16\-18\) |
| **Geological fieldwork / training**  Attendees: 323 | Rock identification; geological formation;  quarrying techniques;  masonry techniques | “Signed up to a geology training course that I wouldn't have known about if it wasn't for WallCAP.”  “Learning about the different types of stone, how quarried etc. Adding to my overall picture of Roman and other life on the Wall.” |
| **Interpretation and management**  Attendees: 722 | Source assessment; critical reasoning; outcome\-based communication; audience interests and bias; professional practice | “I was surprised to learn all the different processes involved in planned a new gallery at the Roman Carlisle event. We analysed the current gallery, discussed at length what we liked and also what we thought didn't work. Naturally none of us agreed, so a fascinating discussion followed. It was quite an insight to hear other people's views on the gallery.” |
| **Well\-being and inclusion**  Attendees: 179 | Mindfulness; appreciation of place; position of heritage in communities | “It’s had a massive impact, I would have gone into real deep depression without it.”  “I work full time so struggle to get along to digs and other archaeological events and activities. As such the GIS project offered flexibility, in particular given home working due to Covid19, to undertake elements of research for the project.”  “I appreciated the opportunity to take part in an indoor activity as I sometimes worry my fitness may let me down during outdoor sessions.” |

 Furthermore, WallCAP’s digital training and dissemination strategy has enhanced non\-local and international participation. By 31 December 2020, @Wall\_CAP \(Twitter\) had 1,544 followers, and its posts resulted in 626,253 impressions \( **IMP7**, 19\-20\). 

 WallCAP has brought together 9 stakeholder organisations \(including Historic England, English Heritage, the National Trust and the local planning authorities\) with 5 community groups and 270 volunteers through these activities. It has thereby created an enduring community of local people who are actively helping to safeguard the WHS from deterioration through participation in conservation activities \( **IMP6**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Heathershaw et al.’s research has informed and shaped the global response to transnational repression, especially but not exclusively, with regard to Central Asian political exiles. The team’s research provided the first analysis of the scale, types and stages of extra\-territorial security by Central Asian states and is used by legislatures and courts in Europe and North America and by major human rights organizations. These organisations have noted that the team’s database ‘saves lives’, informs programming and advocacy, as well as supporting the prevention of the misuse of cross\-border criminal justice mechanisms. Freedom House are now using Exeter’s methodology as a model for a new global database. 

 In addition, international policy development and discourse has been influenced by the team’s research. The US Congress developed the Transnational Repression Accountability and Prevention Act with a ‘significant contribution’ from Heathershaw et al.’s research. Invited evidence to the UK Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee and engagement with the Parliamentary Human Rights Group led to a new model Code of Conduct to, among other things, protect academic exiles from transnational repression. Finally, the work of Heathershaw et al has informed policy discourse in fora attended by Central Asian, EU member state and US delegates. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Heathershaw et al.’s research provides the first\-ever systematic analysis of Central Asian political exiles and the first cross\-national accessible public database of transnational repression from any region of the world. Existing research on the extra\-territorial dimension of ‘regime security’ and the phenomenon of political exiles had mainly focussed on the Middle East and North Africa and on how this coercion impacts on the ability of opposition movements to organise politically.  However, Central Asia – defined as the five post\-Soviet Central Asian republics – remains a poorly understood region. Before our research, there was no systematic evidence, qualitative or quantitative, of extra\-territorial measures by Central Asian regimes against their exiles. 

 Typically denoted as ‘transnational repression’, the team define these acts as the extra\-territorial authoritarian practices to control political space beyond the borders of the state \(3.3, 3.4\). Heathershaw et al have identified their causal processes across three stages and types of practice from online harassment to assassination of exiles, from high\-profile opposition leaders to low\-profile academics \(3.2\). In particular, the team have shown that transnational networks of state agencies and their formal and informal partners work together to move across these three distinct stages of inclining severity \(3.2\). Furthermore, the team have published cases demonstrating the conditions under which escalation to ‘stage 3’ occurs and provided evidence of these practices leading to the closure of spaces of refuge. Heathershaw et al have also shown that in many cases international criminal justice mechanisms, including regional agreements between former Soviet states and the abuse of the international policing service INTERPOL \(R2, R3\), were instrumental in the escalation of extra\-territorial security measures against an exile \(3.1\). 

 Heatherhsaw et al.’s research has systematically collated and analysed the publicly documented cases of over 250 political exiles from 40 different Central Asian opposition groups from five states. The CAPE database is published biennially first in November 2016, with the most\-recent third edition in 2020 \[3.5\]. Analytics have been improved each time with new fields related to gender\-based violence, the misuse of INTERPOL \(R2, R3\), and assassination. Geo\-spatial mapping of cases has been added. This has enabled the team to chart patterns of escalation with respect to certain countries and opposition groups, particularly from Uzbekistan \(3.1, 3.2\) and Tajikistan \(3.2\). 

 The research was undertaken by members of the Exeter Central Asian Studies research group, a research network begun by Heathershaw in 2010 which has grown to be one of the leading groups for the study of Central Asia in Europe. The team began conducting research in this area in 2013 as part of an ESRC\-funded project on conflict management \(ES/J013056/1\), which included the NGO Saferworld as a non\-academic co\-investigator, and Lemon’s doctoral studentship \(see below, 2013\-16, 1216025\) under the supervision of Heathershaw. The team subsequently received specific funding to work on political exiles from the Open Society Foundation \(OR2017\-34773\) and an ESRC IAA NGO Data award. Following this funded research, in 2019 the team began to work on a pro bono basis on Freedom House’s funded ‘global database’ project, which is inspired by CAPE. 

 The CAPE project is collaborative with colleagues at Columbia University of New York and a total of 11 temporary research assistants. The core team comprises three senior scholars \(Heathershaw and Lewis at Exeter and Cooley at Columbia\) and three early\-career scholars \(Owen, Lemon and Furstenberg\) all of whom were PhD students and/or postdoctoral fellows with Heathershaw. In particular, Lemon took on a postdoctoral fellowships at Columbia University \(2016\-18\) and the Daniel Morgan Graduate School \(2018\-20\) in the United States while continuing to work on the project.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since 2016 when the team made the CAPE database open, searchable and user\-friendly, its impact on the global response to Central Asian political exiles has emerged rapidly. The publication \[3.5\] prompted significant media coverage and led to invitations to brief policy makers and collaborate with human rights organizations. As a result of key relationships with these organizations, beneficiaries now routinely use the team’s work to develop policy and as evidence for their own projects and analysis. It is widely used by human rights and legal practitioners with 5,345 unique users and 76,819 unique hits over the period from May\-November 2018 when the high\-profile second edition was released. This impact has had special significance for four specific areas and audiences. The project’s impact on human rights organisations, asylum seekers, as well as legislative bodies and policy makers in the US and UK has extended beyond Central Asia to shape the global response. 

 **4.1.**  **Evidence in the courts** **to grant asylum and save lives** 

 Evidence from the database has been used to support the awarding of asylum, to prevent extradition, and to provide authoritative evidence about exiles which are subject to intimidation, harassment and violence. In particular, 18 Central Asian exiles residing in Russia, Greece, Lithuania, Cyprus, Poland, Sweden, Germany \(x3\), Turkey, Canada, and the United States \(x4\) have called upon Heathershaw et al to **provide expert witness testimony** or official letters of support to demonstrate a pattern of state repression and how this has continued outside of the country. For example, a testimonial letter from the Georgetown Law Clinic \(USA\) notes that ‘ *the wealth of knowledge and cases maintained by the \[CAPE\] project’* which *is ‘not available from general country conditions* *reports*’ was instrumental in the successful award of asylum \[5.1\]. The team have often collaborated with global human rights NGOs.  Letters from Amnesty International \(AI\) and Human Rights Watch \(HRW\) provide testimony of this influence. AI noted *‘several cases where individuals in fear of deportation have used reports produced by the CAPE project to defend themselves’* \[5.2\] and HRW claims that **the database** **has **‘saved lives’** \[5.3\]. 

 **4.2.** **Co\-produced research and joint advocacy activities with leading NGOs** 

 In 2016, Heathershaw et al formed a group of non\-academic advisors, including AI, Fair Trials International, Foreign Policy Centre \(FPC\) and a host of human rights groups in Russia and Central Asia. The team’s research provided, for the first time, the **systematic evidence they needed to demonstrate the targeting of exiles** in their human rights reporting. AI remarks that the CAPE database provides them with *‘a unique analytical tool to study patterns of extraterritorial repression’* which they use ‘ *for advocacy with governments and international governmental organizations’* \[5.2\]. Fair Trials notes that it aids their work *‘to prevent the misuse of cross\-border criminal justice mechanisms’ and ‘plays a very helpful role in supporting our work on the reform of INTERPOL’* \[5.4\] *\(see below\)*. FPC adds that the database enables *‘evidence\-based policy development’ and ‘is critical to our advocacy work in the region \[of Central Asia\]’* \[5.5\]. In 2019, the team began to work as a formal advisor to Freedom House on their transnational repression **‘global database’** project, which is inspired by and modelled on CAPE \[5.16\]. The team provided conceptual and methodological expertise, co\-authored their codebook and co\-edited a special report published by Freedom House in July 2020 \[5.6\]. They note that their work on transnational repression “ *would not have been possible with their \[Heathershaw et al\] foundational work, support and collaboration”.* 

 **4.3.** **Advice to parliaments, shaping a draft law in the US and code of conduct in the UK** 

 In the US, Heathershaw et al’s research has been used to shape and support legislation that was introduced to the **US Senate and House of Representatives** in September 2019. The Transnational Repression Accountability and Prevention Act \(TRAP\) seeks to prevent authoritarian regimes from using Interpol notices to have citizens detained by immigration authorities within the United States and requires the US Government to press for reforms within Interpol. First, CAPE research was used in the oral testimony of two panellists, from the Director for Special Research at Freedom House and Heathershaw’s co\-author from Columbia University in an oral hearing on the TRAP Act in the US Senate on September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2019 \[5.7\]. The committee’s co\-chairman, Senator Wicker, in his introduction to the session, noted that Heathershaw and Cooley “wrote the book on extraterritorial authoritarian practices” \[5.7\].  The Senior Policy Advisor to Senator Wicker, added that the research “ *contributed to the language in the TRAP Act that would require the U.S. State Department to document salient instances of transnational repression in the human rights report*” and continued to say that *“Prof. Heathershaw’s scholarship significantly **enriched the understanding of transnational repression among members of Congress** and their staff and contributed to concrete policy changes, most notably the documentation of transnational repression in the U.S. State Department’s Annual Human Rights Country reports”*  since 2019 \[5.8\]. 

 In the UK, the team have closely collaborated with the all\-party Parliamentary Human Rights Group \(PHRG\) especially with regard to the transnational repression of **academic exiles**. Co\-Chair of the PHRG notes that, *“Professor Heathershaw’s work \[…\] helped to inform the PHRG and other APPGs’ engagement with, and recommendations for, UK foreign policy officials and representatives of these countries.”* \[5.9\]. In June 2019, Heathershaw was invited to give **oral and written evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry** ‘Autocracies and UK foreign policy’ which was quoted in the November 2019 report with respect to the targeting of academic exiles in the UK \[5.10\].  This evidence was used in the report to support a series of recommendations for the Foreign Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) to develop a strategy on internationalisation and academic freedom, to which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab responded affirmatively \[5.10\]. In parallel, Heathershaw became **principal academic advisor** to the PHRG and a founding member of its new Academic Freedom and Internationalisation Working Group \(AFIWG\), a group formed to develop a UK\-wide ‘code of conduct’ on internationalisation and academic freedom including measures to protect academic exiles \[5.9\]. The Code of Conduct was referenced in a subsequent report by Universities UK and headlined on the **front page of** **The Times** on 12 October, 2020. 

 **4.4. Informed the policy of international agencies** **and foreign governments** 

 Heathershaw et al have informed the International Organization for Migration \(IOM\) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \(OSCE\). In January 2018, the IOM’s **flagship **World Migration Report included a text box on the team’s research and argument that large\-scale repression of diasporas may promote radicalization by a small minority of exiles. This citation was included to argue that safe conditions for legal migration and the right to refuge must be protected \[5.11\]. The team appear to have had particular effect at the OSCE and the policy of the US government in these fora. In December 2017, Heathershaw was invited to speak at a closed\-door meeting of the OSCE where he presented data from the CAPE project to around 40 senior officials from the organization. In September 2018, the team’s influence was demonstrated when they helped organise and participated in a meeting on Tajikistan’s transnational repression at the **OSCE’s annual human dimension** meeting \(HDIM\) in Warsaw.  There were more than 50 attendees, many of them official delegates from member states, including the Government of Tajikistan which spoke from the floor in response to the team’s evidence and that of their colleagues.  However, in the main session during the afternoon, the representative of the US government delegation, which had attended the team’s event, noted that ‘Tajikistan uses counter\-extremism to target its opposition’ \[5.12\]. This position was consistent with the evidence presented by the team to the USG on three occasions in the preceding 9 months. The event demonstrated how the international discourse on transnational repression has changed in recent years, partly due to the team’s research on Central Asia.
