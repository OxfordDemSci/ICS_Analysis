###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This research empowered communities in the poorest parts of the world to engage actively with Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\) that provide lifesaving aid. It demonstrated that local languages are crucial for NGOs to build strong relationships with communities and ensure successful delivery of development projects. Yet, remarkably, NGOs and government donors have historically regarded translation and interpretation as a low priority. NGOs serving hundreds of thousands of people in Malawi and Peru adopted the recommendations, which has led to improved community engagement with NGO projects and more positive practical outcomes for such work. The research has been promoted as a vital contribution to UK government aid policy through Parliament and the UK’s national academies.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Dr Crack specialises in the study of NGOs in international development work. She particularly focuses on NGO accountability, which is commonly recognised to include the responsibility of NGOs to be accountable to communities that receive their aid. Crack has built a research profile over the last decade through publications that draw on numerous in\-depth interviews with key practitioner informants to analyse the challenges for NGOs in meeting their accountability commitments. 

 Development NGO policies tend to claim that they seek to be accountable by: a\) ensuring that development projects are designed according to the preferences of communities; b\) empowering communities to participate in decisions about project delivery to promote a sense of ownership; and c\) inviting communities to provide feedback about projects. 

 Crack’s research has consistently identified systematic failures in practice in meeting these goals \(R1\-R3\), with failures in language\-based understanding at the core of many problems. While language is essential to communicative processes, the actual language policies and practices of NGOs have scarcely been studied, despite the fact that NGOs operate in territories of high linguistic and cultural diversity. The present research is the first to have explored how such policies and their consequences affect the capacity of NGOs to be accountable to communities. 

 To undertake this study, Crack co\-designed a three\-year AHRC\-funded research project \(G1\) with Professor Hilary Footitt \(Reading, PI\), Dr Wine Tesseur \(Research Assistant\) and the NGO INTRAC. The project involved extensive archival research and dozens of interviews with NGO workers, donor officials and translators/interpreters in the UK, Malawi, Kyrgyzstan and Peru. 

 The project found that NGO senior management often regard translation/interpretation as a marginal issue, and that the same is true for the UK’s Department for International Development \(DFID\), which is one of the largest donors to NGOs \(R4\). This failure to recognise the importance of language in development work leads to serious and significant consequences. 

 The research demonstrated a consistent view amongst NGO fieldworkers based in developing countries that effective local language communication is vital in establishing relationships of trust and respect with communities. Fieldworkers report frustration with the lack of clear guidance from donors and NGO management about how to translate development concepts, leaving them to invent ad hoc solutions that may not convey the NGO message effectively. The concern that translation difficulties marginalise the very people that are supposed to benefit from NGO work is widespread amongst such frontline staff, as is the perception and experience that this can lead to project failure. 

 In deriving policy\-oriented conclusions from this empirical study, the research team argued that NGOs cannot be accountable to communities unless they address these issues \(R5\). They produced a report written for policy\-makers and practitioners \( *Respecting Communities*\), which included several evidence\-based recommendations \(R6\). 

 Recommendations for donors included: 

1.  Invite NGOs to include translation/interpretation costs in their budget. 

1.  Ask organisations to state their language and cultural policies in their applications and value NGOs that have these policies. 

1.  Ensure that monitoring and evaluation frameworks encourage NGOs to reflect on how language issues affect project outcomes. 

 Recommendations for NGOs included: 

1.  Include costs for translation/interpretation in the budget. 

1.  Translate materials into local languages so communities can participate in projects in an informed way. 

1.  Encourage staff to acquire additional language skills. 

1.  Incorporate language considerations in project design.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 NGOs in Malawi, Peru and beyond, serving hundreds of thousands of people, adopted the project’s recommendations. The results are improved quality of data, increased levels of community understanding, and a greater sense of local empowerment. The project’s recommendations are included in high\-profile parliamentary and scholarly reports on language strategy targeted at the UK government. Government and DFID representatives have met with the research team to identify how the recommendations can reshape policy. 

 **Impact of NGO recommendations** 

 Crack worked directly with NGOs through the research process and after the development of the findings, sharing conclusions in accessible forms and advising on the development of the project recommendations into concrete changes in policy and practice. Following the publication of the final project report \(R6\) she revisited her Malawian research participants in person to provide organisation\-specific advice on implementation. Crack continues to develop these relationships with a view to continuing downstream impact, and has recently begun a formal consultancy role with Tearfund, one of the UK’s leading development and relief NGOs, advising on the creation of a new translation policy. While this will deliver future benefits, a range of concrete impacts have already been achieved: 

 *Recommendations D&E: Funding language costs and translating materials* 

 Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and highly dependent on foreign aid. NGOs play an essential role in delivering basic services. One of the organisations that Crack worked with is the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, which recently received over USD500,000 for human rights projects in Malawi. The NGO shared the *Respecting Communities* report with its donors, who responded by allocating funding for language costs. The NGO then translated its materials, and reported a remarkable improvement in community empowerment as a result: *‘Beneficiaries are able to grasp the concepts, knowledge and develop the skills required for development at grassroots level…For instance, the people in Chitipa District specifically in Nthalire requested for Standard Operating Procedures for Proactive Disclosure of Information in Public Health Services to be translated into their local language.’* \(S1\) \(August 2019\). The participant states that the research has led to an enhanced sense of confidence and ownership among communities over the development process, as well as a change of mind\-set among staff working for the NGO as they *‘are keen to learn the languages spoken and understand the culture of the people’*. 

 Another organisation that worked with Crack is Trocaire, an international NGO that serves 181,000 Malawians. Crack’s main interlocutor, \[text removed for publication\], was able to draw on the findings of the research in order to negotiate internally for funding to translate a training manual: *‘Our volunteers have expressed that the translated manuals are very useful and are contributing to better programme results because they are able to facilitate gender equality discussions in an informed way … which has strengthened the case of allocating funding for translation of materials for programming in our organisation’* \(S2\). The organisation, which spans 17 countries, is now translating material into local languages in the other territories in which they work, referring to Malawi as an example of international best practice \(August 2019\). 

 *Recommendation F: Language acquisition* 

 Kusi Warma is a Peruvian NGO delivering health and education projects to over 12,000 children. Because of this research, they introduced a language policy to their operations \(S3\) \(June 2018\). Notably, as part of this, they paid for their fieldworkers to study Quechua. Kusi Warma now reports: *‘Our direct work in the communities, continually and respectfully of their local culture, speaking their language \(quechua\-speakers at the Andes\), establishes trust bonds with families, that contributes to the improvement of practices for the good growth and development of children’*. \(S4\). 

 *Recommendation G: Incorporating language in project design* 

 Crack worked with the Malawi Sexual and Reproductive Rights Alliance that includes six nationwide NGOs. Because of the research, they have translated advocacy messages, focus group discussion guides and questionnaires into Chichewa. This has *‘helped us to start getting data that makes a lot of sense and meaning from our project beneficiaries…The research has also helped us to reach our advocacy targeted audience’* because the translations have significantly enhanced local understanding of the NGO’s messages \(S5\) \(August 2019\). They now plan to translate these materials in the minority languages of Sena and Yao. 

 **Impact of donor recommendations** 

 In 2015, the UK enshrined in law the commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on development aid. A significant amount of aid is channelled through NGOs. The research fed into a long\-running and high\-profile political debate on aid effectiveness, and in particular, the ability of NGOs to deliver inclusive development. 

 In May 2018, Crack and Footitt presented their research findings to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Modern Languages, at the invitation of its co\-chair, Baroness Coussins. The donor recommendations emerging from the research were incorporated into the ‘Government’ pillar of the APPG’s National Recovery Programme for Languages published in March 2019. This document, officially endorsed by the British Council and the British Chambers of Commerce, called upon *‘Government, civil society and all stakeholders to act now to reverse this national crisis \[in the UK’s languages capability\]’*. \(S6\) 

 The APPG pressed for a governmental response on our report by tabling a written question in Parliament \(S7\). As a result, the research team met with the Minister for International Development, Lord Bates, to identify how our recommendations could inform policy review \(December 2018\). \[Text removed for publication\] confirmed the following month that he had *‘shared this \[Respecting Communities report\] with colleagues who are updating our guidance on programme design’* \(S8\) \(January 2019\). The reach and significance of the research findings were also demonstrated in a joint report by the UK National Academies \(British Academy, Academy of Medical Sciences, Royal Academy of Engineering, and Royal Society\). This urged the government to adopt a national strategy for languages, citing the *Respecting Communities* report as evidence that this strategy could strengthen the UK’s work in international development \(S9\). DFID’s own staff publication, *The Programme Pulse,* also highlighted the contents of the report. \(S10\)

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Effective use of health data for research is crucial for innovations in health and wellbeing. There are significant gaps in the legal regimes and policy positions governing the use of identifiable patient data for research. Inconsistent interpretation creates complex and confusing barriers for researchers. Chico and Taylor’s research identified the gaps and contradictions in the legal and governance frameworks. Their work provided clarity on the legal position that has been directly relied on in drawing common policy lines and guidance nationally, internationally and in support of the research response to the COVID\-19 pandemic. This clarity has enabled a change in governance facilitating innovations in healthcare to patients in a way that is transparent and maximises public trust. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Chico and Taylor have both been seconded to the UK healthcare research regulator, the Health Research Authority \(HRA\), whilst also continuing to develop their research. This dual focus has allowed them to identify and respond to gaps in the regulatory and policy landscape that prevent innovative research. Addressing these gaps is key for the HRA to be able to facilitate health research and innovation in a way that maximises public trust. 

 Chico and Taylor’s research to understand, map and resolve gaps and inconsistencies in healthcare information governance comprises empirical, mixed methods and theoretical research. 

 Determining the conditions to fulfil the duty of confidentiality 

 The absence of a legal standard determining when a consent is sufficient to negate an action for breach of confidence can result in risk\-averse researchers avoiding beneficial research that requires the use of identifiable patient data. Chico and Taylor investigated the detailed and varied English jurisprudence on valid consent, misuse of health data and conditions to assess adequate consent that negates an action for breach of confidence. They argue the application of a clear legal principle of ‘real’ consent, coupled with an established standard for setting relevant information levels needed to achieve the ‘broad awareness’ required for this. They also provide greater clarity concerning the kind of information that is required to support a valid consent to the use of health data \[R1\]. 

 A reasonable expectation of privacy as an alternative legal basis for the disclosure of health data 

 The National Data Guardian \(NDG\) is the body that advises and challenges the health and care system to help ensure that citizens’ confidential information is safeguarded securely. It has recognised that developments in data\-driven technology and the adoption of machine learning in healthcare are putting stress on the traditional concepts for negating a breach of confidence in the use of health data for innovation. Chico and Taylor argued that conformity with a reasonable expectation of privacy could provide an alternative account for the lawful disclosure of confidential patient information for health innovations \[R2\], and that the role of the independent advisors \(HRA Confidentiality Advisory Group\) should contribute to these decisions so disclosure for the purposes of public health improvement is transparent and maintains public trust \[R3\]. 

 Empirical investigation of public attitudes on secondary uses of health data 

 The public is cautious about the use of confidential patient information outside the provision of care, especially when commercial organisations are involved. However, there was a lack of nuanced consideration of the multiple factors that might impinge on public acceptability of secondary uses of health data. To provide more granular evidence, Chico and Taylor conducted empirical investigation into what influences people’s attitudes towards sharing health data with commercial organisations, where there is both a public and a private benefit. A key finding of the work showed substantial shifts \(18%\-45%\) in the acceptability of sharing with a commercial organisation when people were exposed to further information about the public benefits of commercial use \[R4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Chico and Taylor’s research has provided evidence which has been directly relied on to inform legal and policy positions in national and international health information governance. 

 Impact on the policy and guidance for determining the conditions to fulfil the duty of confidentiality 

 NHS Digital \(NHSD\) is the national information and technology partner to the UK health and care system. It has a statutory duty to collect, analyse, publish, and disseminate national health and social care data and issue related guidance. NHSD had no reference point to determine whether a patient’s consent to share their health record was sufficient for NHSD to meet their obligations under common law. The NHSD Research Advisory Group worked with Taylor and Chico using their research \[R1\] in the guidance document Data Sharing Standard 7b – Duty of confidentiality. The NHSD guidance explicitly directs applicants to \[R1\] to help them determine when consent is considered sufficient by NHSD to modify the obligation of confidence and enable the use of confidential patient information **\[S1\].** 

 NHSD holds significant health and social care data sets. It also provides a reference point for all other NHS organisations on data protection and confidentiality. Thus, Sheffield research has affected all organisations comprising the health and social care system and anyone who is or will be an NHS patient.

 Eighth Caldicott principle \- reasonable expectations of privacy and a disclosure of health data 

 The Caldicott Principles are guidelines used across health and social care information governance to safeguard people’s data. The increasing use of data\-driven technology in health and social care requires access to significant amounts of confidential data. The legal bases for setting aside confidentially are limited, and new practice is stretching current legal bases beyond their authentic interpretation. As the common law cannot act to address this directly, the research **\[R2, R3\]** proposed the policy development of a reasonable expectation of privacy as a legal basis for modifying the obligation of confidence. According to the Head of the Office of the National Data Guardian “ *The most significant and longstanding impact from Vicky Chico and Mark Taylor’s work on the National Data Guardian \(NDG\) is on the development of a new Caldicott Principle*” **\[S2\]**. 

 In December 2020, the NDG published Caldicott \- Principle 8: Inform patients and service users about how their confidential information is used **\[S3\].** “ *Her \[Chico’s\] research on the common law duty of confidentiality and the concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy has allowed her to lead engagement with stakeholders to progress an agreed policy position*” \(Director of Policy and Partnerships, HRA **\[S4\]**\). Chico worked closely with the NDG on the development of the recognition of the importance of reasonable expectations where confidential health and social care data is used and shared. She “ *influenced the wording of the new \(eighth\) Caldicott Principle, recognising the importance of creating clear expectations, which formed part of a public consultation about revising, expanding and upholding the principles*” **\[S2\].** 

 All NHS organisations and local authorities must ensure that staff act in accordance with the Caldicott Principles. 

 Confidence of patient consent in health research 

 HRA Confidentiality Advisory Group \(CAG\) provides independent expert advice on the appropriate use of confidential patient information. All applications to use confidential patient information where consent is impossible or impractical in research must apply to this group. Applications are approved based on whether the study is potentially in the public interest. Taylor, as CAG Chair \(2012\-2017\), used R1 when writing the 2017 paper which sets out CAG’s understanding of the public interest **\[S5\].** 

 In response to the COVID\-19 pandemic the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care issued notices that require health and care organisations to share confidential patient information for the purpose of responding to the pandemic. Chico was asked to work with the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) and the NHS to enable healthcare researchers to access data under this notice. Alongside NHSX colleagues, Chico wrote step\-by\-step guidance to accessing data on COVID\-19 for research purposes. *“This guidance was published promptly and continues to be supportive to applicants so that they have access to data to support the pandemic”,* Head of Stakeholder Engagement NHSX **\[S6\].** Up to 31 December 2020, CAG had approved 203 applications involving research in response to COVID\-19, utilising the notice and CAG’s understanding of public interest **\[S7\]**. 

 Impact on the underpinning public trust in policy on secondary uses of health data 

 Chico and Taylor’s research into the public’s views on sharing patient data with third parties including commercial organisations **\[R4\]** has informed policy development and practice across health and social care organisations and the technology sector regarding uses of health data for research. 

 It has shaped CAG’s advice to NHSD on sharing anonymised data outside of the NHS where there is a public benefit but consent is not possible. “ *These principles have been applied throughout the CAG advice and continue to underpin CAG considerations when advising on non\-consented developing and innovative uses of patient information*” \(Head of Confidentiality Advice Service, HRA \[ **S8**\]\). 

 The research has also had a significant impact on the NDG’s work to fulfil the statutory role to publish guidance about the processing of health and adult social care data in England. The NDG, Sciencewise, the Wellcome Trust and UKRI have used it as a key piece of evidence for the 2020 consultation on how the public understand the benefit of sharing health and social care data for research **\[S9\]**. 

 Public attitudes on secondary uses of health data is a barrier to medical innovation globally.  As the specialist adviser to the OECD Advisory Expert Groups for health and the digital economy recommendations, Taylor “ *helped steer the Group towards a draft Recommendation that treats making personal health information available to serve the public interest and the protection of privacy as twin aims that can be progressed together rather than traded off against each other*"", Group Member and Deputy Commissioner, ICO, UK **\[S10\]**. The recommendation was adopted by the OECD Council in 2016 to enable more countries to benefit from research uses of data in which there is a public interest **\[S11\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Solent University has impacted on the work of Kick It Out \(KIO\), football’s equality and inclusion organisation which works to address the high\-profile issue of discrimination in football. Specifically: 

-  Solent research underpinned Kick It Out’s “Inclusive Leadership in Football Award”, an educational programme which has trained over 70 football industry professionals since its launch in 2015. This is now a central component of Kick It Out’s work. 

-  Learners have been recruited from the Football Association, the Professional Footballers’ Association, the Premier League, Arsenal FC, Liverpool FC, Everton FC, Chelsea FC, Southampton FC, West Ham United FC and Bournemouth FC. The programme has been pivotal in persuading and supporting the game’s stakeholders to take equality seriously. 

-  The programme has changed attitudes in football.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research on discrimination in football has been conducted under Solent University’s internationally renowned football programme. Solent has a longstanding partnership with Kick It Out, an organisation established in 1993 by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Professional Footballers’ Association \(PFA\) to tackle racism and discrimination in football. The Kick It Out Equality and Diversity Awareness in Football Award \(later renamed the Inclusive Leadership in Football Award\), a training programme launched in 2015 for football professionals, was designed and developed in conjunction with Solent University, drawing on Solent research as follows. 

 Lawrence’s 2015 research \[3.1\] examines representations and audience interpretations of Christiano Ronaldo that reveal the complexities of white male identity formation and how white male identities can be interpreted through and in the context of football. Facilitated by a conception of contingent whiteness, Lawrence \(and co\-author Kevin Hylton – Leeds Beckett University\) argue that white British men’s interpretations of Ronaldo’s whiteness are inextricably linked to discourses of ‘race’, masculinities and football, all central themes explored in the Equality and Diversity Award. 

 Magrath’s 2017 research \[3.2\] speaks directly to the key themes explored in the Equality and Diversity Award. It examines the foundations of equality and diversity, the power of words/language, and the nature of football ‘banter’. This research is based on 60 semi\-structured interviews with Premier League academy footballers and shows four key findings: \(positive\) attitudes towards homosexuality; football language; football banter; and football friendships. 

 Elliott’s 2017 edited volume \[3.3\] explores issues relating to race, racism, gender and sexuality over 25 years of the development of football broadly.  These analyses include case\-studies of institutional racism as it relates to the lack of black coaches and managers in Premier League teams, and the changing cultural relationship between football and homophobia. These issues relate directly to the development of the Equality and Diversity Award. 

 Magrath’s 2018 research \[3.4\] recognises the importance of anti\-discrimination policy and the effect it has had in reducing overt forms of discrimination inside English football stadia – a topic that forms a key part of the Equality and Diversity Award. This article combines an institutional analysis with 53 semi\-structured interviews with football fans to judge the success of the FA’s anti\-homophobia policy. It shows that while some progress has been made, there are numerous shortcomings in attempts to implement change on the game. 

 Powis’ \(2018\) research explores another protected characteristic that is central to the Equality and Diversity Award \- disability. Across the five units of study, the Award explores a variety of disability\-related issues such as the impact of the 2010 Equality Act, the significance of terminology in both the workplace and in sport, and accessibility. This is underpinned by Powis’ examination of disabled peoples’ experiences of playing sport at both a recreational and elite level and the multiple attitudinal barriers to sporting participation \[3.5\]. In the context of disability football, his research also critiques the process of classification and explores the role of disability\-specific terminology in sport \[3.6\]. These issues are particularly relevant for football coaches and development officers – both disabled and non\-disabled – who work with disabled players and fans.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Discrimination is a longstanding, high\-profile issue in football. Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football was launched by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Professional Footballers’ Association \(PFA\) in 1993 to tackle the “rampant racism that was an inescapable feature of the football culture in England” \(Lord Herman Ousley, Chair, Kick It Out\). The organisation changed its name to Kick It Out in 1997, and since that time the focus of Kick It Out’s work has shifted from a focus on racism to tackling all forms of discrimination in football. 

 Despite great progress since Kick It Out was established, discrimination remains a problem in football. In 2018, Kick It Out received 520 complaints with racism up by 22% and homophobia by 9%. Also, in 2018, Premiership player Raheem Sterling spoke out about abuse that he had suffered. These headlines are the tip of the iceberg with problems running from the top right down to the grassroots of the game. 

 The Kick It Out Equality and Diversity Awareness in Football Award was launched in 2015 with the aim of “professionally developing and educating the future leaders of football … to develop critical thinking and leadership skills around issues of equality and diversity within a football context … to facilitate and enable further inclusive practice throughout the industry” \[5.1\]. It was renamed “Inclusive Leadership in Football Award” in 2020. 

 The Solent research described above is central to the development and design of the course curriculum, which includes themes that relate to definitions, foundations of equality and diversity, and the power of words. Solent University also delivers the course, which includes online distance learning, regular interaction with tutors, discussion with other participants via the course forum and contributions from ex\-professional footballers. Through the course, Solent research has had impact in the following ways. 

 **Impact on the work of Kick it Out** 

 Kick It Out asked Solent University to develop the Award to boost its education work. As part of their investment in the programme, Kick It Out appointed a full\-time Education Officer in 2014 to support the implementation of this and other education activities. 

 Since the course has been running, it has become central in Kick It Out’s education work: 

 “The Equality and Diversity Awareness in Football Award, run in partnership with Solent University, is one of the leading pathways for individuals in the football industry to develop a greater understanding of inclusion” Kick It Out \[5.2\]. 

 “Most of the graduates from the course have been young people whom we hope will be future leaders and influencers in the football industry, for example Peter Harding, a disability sports campaigner who now works for BBC Sport. There are lots of examples of good practice being implemented by alumni of the course, for example Ben Abberstein at AFC Bournemouth and Robyn Kennerdale at Huddersfield Town FC. KIO increasingly regards education as one of its most important activities. This year \[2019\] we will be committing more staff to make the course available to a greater number of people. This is a significant development and speaks to the success of the course” Kick It Out \[5.3\]. 

 Kick It Out followed up on this commitment, further investing in the course to launch the revised, updated and renamed Inclusive Leadership in Football Award in partnership with Solent University \[5.4\]. 

 **Impact on participants** 

 Since its inception in May 2015 up to the latest evaluation in March 2020, 242 football industry professionals have been trained through the Award \[5.5\]. Learners have been recruited from the Football Association, the Professional Footballers’ Association, the Premier League, Arsenal FC, Liverpool FC, Everton FC, Chelsea FC, Southampton FC, West Ham United FC, and Sheffield United FC and Manchester City FC, among others. 

  

 The Award has impacted on participants’ awareness and understanding of issues as they relate to equality, diversity and discrimination in football: 

-  “I have all this newfound knowledge, I’m ready to put it into action, so I can do my bit to make the football industry a more inclusive place for all.” Elizabeth McGrael, Equality Diversity and Inclusion Manager, Sheffield United FC \[5.6\] 

-  “This course has given me the confidence to challenge stereotypical remarks, discriminatory behaviour or just people not being thoughtful in what they say. The course … has allowed me to evaluate how inclusive my workplace is and inspired me to change the things I believe need changing through the right channels with the correct guidelines.” Terrie Ritchie, Inclusion Programme Manager, Liverpool FC \[5.6\] 

-  “I've gained new knowledge and skills that will help me to promote diversity in the workplace. I've also gained the confidence to challenge discrimination issues when they arise” David Alexander, Clyde FC \[5.7\] 

 Overall, the course has impacted on the attitudes and behaviours of learners who have demonstrated new ways of thinking and acting following successful completion of the course. According to Osei Sankofa, Kick It Out’s Education Officer, “Everyone has said they feel more empowered to deal with issues head on and be able to look a little bit deeper” \[5.8\]. 

 **Impact on the football industry** 

 The learners who have studied on the course represent some of the world’s most high\-profile sports brands.  As such, whilst the application of their newly formed awareness and understanding within their specific organisation will be impactful, this impact could also extend well beyond their own employer, given the profile and visibility of these types of organisations. 

 Many of these organisations are globally visible in nature.  As such, the implementation of behaviours and practices developed as part of the Award, and the cultural change elicited from it, will be visible to many millions of people in a range of socio\-cultural contexts. 

 Mark Sampson, who led the England women’s football team to their first ever World Cup semi\-final appearance in 2015, was sacked from this role by the FA in 2017 following allegations of discrimination by England players and the emergence of evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour with female players in a previous role with Bristol Academy. Mark Sampson subsequently completed the Award, as reported by the BBC \[5.9\], saying: “I spent six weeks with Kick It Out on their educational course for equality and diversity. I need to play a more active role in making a difference. It's something I will do for the rest of my life.”

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at Newcastle University has advanced efforts to achieve gender equality between people working in the Scottish agricultural sector. Professor Sally Shortall’s research into gendering in the agricultural sector caused the formation of a taskforce, whose recommendations changed Scottish governmental policy and inspired £1.7M of investment in a range of programmes for farmers and agricultural organisations. More than 1000 women have benefited from increased availability of, and participation in, professional development activities in the Scottish agricultural sector, which included business practice and leadership training, and investment funding. Sixteen agricultural organisations have benefitted from more inclusive practices with regard to gender. This is the first scheme of its kind to be implemented by a developed country. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research conducted by Prof Sally Shortall between 2016 and 2017 at Newcastle University established a baseline position on women in farming and the agriculture sector in Scotland. This was the first commissioned research on women in agriculture in Scotland and provided the evidence base for the Government to develop future policies. 

 This research, commissioned by the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division \[G1\], investigated the role of women in farming and the agriculture sector in Scotland under five headings: daily life, aspirations, career paths, leadership and comparative analysis with women in other family businesses. Particular emphasis was placed on new entrant women farmers. Although not specified in the original tender, inheritance, training and farm safety emerged as important headings. 

 Building on Prof Shortall’s research expertise in this area, the research was comprised of literature review, 9 focus groups, 30 interviews and two on\-line surveys: in total, over 1300 women and 12 men from across Scotland participated. 

 In R1, the presence of gendered occupational enclosure in the Scottish agricultural sector is analysed, with potential mechanisms enforcing this state identified as not just structural exclusion including patrilineal inheritance and exclusion from farming organizations, but also symbolic interaction, non‐verbal communication, exclusionary tactics and language. The research concludes that the process of removing these exclusionary mechanisms does and has occurred, but the rate of change in agriculture remains low because of processes of gendered structural and interactional social closure. 

 In R2, safety in farming practices and on farms is considered, with farm accidents identified as being a persistent social pattern requiring analysis of how families are socialised to interact with the farming space. Danger on farms is normalised, with implications for how children treat the space where families and farms intersect \(a normalisation of danger results in children being socialised to undertake risky behaviour\), and for the behaviour of women when they take on farming roles \(women consciously undertake dangerous farming activities to prove that they are ‘authentic’ farmers\). 

 R3 examines the rural as a gendered space with implications for policy, place\-making and rural social relations, through a case study of \(unconscious\) gendered bias. These themes are examined through the lens of ‘the farmyard’, which as a working and social space has not been given the same consideration in planning policy and research. This has gendered implications because farms have evolved and are premised on the idea that farming relies on a masculine physique. An original example of unconscious gender bias in the social construction of the farmyard is provided, with a discussion of the different ways this is expressed. 

 As well as these findings, the wider research report established that: 

-  Women play a major role in Scottish agriculture, participating in the full range of farming activities. 

-  The most significant barrier women face is a cultural barrier rather than a legal one 

-  Women are very under\-represented amongst the elected leadership of national\-level farming organisations 

-  Some respondents reported exclusionary practices that take place in farming organisations 

-  There is a clear need for more access to vocational, practical training for women entering agriculture, across a range of topics. 

 This research, commissioned by the Scottish government and carried out by Prof Sally Shortall at Newcastle University, immediately upon completion formed the basis for the “Women in agriculture” taskforce, set up by The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Members of the Task Force were Ministerial appointments. The Task Force was gender equal and represented all key Scottish agricultural sectors. Prof Shortall was appointed to, and formed a key part of, this taskforce, providing scientific advice to the work of the taskforce and drafting the final report. This taskforce aimed to make policy recommendations a result of the Newcastle research. The taskforce reported in November 2019 in the document: “Women in agriculture Task Force: Final Report”.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Newcastle research has improved gender equality in Scottish agriculture \[S1\], by influencing the Scottish Programme for Government to invest £1.7M in enhancing the professional development of women in this sector, as well as a programme to change the culture around gender in agricultural organisations and the sector as a whole. This investment was as a result of a taskforce which arose directly from Prof Shortall’s research \[S2\]. So far this scheme has trained >1000 women, nearly 10% of women working in agriculture in Scotland, and is the first scheme to investigate, and implement practical steps to resolve, gender equality in the agricultural sector in a developed nation \[S3\]. 

 This impact was made possible by the direct setting up of the Women in Scottish Agriculture Taskforce by the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, in 2017. This policy impact reflects the importance of the research carried out by Prof Sally Shortall at Newcastle University, and was enacted to implement the recommendations made in the research \[S1\]. This research was described by Fergus Ewing MSP as: “…a significant piece of work which the Scottish Government and the First Minister are committed to progressing to ensure fairer equality in the future for women in agriculture.” \[S2\] 

 Prof Shortall was a key member of this taskforce, providing specialist scientific advice \[S3\]. The Taskforce recommended the implementation of all 27 of Prof Shortall’s recommendations in 2018, which were immediately taken up and funded in the Scottish Programme for Government as, according to Nicola Sturgeon, they “bring forward practical solutions to enable Scottish agriculture to start breaking down the barriers faced by women and to inspire them to reach their full potential”. \[S3; S4\]. As a result of the work of the Women in Agriculture Taskforce, the Programme for Government included a commitment for £200K for 2019/2020. On the 28 November 2019, Mr Ewing announced £300k pa for 2020 – 2024 to implement improvements for women in agriculture, also included in the Programme for Government \[S4, S5\]. 

 A key measure enacted by the Scottish Government include the Women in Agriculture Development Programme, which was delivered via the Be Your Best Self \(BYBS\), Knowing Your Business, and Leadership Development courses. Including the pilot in 2018, more than 1000 women have been trained as part of this programme, despite COVID\-19 related interruptions to planned events in 2020 \[S6\]. The impact on these women has been extensive; feedback from the training programmes indicates that participants rated the programme overwhelmingly as “Excellent”. According to one participant at the BYBS course: “I was able to recognise my fears and worries but also think about how to improve on how I act towards them. The drama triangle and mindset aspects I feel will help me deal with aspects of my life I hadn't dealt with.” Aspects of the course that were particularly valued include “Understanding more about psychology of how our minds work and how we can influence that and make positive changes. Giving the ability and confidence to then go on and do what you want with confidence. Knowing how to cope with difficult situations” \[S7\]. Ten months on from the BYBS training, all women are still actively engaged and meeting regularly, showing the ongoing effect of the programme \[S8\]. 

 The outcome of this programme of training is a cohort of women having gained the ability to further develop their businesses or take up leadership roles in Scottish agriculture. The programme removes barriers to success identified by women themselves in the Research Report \[S1\], and has advanced equality for women within the agricultural industry. This was confirmed by the Equality Impact Assessment conducted by the Scottish government on the Women in Agriculture Development Programme, which showed that the programme has had “a large impact on women, particularly those women in rural communities” and “an impact on everyone in agriculture, from those in farming families and crofting communities to those in larger agricultural businesses and organisations” \[S9\]. The EIA also identifies that the programme has achieved a “positive impact on \[agricultural businesses and organisations\] in terms of business development and profitability” \[S9\]. 

 As well as providing women with the skills to succeed in agriculture, the Taskforce has also delivered activities which have improved equality in the agricultural sector as a whole, leading to an industry which is “more inclusive, with fairer representation, which as a result is more economically resilient and more productive” \[S3\]. Whilst many activities were hampered by COVID \(see COVID impact statement\), several activities with 16 organisations were still completed. Unconscious Bias Training has been delivered in 6 organisations from across the spectrum of the Scottish agricultural sector \[S6; S8\]. As a result, organisations involved are now carrying out “positive actions to support diversity” following the training \[S8\]. The Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution have committed to take on more female board members and young people and to launch a young persons’ board training programme 2021 \[S8\].The Crofting Commission Board has set up a working group to address gender inequality and taken action to encourage more women to attend and observe their meetings through an open invitation \[S8\]. Feedback from the programme indicates a profound impact on participants, who reported that “The materials really made me question my own bias” and “Before enrolling for this training I had considered the benefits of diversity but not unconscious bias. The pre\-work IAT were certainly an eye opener for me and did not give me the results that I had expected.” \[S8\]. 

 An Equality Charter for Scottish Agriculture was developed by the Task Force which supports businesses and organisations to become more supportive and inclusive, leading to greater business efficiencies \[S6\]. The first phase of the pilot of the Equality Charter for Scottish Agriculture has been completed with 10 businesses and organisations. These organisations have benefited from a platform to support their commitment to achieving gender equality, and data collected from the pilot will inform later iterations of the scheme, expanding to all agribusinesses and ensuring it works for all types and sizes of organisation \[S8\]. 

 Further evidence of the success of the Taskforce was in its winning of the Anna Murray Partnership Working Award from Lantra Scotland, one of the leading awarding bodies for land\-based industries in the UK and Ireland \[S10\]. 

 Beyond Scotland, the Irish Farmers Association \(IFA\) developed their “Diversity Strategy: Toward 2025” on the basis of Shortall’s research for the Scottish Government. The IFA’s Farm Family & Social Affairs Executive, Geraldine O’Sullivan, confirms that the work in Scotland was: “was hugely valuable to the work of the IFA Diversity Committee..\[as they\]..start the journey of increasing the gender diversity within the Association.” \[S10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2006, researchers at the University of South Wales \(USW\) have conducted research that examines geographical variations in accessibility to a range of public and private services. This research has **1\)** supported activities of the Welsh Government, providing the evidential base that guided the selection of areas used to pilot their new childcare provision policy **2\)** prompted an on\-going evaluation into the use of these tools for calculating future Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation scores used to allocate programme funds across Wales **3\)** supplied National Sports Bodies such as Welsh Gymnastics, and the charitable organisation Tenovus Cancer Care, previously unobtainable levels of detail on revealed patterns of accessibility to current and future configurations of service delivery points.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2006, research conducted at the University of South Wales \(USW\) has focussed on enhancing small area accessibility estimation models in order to examine geographical variation in a range of public and private services. This was driven by a need to understand spatial and social inequalities in the provision of essential services and suggest ways in which this can be more accurately measured and monitored. From 2010, this has involved the incorporation of transport barriers and service competition initially using proprietary \(ArcGIS<sup>TM</sup>\) and latterly open source \(QGIS, PostGIS\) Geographical Information System \(GIS\) tools. Building on research originally concerned with varying the types of demand\- and supply\-side measures used within accessibility models, we conducted sensitivity analysis on the implications of using alternative approaches based around dasymetric population estimation models \( **R1**\). Much of this research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) under Phase 1 \(2009\-2013\) of the Wales Institute of Socio\-economic Research Data and Methods \(WISERD\) initiative: a multi\-university, cross\-disciplinary institute involving Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, South Wales and Swansea universities. Researchers in USW have developed innovative GIS approaches to aid further understanding of spatial variations in the social and economic geography of Wales. Initially this involved the application of accessibility models to a wide range of facility types, such as post offices, health facilities and public libraries, to examine the impacts of changes in network configuration at the national level since 2010 \( **R2**\). 

  

 Current models are traditionally based on assumptions of access to private transport – our research has for the first\-time created techniques to also consider public transit systems leading to multi\-modal approaches to determining access \( **R3**\). Utilising public web services reporting transport timetables across the UK, this research has extended ‘floating catchment area’ \(FCA\) methodology based on gravity model approaches to consider the implications of calculating access to facilities using enhancements to ‘traditional’ FCA approaches. Subsequently, research funded by Sport Wales in 2015, involved incorporating such enhancements within bespoke Add\-In tools developed for ESRI’s ArcGIS<sup>TM</sup> Desktop GIS. This has been used by both the Welsh Government and Sports Governing Bodies in Wales to gather evidence regarding the most appropriate places to allocate funding to sporting infrastructure. Follow\-up funded research commissioned by the Welsh Government in 2017 updated findings with a new database of sport facilities collected on behalf of Sport Wales which enabled a longitudinal study of changing patterns in provision. The use of these tools has been subsequently extended to consider primary health care services, allowing a multi\-modal examination of spatial variations in access to GP practices \( **R4**\). 

 Research conducted in the Second Phase of the ESRC\-funded WISERD Civil Society \(2015\-2019\) initiative investigated the potential for incorporating extensions to the basic FCA approach to measure spatial accessibility within UK government policy\-relevant indices of deprivation \(using the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation \(WIMD\) as a case study\). The WIMD is the official measure of deprivation used to rank Lower Super Output Areas \(LSOAs\) according to their relative deprivation levels, across eight types of deprivation to produce an overall index. It is used to inform policymaking, allocate resources, and plan levels of service provision at local level and is updated every four to five years. Our research, in relation to the 2014 version of WIMD, contributed to on\-going methodological debates surrounding its construction and has demonstrated how adopting alternative computational approaches might impact on those communities identified as the ‘most deprived’ \( **R5**\). This in turn has implications for place\-based funding mechanisms targeted at particular areas. The models developed permit the inclusion of potentially more sophisticated approaches to measuring access to services than those currently adopted which rely on simple proximity or service density approaches \( **R5**\). In another applied study, research was funded in 2017 by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales \(CSSIW\) in relation to a Welsh Government ‘flagship policy’ regarding free childcare. This applied USW\-developed accessibility tools and models to provide enhanced insights into the existing availability of childcare services. Previously very little was known about detailed geographical patterns of childcare provision in Wales. Our research accounted for supply\-side factors \(such as total opening hours of centres\), and demand \(the distribution of working families with children in the appropriate age groups\), and both were moderated by the impacts of distance. We investigated variations in childcare capacity across Wales in relation to the Welsh Government pledge \(2017\) to provide 30 hours\-a\-week free early education and childcare for working parents of three and four\-year\-olds \( **R6**\). To understand patterns in the availability and accessibility of existing childcare capacity in Wales, detailed modelling was undertaken to create, for the first time, maps revealing childcare provision at highly detailed spatial scales \( **R6**\). 

 Most recently these models have been extended to operate in open\-source GIS environments, initially through a Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship \(KESS\) PhD studentship with Tenovus Cancer Care \(2016\-2019\) and subsequently a similarly funded studentship with Sport Wales \(2018\-2021\). These projects have led to the further development of tools and support materials to measure geographical accessibility to cancer screening and support services using QGIS/PostGIS. It also resulted in the analysis of recreational opportunities within a client\-server architecture that allows both model building and results dissemination to take place remotely via a web browser interface.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Through the application of network\-based GIS tools developed by USW researchers, policy officers within the Welsh Government, Welsh Gymnastics, Sport Wales and Tenovus Cancer Care have been able to strategically plan their activities to better support the delivery of the services they provide. The following projects have been funded by the ESRC through WISERD unless otherwise stated: 

 **USW research informed the Welsh Governments’ policy on Childcare Offer for Wales.** 

 **R6** informed the decision\-making process regarding the implementation of the policy and guided the selection of initial pilot areas. Findings that were obtained using our modelling were published in a Welsh Government report that mapped childcare supply across Wales in relation to potential demand by calculating the number of children \(aged under 4\) within a reasonable travel distance of registered childcare settings against mid\-year population estimates \( **S1**\). This provided the Welsh Government with a sound evidential base for childcare policy making in Wales – for example where the research identified insufficient childcare, this was used by the Welsh Government to evaluate whether parents are able to easily find suitable local childcare \( **S2\)**. This also gained widespread public interest and media attention in Wales; for example, it was featured on the BBC News Website in November 2017 \( **S3**\). The Head of Policy Analysis for the Childcare Offer in the Welsh Government \( **S4**\) stated that GIS\-based analyses: *“have been of value to Welsh Government in providing a real contribution to the evidence base for childcare policy making in Wales. The identification of areas across Wales which have a lack of childcare supply against potential demand has enabled Welsh Government to focus some of the early implementation areas of the childcare offer for Wales to test whether this is experienced by parents on the ground. In participating areas where there this work has identified insufficient childcare; Welsh Government will evaluate whether parents are able to easily find suitable local childcare. The work has raised further research questions for the childcare policy team to consider in terms of what drives this mismatch in supply and demand and whether stimulation of the sector is required to increase childcare capacity in those areas. The maps have been useful to present to stakeholders in gaining recognition of the variance in childcare supply across Wales and the subsequent issues the Childcare Offer for Wales may face during implementation.”* 

 **Policy discussions around accessibility to sporting facilities in Wales were influenced by USW research.** 

 Software tools developed by USW researchers have been used by National Sporting Bodies such as Welsh Gymnastics/Gymnasteg Cymru since 2015 \( **S5**\). This is the national governing body for gymnastics with a membership of over 20,000 and with 97 affiliated clubs caters to 60000 7\-16 years old participating in gymnastics in Wales. The use of our GIS tools has provided greater insight into current and projected levels of provision and enabled them to assemble a detailed evidence base upon which to base policy implementation at localised scales. As a result of our accessibility research, such bodies are now using information regarding spatial patterns of provision in gymnastics facilities to inform their facilities management strategy. They also have used it to better understand social inequalities in access amongst population groups that traditionally have had poor levels of engagement in recreational activities. Presentations have been made in 2018 and 2019 to the Governing Body of Welsh Gymnastics based on our accessibility research. This enabled them to understand the use of facilities and current gaps in provision for those social groups, including ethnic minority communities in urban areas of Wales, at a perceived disadvantage in accessing gymnastic facilities as well as for those ‘elite’ athletes aiming to participate in international sporting events such as the Commonwealth Games. Sport Wales, the national body responsible for developing and promoting sport and physical activity in Wales and the main adviser to the Welsh Government on sport, used \(and continues to use\) this tool to help decide where public sector funding should be invested to deliver the greatest benefit to local communities \( **S6**\). As these tools become more widely available, there is also the potential for further collaboration between organisations charged with promoting sports participation and those concerned with health. 

 **USW research influenced public policy debate on the use of alternative approaches to incorporate accessibility within the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation.** 

 The methods we developed on our research using WIMD \( **R5**\) were included in consultation documents published by the Welsh Government \(WG\) that considered alternative approaches to updating the 2019 version of WIMD \( **S7**\). The Social Justice Statistician with responsibility for the construction of the WIMD \( **S8**\) said that this *“research prompted debate about the role of alternative supply\-demand network\-based GIS approaches amongst Welsh Government officials and others in the Access to Services Domain expert group in the lead up to the implementation of WIMD 2019. The published journal paper and a presentation from the WISERD team to the expert group led to a wider appreciation of the impact of adopting such models within the WIMD methodology*.” Our research has shown how different transportation modes can be incorporated into FCA based accessibility models using a wider range of services. The Social Justice Statistician \( **S8**\) added that based on these refinements of the approach for assessing service accessibility *“there was strong support for continuing to explore this method for potential use in future indices, including the production of a parallel set of outputs using the 2SFCA method following WIMD 2019. WG officials responsible for producing WIMD are keen to continue working with the WISERD team on the above, to enable us to assess the implications of adopting an alternative approach on future Access to Services domain data for future editions of WIMD. The potential impact of this would be better quality data for the Access to Services domain of WIMD, through service access figures that takes into consideration the geographical distribution of all supply sites found within a reasonable travel time/distance. WIMD has a wide range of uses across many sectors to inform research, service provision and funding.”* 

 **USW research provided valuable insight to policies geared to optimising local provision of cancer care services in the Welsh community.** 

 This study commenced in October 2016 and has developed open source tools and support materials to measure geographical accessibility to screening and cancer support services in Wales. Previously, Tenovus Cancer Care, a cancer charity that supports cancer patients and their families and the biggest Wales\-based funder of cancer research with a staff of around 200 and over 2000 volunteers, had not considered GIS approaches to optimise the locations of their cancer services. Our models have enabled important insights into how their two Mobile Treatment Units can best be used to support the capacity already provided at fixed locations where patients receive treatment. This allowed the research team in Tenovus Cancer Care to investigate the impact of alternative spatial configurations of cancer services to enable more patients to be treated closer to home. This creates maximum reach and impact as well as alleviates the pressure of travel for those who must journey to and from a cancer treatment facility. The Director of Research and Support at Tenovus Cancer Care \( **S9\)** stated that: *“With the numbers of people being diagnosed with cancer and so requiring treatment rising year on year, the work conducted, particularly the GIS maps produced, are giving us some really important insights into how the Tenovus Mobile Treatment Units can be used to help alleviate capacity in fixed locations where people receive treatment.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 111 

 Research by the Stroke Research Team has improved how psychological support is provided to people after a stroke. This work highlighted the substantial psychological needs post\-stroke such as depression, anxiety and emotionalism. More than half of stroke survivors experience disabling psychological problems; 7 million worldwide and 33,000\+ in the UK annually. The Stroke Team have revolutionised the assessment and management of these patients by developing reliable mood screening tools, enabling and expediting intervention and support. Motivational interviewing, an existing talk\-based therapy, was specifically adapted for stroke survivors and is now recommended in national and international guidelines. The research has created new collaborations between stroke teams and psychological services and the Stroke Team have developed new ways of training staff to ensure they have the correct skills to provide tailored quality care. The management of psychological problems after stroke has been transformed with new therapies and changes to prescribing practice. The use of fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed anti\-depressant has been reduced following the Stroke Team’s research, which showed increased frequency of bone fractures, negative impacting patients’ well\-being.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prior to the Stroke Team’s research there was a lack of good\-quality evidence to prevent and treat psychological problems following stroke; therefore, psychological care fell below recognised standards. 

 Half of stroke survivors will experience psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, emotionalism and fatigue.  The Stroke Team’s systematic reviews showed that depression affects half of stroke survivors in the first year, with one\-third affected at any time following a stroke, and a quarter of stroke survivors experience anxiety.  These psychological problems are associated with poorer outcomes, negatively impacting patients’ recovery. 

 In order to improve recovery, simple, cost\-effective methods are required to improve the identification and management of psychological problems. In terms of identification, the Stroke Team developed the Signs of Depression Scale \(SODS\) screening tool and have shown the SODS and the one\-item version of the Yale\-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale \(“Do you often feel sad or depressed?”\); are reliable for detecting depression in patients following stroke. 

 In terms of management, the Stroke Team’s research highlighted significant gaps in the evidence supporting the management of psychological problems in stroke survivors.  The Stroke Team’s contribution to Cochrane systematic reviews on depression \[1, 2\], anxiety and emotionalism showed a need for good\-quality evidence for psychological problems after stroke. The systematic review of interventions for preventing depression found the first talk\-based psychological intervention to show a positive outcome was the Stroke Team’s Motivational Interviewing study.  Motivational interviewing helps prevent depression, and potentially reduce death, after stroke. 

 The Stroke Team conducted a single\-centre randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) of motivational interviewing \(2007\) \[3, 6\], a talk\-based psychological therapy, which was adapted from its traditional use in behaviour change, to support psychological adjustment after stroke. This research is one of only two studies of motivational interviewing in managing depression in stroke patients.  This RCT showed that people who received motivational interviewing in addition to their usual care, early after stroke, were significantly less likely to have depression up to a year after stroke, compared to people who received usual care alone, which generally included no psychological therapy. Receiving motivational interviewing was also associated with fewer deaths: for every 12 people receiving the motivational interviewing intervention, 1 person was less likely to die \[6\]. A subsequent feasibility study \(2012\-2013\) \[4\], part\-funded by the Northern Stroke Fund, showed that clinical NHS staff were able to deliver motivational interviewing. These results have informed the COnfirming the Mechanism of Motivational Interviewing Therapy after Stroke \(COMMITS\) study which is now recruiting 1200 participants across 15 UK sites. 

 Multicentre international randomised controlled trials \(involving 5,907 participants\) did not support the routine antidepressant \(fluoxetine\) either for the prevention of post\-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function, but found their use increased the risk of bone fractures \(1.4% absolute excess risk\) in patients. \[5\] 

 <ins> **Improving care through staff training and service organisation**</ins> 

 The Stroke Research Team at the University of Central Lancashire is the UK’s only nurse\-led stroke research unit.  Since 2002, the Stroke Team have worked closely with national and international partners to improve care and education standards. In the ADOPTS study \(2015\-2017\) \(Accelerating Delivery of Psychological Therapies after   Stroke\) funded by the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care North West Coast, the Stroke Team developed and implemented an evidence\-based pathway of psychological support, incorporating cross\-service collaboration and training for staff. There was evidence for increased psychological support for patients by 6\-months post\-stroke following implementation of the pathway. Whilst ADOPTS was not powered to detect a change in mood scores between the intervention and control groups, there was a trend towards less depression in the intervention group.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Across the world, 20 million people including 100,000 in the UK, will experience a stroke annually, of whom two\-thirds will survive. One in three stroke survivors experience depression, particularly within the first year, and this increases cardiovascular\-related morbidity and mortality, whilst also contributing to further NHS costs. Emotional difficulties directly and indirectly reduce quality\-of\-life for the patient by hindering post\-stroke activities like taking medication, engaging in rehabilitation, maintaining social networks, and returning to work. Improving psychological care after stroke enhances patients’ health and quality\-of\-life and reduces burden on NHS services. 

 <ins> **Impact on practice**</ins> 

 The Stroke Team validated two screening tools, SODS and Yale\-Brown Obsessive\-Compulsive Scale, to reliably detect depression in patients following stroke. This validation has led to greater screening for depression amongst stroke survivors.  These screening tools have now been implemented in clinical stroke pathways by numerous NHS stroke services including Cornwall, Dartford, Manchester, Lancashire, London and Glasgow. They are also used in the Netherlands and in Germany \[D\]. 

 The Royal College of Physicians National Clinical Guideline for Stroke now recommend that **“People with or at risk of depression or anxiety after stroke should be offered brief psychological interventions such as motivational interviewing…before considering antidepressant medication”** \[A\]  The Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management, which is also used in New Zealand, similarly recommend that **“…psychological strategies \(e.g. problem solving, motivational interviewing\) may be used to prevent depression.”** \[B\] 

 The Stroke Team’s research, as one of the only sources of evidence on motivational interviewing managing depression after stroke, is increasingly being used in practice and in guidelines.  Motivational interviewing training and principles are now being widely implemented by and for stroke staff. NHS stroke services in Hereford, Cornwall, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow have implemented the training.  Internationally it is found in online training by the Stroke Foundation in Australia, by stroke nurses in the Netherlands and in professional stroke education in the Heart and Stroke Foundation in Canada \[D\]. 

 By adapting motivational interviewing from its original use in behaviour change to adjustment, the clinical impact was extended beyond stroke. For example, the Stroke Team were approached by HIV nurses in Atlanta, USA to provide training in motivational interviewing and guidance into incorporating motivational interviewing within their consultations. They have appreciated Stroke Team’s contribution, stating: **“We and our study participants have truly benefitted from your expertise and input into our motivational adjustment intervention.”** \[J\] 

 The ADOPTS trial has improved care through staff training and the organisation of services. An evidence\-based pathway was developed that enhanced access to psychological support following stroke. The implementation of this pathway resulted in fostering collaborative working between multidisciplinary staff in stroke and generic mental health services, such as Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\), who were previously seen and felt to be working in silos. Working alongside these services to support the adoption of best practice the research resulted in an increased awareness, better networking and peer\-support between the services which previously had minimal collaboration. These new collaborations stimulated the creation of innovative solutions for the provision of psychological support post\-stroke. As one IAPT psychological therapist reported **“I bumped into someone from the stroke team who I met through ADOPTS and we agreed to meet up and try to help each other.”** \[I\] A stroke occupational therapist said: **“I asked \[IAPT\] if they could come and talk about mental health, and obviously stroke\-related, and how we could help patients.”** \[I\] This innovative model has now been widely employed across north\-west England, resulting in increased awareness and collaboration resulting in ADOPTS becoming a shortlisted finalist for the North West Coast Research and Innovation Awards. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners**</ins> 

 Training developed and implemented as part of the ADOPTS research, underpinned by the screening and interventions research, has increased the knowledge and skills among stroke and IAPT teams in identifying and managing psychological problems after stroke. The training improved stroke teams’ psychological awareness, IAPT teams’ stroke awareness and facilitated better psychological support for stroke survivors. Training was initially delivered to 152 staff across six NHS Trusts \(Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust\). The training was well received by participants with one IAPT practitioner stating: **“In the training, thinking about the way we communicate… I found \[it\] really useful… to adapt our therapies.”** Some stroke services and psychological services have cascaded the training, extending its reach beyond the staff trained within ADOPTS. A stroke senior occupational therapist said, **“I’ve incorporated it into in\-service training for therapy staff, because things around psychological impact weren’t really there, and the feedback’s been really positive.”** The training has since been endorsed by the UK Stroke Forum for Education and Training which ensures high quality and relevant training for stroke practitioners and is accessible across the UK. Following ADOPTS, we have been invited to teach on the IAPT course around long\-term stroke recovery conditions. Training has also been delivered in areas beyond those included in the study in Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, increasing the knowledge and skills of IAPT staff across the North West region. 

 <ins> **Impact on patients**</ins> 

 There have been national and international implementations of the work on mood screening, motivational interviewing therapy and antidepressants. This has resulted in substantial impacts on patient care and survival after stroke. Patients who received motivational interviewing in the Stroke Team’s research said they found it beneficial: **“It helps me get things clearer in my mind… stops me sitting and worrying on things,”** While another patient stated **“It’s been worthwhile talking to someone… it’s been great just talking through things because you can talk with family but they don’t understand certain things.”** \[I\] 

 Stroke and IAPT staff felt that stroke survivors, over 1500 per year across the services in which ADOPTS was implemented, benefited from the model. One stroke occupational therapist stated that **“The training brought their \[patients\] psychological wellbeing to the forefront … they’re hopefully getting more holistic care.”** This is corroborated by a stroke survivor who took part in the study and who benefited from an IAPT referral resulting in improved coping methods and an increase in confidence: **“I ended up being referred to Mindsmatter, then attending several group sessions…I know the sessions were a benefit to me. They have helped me in developing my coping methods… I now have more confidence and acceptance of what I can achieve since my stroke.”** \[I\] 

 **Reducing the use of fluoxetine** 

 The FOCUS study showed a 1.4% absolute excess risk of bone fractures with the prescription of fluoxetine.  This has led to the antidepressant, which was commonly used to manage post stroke depression, being prescribed less. The study has been cited in American and Canadian clinical guidelines for stroke management to guide practitioners on the use of antidepressants after stroke \[F, G\]. The guidelines state that the antidepressant fluoxetine does not have an effect on functional recovery.  The use of the antidepressant fluoxetine is now increasingly avoided due to  evidence from the Stroke Team’s research showing its use increases the risk of adverse effects and alternative antidepressants are now considered in the first instance \[H\].

 Evaluations that have demonstrated improvements in outcomes following post\-stroke exercise programmes have guided the development of the HELP \(Health Enhancing Lifestyle Programme\) Hampshire Stroke Clinic, a community\-based collaboration between the University of Winchester, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust \(HHFT\), and Hobbs Rehabilitation \(independent neuro\-rehabilitation service\). The clinic shifts focus from General Practice identifying and recruiting patients to exercise referral schemes to HHFT and their acute stroke unit, Transient Ischaemic Attack \(TIA\) clinic and Early Supportive Discharge \(ESD\). The evidence highlighted in this case study illustrates how our research has impacted on the stroke care pathway of HHFT. Such impact has national relevance as this is similar to other NHS trusts.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the UK, there are over 100,000 strokes each year, and over 1.2 million stroke survivors. Once a stroke patient has been discharged from the care of the NHS, there are limited opportunities for people to engage in accessible and affordable lifestyle behaviour change initiatives in the community, despite robust evidence supporting the benefits of post\-stroke exercise participation, as demonstrated by **Faulkner** and colleagues **\(3.1\-3.4\)**. 

 Faulkner has undertaken randomized controlled trials, in collaboration with local healthcare providers, that have demonstrated: 1\) the short\- and long\-term benefit of stroke/TIA patients engaging in exercise programmes soon after diagnosis; 2\) the economic importance of secondary stroke prevention programmes; and 3\) optimal blood pressure assessment procedures for stroke survivors. 

1.  **Research evidence regarding the benefit of exercise soon after stroke/TIA** 

 Faulkner and colleagues have provided evidence that 8\- to 12\-weeks of at least twice weekly aerobic and/or resistance training can improve cardiovascular disease risk profile **\(3.1\-3.2\)** and quality of life **\(3.3\)** when engaging stroke/TIA patients in exercise programmes within seven days of diagnosis. Faulkner’s research showed large reductions in blood pressure \(BP\) **\(3.1\-3.2\)**, and improvements in blood lipid profile and measures of body composition **\(3.1\)**. The benefits reported immediately following the intervention were maintained up to 12\-months after the exercise programme **\(3.1\)**. These individuals were also shown to have fewer hospital admissions and strokes, and reduced risk of total mortality, when compared to those individuals who did not engage in such a programme, within three and a half years of stroke diagnosis **\(3.4\)**. 

1.  **Research into economic impact of secondary stroke prevention programmes** 

 Faulkner demonstrated the economic benefit of secondary prevention exercise and education programmes on stroke/TIA patient hospital costs **\(3.4\)**. The study was the first to demonstrate that over a three\-and\-a\-half\-year follow\-up period, the costs associated with stroke/TIA patient hospital admissions were 141% higher in those individuals who did not participate in an exercise and education programme soon after stroke/TIA diagnosis. 

1.  **Winchester’s research into optimal BP assessment procedures** 

 Faulkner and colleagues assessed the short\- and longer\-term changes in BP with stroke patients lying down and in a fasted\-state **\(3.1\-3.2\)**. However, BP is measured in differing postures and fasting states within clinical settings \(hospitals, GP practices\) according to a variety of environmental and situational factors. Mitchelmore \(PhD student, University of Winchester; 2015\-2019\), **Faulkner** and **Jobson** demonstrated that when measuring BP in stroke patients and an older, healthy population group, it should be assessed in a fasted state, regardless of posture \(seated/supine\), to optimise the accuracy and reproducibility of collected data **\(3.5, 3.6\).** Accordingly, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic assesses patients at screening and follow\-up assessments in a fasted state.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research of **Faulkner** and colleagues **\(3.1 to 3.6\)** has underpinned the creation of the **HELP** \(<ins> **H**</ins>ealth <ins> **E**</ins>nhancing <ins> **L**</ins>ifestyle <ins> **P**</ins>rogramme\) **Hampshire Stroke Clinic;** an accessible, low\-cost service to community\-dwelling individuals living with stroke **\(5.1\)** which has had a substantial impact on: i\) people, by improving health outcomes for stroke patients and facilitating greater opportunities for volunteers, ii\) reconfiguring the pathway for stroke referrals within the NHS \(HHFT\), and iii\) practice services \(e.g., Hobbs rehabilitation processes and research focus\). 

 **Impact on patient beneficiaries** 

 The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic is recognised as one of the top 100 University programmes that are ‘saving lives and keeping us healthy’ **\(5.2\)**. The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic collects robust data on stroke outcomes. Substantial improvements in BP have been evidenced, with attendees to the clinic experiencing meaningful reductions in BP from when they start \(146/82 mmHg\) to when they complete the programme \(135/79 mmHg\) **\(5.3\)**. This is impactful when considering that a BP ≤140/85 mmHg is associated with up to a 41% reduction in experiencing future strokes \(Weiss et al., 2017, doi:10.7326/M16\-1754\). Engagement with the exercise programme has resulted in attendees showing improvements in their functional abilities \(e.g., balance, walking\), psychosocial outcomes \(anxiety, depression, confidence\) and quality of life have also been reported **\(5.3\)**. In support of these positive impacts, the Stroke Association have reported that: 

 *‘The programme is having a real impact on the lives of our service users and has both physical and psychosocial health outcomes. They feel that the support from ward to the clinic is 'seamless' and for service users whose strokes were a few years ago, this new programme has given a renewed boost to their recovery and a feeling that they can continue to make improvements.’* **\(5.4\)** 

 The impact of this clinic on the quality of life of service users and their families has also been significant, as evidenced through patient testimonials. For example, this patient highlighted numerous positive impacts: 

 *‘When I first started attending, I was barely out of my wheelchair. Afraid to walk, as I was not at all confident to walk. But now with exercises for core muscles, co\-ordination, agility, balance, strength, making us more aware, I'm able to walk with my own two legs with a lot more confidence’* **\(5.5\)** 

 **Impact on referral configuration** 

 Prior to the commencement of the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic, the referral of stroke patients to Winchester City Council’s Active Lifestyle’s Exercise Referral Scheme, primarily from GP practices, was limited, with approximately 20 patients being referred annually to community, leisure\-centre based exercise programmes. The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic has instigated significant service reconfiguration for the referral of patients to community stroke rehabilitation programmes by developing a new pathway of secondary care via HHFT, and in particular the Hyper\-acute stroke unit, TIA clinic and ESD team **\(5.6, 5.7\)**. Although the Clinic also receives referrals from GP practices, with 16 GP practices referring patients to the clinic in the first year of the Clinic \(March 2019 to March 2020\), the programme quadrupled \(n = 80 patients\) the number of annual stroke survivors engaging in community exercise. As of June 2020, and due to COVID\-19, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic commenced the delivery of virtual online, practitioner led exercise classes. Accordingly, individuals newly diagnosed with stroke during COVID\-19 are also able to access the services of the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic. 

 **Impact on voluntary sector** 

 Based on the success of recruiting local stroke patients to the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic, the Stroke Association approached the University of Winchester to create a new stroke support group **\(5.4\)**. Accordingly, in November 2019, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic and Stroke Association started to provide additional opportunities for community\-dwelling stroke survivors \(approx. 20\-30 people\) to help improve patients’ communication, rebuild confidence and independence, and help people rebuild their life after stroke. Students \(Sports Science, Physiotherapy\) from the University of Winchester and other Higher Education Institutions \(Solent University; University of Portsmouth\) are afforded opportunities to enhance their learning whilst supporting the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic. Their involvement provides an opportunity to foster the application of knowledge and aids in developing and applying their learned skills, whilst facilitating confidence\-building and an opportunity to improve communication skills when dealing with members of the public **\(5.8\)**. In addition to enhancing learning opportunities, this link is shaping the views of future generation allied health practitioners on after stroke care. Impacting upon the Physiological Society and Guild HE report on ‘Sport & Exercise Science Education: Impact on the UK Economy’ **\(5.9\)**, the HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic was one of only three \(of 29\) University case studies that was deemed to provide ‘benefits to the public purse’. 

 **Impact on independent neuro\-physiotherapy provider** 

 Hobbs Rehabilitation is the largest independent rehabilitation provider in the UK. The HELP Hampshire Stroke Clinic has influenced Hobbs’ activity by: i\) facilitating opportunities for them to deliver group\-based exercise classes in the community as a part of a collaborative programme, and ii\) encouraging them to engage in research activities to help further their knowledge, understanding and application of physical therapy for patients with neurological conditions **\(5.10\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

| Research has had impact through promoting the inclusion of victims’ rights as part of post\-conflict transition, human rights advocacy and enhancing accountability for state wrongdoing via legal accountability mechanisms. This has been most evident, in reach and significance, within Northern Ireland as a region with unique circumstances \(emerging post\-1998 from armed conflict\) and by influencing the attitudes and activities of community groups, human rights/victims’ Non\-Government Organisations \(NGOs\), international policymakers and lawyers involved in shaping truth recovery public policy and legal redress for past human rights abuses. Building on earlier work, impact has been driven by a range of activities, public events, collaborations and consultancies undertaken since 2014, as outlined in the evidence below. With a focus on holding the powerful accountable, impact is evidenced in supporting victims, recognition as a model for international practice, use to inform legal debates and proceedings and contributing to major policy debates in the USA. |

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Post\-conflict redress, including for victims and survivors of state violence, is a concern that has risen to prominence in recent years for domestic and international policymakers. In Northern Ireland \(NI\), the Good Friday Agreement \(1998\) ended a conflict costing 3,600 lives. Dealing with a conflicted past, by focusing on outstanding victims’ truth and justice issues, has been a significant and contentious area of debate and policymaking; evidenced in civil society activities, the work of public bodies \(e.g. Victims’ Commission\) and key policy initiatives \(e.g. Consultative Group on Dealing with the Past, 2012 Report; Addressing the Legacy of Northern Ireland’s Past, 2018 Consultation\). The underpinning research reflects long\-term engagement with the dilemmas confronting societies emerging from conflict, the legacy of state wrongs and the limitations of accountability mechanisms. The discrete but interlinked projects have been carried out by Professor Mark McGovern while employed by the University \(1993 onwards\). The research has developed considerably since 2014, with a focus on the issue of **Collusion, State Violence, State Agents and Accountability.** 

 Research conducted during the current census period builds on a body of work which underpinned a 2014 EHU impact case study \(‘Influencing debates on post\-conflict justice and human rights’\). This involved several projects, including; the *Ardoyne Commemoration Project \(ACP,* 1998\-2002\); an *Assessment of Community\-based Approaches to Truth Recovery* \( *Assessment*, 2003\-2006\) and *Attitudes Towards a Truth Commission for Northern Ireland* \( *Attitudes*, 2005\-2008\). The *ACP* was an innovative, community\-based project on post\-conflict truth recovery. The *Assessment* research examined its impact. The *Attitudes* project created a module of questions for the *Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey* – the largest public opinion social survey conducted in NI.  Together this work attracted total research awards of £145k\+ \(e.g. *Community Relations Council \(NI\)*, *EU Structural Fund for Peacebuilding in Northern Ireland* and the *Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust*\). Outcomes and outputs included a monograph \( *Ardoyne: The Untold Truth*\); reports and launch events; international engagements and networks \(e.g.  Sri Lanka Transitional Justice Group, 2006; Greensboro Community Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2007\) and comparative work with UK\-based NGOs on the impact of counter\-terrorism policies. 

 A focus on the post\-conflict accountability for the conflict\-related actions of policing and intelligence agencies \(particularly in NI\), their agents and informers, developed throughout this work. At the core of work conducted since 2014 has been a long\-term research project \( *‘Collusion, State Violence and Victims’ Perspectives in Mid\-Ulster*, 2009 onward\) exploring state collusion in non\-state political violence, focussing on cases in Mid\-Ulster in the 1980s and 1990s. Funded by the *British Academy* \(£8,440\) and *EU Peace III Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation Fund* \(£15,580\), this work has been carried  out collaboratively with victims’ families and the victims’ organisation *Relatives for Justice* \(RFJ\). The research examined evidence of collusion, the impact on families, and attitudes toward \(and issues with\) post\-conflict legacy mechanisms. This sensitive work involved personally conducting 50\+ in\-depth interviews with family members and eyewitnesses and collating a large body of legal and archival materials, relating to over 40 killings carried out by loyalist paramilitaries where collusion with state agencies has been alleged. Many of these deaths remain the subject of ongoing investigation by statutory bodies \(e.g. Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland\) and legal processes. Research was also undertaken into the roots and character of state counterinsurgency strategies, state wrongdoing and political/policy decision\-making. The researcher conducted another 30\+ in\-depth interviews with keynote respondents \(and further substantial archival research\) to examine longer\-term and wider patterns of state violence, the rules governing the actions of agents and informers, and legal and post\-conflict accountability mechanisms. International peer\-reviewed journal publications have analysed the links between colonial wars, counterinsurgency practice and collusion *\[ref 5\]* and the logic behind institutionalised collusion *\[ref 4, 6\]*. Others explored collusion in the 1994 Loughinisland massacre *\[ref 3\]* and the ‘soldier\-victim’ figure in legacy state\-killing cases \[ *ref 2\]*. A single\-authored monograph based on the Mid\-Ulster research followed *\[ref 1\]*.

 **4. Details of the impact**: 

 Impact flows primarily from long\-term, ongoing and direct engagement with community groups, NGOs, political representatives and legal professionals involved with influencing policy/practice for post\-conflict truth recovery and state accountability in Northern Ireland \(NI\) as a region with unique circumstances. The research has had an effect on the activity, attitude, awareness and capacities of relevant individuals, organisations and constituencies. Impact has been evident in, **a\) promoting victims’ and survivors voices and rights** through research on, with and for families, NGOs and civil society; **b\) pursuing accountability for state wrongs** via legal cases and accountability mechanism and **c\)** **advancing an inclusive, rights\-based culture** \(domestically and internationally\) through influencing public debate and policy. 

 **a\)** The **promotion of victims’ and survivors’ voices and rights* builds on the long\-term impact of a participatory approach through engagement with victims’ relatives. First evidenced in the work of the *ACP* \(1998\-2002\) this continued through the research undertaken with *RFJ* and the families of victims of collusion in Mid\-Ulster \(2009\-2019\) **\[Factual Statement, FS1\]**. The project and outputs *\[ref 1\-6\]* have affected and continued to inform the awareness, behaviour and capacity of victims’/human rights organisations and legal professionals in collaborative approaches to truth recovery. 

 Collaboration with RFJ and the families they represent has been extensive, intensive, long\-term and on\-going. For the CEO of RFJ the core aims of that partnership have been to ‘empower bereaved families to document their experiences…raise awareness and concerns more publicly about these killings…examine practices…identify failings \[and\] set out potential remedy’ **\[FS1\]**. The ‘ground\-breaking’ work has ensured the ‘voices \[of victims’ families\] have been heard and their experiences validated’ **\[FS1\]**. As ‘completely evidence based’ the RFJ CEO is in ‘absolutely no doubt’ the collaborative aims have been achieved. The North Belfast MP is also a human rights lawyer and a relative of a conflict collusion victim **\[FS2\]**. In combining ‘independent analysis’ with ‘highlighting families’ stories’, he argues, ‘the research…should not be underestimated \[in\] promoting accountability’ and adds ‘immeasurable weight’ to ‘reconciliation’ efforts. 

 The work has made a broader contribution in influencing public debates about legacy and post\-conflict transformation. A Former Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police is now Head of ‘Operation Kenova’ and other current investigations into over 150 cases involving collusion allegations **\[FS3\]**. The ‘work with victim advocacy groups’, he contends, has ‘tirelessly’ sought truth for families and ‘quite properly’ led to asking ‘legitimate questions of the authorities’. In providing a ‘crucial perspective’ and voice for ‘a sector that has felt disenfranchised and let down’ the research has ‘directly stimulated and informed the discussion on legacy issues’ **\[FS3\]**. ‘Those in law enforcement’ should promote the researchers work and ‘welcome \[the\] scrutiny’ it prompts. A partner for Kevin R Winters Solicitors \(KRW\) **\[FS4\]** \(Ireland’s leading human rights law firm, representing numerous victims’ families\), says he ‘cannot overestimate…the societal impact’ of the work and value of its ‘academic integrity’. For the RFJ CEO it has placed legacy issues ‘firmly on the political agendas of the Irish and UK Governments, the devolved administrations’ and beyond’ **\[FS1\]**. 

 The community\-based, participatory approach to transitional justice policy and practice advocated in earlier work was recognised as a model for international practice in citations contained in USAID \(2014\) *Community Participation in Transitional Justice: A Role for Participatory Research* **\[Other Sources, OS3\]**. USAID is ‘the lead US Government Agency that works to end extreme global poverty’. Publications cited include Lundy, P. & McGovern, M. 2008. ‘Rethinking transitional justice from the bottom\-up’. *Journal of Law and Society*, 35, 265\-292 \(as key source for ‘bottom\-up’ approaches at note 6; see also note 35, 184 – including reference to the ACP\); Lundy, P. & McGovern, M. 2006. ‘Participation, truth and partiality: participatory action research community\-based truth\-telling and post\-conflict transition in Northern Ireland’, *Sociology*, 40:1, 71\-87 \(at note, 34, 54, 59, 69, 109, 184\) 

 **b\) **Pursuing accountability for state wrongs* has involved two primary areas of impact. The first focuses on **legal accountability for state collusion and the activities of agents and informers**. Research *\[ref 1\-6\]* on covert policing and the use of agents and informers has directly informed legal cases brought on behalf of the families of victims of NI conflict\-related violence. This follows long\-term engagement with KRW Solicitors **\[FS4, 6\]**. A Partner for KRW **\[FS4\]** notes, the ‘research and published works have transformed the factual matrix within which we work… complimented and enhanced our professional objectives… \[and\] our clients’ interests’. Providing ‘opportunities for dependable evidence’, the work has been employed ‘to reference and cite cases \[where\] commonality of suspects, ballistics and intelligence was not previously understood’. For the KRW litigation consultant the research ‘has assisted’ in developing ‘pleadings on collusion as an administrative state practice’ **\[FS6\]**. The KRW Partner argues that **specific publications have underpinned their legal strategies and arguments**. The ‘thematic research’ and ‘geographical’ and ‘chronological’ framing of the ‘seminal work’ \( *Collusion and Counterinsurgency*, *ref 1*\), has been ‘critical to our litigation approach to disclosure’ **\[FS4\]**. As lead solicitor for the six families of victims of the 1994 Loughinisland massacre, the research for *See No Evil \[ref 3\]* provided ‘critical analysis… which was crucial to refining our litigation strategy’ **\[FS4\]**. The historical and theoretical contexts provided by *Colonial Roots of Collusion \[ref 5\]* has been ‘directly relevant to pleading cases’ involving litigation against the British Army, including dozens of killings in the early 1970s. By broadening an understanding of state collusion, the research has informed litigation in cases where \(previously thought unlikely\) ‘British Army intelligence may have permitted the murder of RUC officers to protect informants in republican groups’. 

 **The research led to requests to provide expert affidavits and reports for human rights lawyers bringing legal cases where collusion has been suspected**. These include providing an expert affidavit outlining state use of informers and agents within the IRA prior to the Birmingham Pub Bombings, 1974 \(BPB74\). The expert report was requested by leading UK \(Broudie, Jackson and Canter, BJC\) and NI\-based \(KRW\) civil liberties firms representing the victims’ families. It was submitted to a recent high\-profile inquest into the case \(2019\). A Director and Head of Major Inquiries of BJC **\[FS5\]** \(who has represented the families of victims of Hillsborough Disaster and Manchester Arena bombing\), states the BPB74 ‘pro\-bono’ report was an ‘exhaustive analysis…which enabled us to understand the dynamics between various groups’. Confirming a lack of ‘available evidence of British involvement in the bombings’ also saved ‘a great deal of time and the families the anguish of exploring fruitless lines of inquiry’ **\[FS5\]**. The KRW litigation consultant notes the researcher’s ‘extensive’ record of published work on collusion meant his ‘credibility as an academic expert \[was\] ‘compelling’. The BPB74 report ‘was comprehensive’, assisting in submissions, arguments and the ‘forensic interrogation’ of disclosed evidence **\[FS6\]**. KRW invited the researcher to provide expert testimony in a BPB74 Freedom of Information tribunal case heard at the Royal Courts of Justice, London \(February 2020\). The researcher was described as ‘a compelling expert witness’ on ‘ideas of National Security…risk to individuals’ and the form and structure of ‘PIRA and contemporary dissident Republican activity’ **\[FS6\]**. The ‘eloquent’ evidence demonstrated the ‘practical importance of the research’ for victims’ families seeking legal accountability. **\[FS6\]**. 

 The second area of impact in terms of legal accountability is concerned with evidence of a **torture culture, secrecy and state wrongdoing** within the British military during the early years of the NI conflict. A partner of Harte, Coyle and Collins solicitors \(HCC\) **\[FS7\]** found a public presentation by the researcher ‘of such high calibre’ it ‘triggered’ the request for an expert report in a case being taken against the Ministry of Defence on behalf of their client, Liam Holden. A 1972 conviction for killing a British soldier \(a commuted death penalty, serving 17 years in jail\) against Holden was quashed in 2012. The civil litigation alleges Holden was tortured \(including waterboarding\) to extract a confession. The expert report examined evidence of official tolerance of a ‘torture culture’. The HCC Partner notes the ‘detailed, comprehensive’ expert affidavit is ‘of significant assistance to the case’ **\[FS7\]**. Currently under consideration as part of ongoing legal proceedings, the report and the researcher’s ‘knowledge \[as an expert witness\] will greatly assist the Court’ **\[FS7\]**. 

 **c\)** **Advancing domestic and international awareness of rights\-based legacy work/state accountability** has involved impactful activities and engagement designed to shape public awareness and debates on collusion, legacy and state accountability, domestically and internationally. Public engagement with key stakeholder sectors has included events organised in collaboration with NGOs and legal professionals. These include delivering the 2015 annual Pat Finucane Lecture \(with human rights lawyer Peter Madden and BBC journalist John Ware\) \- ‘the first public and independent analysis of the UK government review into the murder of Pat Finucane’ **\[FS1\]**. A 2014 keynote address was given to RFJ’s ‘Harms to Rights’ conference, opened by then Deputy First Minister of NI, Martin McGuiness **\[FS1\]**. Attendees at both events included political representatives \(e.g. Martina Anderson MEP\), statutory organisations \(e.g. Victims’ Commission, Police Service of NI\) and human rights lawyers. The KRW partner invited a keynote address for the ‘Belfast Homecoming’ conference \(2017\) for an audience including national/international senior legal professionals \(e.g. Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland, Sir Declan Morgan QC **\[FS4\]** and the Partner at HCC **\[FS7\]**. The widow of Pat Finucane spoke at the Belfast launch of *Counterinsurgency and Collusion* **\[** *ref 1,* **FS2\]** where over 200 attendees included the Head of ‘Operation Kenova **\[FS3\]**, journalists, NGO and political representatives \(e.g. MPs, members of the NI Assembly\), human rights lawyers, victims’ families and survivors **\[FS 1, OS2\]**. The KRW litigation consultant co\-hosted the London launch of *Collusion and Counterinsurgency* for an invited audience of fellow senior legal professionals **\[** *ref 1,* **FS6\]**. 

 Internationally, the focus has primarily been on **influencing political representatives and policy makers in the US**. This centred on two trips. The first involved a **series of public launch events** for *Counterinsurgency and Collusion \[ref 1\]* in nine US cities \(e.g. New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Boston\), and **private briefings for prominent political representatives**, in June 2019 **\[OS 1: 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12\]**. Organised in conjunction with RFJ and the Ancient Order of Hibernians \(AOH\) these briefings and events \(attended by over 600 people\) highlighted issues raised in the research **\[FS1, OS 1.7, 1.9\]**. They included a book launch \(supported by $2k from the Northern Ireland Bureau \(NIB\), introduced by its First Secretary\) at the National Press Club, Washington DC for an audience of political, legal and community leaders \(e.g. Deputy Head of the Irish Embassy\) **\[FS1\]**. Private briefings, to focus US policymakers’ influence on legacy accountability, were held with leading members of Congress \(e.g. Peter King \(New York\), and the Chief Advisor to Richard Neal, Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee\) **\[OS 1.6, 1.7\]**. For the CEO of RFJ, a letter sent by leading members of Congress \(e.g. Peter King, Eliot Engel\) to the senior British official in the US \(Deputy Ambassador Michael Tatum\) in July 2019 was a ‘direct consequence of the US book launches’ **\[OS.14, FS1\]**. The letter raised concerns over the ‘failure to implement agreed legacy issues \[specifically\]… legacy killings in Tyrone and South Derry’ **\[OS 1.4, 1.7\]**. 

 Citations issued by members of Congress marked the impact of these briefings and public events **\[OS 1.10, 1.11, 1.12\]**. For example, Rep. Brendan Boyle \(member, House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee\) found the book and launch meetings worked ‘diligently’ for ‘transparency and accountability’ and will ‘educate the public’ **\[OS 1.10\]**. Borough President of the Bronx, New York City heralded the ‘ground\-breaking’ research and public events as means to ‘increase American awareness of legacy victims’ **\[OS 1.11\]**. Pennsylvania Congressmen Kevin Boyle and Michael Driscoll ‘heartily’ commended the ‘hard work and commitment’ evident in the ‘praiseworthy accomplishment’ of the work that would ‘enlighten all Irish\-Americans’ about ‘suspected collusion’ **\[OS 1.12\]**. 

 The second trip followed an invitation to provide **a briefing on the impact of Brexit on peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland to members of the US Congress House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Congressional Friends of Ireland Caucus of the House of Representatives** in November 2019 **\[OS 1: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5\]**. Committee members present included Eliot Engel \(Chair\), Bill Keating \(Massachusetts\) Brian Higgins \(New York\) and Brendan Boyle \(Pennsylvania\). Audience members included the Deputy Head of the Irish Embassy, First Secretary of the NIB and several dozen congressional and senatorial advisors \(e.g. Chief Advisor to Richard Neal\). A meeting was held with Senator Chuck Schumer \(New York, Senate Leader\) and requests for further briefing material received from several Senators’ offices \(e.g. Jack Reed, Rhode Island\). A letter was subsequently sent by senior members of the US Congress \(including Rep. Boyle and Rep. Neal\) to UK party leaders in early December 2019 raising concerns over the impact of Brexit on human rights and legacy issues **\[OS 1.2\]**. **The RFJ CEO says these efforts raised the profile of legacy and collusion issues in the US**, feeding into wider initiatives to secure the appointment of a US envoy to ‘cement the peace process’ and deal with ‘outstanding’ concerns, notably ‘addressing the legacy of the past’ **FS1\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Institute of Management \(IoM\) led the research in the Realising an Applied Gaming Ecosystem \(RAGE\) European H2020 project; investigating the structures, business models, value chains and component\-based production processes deployed by the applied digital games industry. Significant impact was achieved as the new component\-based production processes and models developed by the project are now embedded in the practice of commercial European games developers and the games containing the assets are accessed by learners located in in France, Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, UK, Spain and Germany. The European Commission selected the project for the prestigious EU ‘Innovation impact’ award in 2018.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The global demand for games designed with a purpose other than leisure or entertainment referred to as applied games is expected to increase over the coming years. The applied games industry in Europe is fragmented and competitively disadvantaged in relation to the more established industries of the United States and Asia. The RAGE project investigated whether the industry could learn form and adopt production and business processes and methodologies deployed by their successful leisure industry counterparts to achieve a competitive advantage. 

 The IoM led the project with other partners contributing technical and pedagogic expertise, commercial exploitation and administration. This research sought to identify good practice in the development processes and business models of the more established leisure industry that could be deployed to increase efficiency and the profitability of developers whilst improving the quality of their products. This involved extensive research in to the process and business models of the more established leisure games industry through stakeholder consultation and a comparative analysis of the established and emergent business models and value chains of both industries. The principal aim was to develop new business and process models that could serve to underpin the potential growth in demand for applied games. 

 A significant barrier to international competitiveness identified was the cost of production related to the efficacy of development processes and specifically the high cost of development. In the leisure industry the use of outsourced middleware and software components was commonplace Businesses such as Unity served demand by providing a market place of components or assets that were affordable and widely used by the industry. However, whilst these methodologies and business models were well established in the leisure industry in the applied industry they were not. These methodologies and models had not been validated and were largely untested in the applied Industry; where complex pedagogic features and functions were identified and highlighted as essential ingredients of applied games. The RAGE project undertook to establish an equivalent asset\-based market place for the applied industry in Europe. This involved the development and testing of reusable, interoperable, open source software assets by technical partners. The assets, process and business models were evaluated and tested and the provision of a platform to market these assets.  The assets were made available to the European development industry with the aim of condensing the development time to market and several pilots were undertaken with the industry as a proof of concept. The assets were rigorously tested by the developers based in the UK, France, Germany and Holland. The efficacy of the processes assets and business models was further evaluated.

 <ins>National and International Impact</ins> 

 As a result of the research; methodologies, production processes and business models developed as outputs within Work\-package 7 of the RAGE project have been widely adopted by the key beneficiaries of the research, European based applied game development studios. These developers have enjoyed improved efficiencies in production, gained insight into their competitive market and identified potential growth opportunities in applied games. Six compelling international commercial case studies, supported by testimony, refer to the corroboration of Impact 3,4,5,6,7,8, are provided as supporting evidence of the impact of the project on their internal development processes and business efficiencies. These case studies testimonies include from the United Kingdom Playgen and Gameware, from France BIP Media and from Germany Nurogames. The adoption of processes and asset\-based production methodologies and business models have resulted in achieving significant development cost savings in research, development and production by the businesses concerned thereby improving their global competitive advantage. 

 The impact of the project outputs has extended beyond that of  beneficiaries to research and development activities supported by the EU involving major international corporations. One of the highest profile of projects utilising the RAGE outputs is the “Jenner” applied game  [http://shura.shu.ac.uk/22448/](http://shura.shu.ac.uk/22448/). 

 The game was produced in collaboration between Sheffield Hallam University, Steel Minions Developers and Sony Playstation as part of the REVEAL project. This Virtual Reality \(VR\) Game included a VR, simulation of the house of Georgian Scientist Dr Edward Jenner and was developed applying the asset\-based development methodologies and the use of a several of RAGE components. The 2019 gamification award winning project The Breaking Educational Barriers with Contextualised, Pervasive and Gameful Learning Beaconing project deployed a number of assets and adopted the RAGE processes methodology  [https://beaconing.eu/](https://beaconing.eu/). 

 Another EU funded research and development activity to use the processes, asset\-based methodologies and business models developed is the Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems project which aims to establish a sustainable competitive ecosystem of European technology and solution providers for interactive technologies.  [https://iv4xr\-project.eu/](https://iv4xr-project.eu/). 

 In Portugal, The Escola de Policia Judiciara, the Portugese Police training academy have adopted the RAGE processes and deploy the assets with their development partners in their production of learning materials to help train their police officers to be sympathetic with victims of domestic violence and to satisfy a variety of other training requirements. 

 <ins>Recognition and Awards</ins> 

 Early indications of the potential international impact of the RAGE project were recognised in 2017 when it was selected by the European Commission as one of the finalists of the European Innovation Radar prize. This is a prize for the most promising Early Stage Innovations across the breadth of EU Horizon 2020 programme one of the key criteria for the award was impactful innovation. 

 Furthermore, in 2019, the project was highlighted as being one of the most significant research and innovation projects in the Netherlands. 

 International applied and leisure industry groups and their members have engaged with the project including the United Kingdom Interactive Entertainment \(UKIE\), the Dutch \(Netherlands\) Games Garden, Balkan and French Industries and further evidence of the impact of the project the RAGE Ecosystem, Where the process models and assets are located is that over 850 European industry representatives have directly engaged with the project outputs processes and assets. A number of technical ‘hackathons’ have tested the processes and assets in Amsterdam, Vienna and in Brussels at the European Parliament.  This impact has also been recognised within the EU commission as evidenced by two awards for achievement granted to the project and in the ongoing and significant influence on policy development of future EU research in the applied games development space. 

 The following is an extract from the RAGE \(644187\) Project Final Review Report completed by the European Commission, highlighting the impact of the project; ‘ *RAGE as flagship project in the field of advanced gaming has elaborated an ecosystem for the applied gaming market offering a portal in form of a marketplace for all stakeholders of the applied gaming industry*.’ 

 Sustainability of impact is assured as is the legacy of the research outputs under the custodianship of the recently established, RAGE foundation. In summary, the international impact of the Business Modelling and Management of Asset based development for the Digital Games Industry Case Study has been significant in terms of take up of the models and processes and in serving to stimulate the use of new asset\-based development methodologies to help gain competitive advantage in the emerging applied games industry in the UK, France, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Spain.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Alcohol misuse is a serious problem in the UK \(e.g., in Wales, almost 55,000 hospital admissions were attributable to alcohol between 2017\-2018\). Research by Cardiff University informed policy and legislation designed to mitigate the harmful effects of alcohol abuse, including supporting a new law in Wales for the minimum pricing of alcohol. The Cardiff team also developed ‘Have a Word’, a motivational tool to reduce risky alcohol consumption, which was adopted as a routine intervention by Public Health Wales and Public Health England. Use of ‘Have a Word’ by The Ministry of Defence further ensured that all 140,000 UK military personnel were screened for alcohol misuse over 2 years, with evidence of declining prevalence upon repeated screening. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cardiff University researchers delivered several research projects focused on evaluation of the use and misuse of alcohol and associated repercussions in wider society. These interlinked studies are summarised below under three headings: 1\) Alcohol pricing; 2\) ‘Have a Word’: motivational advice about alcohol use; and 3\) ‘Have a Word’ and the armed forces. 

#  2.1 Alcohol pricing 

 In 2006, and again in 2016, the Cardiff team investigated the relationship between violence\-related injury and the price of alcohol **\[3.1\]**. They showed that high regional violence\-related injury rates correlated with low price of alcohol, as measured by the price of beer. Cardiff research concluded that risk of injury from violence was closely linked to alcohol price and proposed that increasing the price of beer would reduce violent injury **\[3.1\]**. Researchers estimated that 2,200 fewer violence injuries per month in England and Wales would occur following a 1% increase in alcohol prices above inflation. This increase in pricing could also help address the additional harms caused to disadvantaged groups through alcohol consumption, such as a higher risk of alcohol\-related hospital admission amongst those living in deprived areas **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. 

 **2.2 ‘Have A Word’: motivational advice about alcohol use** 

 a. Where to intervene 

 When alcohol use becomes harmful, there are a number of settings in which at\-risk people encounter authorities, such as healthcare workers and the police, who could give advice or guidance around alcohol consumption. It was not known how effective advice delivered in these particular settings was, or what was the best format for a positive intervention. The Cardiff team proposed that out\-patient clinics, where individuals are receiving follow\-up treatment from A&E visits for alcohol\-related facial injuries, provided an ideal opportunity for an **Alcohol Brief Intervention \(ABI\)** \- a short, evidence\-based, structured conversation about alcohol consumption to motivate the person to reduce their drinking to safer levels. Findings on this intervention, published in 2003, showed that brief advice proved effective when patients attended the out\-patient clinic in the days following an alcohol\-related facial injury, with the percentage of “hazardous drinkers” reducing by more than half \(60% down to 27%\) amongst those receiving a motivational intervention **\[3.4\]**. The Cardiff team’s expertise in this area led to their involvement in designing three clinical trials which assessed emergency departments, GP surgeries and Probation Offices as potential locations for ABIs in the Screening and Intervention Programme for Sensible drinking \(SIPS\) study, led by King’s College London. 

 b. How to intervene 

 The Cardiff team found that although effective as an intervention, ABIs are difficult to embed in emergency clinical settings like A&E, as patients who are inebriated and potentially aggressive are not particularly reflective of their behaviour, or receptive to learning **\[3.5\]**. Furthermore, the traditional ABI training of 2 days was challenging for clinical staff to attend. Following a pilot Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) in 2010, in 2011 the Cardiff team established a longer KTP with the Welsh Government \(WG\) with involvement from Public Health Wales \(PHW\). This KTP was designed to develop and deliver ‘Have a Word’ – an ABI programme in Wales, which launched in January 2013 **\[G3.1\]**. ‘Have a Word’ aimed to encourage health professionals to offer motivational health advice to prompt behaviour changes when patients are most receptive, known as ‘teachable moments’. These ‘moments’ vary according to the speciality of the health professional, making identifying when those might occur a key part of the training. A critical feature of the ‘Have a Word’ programme was that training takes only 2 hours, and includes a ‘train the trainer’ format for wider dissemination. 

#  2.3 ‘Have a Word’ and the UK armed forces 

 Problematic alcohol consumption is also known to be prevalent amongst the UK armed forces, with estimates suggesting that between one to two thirds of armed forces personnel exhibit ‘increased risk’ drinking levels. In 2016 the Cardiff team worked with the Ministry of Defence to pilot the ‘Have a Word’ ABI model together with the WHO’s alcohol consumption harm assessment tool, AUDIT\-C **\[3.6\]**. The research involved establishing service personnel’s alcohol consumption using AUDIT\-C, and then carrying out an ABI following the ‘Have a Word” model if risky drinking behaviour was identified. The assessments and ABIs were carried out by dental professionals during routine mandatory dental inspection, reflecting the Cardiff team’s experience in integrating ABIs into clinical settings **\[3.4\]**. Initially, ‘Have a Word’ was used alongside the full 10\-question AUDIT\-C tool; however, feedback from 20 pilot sites resulted in a shorter, 3\-question version of the tool being used in a larger study, involving 109,900 individuals \(approximately 74% of armed forces personnel\). Of these, 66,784 received a score indicating high risk of alcohol\-related harm, and 63% of these personnel received the ‘Have a Word’ ABI. This was the first example of standardised use of screening and ABIs in a military population anywhere in the world.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  The Cardiff team carried out wide\-ranging research into interventions to reduce harmful drinking. This research has translated into impacts on Welsh Government legislation, public health strategies across the UK, and interventions across the entire British Armed Forces. 

#  4.1 New law on alcohol pricing 

 In July 2014, Moore led a sub\-committee examining minimum unit pricing \(MUP\) for alcohol, as part of a Welsh Government Advisory Panel on Substance Misuse **\[5.1\]**. This was both in his capacity as an expert and as the publicly\-appointed advisor to the Welsh Government on matters relating to alcohol misuse and substance abuse. Panel discussions included Cardiff’s research into the benefits of various alcohol\-reduction policies linked to alcohol affordability, including the reduction of violence\-related emergency department attendance as prices increase **\[5.2, 3.1, 3.2\].** Based on the panel’s findings, the **Public Health \(Minimum Price for Alcohol\) \(Wales\) Bill 2018** was passed **\[5.2\]**. This Bill makes it an offence to supply alcohol anywhere in Wales below the minimum price, calculated based upon MUP \[50p\], percentage strength and alcohol volume, and was enacted in March 2020 **\[5.2\].** A handful of other nations, including Canada and Russia, have minimum pricing policies that are not specifically linked to alcohol units, while the Republic of Ireland has yet to implement minimum unit pricing policies which passed into law in 2018. After Scotland, the new law makes Wales only the second country in the world to both legislate and implement a minimum unit price for alcohol. 

#  4.2 ‘Have a Word’: implementation by UK Public Health Bodies 

 To ensure broad dissemination and use of the ‘Have a Word’ training courses **\[3.5\]**, a training team was set up, with training on ABIs provided across every health board in Wales **\[5.3\]**. Prior to the Cardiff research, ABI training in Wales was previously only delivered to GPs **\[3.4**, **3.5\]**. By August 2016, over 13,000 practitioners from a wide range of Welsh professions and organisations had been trained to deliver the ‘Have a Word’ programme, including nurses, midwives, youth workers, pharmacists, police, and dieticians **\[5.3\]**. The Welsh Government’s *Working Together to Reduce Harm: Substance Misuse Strategy 2015 Annual Report* states that: “The ‘train the trainer’ module of ‘Have a Word’ is firmly established and has been accessed by delegates from primary and secondary care, health and social care, criminal justice, third sector organisations, the police, Royal British Legion, local authorities, Communities First and health boards.” **\[5.4\]**. 

 The National Survey for Wales 2018 recorded a decrease in adults reporting drinking more than weekly guideline amounts, with 18% of adults reporting this behaviour in 2018 compared to 20% in 2016 **\[5.5\]**. Further, Public Health Wales has now incorporated ‘Have a Word’ into its new multi\-topic approach to behaviour change conversations, ‘Make Every Contact Count’ **\[5.3\]**. The 2015\-2016 PHW Operational Plan prioritised the continued use of ABIs, expanding their application to other lifestyle behaviours, specifically smoking and physical activity as well as alcohol use **\[5.6\]**. 

 In 2016, Public Health England \(PHE\) commissioned PHW to pilot the ‘Have a Word’ programme across Yorkshire and Humber, the North East and the South West **\[5.7\]**. Cardiff\-designed training materials purchased by PHE included a structured questionnaire to train healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who would benefit from the brief motivational advice around alcohol use. The aim of this pilot was “ *to refine the training and support materials from ‘Have a Word’ and develop a final set of materials to make available across England to support training and the implementation of IBA \[Alcohol Identification and Brief Advice\] in the NHS and other settings*” **\[5.7\]**. 

 Following the success of this trial, Cardiff’s ‘Have a Word’ resources were incorporated into the 2019 NHS England initiative, the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) framework **\[5.8\]**. This framework forms part of NHS England’s Long Term Plan, and aims to reduce the \~£21B annual cost to society of harmful alcohol consumption **\[5.8, 5.9\]**. The CQUIN framework links the delivery of alcohol brief advice to financial commissioning incentives, and the expectation is that 60,000 “at risk” alcohol users should receive brief advice by the end of 2020 **\[5.9\]**. 

#  4.3 ‘Have a Word’: implementation in the UK armed forces 

 In June 2016, in a joint project with Cardiff researchers, the Ministry of Defence adopted screening risk for alcohol use, alongside provision of brief advice, during mandatory biannual dental checks. Where use of the WHO AUDIT\-C screening tool indicated the need for an intervention, ‘Have a Word’ was used as the brief advice tool. To enable this intervention, over 1,000 personnel across all Defence Primary Healthcare Centres were trained in the delivery of Cardiff’s ‘Have a Word’ brief intervention. The Cardiff team’s ‘train the trainer’ model of delivery was again used to cascade the ‘Have a Word’ training, with 28 military dental professionals trained by the PHW Alcohol Training Lead, using resources developed by the Cardiff team, who in turn cascaded the training to local and overseas dental centres **\[3.6\]**. 

 Since the introduction of the programme, all 140,000 UK armed forces personnel have received the screening at least once, with over 276,000 assessments in total **\[3.6\]**. The Head of Research and Clinical Innovation for the UK Defence Medical Services described the result of introducing the screening programme as *“transformational”* **\[5.10\]**. He highlighted the tangible benefit achieved through use of the ‘Have a Word’ intervention, stating: “ *Very encouragingly, screening in successive dental checks provides evidence that the prevalence of alcohol misuse in this population is declining*” **\[5.10\]**. 

 Cardiff’s research into reducing harm caused by excess consumption of alcohol has been used to support introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol in Wales, alongside national public health initiatives to encourage behaviour change around alcohol misuse, including in both the population and the entirety of the UK’s armed forces.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The ITER tokomak is designed to demonstrate the large\-scale feasibility of fusion energy generation. It depends critically on superconducting materials to carry the large currents which enable magnetic confinement of the plasma. New metrology techniques developed in Durham are able to characterise the properties of the superconducting strand *under operational conditions,* enabling selection for build of only those which meet the stringent requirements. 

 ITER maps directly onto the United Kingdom’s legal commitment to zero net carbon emissions by 2050. The United States Department of Energy concluded that ITER is the most important large\-scale project in the world of the next 20 years.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Hampshire and his group have spent the last two decades in Durham researching new instrumentation and measurement protocols to study the current carrying capacity of superconductors. The critical current density, Jc, of a superconductor, is the maximum current density for lossless conduction. This is completely determined by flux pinning at grain boundaries under realistic operating conditions, as this prevents the heating associated with flux motion. In a detailed series of experimental, theoretical, and computational works, Professor Hampshire demonstrated the relationship between Jc and flux flow at grain boundaries in technologically important polycrystalline superconducting materials. Flux pinning becomes much less effective at high magnetic fields and high strains, giving a critical current density which is less than 1% of the theoretical Cooper pair maximum \[R1\-6\]. 

 From 2000, Hampshire and researchers in Durham designed, built and commissioned the first research instruments capable of measuring the critical current as a function of magnetic field, temperature and strain, *Jc\(B,T,ε\),* in long\-length superconducting strands. These could perform measurements with nV sensitivity with independent control of all the parameters i.e. high magnetic fields, up to 15T \(Durham\) and 28T \(Grenoble\), at cryogenic temperatures from 1.8\-14K, and high currents, up to 2KA and under uniaxial strains from \-1% to \+0.5% \[R1\]. This research led to the current impact case study because the development of this instrument critically enables the study of Jc under the operational conditions expected for the superconducting materials for use in ITER. The novelty and accuracy of the data, together with the associated understanding of flux pinning and low temperature superconductor behaviour \(Ginzburg\-Landau theory\) led to the development of the ‘ *Durham Scaling Law*’, replacing the former standard ‘ *Summers’ scaling law’*, previously used by the fusion energy community. This established Durham as a world\-leading research centre for novel, accurate measurements of *Jc\(B,T,ε\)* \[R2–4\] and for developing an understanding of flux pinning in high field superconductors. This was further recognised in 2005 in research building on the *Jc\(B,T,ε\)* expertise to measure both \(isotropic\) low temperature superconductors and \(anisotropic\) high temperature superconductors \[R4, R5\], funded by a GBP1,600,000 EPSRC grant. 

 Superconducting magnets manufactured from the isotropic low temperature superconductors Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn and NbTi provide the enabling materials technology for the current generation of magnetically confined fusion energy tokamaks. The Hampshire Group has been closely associated with European fusion energy projects and most recently the international ITER project at the CEA Cadarache Centre in Provence. In 2011, Raine and Hampshire set up and managed the European Reference Laboratory \(ERL\) funded by ITER for approximately EUR2,000,000. This has completed several thousand *Jc\(B,T,ε\)* measurements and other cryogenic and physical property measurements of the European superconducting strands needed for the ITER magnets using the facilities and research expertise in the Group. This expertise was further recognised between 2012 and 2018 as the group was part of the original GBP2,400,000 EPSRC Fusion Doctoral Training Network \(EP/K504178/1\) and in 2020, its renewal. Prof. Hampshire also has expertise in magnet design and has recently been granted two patents \(GB2562385, GB2558685\) concerning a novel design for a superconducting magnet for producing part of the toroidal field \(TF\) which forms the basis of new designs of magnets that consider the topology of superconducting magnets in fusion tokamaks \[e.g. R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Superconducting magnets are an essential enabling technology for magnetically confined fusion energy tokamaks. Conventional electromagnets made of copper or aluminium would either melt or be prohibitively expensive to run, both in terms of cost and energy. Such economic realities also underpin the use of superconducting strands \(or wires/cables\) for high\-field magnets used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques \(the basis for Magnetic Resonance Imagers in the health sector\), and in high\-energy particle accelerators, such as at CERN.

However, the technical challenges to control a plasma of sufficiently high energy to sustain a net energy output are immense. The main focus for the worldwide effort in nuclear fusion is currently on magnetic confinement and in particular on the ITER tokamak being built in Southern France. The ITER project is a collaboration between 35 nations \(including China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States\). It will be the world's largest toroidal magnetic fusion device and aims to demonstrate the feasibility of commercial fusion energy. 

 

 Fig. 2: Structure of the superconducting strands. 

The scale of ITER is immense. 10,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, the largest and most integrated superconducting system ever built, with a combined stored magnetic energy of 51 Gigajoules, will produce the magnetic fields that will initiate, confine, shape and control the 10<sup>8</sup>K ITER plasma. There are 18 D\-shaped coils of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn producing a toroidal field **\[E1\]** \(Fig 1\) **,** 10 of which are to be built in Europe, with the other 8 \(\+1 spare\) manufactured in Japan. These, together with the poloidal field \(PF\) coils of NbTi, amount to one third of the estimated USD22billion cost of the tokamak. 

 The magnet technology is based on internally cooled “ *cable\-in\-conduit conductors*”, in which bundled superconducting strands, mixed with copper, are cabled together and contained in a structural steel jacket \(see Fig 2\). These coils will be highly stressed and the reliability of the more than 100,000km of strands used in these superconducting magnets is critical to the progression of the project and to the overall success of ITER. This in turn requires robust, reliable and detailed quality control testing of these materials under functional conditions. This is the key impact generated from the research outputs of Professor Hampshire’s group, given international reach and significance due to ITER. It built on background work by the Durham group on measurements of the superconducting strands for both European and Japanese coils from 2002 to 2011 **\[R2\]**. Durham was then asked to make the data publicly available for the entire fusion community for use in magnet design and modelling. Dr. Mitchell \(Head of ITER Magnet group\) confirms “ *Durham developed accurate techniques to accurately control temperature and strain and for the first time parameterise the full ITER operational space*” **\[E6\]**. This has impacted on the design, the quality assurance/reliability, and the construction processes for ITER. 

 These measurements provided the gold standard in the community and have led to similar facilities being developed at the US government standards laboratory, NIST, by staff trained in Durham **\[E2\]**. *Fusion for Energy* \(F4E\), the agency responsible for the development of fusion energy in Europe, established the *European Reference Laboratory* \(ERL\) at Durham University in 2011 as a contribution to the ITER project. The ERL in Durham has subsequently received more than EUR2,000,000 in funding from F4E between 2011 and 2018 to provide thousands of characterisation measurements of the superconducting strands to be used in the 10 \(of 18 \+1 spare\) huge TF magnets/coils and one of the PF coils in the ITER magnet system **\[E7\]**. These measurements are critical and have ongoing impact at ITER \- if one TF coil fails, the topology of the plasma and vacuum jacket within the TF magnets means that inserting a new TF coil would cause a 2\-year delay for repairs/replacement. By January 2020, the measurements for F4E were completed. 

 This work in Durham included a formal quality assurance process for F4E. This comprises an independent verification of the strand supplier performance tests and is critical to acceptance of the superconducting strands prior to incorporation into the ITER magnet cables by the cable manufacturers. The experience in 2008 at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN **\[E3\]** shows that it takes only one magnet component failure to bring a machine of this complexity to a halt. Strands that do not pass the Durham tests are not used in the ITER tokamak. 

 Durham University’s research and collaboration with F4E secured reliable operation of the TF and PF coils, and informed decisions leading to improvements in productivity and resource\-use efficiency: 

  

1.  The quality of the superconducting composite strands is exceptionally reliant on the quality of the heat treatments used to diffuse the Sn in the Nb wire to produce the superconducting Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn. However, this can also lead to unwanted diffusion into the high purity copper within the strands. Key verification tests undertaken by the Durham ERL between March 2013 and June 2014 identified several strands where the copper impurity level violated specification, contrary to supplier’s data. This resulted in a review and round\-robin tests were initiated by F4E and conducted by Durham, Twente, CERN, and the ITER Organization, which confirmed the Durham results. From 2014 onwards this has resulted in F4E avoiding strands which would have compromised the reliable operation of the European TF coils in the ITER tokamak. Durham’s analysis allowed F4E to ensure the stability of the European TF coils resulting in what Thierry Boutboul, Senior Technical Officer, described as a ‘ *technical positive impact*’ **\[E4\]**.

 2.   The brittle nature of the Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn polycrystalline compound means that the wires have to be baked in ovens the same size of the resulting coils \(see Fig 1 and 3\), on size scales which make it very difficult to ensure temperature homogeneity. The magnet coils themselves cannot be tested before assembly into ITER, so instead test samples are placed all around the coil in the oven. Durham produced, supplied and measured the critical current in hundreds of these test samples between October 2012 and May 2018. F4E said: ‘ *Thanks to Durham work and its very collaborative attitude the homogeneity of both … ovens has been confirmed, which is a technical positive impact*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 3.    In 2015, operational technical difficulties led to discrepancies in some of heat treatments, and it was not clear whether these coils would meet specifications. The Durham group simulated these and demonstrated that there was no impact on the Jc properties of the coil, which led F4E to comment that ‘ *I would like to stress the reactivity and the collaboration spirit of Durham staff which enabled F4E and ITER IO to get this confirmation and not to waste time … but to continue with the fabrication of the coil. This had a clear schedule positive impact on the project.*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 Durham’s research activities in functional metrology of superconductors continues to have a major impact on the ITER construction programme. The immediate impact is technical, but has significant political consequences. ITER commissioning has spiralled away from its initial 2016 schedule, with first plasma now expected in December 2025 and the budget is quadruple its original size **\[E5\]**, compounding political sensitivities. Thus, maintaining the speed of construction, while ensuring the reliability and stability of the magnets, so that at switch\-on plasma containment is achieved is crucial to the future political will and decision making of the collaborating countries in the decision to build fusion\-based electricity power stations.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Twenty percent of the population experience visual stress. It impedes reading and aggravates symptoms associated with cortical hyperexcitability, impairing quality of life and economic activity. Wilkins’ research has identified the mechanisms of visual stress. Working with two companies, he **developed and improved products that alleviate symptoms** in those who suffer from visual stress and its consequences: Coloured page overlays \(Crossbow Education\) are sold across 16 countries, **yielding continued commercial benefits.** Products are now used in **70% of UK schools** improving reading in children. Business settings **benefit from research informed training courses** that help identify visual stress in employees and support them with **resources,** increasing **workplace productivity**. The **Intuitive Colorimeter** \(Cerium Visual Technologies\) **has been updated to an electronic version patented in 2017** and **is now used by Optometrists** \[text removed for publication\] to prescribe precision tinted lenses to individuals who suffer more acute symptoms. Precision tinted lenses enable Optometrists worldwide to **deliver positive outcomes to thousands of people**, widening their professional practice and improving users’ quality of life.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Visual stress refers to the perceptual distortion and discomfort that can occur on exposure to visual stimuli such as flickering lights, strongly contrasting colours and spatially repetitive patterns, such as text or supermarket shelves. It causes discomfort to one in five people in the general population and has particularly negative consequences for individuals with sensory difficulties, such as people with dyslexia, autism spectrum disorders and recurrent migraine. 

 Wilkins has studied the psychobiological aspects of vision and visual stress for over four decades. Since 2000, his work at Essex has characterised the visual stimulation underlying visual stress, explored the neural mechanisms involved and found new methods of treating symptoms. His research has been supported by competitive funding agencies \(Wellcome Trust, ESRC, MRC\) \[ **G1**, **G2, G3**\] **.** 

 <ins> **A. Coloured Overlays</ins>** 

 Wilkins examined the use of coloured plastic sheets as text overlays to reduce the perceptual distortions and discomfort that can impede reading. He showed that for those experiencing visual stress, coloured overlays improved reading speed and clarity of text. In a sample of 12 mainstream schools, 50% of children report improved clarity of text and 5% of children were shown to read at least 25% more quickly using an overlay \[ **R1**\]. Overlays in grey did not improve reading speed, ruling out a placebo effect \(e.g., increased motivation to read better/faster\). Wilkins demonstrated that to achieve such effects readers required an appropriate, individually selected colour \[ **R2**\] and that packs of overlays without a sufficiently large palette of colours do not provide a benefit \[ **R3**\]. These findings informed the development of coloured overlay products \(e.g., page and monitor overlays\) and visual stress resources manufactured and sold originally by i.o.o. Sales and Cerium Visual Technologies \(CVT\) and subsequently Crossbow Education \(CE\). 

 <ins> **B. Precision Tinted Lenses</ins>** 

 Visual stress symptoms are related to hyper\-neural activity in response to sensory stimulation, for example inappropriately firing visual neurons upon seeing text, a phenomenon particularly pronounced in those suffering from conditions associated with cortical hyperexcitability \(e.g., autism spectrum disorders, migraine, epilepsy\) \[ **R4**, **G1**\]. For these affected individuals, visual stress occurs not only during reading which can be addressed with coloured page overlays, but may also occur in response to a range of daily\-life stimuli, thus requiring a more *constant* use of coloured filters. 

 Wilkins examined the use of coloured spectacle lenses as another means of treating the symptoms of visual stress. His research with coloured light and coloured lenses demonstrates the benefit is optimal only if the colour of the lens is selected individually and with precision \[ **R4**, **R5**, **G1**, **G2**\]. For example, improvements in reading speed using precision tinted lenses are only achieved if there is a close match between the user’s ideal colour and that used to tint the lenses. Wilkins’ research identified the range and number of colours needed to provide benefits to users. It showed that at least a thousand tints are needed, and how this can be achieved through the combination of appropriately selected trial lenses. Wilkins used his research findings \[ **R1\-R5**\] to develop the Intuitive Colorimeter \(IC\) to enable optometrists to prescribe the optimal colour of tinted lenses rapidly and with precision. Colorimeters illuminate text with coloured light and permit the separate manipulation of hue, saturation and luminance. Observers can select a colour that is optimal for clarity of vision, which guides the provision of the ‘precision tinted lenses’, via a protocol established by Wilkins. Wilkins’ research \[ **R4, R5**\] also identified the importance of the precise and reliable replication of the colours established in the colorimeter in the selection of appropriate lens tints. 

 Wilkins’ research has linked precision tinted lenses to reduced visual discomfort and associated symptoms for those experiencing migraines as precision tints help normalise enlarged cortical haemodynamic responses triggered when viewing uncomfortable images, an effect not found with other tints \[ **R6**, **G2**\]. Precision tinted lenses were also shown to improve visual stress symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorders \[ **R7**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Context:** Up to 20% of the population are affected, to some extent, by visual stress \[ **S1a**\]. This is **more than 13,000,000** people in the UK alone \[ **S2a**\]. Visual stress can prevent children from learning to read and is a major component of photophobia \(light sensitivity\) contributing to migraine. The economic costs of illiteracy and migraine are GBP80,000,000,000 and GBP3,420,000,000 per year in the UK alone \[ **S2b**\]. 

 **Continuation Statement** 

 The REF2014 case demonstrated that the research described in Section 2 achieved impact by providing **two innovative solutions to alleviate visual stress** and its consequences: coloured overlays and precision tinted spectacle lenses designed with an intuitive colorimeter. **Since August 2013** there has **been continued commercial success** of the coloured overlays, **a wider uptake of products in schools and additional uptake in businesses**. An **improved, electronic version of the IC** has been **developed, patented, and successfully launched** in 2018. The new version allows for **quicker and more accurate** testing helping optometrists to reach individuals who previously could not easily endure a longer examination. The new design is easier to use enabling CVT to **expand their clientele**.

 <ins> **A3. Coloured overlays and</ins> <ins>newly launched</ins> <ins>CPD courses</ins> <ins>now extend the reach to employers and employees in UK business settings</ins> <ins></ins><ins>**</ins> 

 CE’s corporate arm, Visual Stress Solutions \(VSS\) provides overlays, visual stress resources and continuing professional development \(CPD\) courses to enable employers to identify and support employees with visual stress, a barrier to workplace productivity \[ **S6a**\]. By making ‘reasonable adjustments’ to improve employees’ visual stress symptoms employers can ensure Equality Act compliance \[ **S6b**\]. CE’s CEO testifies that in **2018** **they added CPD courses** to their offering which are **‘ **based on Prof Wilkins’ research** at the University of Essex*’ \[ **R1\-3**\]. Since 2018, it has already enabled **over 400 representatives from organisations** including the NHS, Police, Fire Service, Prison Service, MOD, Santander, RAC, and Western Power to ‘ **identify visual stress** in the workplace and **make the most effective treatment recommendation** using our Visual Stress Assessment Pack*’ states CE’s CEO \[ **S3**\], adding, ‘ *The **huge difference this makes to individuals’ work and home life** is evidenced by the positive feedback we receive from those undertaking our courses’* \[ **S3**\]. The Head of Equality & Well\-being, Fire Service, comments: ‘ *I now have the skills to take back to my workplace to be able to carry out Visual Stress assessments with confidence. Since the training I have carried out a number of assessments, the most recent assessment resulted in an increased reading speed of 23%’* \[ **S6c**\] **.** Employees using overlays say ‘ *At last\! I can read my emails’, ‘I can read a lot quicker*’ \[ **S6c**\]. The CEO concludes ‘ **Working with Prof** **Wilkins** and applying the research undertaken at Essex, enabled Crossbow VSS **to help 1000s of people** in the workplace by alleviating visual stress through simple affordable methods and technologies*’ \[ **S3**\]. 

 <ins> **B1. Cerium Visual Technologies</ins> <ins>improve the IC and</ins> <ins>benefit from</ins> <ins>increased</ins> <ins>commercial success through widespread use of the IC to prescribe precision tinted lenses**</ins> 

 
Wilkins’ research \[ **R4\-6**\] has underpinned the continuing development of the Mark 2, 3 and 4 versions of the IC \[ **S7a\-d**, **S8**, **P1**\] released in 2002, 2009, and 2018 respectively, manufactured and sold by CVT. The MD of CVT states that the company ‘ *was founded on, and continues to grow around, the insights from research conducted by Professor Wilkins’*. Through a KTP with Essex in 2014 led by Wilkins \[ **S9**\], **CVT improved the IC** \[ **S7b**\]. An **international patent** was filed for the **Mark 4, known as the Curve, in 2016** \[ **P1**\], following a 2014 UK application. The advanced IC enabled reduced manufacturing costs and by simplifying and semi\-automating the process of selecting the appropriate tint, facilitated a more streamlined assessment process \[ **S8**\]. During the KTP Wilkins applied the insights from his underpinning research in visual stress and its treatment with colour \[ **R4\-R6**\]. On the development of the Curve the CVT MD states ‘ **Wilkins’ research** at Essex \[ **R4, R5**\] on the use of the Colorimeter **provided a scientific basis** for best practice in treating visual stress through colour, which was utilised in the \[KTP\] project*’ adding ‘ *During the KTP Wilkins worked closely with the Associate to **apply Essex expertise in visual stress and its treatment with colour to develop the new Colorimeter**’ \[ **S8**\] *.* 

 The IC is in widespread use worldwide \[ **S10a**\]. The MD states: ‘ **ICs have been sold and are in use across North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East** \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S8**\]. The Curve’s digital design necessitates less practitioner training to prescribe lenses, enabling high street chains such as Specsavers to use it, **widening CVT’s customer base** \[ **S10b**\]. \[text removed for publication\] The Curve was shortlisted for the **Association of Optometrists product of the year** \(2019\) \[ **S7e**\]. 

 <ins> **B2. Optometrists across the world use the Curve to prescribe precision tinted lenses to more diverse customer base**</ins> Wilkins’ body of research \[ **R4 \- R6**\] was foundational for the Colorimeter **patent** \[ **P1**\]. The latest version of the IC, the Curve, allows for quick, less straining, individual prescriptions. The CVT MD testifies *‘The IC enables \[practices\] to offer patients something unique **, diversifying their practice, and opening up new patient referral streams**.’* and adds ‘ *the **Curve’s new automated design, allows for quicker testing, enabling individuals such as those with neurological conditions \(e.g., autism, migraine\), who can benefit from precision tinted lenses** \[ **R6\-7**\] but would previously have experienced discomfort during the longer examination, to be prescribed lenses*’ \[ **S8**\]. Wilkins research \[ **R4\-7**\] underpins the Society for Coloured Lens Prescribers \(SCLP\) training programme for eye care practitioners supporting them to use the IC in practice \[ **S8**\]. **Since 2013, an additional 78 lectures/training events were run across 14 countries,** including France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Korea and Spain. This represents over 180 hours of CPD for practitioners \[ **S11**\]. 

 Optometrists in the UK, Australia, and the USA confirm that the IC offers a valuable addition to their services \[ **S12a**\] which could not have been achieved without the underpinning body of Essex research leading to the IC development: ‘ *Colorimetry provides an additional tool in helping solve patient problems which cannot be resolved by simple prescriptions alone*’ Optometrist UK. *‘The ability to prescribe precision tinted lenses has added another dimension to my optometry practice. I have been able to help patients with difficulty reading text and migraine sufferers. For the first time Australian Optometrists have the opportunity to prescribe with precision to patients who suffer from Visual Stress’.* Optometrist, Australia. ‘ *The Intuitive Colorimeter has been a valuable addition to our practice \[…\] the Colorimeter is another powerful tool in the rehabilitation or functional optometrists’ arsenal*.’ Optometrist, USA. The *C*linical Editor, Optometry Today found the IC ‘ *invaluable for prescribing precision tints to manage the adverse effects of visual stress in a range of neurological conditions’* adding that it *‘allowed me to develop a niche area of clinical interest.*’

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Air pollution is Europe’s largest public health risk, responsible for more than 500,000 deaths every year, and costing the UK alone some £20 billion annually. Pioneering research by Professor Helen ApSimon and Dr Audrey de Nazelle of Imperial College London is addressing this complex issue, informing international agreements and cost\-effective national strategies to reduce emissions, while incorporating previously overlooked dimensions, including local processes and entrenched human behaviours. 

 **Beneficiaries**: National and international policymakers, wider society. 

 **Significance & Reach**: The research has directly supported new targets, policies and guidelines for reducing human exposure to air pollution in the UK, Europe and beyond, potentially benefiting billions of people worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As part of the UN Economic Commission for Europe \(UNECE\) Convention on Long\-Range Transboundary Air Pollution \(the Air Convention\) and the Task Force for Integrated Assessment Modelling \(TFIAM\) from 2000 until the present, alongside the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis \(IIASA\), Professor ApSimon projected pollutant emissions across Europe and their atmospheric dispersion and deposition, critical loads as criteria for ecosystem damage, and potential cost\-effective measures to reduce emissions and their costs **\[1\]**. The successful development of the Gothenburg protocols by the UNECE to reduce air pollutants depended critically on such integrated assessment modelling to assess cost\-effective scenarios for reducing air pollution in Europe **\[1, 2\]**. Building on this work, ApSimon focused over the last 10 years on detailed modelling of national strategies to achieve compliance with targets set in the UNECE Gothenburg protocols and parallel national emission ceilings set by the EC **\[3\]**. 

 More recently, ApSimon has shown how to integrate urban and local dimensions, such as traffic and street\-scale urban form, into overall air pollution control strategies. This work illustrated how real\-world exposures may deviate from EU standards, leading to non\-compliance with legislated NO2 concentrations **\[4, 5\]**. Her current work contributes to Defra’s Clean Air Strategy, with a special focus on PM2.5 as the pollutant with the greatest health effects. She is also contributing to the development of targets for improvement in the new UK Environment Bill, working closely with government on post Brexit projections and synergies between air quality and climate measures. ApSimon now heads the National Integrated Assessment Modelling \(NIAM\) activities within TFIAM, bringing together parallel work in other countries and providing knowledge transfer to eastern European countries outside the EU. 

 Her analyses of air pollution exposure pathways at local levels have shown that polices for protecting human health may be amplified or diminished by the mediating effects of individual behaviours. There is an urgent need for integrated health impact assessment and epidemiological models to link national and international policies to their effects on individual behaviours, exposures and health. 

 de Nazelle’s emerging work is focused on understanding how the behaviours of individuals interact to determine personal exposures to air pollution **\[6\]**. She is accounting for individual activity patterns and evaluating trade\-offs in risks and benefits of outdoor physical activity based on data from wearable sensors to underpin new models for individual activity patterns and associated exposure. Her work, for instance as Co\-I on the EU\-funded Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches \(PASTA\) project **\[7\]**, makes the case for systems thinking in urban policies that tackle air pollution, by considering multiple outcomes including effects of physical activity, traffic injuries, noise, or greenspace exposures and is already influencing national and international policy.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Air pollution has long been a serious public health problem. Over 500,000 preventable deaths occur annually across Europe due to air pollution, making it the continent’s largest environmental health risk **\[A\]**. In the UK alone, air pollution causes up to 40,000 deaths each year, costing the economy about £20 billion annually **\[B\]**. 

 Pioneering research by ApSimon and de Nazelle is transforming policy in the UK and internationally, paving the way for new, more effective solutions. Specifically, their work has impacted air pollution policy in two main ways: 

1.  by informing new, more effective, strategies for compliance with legally binding international emission ceilings; 

1.  by incorporating previously overlooked dimensions, including local factors and individual behaviour. 

###  Strategies for Compliance 

 The UNECE Convention on Long\-range Transboundary Air Pollution is the only legally\-binding regional agreement of its kind in the world **\[C\] \[2\]**. ApSimon’s pioneering approach to integrated assessment modelling **\[1, 2\]** supported governments in the UK and Europe to implement new strategies for cost effective compliance. These have been crucial in abating pollution levels, which have fallen by about 10% over the last 7 years **\[1\]**. The Deputy Director of Defra Air Quality & Industrial Emissions, states that: *“to design and evaluate effective policies, we need robust and agile evidence … \[ApSimon’s work\] plays a highly significant contribution to our underpinning evidence base”* **\[D\]**. A key contribution was ApSimon’s development of the UK Integrated Assessment Model, UKIAM **\[3\]**. The Deputy Director of Defra Air Quality & Industrial Emissions describes it “ *as a unique capability for modelling future air pollution scenarios for the UK … \[enabling\] the assessment of the implications for health and natural ecosystems...* **” \[D\]**. 

 ApSimon’s recent work for Defra focusses on reducing annual mean concentrations of fine particulate PM2.5 as part of the Government’s Clean Air Strategy **\[E\].** Her extensive analysis of emissions of SO2, NOx, NH3, VOCs and PM2.5 summarised in the ground\-breaking report on reduction of exposure to PM2.5 **\[E\]** provided the evidence to justify the UK Government’s ambitious commitment to achieving the WHO guideline of 10 ug.m<sup>\-3</sup>. Defra confirms ApSimon’s contribution, writing: *“the UKIAM model has been vital in enabling Defra to set out its ambitions to reduce exposure to fine particulate PM2.5 … The Imperial College Team and the model have a pivotal role to play in setting these targets and in ensuring that ambition is based on sound science.”* **\[D\]**. They conclude that: **“** *It is not overstating the fact that the team has a vital role to play in supporting development of policies … by providing the underpinning evidence to enable targeted reductions in exposure to fine particulate matter.”* **\[D\]** 

 As the lead of the UK Focal Centre for Integrated Assessment, ApSimon’s work underpinned development of the Gothenburg protocols to control transboundary air pollution in Europe and the National Emissions Ceilings Directive of the EC. The co\-chair of the UNECE Task Force on Integrated Assessment Modelling, states that ApSimon is *“playing a leading role in strengthening the network of national integrated assessment modellers, which is aimed exchanging information … within the UNECE on understanding of emissions, measures to reduce them, and ways of evaluating the health benefits.”* **\[F\]** 

###  Local Factors and Individual Behaviour 

 A theme in the research at Imperial is that technological transformations alone are insufficient to address air pollution. In particular, as shown in **\[4\]** and **\[5\]**, because national\- and continental\-scale policies often fail to account for local factors and individual decision\-making, real\-world exposures may not comply with legislated NO2 concentrations **\[4, 5\]**. By integrating urban and local dimensions such as traffic and street\-scale urban form, ApSimon’s **\[4, 5\]** work showed that local processes can amplify or diminish the effectiveness of air pollution policies. 

 Her colleague, De Nazelle, has extended this work, investigating the trade\-offs in individual decisions, particularly to walk and cycle instead of using polluting forms of transportation, showing they can reduce air pollution levels, improve health through increased physical activity, and reduce noise, traffic injuries and greenhouse gas emissions. De Nazelle influenced the transport appraisal by the UK Department for Transport through her report **\[7, G\]** that led Public Health England to conclude based on partly her work that, “ *…that addressing air pollution can contribute to broader benefits, in particular through increasing physical activity levels in the population*” **\[B\]**. The Director for Health Protection for Public Health England, confirms De Nazelle’s contribution: **“** *We have specifically integrated Dr de Nazelle’s findings – in particular those produced during the current REF period, i.e. since August 2013 \- in our reports and guidance material such as: Review of Interventions to Improve Outdoor Air Quality and Public Health; Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 2017; NICE guideline Physical Activity: Walking and Cycling; Cycling and Walking for Individual and Population Health Benefits; Spatial Planning for Health \[and\] have also sought Dr de Nazelle’s expertise directly as an advisor to our work reviewing interventions to improve air quality and public health.”* **\[B\]** Recently PHE has focused on walking and cycling strategies and that “ *Dr de Nazelle’s work has been a key contributor to this agenda, which has led to successful uptake by local and national governments of active travel policies*.” **\[B\]** 

 de Nazelle’s approach has resulted in new guidelines and policies internationally. She was Co\-I on the EU PASTA project, which contributed to a sea\-change in how active mobility is perceived and promoted in policy and public discourse. PASTA outputs were cited in global policy documents **\[H\].** The outputs of her PASTA project led to the creation of WHO’s HEAT air pollution module, used by local policy makers internationally to decide on transport investments **\[I\]**. The WHO complied a set of 24 case studies across Europe which demonstrated the impact HEAT has had to promote healthy active travel policies **\[I\]**. One such example was Transport for London’s use of HEAT to estimate that health made up two thirds of the benefits of their project which reduced space for cars **\[I\]**. Beyond HEAT, De Nazelle’s work has been cited in WHO reports and guidance material including the *Global Report on Urban Health* \(2016\), *Environmental Risks of Cities in the European Region* \(2017\), *Preventing Disease through Healthy Environments* \(2016\), *Protecting Health in Europe from Climate Change* \(2017\), *Promoting Health, Preventing Disease* \(2015\), *Health as the Pulse of the New Urban Agenda* \(2016\) **\[I\]**. Cycling networks and active travel infrastructure have been expanded in all PASTA case study cities **\[I\]**. The WHO Head of Office reports that, “ *expansion of the cycling network in European cities could achieve up to 25% of cycling mode share, which in turn could save more than 10,000 lives \(based on estimates of 167 cities\)*” **\[I\]**. Confirming de Nazelle’s contribution, they add that “ *ambitious strategies and major funding have been announced in the past years to promote cycling in particular, directly and importantly influenced by de Nazelle’s work…*’ **\[I\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The application of X\-ray crystallography to the screening of small molecule fragments for protein binding, initiated in the Departments of Biochemistry and Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, led to the structure\-guided drug discovery approach implemented at the company Astex. Astex has used this methodology to discover two new highly successful anti\-cancer drugs that appeared on the market in 2017 \(Kisqali for breast cancer\) and 2019 \(Balversa for urothelial cancer\). The fragment\-based approach is now used by most major pharmaceutical companies, and over 40 compounds discovered using fragments have reached clinical trials. Astex currently employs 140 people and has a turnover of GBP 72,000,000. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Tom Blundell, in collaboration with Chris Abell in the Department of Chemistry and Harren Jhoti from the company Astex, pioneered the use of small fragments in drug discovery. Their work at the University of Cambridge using X\-ray crystallography to screen small molecule fragments binding to proteins led to Fragment\-Based Drug Discovery \(FBDD\), which has revolutionised drug discovery and is now used throughout the pharmaceutical industry. 

 **Fragment\-based drug discovery \(FBDD\)** 

 FBDD is a method for finding lead compounds as part of the drug discovery process. In traditional high throughput screening \(HTS\), molecules with high affinity binding are sought, requiring libraries of up to a million large drug\-like molecules; in FBDD, much smaller molecules, such as small, organic molecules with molecular weight of < 300 Da, are identified that may bind only weakly to the drug target. These chemical fragments can then be elaborated or combined to produce larger molecules with higher affinity. This method means that a library of only hundreds of small fragments is required and results in a more efficient method than HTS. 

 The team realized that high\-throughput X\-ray crystallography could provide a powerful method for determining high\-resolution three\-dimensional structures of fragments bound to protein targets by screening multiple crystals of target proteins. This allows identification of those small molecules that bind, and their position and orientation at the binding site can be defined. This had the added advantage of identifying which other molecules might bind nearby, thus facilitating combining the small molecules to make higher affinity compounds. This idea was explored by soaking single protein crystals in concentrated solutions of fragments to initiate binding, then demonstrating that chemical elaboration of the fragment could produce drug\-like molecules. By March 2001, the proof\-of\-principle experiments were in place, and the use of X\-ray crystallography to carry out fragment screening for drug discovery was described in two highly influential papers published in 2002 \[R1, R2\]. Based on these results, GBP 28 million in investments was secured in 2001 and Astex established their first research laboratory on the Cambridge Science Park. Blundell and Abell have collaborated closely with Astex over many years, working on solutions to challenges in the practical implementation of X\-ray based FBDD. 

 **Fragment linking** 

 The early work in 2000/2001 described above considered fragment growing in which fragments are elaborated, guided by structure, to pick up additional interactions with the protein main\-chain and sidechains in the binding site, but then focused more on fragment linking, when different fragment binding sites are co\-located in the same pocket of the protein structure. As part of a Blundell and Abell collaboration targeting tuberculosis using FBDD, a comparative analysis in 2009 explored the relative merits of fragment linking and fragment growing in the rapid development of enzyme inhibitors \[R3\]. X\-ray crystallography methods were complemented by a nuclear magnetic resonance \(NMR\) approach in 2010 to identify the most promising fragment linking strategy exploiting inter\-fragment Nuclear Overhauser Effects \(NOEs\) \[R4\]. 

 **Targeting protein\-protein interactions** 

 In 2013, the Blundell lab defined structures of complex multi\-protein systems; these proved to have small pockets at the interfaces, usually in shallow grooves. With the Abell group, they showed that these could be targeted by fragment\-based screening, even though these interactions were previously considered undruggable \[R5\]. This has encouraged others, including Astex, to look at interfaces, in addition to enzyme active sites, as possible drug targets. 

 **Hotspot mapping** 

 In 2016, the Blundell lab developed a computational approach that samples atomic hotspots \(locations that are crucial for ligand binding\) with three simple molecular fragment probes comprising aromatic rings with substitutions by a hydrogen\-bond donor, by a hydrogen\-bond acceptor or by a lipophilic group. The resulting fragment hotspot maps specifically highlight fragment\-binding sites within potential pharmacophores \[R6\]. They provide a visual guide within the binding pocket, allowing medicinal chemists to grow the molecule to make further interactions and alerting them to suboptimal interactions within the original hit. 

 The research undertaken by Blundell, Abell and Astex has led to significant commercial impact, resulting in new drugs being developed and approved for treatment of two types of cancer, as explained further in section 4.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Adoption of FBDD by the pharmaceutical industry** 

 The structure\-guided FBDD approach, pioneered by Blundell, Abell and Jhoti through the foundation of Astex, has led to the widespread adoption of this technology throughout the pharmaceutical industry, changing the way that drug discovery is carried out. The approach has become so embedded in the industry that there are now dedicated structural FBDD groups within most major pharmaceutical companies \[E1\], including AstraZeneca, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Abbvie \[E2\]. By 2018, over 40 compounds were or had been in clinical development due to the uptake of this technology \[E2\]. 

 **Astex** 

 The company \(named sequentially Astex Technology, Astex Therapeutics and now Astex Pharmaceuticals\) was originally founded by Professors Blundell and Abell and Dr Jhoti to exploit FBDD using X\-ray crystallography. Since its foundation in 1999, Astex has positioned itself as a world\-leading pharmaceutical company in FBDD, and in September 2013 this was demonstrated when it was acquired by Otsuka Pharmaceutical for USD 866,000,000 \[E3\]. The company employs 140 people and in 2018 had a turnover of GBP 72,200,000 \[E1\]. Blundell remains on the Astex Board which ensures a continuing dynamic exchange of ideas between the Blundell laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry and Astex \[E4\]. The original 2002 papers set the manifesto for how Astex would implement FBDD using X\-ray crystallography \[R1, R2\]. Astex continues to be a world\-leader in FBDD with a strong proprietary clinical pipeline targeting cancer and diseases of the Central Nervous System. This has led to three drugs being taken to market, as detailed below, along with another five currently in clinical trials \[E5\], one of which \(ASTX660\) was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in 2020 for the treatment of T\-cell Lymphomas \[E6\]. 

 **Drugs in the market** 

 **Kisqali®** 

 In 2017, Astex’s first drug, Kisqali®, also called Ribociclib or LEE011, was launched by Novartis \[E7\]. Kisqali® is an inhibitor of the cyclin\-dependent kinases CDK4/6 and is used in combination with another drug, Letrozole, as a first\-line treatment of an advanced form of breast cancer called hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor\-2 negative, HR\+/HER2\-. Kisqali® was discovered as part of a collaboration between Astex and Novartis in 2005, and a key step was the determination of the crystal structure of CDK4 by scientists at Astex \[E7\]. The compound was taken through preclinical and clinical development by Novartis, and gained approval for commercialization in 75 countries \[E7\] including approval by the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) \(March 2017\) and by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) \(August 2017\) \[E7\]. Sales of Kisqali® for the 2019 financial year were USD 480,000,000 \[E8. In June 2019 Novartis published clinical trial data showing a significant increase in survival rate for patients treated with Kisqali® and Letrozole. Survival rates at 42 months were 70.2% for the Kisqali® combination therapy compared to 46.0% for endocrine therapy alone \[E9\]. The Chief Executive at Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now said “... this combination treatment can offer patients invaluable extra time before their disease progresses – time to live well and continue with day\-to\-day activities such as working for as long as possible. This option could also help delay the need for chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects it can bring” \[E10\]. 

 **Balversa™** 

 Another Astex clinical candidate, Balversa™, \(also called Erdafitinib\) was so successful in Phase 2 clinical trials that it was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the US FDA in 2018 for the treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer, the sixth most common type of cancer in the USA \[E7, E11\]. This designation led to rapid review and approval of the drug for marketing in the USA in April 2019 \[E7\]. Balversa™ was discovered using FBDD by Astex as part of a collaboration with Janssen which commenced in June 2008 to identify novel, small molecule inhibitors of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor \(FGFR\) kinase. Janssen was responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of Balversa™ \[E11\], which is the first personalized treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer \[E7\]. 

 The work on FBDD by Professors Blundell and Abell and Dr Jhoti has created a shift in the way pharmaceutical companies discover new lead compounds for drug discovery. It has led to the creation of jobs including 140 at Astex alone, generated a large contribution to the economy, including USD 866,000,000 for the sale of Astex and USD 480,000,000 for Kisqali sales in 2019\-2020, and the approval in 75 countries of three drugs that are creating a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of patients with breast and urothelial cancer and leukemia.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The introduction, nature and scope of lobbying regulation – the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016 – in Scotland has been shaped by Dinan’s research on lobbying and political communication. 

 Ethnographic research and knowledge exchange work helped build the case for statutory regulation, responding to calls for a more transparent politics following devolution. Research established a framework for regulation that both informed the demands of transparency campaigners and highlighted the need to avoid loopholes. 

 Nearly a third of registrants under the recently introduced disclosure system reflect categories recommended through Dinan’s research. This accounts for a significant proportion of lobbying activity now disclosed, leading to a substantial improvement in lobbying transparency in Scotland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A key finding of the research was that devolved Scotland was not as 'open' and transparent as the rhetoric surrounding Scottish politics suggested, and that in particular there was a need for lobbying transparency to enhance democratic accountability \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). The research also evidenced the profound problems with lobbying self\-regulation, and informed subsequent knowledge exchange work on statutory approaches to this issue. The work also highlighted the difficulty that many voluntary and third sector organisations experienced in relation to lobbying disclosure and the challenges that demands for transparency placed on civil society groups. This is important because the legislative proposals for a Scottish lobbying register had to be designed to cater proportionately for a wide variety of lobbying organisations and seek to meet public accountability concerns. 

 The research underpinning impact in the current REF cycle comprises an ongoing programme of research and knowledge exchange dating from 2000 to the present. Dinan’s work on lobbying transparency has involved extensive and sustained research and knowledge exchange activities with policy makers and civil society groups \(in Scotland, UK, and EU\). This research informed deliberation on lobbying disclosure in Scotland. Dinan’s ethnographic research on lobbying organisations and lobbying regulation in Scotland was designed and conducted at Stirling \( **R1**, **R2**\), with impacts occurring and further underpinned by research produced \( **R4**\) after he re\-joined Stirling in the current REF period. 

 The initial fieldwork \(2000\-2003\) on Scottish political communication comprised extended fieldwork and observation of the developing lobbying industry around the new Scottish Parliament, up until 2003. It involved 73 interviews with various corporate and voluntary sector lobbyists, public servants, and elected representatives. It also drew upon participant observation at more than 70 official, public, and private meetings for those involved in public affairs in Scotland. This research was supplemented by extensive media monitoring and analysis of lobbying in popular and trade press \( **R1**, **R3**\). During this fieldwork the Scottish Parliament Standards Committee started an investigation of lobbying. Initial research findings were submitted as written evidence to the Holyrood inquiry, and the research team were called to give evidence before the Committee \( **R3**\). The research team were the only academics then advocating a register based around full disclosure by *all* lobbyists, including commercial consultants, in\-house corporate lobbyists as well as charities and civil society organisations. This policy engagement was built upon extensive fieldwork and led to the research team developing recommendations to underpin a lobbying disclosure system for the Scottish polity. This had not been part of the original research design, but was developed in response to the unanticipated opportunity to engage with policy makers and stakeholders on the question of how best the Scottish Parliament as a political institution should handle relations with outside interests. 

 The second phase of the research on lobbying in Scotland \(2014\-2018\) has focused on examining lessons to be drawn from other legislatures with lobbying disclosure systems, and the quality and utility of lobbying disclosures for enhancing democratic accountability \( **R4**\). This work also considers the opportunities afforded by new media and communication technologies to make information on lobbying available in a timely manner to help inform media and civil society groups to play a watchdog role in relation to efforts to influence public policy. Dinan organised and convened an expert policy seminar in Stirling in November 2015 to disseminate the latest research and practice evidence, bringing together regulators and academics from the EU and US with the bill team designing the Scottish legislation, as well as members of the Scottish Parliament committee scrutinising the legislation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

-  The impact here relates to both policy development and legislation in regard to the regulation of lobbying in Scotland, and impact on the submissions and advocacy strategies of civil society organisations in relation to lobbying transparency. ESRC funded research on lobbying and Public Relations was popularised in the media and in policy circles including via official consultations into lobbying \(R3 & E1, E3a & b\) with identifiable effects on all of the bodies noted. 

 **Impact: The Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016** 

-  Dinan \(and colleagues then at Stirling\) were the only academics to argue for a statutory lobbying register in Scotland in 2001 \(R3 & E1\) and amongst a small group in the EU. The effect of this work is acknowledged to be significant by policy actors. 

 **Initiating the legislation** 

-  The pathway to legislation – the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016 – that created a statutory lobbying register was through a Private Members Bill introduced by Neil Findlay MSP at the Scottish Parliament on 6 July 2012. **Findlay’s Bill was heavily influenced by the findings of the research** noted above \(R1, R2\) as well as the insights from subsequent knowledge exchange work with civil society groups interested in transparency promotion \(E2\). As Findlay states, his Bill was directly influenced by this research: 

-  ‘I am certain that had Dinan and his colleagues at Stirling not carried out their initial work on lobbying in Scotland my private members Bill… may well have never been introduced. Their academic work created the space and provided some of the evidence that underlines the need for such a Bill’ \(E4a., Neil Findlay MSP testimonial\) 

-  **Findlay’s bill went on to lead directly to and inform the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Bill**, now Act. As a Scottish Government briefing explains: 

-  ‘Mr Findlay’s Bill received broad support in the Parliament \(31 MSPs\) and, in May 2013, he lodged a final proposal for his Bill. Subsequently, in June 2013, the Scottish Government announced, under Rule 9.14.13 of the Parliament’s Standing Orders, that it would introduce legislation of its own to give effect to the proposal in Mr Findlay’s Member’s Bill.’ \(E3a, p.9\) 

-  Therefore, the research had a direct impact on the case for introducing such legislation. Furthermore, the research underpinned key provisions of the proposed legislative framework. 

 **Informing the legislation** 

-  Following the Scottish Government’s decision to introduce legislation, **Dinan played a prominent role in the deliberations among civil society groups in Scotland**, scrutinising this issue, as well as submitting evidence to both Scottish Parliamentary \(2014\) \(E3a\) and Scottish Government \(2015\) \(E3b\) inquiries. Based on his research in this area, he was then appointed to the official Holyrood Lobbying Register Working group in 2017 to advise on aspects of implementation \(see section below\) of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016 \(E5\) and continues to work with Scottish civil society groups interested in monitoring lobbying disclosure. 

-  Dinan participated in the official Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee round\-table discussing key elements of the Scottish Government's proposals for lobbying regulation, 12 November 2015 \(E6a\). In late November 2015, he convened an expert policy seminar at the University of Stirling focused on regulatory design and the mechanics of realising transparency in relation to lobbying and political communication. The seminar involved participants from Scottish Government, Scottish Parliament \(including chair and clerks of Standards Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, and Corporate Body\), Westminster and Irish regulators, public servants working on lobbying and related ethics issues from EU and Scotland, and a number of invited academics. The seminar was held to ensure that decision makers in Scottish Government were appraised of best available research and practice insights while deliberating on the provisions of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Bill that would eventually become the basis for legislation in 2016 \(E6b\). 

-  In his capacity as a founding member of the Scottish Alliance for Lobbying Transparency \(SALT\), Dinan also briefed the responsible Minister for Parliamentary Business \(Joe Fitzpatrick\) in January 2016 \(E8, p.54, 85\) and also met with the civil servants drafting the stage 1 and 3 legislative proposals \(June 2015 and March 2016\). As the Electoral Reform Society, Scotland, state on the influence of Dinan and his research’s contribution to this process: 

-  ‘Dinan’s research added legitimacy to the campaign and helped develop our asks. His attendance at various meetings with Civil Servants and politicians where he was able to explain his research were vital in ensuring the lobbying register became law.’ \(E4b., Electoral Reform Society, Scotland testimonial\) 

-  The Minister for Parliamentary Business subsequently acknowledged the impact of SALT: ‘The vibrancy of such debate and that campaign are important to Parliament and to Scottish democracy.’ \(E6c, p.85\) 

-  The research directly informed the advocacy of pro\-transparency civil society groups in Scotland, which attracted widespread popular support during parliamentary deliberation on the provision of the Lobbying Bill \(E7\). Dinan used his role in SALT and his research and policy expertise to shape key campaigning demands that were eventually included in legislation. 

-  Research highlighted the need to avoid loopholes and bring transparency to lobbying activities targeted at the civil service and special advisors in government. These recommendations were reflected in stage 3 amendments to the legislation accepted by the Scottish Government, and approved by the Scottish Parliament: 

-  ‘\[I\]t is very clear the impact the research had and it is easy to trace the way it impacted on crucial legislation which now governs the operation of Parliament in Scotland. There was no alternative source of this research and I doubt it would have been possible to win the changes we won without it’. \(E4d., Common Weal testimonial\) 

-  Dinan’s expertise and engagement with policy makers to explain the research and evidence from different regulatory systems has been a common thread running through the phases of policy activism and deliberation at Holyrood on the topic of lobbying transparency. 

-  ‘Thanks to his support and research, parliamentary and stakeholder debates that input to the development process of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Bill were considerably more informed than would otherwise have been the case, which served to make the Bill a more successful piece of legislation.’ \(E4d., Transparency International testimonial\) 

-  Dinan is the only academic who has participated in all of these policy processes and this has ensured that the Stirling research is well known to politicians and officials charged with developing and running the lobbying register. 

 **Implementing the legislation** 

-  The research \(R1 to R4\) and knowledge exchange activity with stakeholders in Scotland \(E2, E6c, p.54\) informed Dinan’s contributions as the only academic member of the Lobbying Register Working Group \(E5\), which was tasked with advising civil servants at the Scottish Parliament on the implementation of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act and developing detailed draft Parliamentary Guidance and a Code of Conduct for people lobbying MSPs. Dinan was used as an expert source for the stakeholder and scoping research undertaken on behalf of the Holyrood Lobbying Registrar’s office \(E9\). 

 **The Impact of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016** 

-  The Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament has recently described the lobbying register as ‘a very valuable source of transparency about public life in Scotland’ \(E10\). The legislation has directly impacted on some 1,189 registrants across Scotland who have disclosed lobbying activity since March 2018. Nearly 30% of those registrants are within the categories of lobbyists that the Stirling research \(R1\) recommended should be included in any disclosure system, but which were initially excluded in legislative proposals. These groups also account for a significant proportion of the substantive information returns of lobbyists disclosing their lobbying activities under the legislation \(2,736 returns, representing 40% of disclosures\) \(E10\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Asylum seekers can face the risk of unjust and erroneous decisions on asylum applications based on formal or informal assessments of their native language in the process known as Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin \(LADO\) where such analyses are not informed by insights from forensic, variationist and psycholinguistic research. Other professional and personal disadvantages to migrants and refugees can also arise from simplistic perspectives about what constitutes and characterises a 'native speaker'. Essex research has challenged existing policies and practices and has: 

-  improved **access to justice** and **equality** 

-  improved **existing processes** and **exposed flaws in their application** 

-  improved **professional standards** and **guidelines** 

-  contributed to **continuing professional development** 

-  **shaped and informed public attitudes** towards issues related to the native language of refugees, migrants and bilinguals 

 Our research has a wide reach, benefiting refugees and migrants, commercial, governmental and academic providers of LADO, lawyers and judiciary, professional and charitable bodies and NGOs and the wider public. 
","
### 1.  Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning this case study demonstrates the broad range of variation and variability within and across languages, in particular languages with broad geographical distribution and regional variance e.g. Arabic \[R1\] and across speakers \[R2\], in particular in multilingual settings and language attrition contexts \[R3\]. Our research argues that: 

-  Rigorous sociolinguistic/forensic standards, arising from the theoretical and methodological state of the art, are needed to underpin procedures used for official decision\-making, such as LADO, in order to ensure validity and fairness \[R4, R2, R5\]. 

-  Evaluating whether or not someone speaks a language ""natively"" requires expert knowledge of linguistics, since non\-linguists do not possess the necessary awareness of a range of matters tied to nationality, national origin, citizenship, identity, multidialectism, multilingualism and the way in which a speaker will use their language in a particular context or setting \[R2\]. 

-  Intrinsically linguistic historical processes and social constraints – in particular those related to \(national\) identity – interact in complex ways, shaping the overall process of language change and variability in individuals and communities \[R1, R6, G3, G5, G6\]. 

-  Speech is shaped by context and factors such as inequality of power between interlocutors, ethnic, racial or class conflicts in cross\-cultural communication, pressures to assimilate to the standard variety, proficiency in other languages, etc. These factors have to be recognised, understood, and taken into account in LADO analyses \[R2, R7, R3\]. 

-  Speakers, who use more than one language on a daily basis, in particular after moving to another speech community, do not use their native language in the same way it is spoken in the country of origin. In such cases, LADO may not be feasible or reliable \[R7, R3, G2, G4\]. 

-  Identity and experiences, particularly traumatic ones, can strongly impact on the way in which \(native\) languages are used and may lead to a native speaker no longer being perceived as such, making a determination of a speaker's origin on the basis of their language use unreliable \[R7, R3, R5\]. 

-  Native language knowledge is subject to change in a foreign\-language environment \[R7, R3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **1. Improving professional standards, improving existing processes and exposing flaws in their application 

 *Professional guidelines* 

 Essex research has revealed the importance of robust linguistic analysis when applying LADO. In particular, it has shown that where LADO is *""unsupported by demonstrated expertise*"" \[S1a\], for example through employing analysts that are not sufficiently qualified, decision\-making is compromised \[R4\]. The Language and Asylum Research Group \(LARG\), convened by Patrick and Schmid, also advocates for the LADO practice to be underpinned by robust research on relevant forensic, sociolinguistic, dialectological and psycholinguistic issues in order to ensure access to justice and equality for refugees \[R4\]. The 2004 *Guidelines* *for LADO* \[R5\], developed by LARG, are accepted as the professional standard and have been adopted by governments across Europe, USA, Australia and Canada, as well as by the two main providers of LADO reports, Sprakab and Verified AB \[S1\]. The Guidelines continue to be routinely cited by LADO companies and in court cases and have resulted in the reconsideration of a number of such cases \[S1a\]. *Verified*, the primary supplier of LADO reports to the UK Home Office, cites the guidance in every case report. The *Guidelines* have further been endorsed by many learned bodies, most recently the International Language Testing Association in 2018 \[S1b\]. In these guidelines and in their existing research, Patrick, Schmid and Al\-Wer maintain that LADO reports must be: 

 a\) informed by expert sociolinguistic and forensic knowledge \[R2\] 

 b\) informed by recent research on the actual dialect in question \[R4\] 

 c\) based on accepted standards and methodologies for conducting interviews, analysing them and evaluating the outcomes \[R4\] and 

 d\) aware of possible changes to the native language due to prolonged absences from the country of origin, in particular where speakers left this country at a young age \[R7, R3\]. 

 When these principles are not adhered to, it constitutes grounds for decisions that were made on the basis of the LADO report to be challenged. Lingua, the specialised unit for LADO within the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration, attest this is an essential field of work \[S2\]: 

 *‘Used by several \(mostly European\) state authorities in their asylum procedures, LADO has been a controversial field of work since its beginnings in the mid\-1990s…lf the situation has somewhat improved over the years, this is largely due to the commitment of the few linguists putting aside their reservations and being willing to discuss LADO objectively, scientifically, and without bias. The 2004 publication of the Guidelines for the Use of Language Analysis* \[R5\] *in relation to Questions of National Origin in Refugee cases spurs the beginning of this debate….’* 

 *Challenging the LADO practices of companies to ensure robust analysis* 

 Patrick’s research exposed the flawed and fraudulent practice underlying many LADO reports of Sprakab, who was the main provider of LADO reports for the UK Home Office \(HO\) and the Swedish Migration Board \(SMB\) \[S3\]. At the same time that these revelations became public knowledge in 2014, Sprakab’s practices were heavily criticized in a Supreme Court verdict \[S3a\]. Patrick’s research was drawn upon when he was invited as an expert to provide his critical view of Sprakab's practices to the lawyer representing the appellant in the Supreme Court case. 

 ‘*Besides the direct impact of the dismissal of the Home Office’s appeal and  the success of the two asylum\-seeking clients …, it is fair to say that Prof. Patrick’s work has had a broader impact … a key  “aspect of the Sprakab evidence was unsupported by demonstrated expertise in the relevant field” as Prof. Patrick had long observed, and urged that “The Upper Tribunal ought to give further consideration to how the basis for the geographical attribution of particular dialects or usages can be better explained and not \(as it often currently seems to be\) left implicit” ‘*’ \[S1a\]. 

 This court case led to significant media attention including a Swedish documentary on Sveriges Television AB, Sweden's national television broadcaster, which also drew on Patrick’s research \[S3b\]. Following the Supreme Court Case both the HO and the SMB moved to a different main provider for LADO reports \[S3c pg. 6\]. 

 *Providing guidance and training* 

 Patrick and Schmid continue to provide the evidence base for LADO professional standards. As crisis regions shift due to global developments, so do migration patterns, making it necessary for agencies to find native speakers and experts able to provide analyses. While it is usually possible to find academic experts and non\-expert native speakers possessing the necessary expertise of the language, they are often unfamiliar with rigorous forensic standards required for this analysis. In 2020 Patrick and Schmid led online and in\-person discussions to introduce best practice for experts on particular language varieties \(e.g. Syrian Arabic\) who are novel to LADO reports, providing them with insight into the requirements of such reports in order to improve their quality and guarantee that best practice was applied \[S4\]. 

 In order to develop more widely available training materials for LADO providers, in 2019 Patrick and Schmid met with government agencies providing LADO services \(the UDI \(Norway\), Lingua \(Switzerland\)\) and private businesses \(De Taalstudio \(the Netherlands\)\) as well as academic experts, in order to assess training needs and discuss the development of training resources. The head of the Swiss bureau Lingua, has acknowledged the role played by these activities as bringing “ *LADO forward as a topic in the academic context*” and promoting “ *further development according to scientific standards*” – activities, which, in his view, are “ *essential*” to ensure the quality of LADO practice \[S2\]. 

 **2. Improving access to justice and equality** 

 Patrick, Schmid and Al\-Wer have provided over 40 expert opinions between August 2013 and December 2020 to lawyers and organisations in the UK and the Netherlands, challenging existing LADO analyses with negative outcomes based on their research and expertise \[R5\]. These have "" *proved essential in the outcome*"" \[S5\] of many such procedures, often directly leading to the original LADO report being dismissed, or not considered of material importance, and the asylum status that had previously been denied being granted \[S5, S6\]. Based on Patrick’s research \[R4, R2\] and expert opinion, reports that do not meet the requisite level of linguistic analysis, including shortcomings related to the analyst having insufficient familiarity with the language or dialect in question or the political situation \(e.g. confounding dialect and geographical borders\) are challenged \[S1a, S6\]. Schmid’s research on changes in the native language of migrants \(attrition\) demonstrates that perceived native speaker status is not stable \[R7\], in particular among younger migrants \[R3\]. Schmid has argued against the validity of decisions based on LADO reports or informal assessments by judges, Social Services or immigration departments rejecting the appellant's account of their origin in cases where they had spent prolonged periods of time outside that country or region. For example an expert consulted in a case from 2019 notes: 

 *‘I have been informed by the representatives of this young man that your input… \[was\] essential to the judgment in the case, in which the original rejection of his application for asylum was overthrown and he was granted leave to remain….*’ \[S5\]. 

 Al\-Wer has regularly provided LADO reports on the origin of asylum seekers from various Arabic\-speaking regions, based on her expertise in the dialectology of Arabic \[R1, R6\], as evidenced by Lingua who state 

 ‘*Her work has a direct, qualitative impact on asylum decisions. Ensuring that questions regarding the origin of asylum seekers are thoroughly and carefully examined leads to more informed asylum decisions which, in turn enhance the quality of Swiss asylum procedure as a whole'. \[S2\].* 

 The findings from Essex research and the expert opinions provided by Essex scholars have been key factors in shaping policy and practice around the use of LADO, and have been used and cited to challenge and overturn a large number of decisions. The broader dissemination of this research has impacted on a range of other factors concerning asylum seekers, migrants, and multilinguals. 

 **3. Shaping and informing public and professional attitudes** 

 Schmid’s research \[R7, R3\] demonstrates that native speakers who live in a second or foreign\-language environment and consequently encounter problems in producing and processing their native language \(such as word\-finding difficulties, a foreign accent, grammatical and lexical errors, \[R7, R3\]\) are often surprised and worried by these developments and frequently experience feelings of shame and guilt \[S7\]. They are also often confronted with strongly negative reactions from friends, family, \(potential\) employers and the wider public \[S7a\]. Schmid’s unique and extensive research \[R7, R3\] on the phenomenon of language attrition is debunking the widely\-held myth that native language knowledge is impervious to change and attrition and that, therefore, any sign of attrition must be a ploy for attention or indicate attempts to be deceitful \[S8\]. Since 2016, Schmid’s website, languageattrition.org, provides an introduction to the phenomenon in both children and adults through explanations and examples. She has contributed to the public debate in cases of high\-profile attriters widely reviled in the press and Social Media, such as the American soldier Bowe Bergdahl, the Surinamese\-Dutch boxer Regilio Tuur and, most recently, actor Hilaria Baldwin \[S8\]. Her research has been widely referenced in the media by outlets with a very broad reach \(eg, the Independent with a readership of over 33.7 million\) with articles and interviews cumulatively reaching an audience of millions. A recent TikTok video based on her research attracted over 50k views \[S8\], her work was used in an art project for the Manchester Jewish Museum \[S7a\], and her website has attracted more than 1250,000 views since publication \[S9\]. The significance of Schmid’s research to individuals affected by language attrition, is evidenced through personal communications from those experiencing these phenomena \[S7\], expressing feelings such as "" I didn’t know that there was a name for this experience I have struggled with for so so long\! \[…\] I feel like a stranger in my own home \[…\] finally I know that my experience is not so unusual. Thank you\!"" \[S7b\]. Over 50 individuals have similarly reached out for advice and insight and have expressed gratitude for making sense of their own experiences of language loss, which can negatively affect their personal and professional lives \[S7\]. 

 **4. Preventing professional disadvantaging of multilinguals** 

 In 2019 Schmid was invited to provide an expert analysis of the English language qualification criteria used for professional re\-accreditation of the English Nursing and Midwifery Council \(NMC\).  As a result of Schmid’s research \[R7, R3\] and analysis, the Council have changed the criteria, removing some of the barriers to re\-accreditation, e.g. a recent English test in those cases where a relevant qualification had been obtained in an English\-speaking country more than five years ago \[S10, S10a\]. In 2020 approximately 16% of nurses, midwives and nursing associates who are on the permanent register and eligible to practise in the UK \(a total of 724,516 individuals\) are from overseas so these changes potentially benefit over 116,768 professionals \[S10b\]. 

 In 2020, Schmid taught two webinars to court interpreters and translators in the Netherlands \(total attendance ca. 75\), explaining how language attrition may impact on professional practice, e.g. after a career break, and what practitioners can do to prevent these effects \[S11\] – these webinars count towards the CPD requirement such professionals have to regularly demonstrate to maintain their accreditation. A similar talk was given at the Essex Teacher Conference in 2018 to about 25 attendees. Feedback from these events was extremely positive, indicating that attendants found the information useful and intended to use it in their professional practice \[S11\]. As these examples show, it is important for practitioners and, in particular, language experts such as translators and teachers, to understand to what extent language attrition may affect professional performance and how it can be prevented or minimized. 

 Simplified views of multilingualism and the concept of ‘native speakers’ and 'native languages' can lead to multiple disadvantages for migrants and, in particular, refugees and asylum seekers. Our cumulative expertise from the point of view of sociolinguistics, applied linguistics and psycholinguistics aims to expose, address and, where possible, mitigate these disadvantages. The beneficiaries of this impact range from dozens of individual migrants and asylum seekers, for whom our expertise has had a profoundly life\-changing effect through professionals and courts up to a broad audience of millions reached by the manifold ways in which our research findings have been disseminated.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Supporting unemployed people to get jobs has benefits not only to individuals but to wider society and the UK economy. Research by **Ingold**, **Stuart** and **Valizade** has led to improved service provision by the employability service industry including large service providers such as Serco and Public Health England as well as local authorities. It has facilitated significant adoption of best practices across the industry and supported leading professional bodies in providing services and training interventions for their corporate, public and third sector members. Significantly changing practitioners’ approaches to strategy towards co\-opetitive, relational and needs\-focused service delivery has enhanced professionalisation of the sector and supported strategies to influence policy makers.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Government policy to get the unemployed into work has increasingly involved ‘employability’, ‘activation’ or ‘welfare to work’ programmes. Such programmes aim to address deep structural problems that can occur even during periods of labour market buoyancy. Although levels of employment in the UK were historically high between 2015 and March 2020, more than 2.5m people struggled to enter paid employment or ‘cycled’ between periods of unemployment and paid work. Exemplar programmes in the UK include the New Deal programmes, the Work Programme, and the Work and Health Programme. The Work Programme alone cost approximately GBP3bn**Footnote:**

 [https://www.nao.org.uk/wp\-content/uploads/2014/07/The\-work\-programme.pdf](https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The-work-programme.pdf) 
. Such employability programmes have assumed even greater importance in response to the employment crisis resulting from the global coronavirus pandemic, as seen by the Government’s new Kickstart and Restart programmes. 

 Research led by Dr Jo **Ingold,** with Professor Mark **Stuart** and Dr Danat **Valizade,** has examined the ‘demand\-side’ of activation – i.e. how to engage employers – rather than the conventional focus on the ‘supply\-side’ of activation, i.e. individuals outside the labour market. **Ingold’s** research has drawn attention to the lack of engagement in employability programmes by employers and the barriers and enablers to their engagement **\[1\]**. The research includes three major projects that together constitute a sustained body of scholarship: a\) an exploration of small and medium sized enterprises \(SMEs\) and their engagement with employability service providers \(2012\-2013\), b\) a collaborative project with Prime provider Serco on the delivery of their programmes to activate difficult\-to\-access claimants with mental health issues, and c\) a comparative study on employability programmes in the UK and Denmark funded by an ESRC Future Research Leaders grant based on 1503 employer survey responses and 103 employer and service provider interviews **\(i\)**. The research advanced understanding of employer engagement across four dimensions: 

#####  Employer Engagement 

 The research found that employer engagement in employability programmes was central to their success, but this was undermined by employers being excluded from policy development, resulting in low take\-up of government programmes **\[2\]**. Analysis of the complexity of relationships at the frontline of the UK service delivery supply chain found three key types of activities of employability programme providers: business to business sales; matching of clients to employers’ requirements; and building and maintaining trusting relationships **\[2\]**. From this, comparative research **\(i\)** developed a number of measures of employer engagement. Further, it was found that ‘relational’ \(in\-depth, sustained\) employer engagement in Denmark was twice that in the UK \(60% compared to 31%\) **\[3**, **4\]**. The findings implied that UK policy placed too much emphasis on a “push” approach \(i.e. “selling”\) and not enough emphasis on a “pull” approach \(i.e. gaining better knowledge and understanding of employers’ needs\). 

#####  Competition and Co\-opetition 

 The employers’ role in employability programmes was further illuminated in **\[5\]**, where it was found that SMEs had little awareness of programmes and highlighted the intense competition driving service providers’ attempts to engage employers through a programme developed without considering employers’ interests or their propensity to engage **\[5\]**. The findings exposed the plethora of confusing ‘products’, including apprenticeships, traineeships, work placements and different programmes aimed at niche demographic groups. The UK competitive landscape of employability reduces co\-operation between providers, undermining services for both the unemployed and for employers **\[4\]**. The research findings suggested that co\-opetition – collaboration between competitors – is required to deliver an enhanced service offer to businesses and this informed the activities with practitioners. One aspect of this was a ‘single front door’ for employers to access programmes in specific labour market areas. 

#####  Appropriate services for disadvantaged groups 

 Research exploring individuals with mental health conditions on employability programmes found that the support they received from employability programmes was not sufficiently tailored to their employment or health needs. Further, the ‘problematising’ of unemployed candidates had the effect of reducing rather than enhancing their chances of gaining employment **\[6\]**. The need for more tailored services to help unemployed people into work was thus a central finding. It was argued that the existing delivery model that involved participants spending defined amounts of time with different providers did not help those with mental health conditions to make sustained progress towards work. A key finding was that while employability programmes increased employers’ probability of recruiting long\-term unemployed in the UK and Denmark, they were not able to counter employers’ selective hiring practices that were detrimental to the hiring of disadvantaged groups **\[3\]** and this was related to the way programmes were delivered. 

#####  Benefit conditionality 

 Drawing from both employers’ and providers’ perspectives, the research found that employers viewed ‘benefit conditionality’ negatively **\[3**, **6\]**. The requirements placed on jobseekers in order to retain access to benefits led to employers receiving large numbers of unsuitable and unfiltered job applications; they viewed this as a product of ‘box ticking’ and compliance targets.  In both the UK and Denmark, providers employed differential strategies to place people in work. Building relationships with employers is crucial to the delivery of these strategies. However, employer engagement and relationship\-building was entirely overlooked by UK policy makers, the commissioning of services by governments at national, regional and local levels and in the delivery of programmes by providers on the ground **\[4\]**. 

 Two doctoral researchers were associated with this stream of research and their contribution is acknowledged: Meenakshi Sarkar and Frederike Scholz.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Ingold’s** research has had an impact across the employability sector. She is considered a national authority on employer engagement, leading to key advisory and thought leadership commissions with leading industry bodies. 

####  Service delivery 

 Serco, a leading multinational company, changed its service delivery model for the UK Work Programme as a direct result of **Ingold’s** research on mental health service users. Serco is a leading contractor of major UK government services and was one of the key Prime providers for the Work Programme \(2011\-2017\) **\[A\]**. The Serco Director, Employment Related Services confirms: *“Up until 2015, Serco had applied a 3\-phase model for delivery of services to customers on their 2\-year Work Programme journey. For the customer, this meant that they had a change of service provider twice during the course of the programme. … Your research with this customer group identified that the 3\-phase model did not best meet their needs … In response to your research, we altered our delivery model at Serco in 2015, allowing customers to spend the entirety of their time on Work Programme with a single service provider, thereby creating a framework which enabled longer\-term relationship building and allowed for the consolidation of progress towards employment.”* **\[A\]** 

 As a direct result of the research, Serco provided a range of developmental programmes to better equip frontline employment advisers with the skills and understanding to provide more effective support for people with mental health issues **\[A\]**. This improved the performance on entry into employment 3 months or longer; the Head of Employment, Skills and Enterprise confirms: *“For the following year the number of people in employment 3 months or longer through our schemes increased by 386 \(9.3%\) and the number of individuals with a disability brought into employment three months and longer increased from 220 to 284, an increase of 29%.* **\[B\]** 

 Supported by a University of Leeds ‘Impact Leadership Award’, **Ingold** worked with an independent consultant, Tony Carr of 4frontpartners, to help translate the research findings for practitioner audiences and extend the delivery of training provision for industry professionals. 

 Public Health England \(PHE\) improved their employment services to people with alcohol and drug dependence, drawing on **Ingold’s** expertise and research on employer engagement. The Individual Placement and Support \(IPS\) Trial Manager and Project Lead **\[C\]** details how the research benefitted the specialist teams \(a Best Practice Group\) that were trialling a new evidence\-based intervention service at seven sites. **Ingold** led a series of training sessions for IPS specialists across all sites in the UK to resolve specific challenges related to the trial. The Trial Manager and Programme Lead stated that the intervention: *“led to a different approach to how they engage with employers. This includes adopting an approach that takes more account of employer needs and seeks to balance those with the needs of those seeking to access employment \(the clients\). Furthermore, as a result there has been a change of emphasis from an approach of ‘cold\-calling’ employers to one based on market intelligence, targeting and relationship management.”* **\[C\]** 

 Promoting best practice and professionalisation of the sector, **Ingold** designed and delivered a suite of training courses for IPS specialists on business engagement \(including communications, sales & negotiation, understanding employer needs, market intelligence, problem solving in the context of brokerage roles, and relationship building\), with particular guidance on the training requirements needed for new members of staff joining the programme **\[C\]**. Furthermore, **Ingold** contributed research evidence and practical solutions to an IPS manual and supplementary manual focused on employer engagement that will be used to guide all current and future IPS delivery across the UK. It was mentioned that *“this document forms a key element of IPS strategy which is critical for the national roll\-out of the IPS programme”.* **\[C\]** 

 Further invitations for **Ingold’s** expertise led to engagement with service delivery providers and employment, skills and economic development leads at City of York Council \(CYC\), including three strategic workshops, jointly mapping service provision and customer needs and developing strategic action plans for employer engagement in the city **\[D\]**. This led to a number of tangible strategic changes \(e.g. adopting a “single front door” approach\) in how CYC manage employer engagement in the city: the setting up of a network of service providers, CYC and other agencies; identifying business needs, adapting to online provision in response to Covid\-19 and putting training online; and adopting a set of new principles of needs\-led service provision to avoid duplication and streamline the process for business **\[D\]**. 

 Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) worked with **Ingold** on their Working Well Early Help \(WWEH\) employment support programme aimed at supporting a return to employment for individuals with a health condition or disability. Their role was to provide evidence and tangible actions to improve engagement with Small and Medium Sized Enterprises \(SMEs\). The evidence on the importance of a needs\-led approach and co\-opetition has led to re\-evaluation at the level of commissioning as to how employer engagement is addressed across the Greater Manchester ecosystem. **Ingold** helped GMCA identify the challenges WWEH faced in SME engagement and better understand existing good practice **\[E\]**. 

####  Advising professional bodies 

 **Ingold** has become a recognised influencer and contributor to the employability sector. She has supported professional associations, helping their development, enhancing their members’ collective knowledge and skills and assisting lead organisations in lobbying government: 

 First, **Ingold** has advised the Institute of Employability Professionals \(IEP\), the leading organisation for professionals in the UK employability sector with 9,000 members. The IEP Chief Executive states: *“In February 2020 Jo was appointed a Fellow of the IEP; a rare accolade for an academic that signifies the importance of her work to the Institute.”* **\[F\]**. A co\-authored report influenced members to work more collaboratively: *“The report and launch event were a springboard for the IEP in setting out the importance of collaboration to effective delivery of employability services for both jobseekers and employers. This is a game\-changer for the industry in enhancing delivery both for customers and businesses and in reducing costs.”* **\[F\]**. The Chief Executive commented that **Ingold** is *“highly credible and unique in bringing together evidence and policy and prompts IEP members to think expansively about persistent issues for the sector.”* **\[F\]**. Based on her leadership as an IEP Fellow, the testimony continues: *“Jo has contributed significantly to a sea\-change in attitudes and behaviours amongst both commissioners and providers, which are evidenced by the conversations the IEP Board is having and will continue to have as we move into a critical phase of employment service commissioning in 2021.”* **\[F\]**. Supporting IEP’s lobbying agenda, **Ingold** was also invited to give evidence from her research on behalf of the IEP to the Work & Pensions Select Committee on DWP’s preparations for changes in the world of work \(HC358 – November 2020\) **\[G\]**. 

 Second, **Ingold** advised the Employment Related Services Association \(ERSA\) the largest UK providers’ organisation with 900\+ members. ERSA confirms that **Ingold** has greatly benefitted them as an industry association and intermediary in lobbying government and providing knowledge and research evidence to their membership **\[H\].** The Chief Executive of ERSA stated: *“ **Ingold** has become a respected authority on evidence\-based research for the employment services sector and as such we are pleased that we have been able to draw on her insights in our role of lobbying government and influencing the large service commissioners throughout the UK.  We are an important institution in advocating for the sector. Her research informed our submission to the UK Government’s Improving Lives Green Paper with regard to better understanding the support needs of disabled people …”* **\[H\]** 

 Third, **Ingold** was instrumental in the formation of an ERSA Employer Engagement Forum that facilitates dialogue on key employability issues and includes over 200 employability sector leaders, commissioners and policy makers. Furthermore, the research has been valuable to the setting up of an Evidence Hub of what works in improving service delivery with **Ingold** advising on the structuring of this resource for ERSA members **\[H\]**. In January 2019, findings supporting the importance of a needs\-led approach to overcome the complexity of employment programmes for employers were presented as evidence by Samantha Windett on behalf of ERSA to the Work and Pensions Select Committee on Universal Credit: Youth Obligation **\[I\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bovine tuberculosis \(bTB\) is a global disease that is economically draining to control and threatens human health. Research at the University of Cambridge has directly informed policy decisions relating to the control and surveillance programmes of bTB in the UK and Ethiopia. The research sculpted the future direction of vaccination policy and delayed the implementation of cattle vaccination in the UK, which saved at least GBP120,000,000 of public money. The work has also led to improved surveillance of bTB  in English slaughterhouses. Through sustained engagement and collaboration, Cambridge research has contributed to greater availability of high quality bTB testing in Ethiopia, through specially trained staff and testing teams, and establishment of the country’s first ministerial group to lead national efforts in overcoming bTB.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Bovine tuberculosis \(bTB\) is a significant bacterial disease in the UK and globally. It is infectious and contagious, with two main reservoirs \(cattle and badgers\). The disease threatens the cattle industry and presents risks to other livestock, wildlife and domestic pets. bTB in animals can also threaten human health, although the widespread pasteurisation of cows’ drinking milk and milk products largely protects the public from undisclosed cases of bTB in cattle \(source: UK Government Animal and Plant Health Agency, online\). Globally, no bTB vaccine is licensed for use in cattle. The problem is that at present it is impossible to distinguish between a vaccinated and TB\-infected cow and a positive result in the standard diagnostic skin test acts as the legal definition of a TB infection, even if induced by vaccination. 

 **Modelling the suitability of cattle vaccination as a supplement to existing test\-and\-slaughter control** 

 Conlan and Wood have worked closely with bTB policy teams in Defra since 2007 with a series of Defra\-funded projects; since 2012 they have developed mathematical models for the transmission of bTB within herds in Great Britain, providing a shift in the level of statistical rigour applied to policy approaches and offering insights into the epidemiology of bTB. These models were used to publish the first estimates of cattle\-to\-cattle transmission of bTB in the UK \[R1\]. 

 Between 2011 and 2013, the cattle\-to\-cattle transmission models developed by Conlan and Wood were extended to explore cattle vaccination as a supplement to existing test\-and\-slaughter control. Vaccination is known to interfere with the standard diagnostic tests for bTB because it is impossible to tell whether a positive result is due to the vaccine or a true infection. There was an acknowledged need for a test that Distinguishes Infected from Vaccinated Animals \(DIVA\); none are currently licenced. 

 Developing cattle vaccination is central to UK government strategy for bTB control. However, under current national and international trading regulations the UK government will only consider vaccination as a supplement, rather than a replacement, to test\-and\-slaughter. Most of the economic costs associated with bTB in the UK come from testing and restrictions, rather than disease losses, therefore Conlan and Wood’s models demonstrated that there was no economic benefit of vaccination without an accurate DIVA test \[R2\]. 

 Subsequently, in 2014 Conlan and Wood were part of a Defra\-funded tender led by Triveritas management \(a commercial organisation providing veterinary good clinical practice regulatory studies\) to calculate the size and scale of field trials necessary to satisfy the EU’s requirements for allowing use of a cattle vaccine. The models showed that demonstrating a protective benefit from the vaccine in individual cattle could be achieved by a trial of \~100 herds.  However, satisfying the EU’s requirement that trials could estimate an impact of vaccination on reducing transmission of infection would require far larger, and frankly unaffordable, trials \(of the order of \~1000 herds\). As an invited member of a follow\-on working group, Conlan developed cheaper experimental designs to evaluate this key requirement from the EU, namely a three arm design which includes fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated control herds \[R3\]. 

 **Operational models to rank the effectiveness of slaughterhouse surveillance for bTB in Great Britain** 

 In 2018 Conlan, Wood and collaborators developed the first operationalised model to rank the effectiveness of slaughterhouse surveillance for bTB in Great Britain \[R4\]. The model identified large geographic variations in the effectiveness of slaughterhouse surveillance and offered the ability to prioritise further investigation to slaughterhouses that had unusually high or low rates of bTB. 

 **Bovine tuberculosis in Ethiopia** 

 Since 2014, Conlan and Wood have led major programmes of underpinning research on the epidemiology, spread and control, including social and political aspects, of bTB in Ethiopia using mathematical modelling and analyses of whole genome sequences of *Mycobacterium bovis* from cattle and humans. Their research has demonstrated that the prevalence is high, if highly variable between regions, with a herd prevalence of 22.4% \(95% CI: 17\-29%\) outside Addis Ababa in Ethiopia \[R5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bovine tuberculosis is a substantial economic and animal welfare problem. The UK government spends \~GBP100 million annually on bTB control, with costs to industry estimated to be a further GBP50 million \[E1, page 13\]. As a member of OIE \(World Organisation for Animal Health\), the UK is required to have a bTB eradication plan. Modelling work undertaken at the University of Cambridge has led to the following impact: 

 **Influencing high\-level policy direction in the UK** 

 Conlan and Wood have engaged closely with government advisory bodies that formulate or challenge government policy in England: Wood as part of Defra’s TB Eradication Advisory Committee the independent review committee in 2018, chaired by Professor Sir Charles Godfray \[E2\], and Conlan on a group examining vaccination strategies. In 2014, their research was cited as part of the evidence for the government’s epidemiological rationale in the Defra’s Strategy for achieving Officially Bovine Tuberculosis Free status for England \[E3, page 57\], which rejected a “one size fits all approach” and set targets to measure progress. Wood’s research was also cited in a Parliamentary debate on 13 March 2014 by a Liberal Democrat MP, highlighting the issue of latent TB in cattle and suggesting a change in focus regarding strategies \[E4\]. At this point, badger culling as a means to tackle TB was not seen as publicly acceptable, with the government looking to vaccination as a desirable alternative. 

 **Changes to vaccination strategy in England** 

 Conlan and Wood’s evaluation of BCG vaccination in cattle \(R2\) suggested that field trials would have to be on a massive scale, but at the point when Defra commissioned their analysis in 2014, led by Triveritas, extensive field trials were still expected to start in 2015. This was in line with the 2014 Strategy for achieving Officially Bovine Tuberculosis Free status for England, in which the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committed to an investment of GBP24.6 million in the development of effective TB vaccines for both cattle and badgers \[E3\]. The Triveritas study estimated that the cost of the field trial then proposed would be as much as GBP120,000,000, with additional costs of \[text removed for publication\] for implementing any vaccination programme \[E5\]. 

 These results had an immediate impact on Defra policy: to indefinitely delay implementation of cattle vaccination. This saved public money through stopping impossibly large field efficacy trials and through providing clear evidence that DIVA tests had to be improved before vaccination could be rolled out. It also prompted a longer\-term change of focus on the <ins>specificity \(the ability to detect a true negative\)</ins> of the replacement DIVA test, rather than sensitivity <ins>\(the ability to</ins> <ins>detect a true positive\)</ins>, which had previously been the priority \[E1\]. In a statement on 18 December 2014, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said, “\[The\] report…shows that before cattle vaccination field trials can be contemplated, we need to develop a better DIVA test. This research is likely to take a further two years.” \[E6\] 

 The senior policy adviser from Defra’s Bovine TB Programme states that the evaluation report, and Conlan and Wood’s 2015 paper \(R2\), *“contributed to a change of emphasis from vaccination assessment to the validation of new diagnostic \(DIVA\) tests. By understanding the scale of trial needed to confirm efficacy, we were able to prevent costly, complex action that would not have resulted in demonstrable lowering of disease. In real terms, this translates as preventing government expenditure and saving an estimated* \[text removed for publication\] *of public money.”* \[E7\] 

 The 2018 Bovine TB strategy review \[E2\] cited Wood and Conlan’s research, noting that *“Existing surveillance regimes underestimate the prevalence of the disease in cattle in England and this hinders control.”* \[E2, page 32, cites \(R1\)\] 

 It goes on to say: “ *The* \[EU\] *Commission indicated the necessity of field trials... However, to obtain sufficient statistical power using this approach would likely require, given the prevalence of bovine TB in England, large\-scale field trials which might involve 500 farms over 2 years. This may be unfeasible and equivalent information might be obtained more easily using vaccination and challenge experimentation with approximately 200 individual Animals*.”\[E2, page 44, cites \(R3\)\]. 

 The Government response in March 2020 recognised that *“performance of the DIVA test is crucial in enabling BCG vaccination to realise disease control benefits. As well as identifying vaccinated cattle that are truly infected, it is essential that the DIVA test has a high specificity... Field trial designs have been developed to further evaluate the cattle BCG vaccine and DIVA skin test and provide the evidence required for applications for* \[Marketing Authorisations\] *to be submitted and for the DIVA test to be internationally recognised.*” \[E1, page 23\] 

 The Defra senior adviser confirms that *“Research from the University of Cambridge…has played a key role in government understanding of key factors involved in building a diagnostic and vaccination policy for bovine TB, and has directly influenced decisions that have had an important impact on public spending.”* \[E7\] 

 **Identification of slaughterhouses with low rates of bTB detection** 

 The model of slaughterhouse surveillance \(R4\) was transferred to the Animal and Plant Health Agency \(APHA\), responsible for bTB control, resulting in implementation of new professional practice to monitor bTB levels. It is run on an annual basis to identify slaughterhouses with unexpectedly low rates of bTB detection, which need further investigation. The Data Systems Group Workgroup Leader at APHA says that this is now an “integral part” of reporting to Defra and enables them to “identify any poor performing slaughterhouses \(in terms of their inability to identify bTB infected animals\)” \[E8\]. The Godfray review also cited the research, noting the need for *“raising awareness of its importance with slaughterhouse workers, financial incentives for good practice and more frequent inspection.”* \[E2, 3.35, page 38\]. 

 **Introduction of new bTB policy in Ethiopia** 

 In Ethiopia, where the bTB burden is very high in dairy cattle, Wood has been instrumental in the establishment of a steering group, chaired by the Ethiopian state minister, on bTB control; no similar body has existed before. By engaging in a series of focus group discussions with farmers, veterinarians and human health workers in two sites in Ethiopia, Conlan, Wood and collaborators were able to show the need for investment in animal health system strengthening in Ethiopia \[E9\]. The terms of reference of this Ministerial group in Ethiopia include that it be chaired by the State Minister to lead on national efforts to coordinate control at the national and regional level, a highly significant symbol in the centralised Ethiopian government system. The controls now being developed have a firm base in the work published from the Cambridge related programmes \(R5\). There is now much greater availability of high quality bTB testing, through specially trained staff and testing teams in the government agency National Animal Health and Diagnostic Investigation Centre \(NAHDIC\), which regularly offers advice to farmers around disease control \[E9\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research at the University of Bristol has led to the adoption of new genetic tests for the diagnosis of rare blood disorders within the new NHS Genomic Medicine Service which will launch in 2020. Data that are already available from the NIHR BioResource and 100,000 Genomes Project pilot programmes indicate that better genetic testing has improved care for 1,042 patients in the UK and overseas by providing diagnosis enabling targeted therapies to correct blood abnormalities and genetically linked health problems such as hearing loss. Three key genes underpinning those tests have been incorporated into international gene diagnostic lists commercially available from 36 labs in 9 countries, as well as national and international guidelines. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Genetic blood disorders \(GBD\) are complex conditions that have wide\-ranging and often severe clinical manifestations. Research led by Professor Andrew Mumford and Dr Sarah Westbury has uncovered the genetic basis of several GBD, enabling the development of precise diagnostic tools to inform personalised patient care. 

#  Genetic discovery 

 Through large scale recruitment of patients to genomics research cohorts, detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation of patients with GBD and analysis of genomic sequencing data, Mumford and Westbury discovered the genes underlying four new GBD \( *TBXA2R, F2RL3, TPM4, DIAPH1\)* \[1\] and provided definitive clinical descriptions of others \( *RASGRP2, GPIBB, P2RY12, FGA/FGG, VKORC1, THPO*\) \[2\]. 

#  High\-throughput genetic testing methodology 

 With consortia colleagues from the Universities of Sheffield and Birmingham \[G1, G2\], Mumford developed new standardised laboratory methods to classify the features of different types of blood platelet disorders, which is an essential pre\-requisite for genetic diagnosis. Mumford was the first in the UK to report how this enables interpretation of high\-throughput sequencing genomic data to enable diagnosis of a rare blood platelet disorder \[3\]. 

 Mumford and Westbury extended this approach by developing a standardised computational nomenclature for describing the clinical characteristics of patients with GBD within an existing system called the Human Phenotype Ontology \(HPO\). With collaborators at the University of Cambridge and the Sanger Institute, they combined with a novel statistical analysis method called similarity regression to be a powerful gene discovery tool that first validated in patients with known GBD \[4\]. This approach was then applied to complex genomic data from patients enrolled by Mumford and colleagues to the NIHR BioResource rare diseases \[4\] to enable the discovery of multiple new GBD genes \( *SRC, DIAPH1, GPIBB*\). 

#  Translation of genetic testing methodology into clinical diagnostic tests 

 The new genetic discoveries and methodologies from Mumford and Westbury \[2,5\] were incorporated into two prototype high\-throughput clinical diagnostic tests for GBD: 

 1.  The ThromboGenomics gene panel v3.0. in which the sequence information from 96 genes was analysed simultaneously. This was successfully validated and piloted in 2,396 European patients with undiagnosed genetic bleeding or thrombotic disorders \[5\]. 

 2. Interpretation of whole genome sequencing \(WGS\) data from 1,169 patients with genetic bleeding or thrombotic disorders enrolled to NHS 100,000 Genomes Project or NIHR Bioresource Rare Diseases \[6\]. 

 Both pilots showed that new technologies for genetic diagnosis of GBD had sufficient diagnostic accuracy for clinical use and were deliverable in a healthcare setting. The pilot programmes also yielded novel scientific knowledge about the molecular basis of GBD and proof\-of\-concept that alterations in genomic regions that regulate GBD genes could result in human disease \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 GBD affect more than 100,000 people in the UK and are may be associated with complex chronic health problems involving other organ systems and have high treatment costs. Some GBD result in severe illness or death in infants and children or may pre\-dispose individuals to life\-threatening complications such as acute leukaemia in adulthood. The devastating impact of GBD can be mitigated by accurate clinical genomic diagnosis because this enables selection of personalised treatments, prediction and early intervention for severe complications and informs reproductive choices for families. 

#  Genetic diagnosis for 1,042 patients internationally with genetic blood disorders 

 The ThromboGenomics and 100,000 genomes pilot programmes that incorporated the gene discoveries and methodologies developed by Professor Mumford and Dr Westbury \[2, 5\], enabled precision genetic diagnosis for a total of 1,042 patients with bleeding, platelet or thrombotic disorders in patients from NHS hospitals but also 10 hospitals in Europe, the Middle East and the US \[5, 6\]. In all cases, genetic diagnosis had not been previously achieved using existing clinical diagnostic tests. 

#  Improved characterisation and treatment of rare genetic blood disorders 

######  Through the development and delivery of the pilot diagnostic programmes for GBD \[5, 6\] Mumford and Westbury have also provided benefits for the healthcare and scientific communities. Advances have included the definition of new human genetic diseases allowing diagnosis for future families and the translation of mechanistic understanding of GBD into the development of new or re\-purposed personalised treatments. 

######  One example of this is the gene *DIAPH1,* which Mumford and Westbury were the first in the world to link to a human disorder in which there are abnormalities in blood cells and hearing \[1\]. Through identification of further cases in the UK NIHR BioResource and University of Murcia genetics diagnosis programmes, Mumford and Westbury reported the characteristics of 16 further patients with *DIAPH1* gene changes revealing hitherto unrecognised immune system defects in the cases \[Ai\]. Their description of these cases provided sufficient evidence for formal designation of *DIAPH1* as gene associated with a blood disease \(according to American College of Medical Genetic and Genomic criteria\) and recognised and cited \[1\] in resources that list human genetic disorders curated by the US based OMIM \(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man\) \[Bi\] and ClinGen \[Bii\] organisations and by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis \[Biii, Biv\]. 

######  Since discovery, the blood disorder caused by *DIAPH1* gene changes has been reported in more than 50 further cases in the scientific literature or online gene mutation catalogues. Through systematic evaluation of patients and laboratory analyses, Mumford and Westbury have also resolved the common molecular pathogenesis through which *DIAPH1* gene changes cause haematological and hearing abnormalities \[Ai\]. This mechanistic insight has directly improved patient care by enabling Westbury to report first\-in\-disorder treatment with thrombopoietin\-receptor agonists to reverse low platelet counts \[Ai\]. Genetic diagnosis in families with *DIAPH1* gene changes has enabled identification of infants at risk of hearing loss so that mitigating measures can be introduced to prevent developmental delay and also reversal of hearing loss by cochlear implantation \[Aii\]. 

#  Adoption of diagnostic technology by healthcare systems 

 The NHS Genomic Medicine Service \(launched 2020\) incorporates pioneering scientific advances in the genomics of rare diseases and cancer, such as the 100,000 Genomes Project, into mainstream healthcare and aims to bring the benefits of personalised medicine to the NHS as the standard of care. Professor Mumford was the Director of the West of England Genomic Medicine Centre, one of thirteen English centres that conducted the 100,000 Genomes Project. He is now the Medical Director of the South West Genomic Laboratory Hub that is responsible for implementation of the Genomic Medicine Service for the 5 million population of the South West of England. He co\-leads the Haematology Genome Clinical Interpretation Partnership \(GeCIP\) that coordinates genomic research within the NHS. 

 This has facilitated incorporation of the genetic discoveries and new methodologies developed and validated by Mumford and Westbury \[1\-6\] into mainstream clinical use in high\-throughput diagnostic tests. For example, *DIAPH1, TPM4* and *TBXA2R* which were first linked to human blood disorders by Mumford and collaborators \[1\] are incorporated into the R90 ‘Bleeding and Platelet Disorders’ \[Ci\] genetic diagnostic test listed in the NHS Genomic Test directory \[D\] and now available for clinical testing across the English Genomic Laboratory Hub network. These genes are also a component of the ‘Severe Paediatric Disorders’ research gene panel \[Cii\] which is applied to analyse the genomes of critically ill children and their parents \[G\], which cites the genetic discovery study \[1\] as high\- quality evidence for inclusion of *DIAPH1*. 

 These genes and panels have now been adopted by the Australian Genomics diagnostic service, which is working in partnership with Genomics England to build consensus around gene panel content \[E\]. The genes are also used in multiple international gene diagnostic tests that are commercially available \( *DIAPH1:* 33 labs in 9 countries \[Fi\], *TBXA2R:* 11 labs in 6 countries \[Fii\], *TPM4:* 3 labs in US \[Fiii\]\) and have been incorporated into three international research pilot programmes to bring patient benefit through high\-throughput genomic diagnosis of platelet or bleeding disorders \[H\]. 

#  Informing clinical guidelines 

######  Methodologies developed by Mumford for the collection of phenotype data, laboratory analysis and genetic testing for bleeding and platelet disorders are incorporated into the current clinical guidelines for diagnosis of bleeding disorders by the British Society of Haematology which defines clinical haematology practice standards in the UK \[I\] and have been adopted by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis for which membership spans 100 countries \[J\]. Mumford presented best practice in genomic diagnosis of platelet disorders as the state\-of\-the\-art plenary speaker to more than 6,000 people from 125 countries at the 2016 Congress of the World Federation of Haemophilia.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The £11 million Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing \(SAM\) project is a knowledge exchange, research and business support programme underpinned by a diverse body of research produced in Sunderland’s Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice \(AMAP\). It has enabled manufacturing SMEs in the North East of England to implement product and process development and adopt new technology. Purposively aligning SAM’s scope with the diverse scope of AMAP research has enabled SMEs across the sector to seek research\-based support for a broad range of organisational challenges. The effect \(enhanced productivity through innovation\) is felt by businesses through, for example, improved profitability. SAM has delivered benefits of £2.34 for the regional economy for every £1 of funding.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research undertaken in the Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice \(AMAP\) underpins the Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing \(SAM\) project. A body of research in three of AMAP’s areas of applied research \(design, supply chain and process, and advanced maintenance\) forms the intellectual backbone of the practical support and advice offered to SMEs through the project. The diversity of the research undertaken has facilitated the strongly adaptive and bespoke, solution\-focussed approach in the SAM project. The rationale behind SAM is directly informed by prior knowledge exchange projects such as **Digital Factory** \(2003\-13\), which brought research to bear in training over 6,500 manufacturing employees and consultancy for hundreds of business; and **Engineering Fellows** \(2003\-6\), which developed and embedded research cultures in regional industry by engaging senior industrialists in PhD programmes within their own companies. The body of work that underpins the SAM project and its impact reflects a long\-term programme of research in Engineering; consequently, only a small sample of exemplar outputs and grants from each area are described. 

 **Design** 

 Design research at Sunderland has a broad scope, including work on material, product and system design. SAM participants benefit particularly from the Unit’s research on computational modelling and simulation in design. Exemplar projects include: 

-  Research led by Elmarakbi to model the behaviour of new graphene\-based materials used in fabrication of nanocomposites **\[R1\]**. It demonstrated that car bumpers produced with graphene\-enhanced composite materials had 40% higher specific energy absorption than traditional composite materials, and has greater stability. A method for forming graphene nanoplatelets was patented. 

-  The Eco2Trans project, which aimed to increase efficiency and range of electric vehicles. Computer simulation and rig\-based prototype modelling demonstrated that it is possible to improve overall energy consumption levels by around 5 to 12% by using a variable ratio gearbox within an electric vehicle **\[R2\]** 

 **Supply chain and process** 

 AMAP research on manufacturing processes and \(primarily automotive\) supply chains has created an evidence base used in the SAM project to increase output, reduce waste and enhance profit margins in participating SMEs. Research on virtual and augmented reality \(VR and AR\) has had particular application in designing new manufacturing, on\-boarding, auditing and customer acquisition processes. Exemplar projects include: 

-  OPTFEST redesigned modern maintenance technologies and practices from the aerospace and other industry sectors to improve the profitability of the engineering parts of the food processing sector **\[R3\]**. 

-  Work by Dixon et al. \(2017\) revealed inconsistencies in maintenance practice in the automotive supply chain, and how such inconsistency links with organisational cultural development. It resulted in a conceptual tool that guides manufacturers in the automotive supply chain towards a better understanding of how it can best monitor, develop and enrich its own maintenance strategy **\[R4\]**. 

-  AMAP research explores the use of augmented and virtual reality \(AR and VR\) in manufacturing settings. Haddad and Baglee conclude that AR could have a critical  role in knowledge transformation and knowledge transfer **\[R5\]**. 

 **Predictive maintenance** 

 Research on predictive maintenance led by Baglee examines the effect of innovation in maintenance systems, strategies and technology, and the barriers to adopting such innovation. This research has enhanced how participating SMEs approach maintenance. 

-  DYNAMITE resulted in an infrastructure for mobile monitoring technology and created new for\-decision systems incorporating sensors and algorithms. The key features include wireless telemetry, intelligent local history in smart tags, and on\-line instrumentation. A novel method AIMMS \(Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Maintenance System\) was developed to identify factors influencing the implementation of modern maintenance practices, and enable organisations to devise an overall maintenance strategy **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In early 2018, Sunderland’s School of Engineering, in collaboration with the European Regional Development Fund \(ERDF\), launched the Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing project \(SAM\). This pioneering knowledge exchange, research and business support project leverages the Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice’s \(AMAP\) industry\-facing applied research portfolio and expertise in the service of the regional manufacturing sector. It enables SMEs in the manufacturing supply chain to implement product and process development and adopt new technology, and make sound capital investment decisions. The resulting enhanced productivity through innovation benefits both the SMEs involved and the regional economy. To date the project has received £10.9m in funding. Its continued success is reflected in a recent decision by the Ministry of Housing and Local Communities to extend the project to 2023. 

 SAM was born out of AMAP’s successful and diverse research and knowledge exchange projects, including Engineering Fellows and Digital Factory. Research\-based expertise in design, supply chain and process, and predictive maintenance underpins the work undertaken with small and medium sized enterprises \(SMEs\) to address organisational challenges. It also informs the design and content of SAM’s micro\-factories where SMEs can visualise and test innovative technologies and processes. The project’s leadership and technical staff include University research staff **O’Brien** \(Director of AMAP, SAM Technical Lead and SAM Grant Panel member\) **Baglee** \(Head of Engineering, SAM Steering Committee member and SAM Grant Panel member\), **Morris** \(Lecturer and AMAP Operations Manager, and SAM Senior Manufacturing Specialist\) and **Mehrabi** \(Associate Professor of Engineering and SAM Research Lead\). The SAM Technical Team, comprising specialist researchers and technical staff at the University, work with SMEs to address organisational challenges In aligning the scope of the project with the \(diverse\) scope of AMAP’s research, SAM enables SMEs across the manufacturing sector to access research\-derived support to address a broad range of organisational challenges. 

 <ins> **Impact on</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>North East</ins> <ins>region**</ins> 

 The North East has lowest level of expenditure on R&D of any English region and performs poorly on all principal innovation metrics. There has been underinvestment by the private sector and capability failures where companies lack the skills, resources or other capacities to exploit innovation opportunities **\[S1\].** Sunderland City Council *“are acutely aware that economic challenges can make companies reticent to invest in the resources, such as staff and equipment, which are necessary for sustainability. Partnerships with research organisations can remove some of these barriers and give SMEs access to knowledge, equipment and facilities that are essential for innovation and their own sustainability”* **\[S2\].** 

 An external assessment of the SAM project **\[S1\]** carried out in October 2020 at the request of ERDF shows that it has achieved this goal, with **significant benefit to the regional economy**. The assessment directly attributes 198 FTE new jobs, additional £20m in sales turnover and £6.6m Gross Value Added to the SAM project. Productivity, measured by Output per Hour \(OpH\), increased following SAM support by an average of 9.1% to £64.43 \(based on participant self\-reporting\), compared to a sector\-level average of £39.25 across the UK and £36.45 at the North East level \(according to the Office for National Statistics’ 2018 OpH data for the manufacturing sector\). **The assessment concluded that for each £1 of funding, SAM delivered benefits of £2.34 for the regional economy.** 

 The project **supports the strategic development goals of both the City of Sunderland and the wider North East region**. The Business Growth Director of the North East LEP says: “ *The North East LEP has identified advanced manufacturing as one of four areas of strategic importance, where our assets and capabilities have strong opportunity for growth. The SAM project aligns with and supports these growth ambitions **. It is a critical activity underpinning our commitment to supporting businesses to capitalise on local research and innovation capability**… SAM provides technology expertise that encourages SMEs to explore new ways of working, and then financial grant support to de\-risk their take\-up of these technologies. **As a bridge between academia and industry, this is highly effective in enabling research to become commercialized**. The project, built on the foundations of the University of Sunderland’s excellent research in advanced manufacturing, has confirmed the role of the University in strengthening the regional economy and in removing barriers to innovation*” **\[S3\]**. 

 The Chief Executive of Sunderland City Council acknowledges the project’s relevance to the City Plan, adding: “ **The University’s research on advanced manufacturing provides the foundations of the SAM project, and underpins its contribution to economic growth in the city and wider region**… Advanced manufacturing is a key part of the local economy, and its sustainability and growth are critical… **The importance of this cannot be over\-estimated and has been increased as we seek to adapt to the wider challenges and opportunities of a post\-Covid post\-EU Exit economy**… The SAM project is an exemplar mechanism for enabling these partnerships and is a success because … the University of Sunderland undertakes applied research that is informed by industry needs. The industry\-facing nature of their research also brings credibility to the project – essential for demonstrating to SMEs the value of engaging with the project”* **\[S2\].** 

 **Impact on participating SMEs** 

 SMEs can lack the expertise, resources and space to embrace productivity\-enhancing innovation. The SAM project was designed to address these challenges by giving SMEs access to knowledge and facilities arising from the UoA’s rich history of academic research, innovation and industry partnerships. SMEs benefit from four strands of support: 

-  Knowledge exchange projects of up to 15 days with the SAM Technical Team, working with deliberate focus on areas where there is both a specific advanced manufacturing need, and knowledge within the team and complementary University academic staff to address it. Since the project launch, **253** **SMEs have received 6,379 hours of bespoke, solutions\-focussed support \[S4\].** 

-  Grants of up to £50,000 to support the growth of new products and processes. The grant fund operates as an extension to Technical Team support which must have been received prior to applying for a grant. This ensures that the funding enables real and meaningful changes identified by the team as appropriate and realistic, and not simply allocating grants to fund ‘nice to have’ capital equipment. The UoA’s research, in underpinning advice to SMEs and funding decisions, ensures that every penny in grant money delivers impact. **46 SMEs have received grants totalling £1.13m. \[S4\]** 

-  Access to industry\-leading technology and equipment in five micro\-factories, including VR and AR software, a two\-material 3D printer, Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence measuring equipment, and a robotic welding cell. The design of the micro\-factories and the selection of equipment drew on knowledge of the state of the art and future trends in Industry 4.0 gained through applied research, and the facilities allow SMEs to visualise and test the advice they receive from the Technical Team before adopting it in their business. Approximately 150 SMEs have accessed this opportunity, and **71% of those who participated in the external assessment said it enabled them to decide whether or not to make a capital investment**. 57% of SME respondents did invest in kit as a result, and 43% said it enabled them to decide against investing **\[S1\]**. 

-  Research and development undertaken by SAM research fellows in response to specific SME requirements. **20 SMEs** have benefitted from this support **\[S4\].** 

 The project has supported **253 SMEs in the North East Local Economic Partnership region** \(County Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland\); 68% in developed areas, and 32% in transitional areas **\[S4\].** 

 The external assessor’s survey of all participating SMEs asked about the business outcomes of their participation in SAM. Of the 40 responding SMEs \(16% of SAM participants\) 56% reported **improved technical capability or understanding**; 44% have **introduced new or significantly improved products**; 41% reported **improved productivity**; and 37% have **introduced new or significantly improved processes**. In addition, over a third of respondents reported **increased production volume** and **improved product quality,** and more than a quarter counted a lasting relationship with the University of Sunderland, increased profit, improved efficiency, improved design capability, and implementation of new production technology among key benefits **\[S1\].** Clearly, AMAP’s applied research, made accessible through the SAM project, has resulted in improvements in key business performance metrics. 

 **SAM successfully boosted Technology Readiness Levels \(TLR\), with 65% of SMEs reporting an improved TRL after participation.** The average increase in TRL across respondents was 2 points on the scale, indicating that SAM has helped SMEs to move products closer to market. The greatest increase in TRL was one SME that went from TRL 2 to TRL 9 over the course of their participation, indicating their product is now at market **\[S1\]**. 

 Each SAM intervention is tailored and unique, but the following examples give a flavour of how the benefits enjoyed by participating SMEs derive from research. 

 **Funky Chunky Furniture** make standard and bespoke solid wood products. Its business was growing but the company was not ready for the high disruption and additional cost of relocating to new premises. In June 2019 SAM introduced the company to software integrated workflow along with metrics relating to sequence, frequency and time in all the pertinent steps. Inefficiencies in process were established, lean and efficient designs explored and suggestions for improved layouts established **\[S1\]**. **By July 2020, the company had experienced growth of approximately 30% \(approx. £36k net profit\) within their existing premises, with no increase in headcount or overheads** **\[S5\].** 

 Fabrication and machining group **Dyer Engineering Ltd** used SAM support to produce a suite of fully functioning, interactive ‘virtual site tours’ and 3D scans with a wide range of information relating to capability, process, and live performance data. These are available both on standard screen displays, viewable through a web browser and also as a VR walk\-through. **The virtual technology has been particularly valuable in customer acquisition and onboarding new employees in times of social distancing and has saved time and money in asset tracking and site surveys for the installation of new equipment.** Its adoption makes Dyer stand out from competitors as an early adopter and innovator **\[S6\]**. 

 SAM advice enabled hygiene solutions manufacturer **AGMA Ltd** to meet the exploding demand for its sanitisers and hand gels linked to COVID\-19. SAM expertise helped them identify areas of the business that could be improved through automation and invest in the machinery required to automate the process, safeguarding 30 jobs while increasing output, reducing lead\-times and increasing sales. AGMA’s Finance Director says “ *This would not have been possible had it not been for the support we received from the SAM Project*… **This support has allowed us to tap into R&D expertise, previously out of reach, and invest in state\-of\-the\-art machinery that will help us compete for years to come**”** **\[S7\].** 

 **DLAW Contractors**, a relatively new company which manufactures renewable energy solutions, was supported by the SAM project to both identify the machinery it needed in order to improve its manufacturing processes and with grant funding towards its purchase. **This support helped the company to go on to win its largest and most valuable order to date to the value of approximately £300,000 \[S2\].**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Manchester research has improved primary health care service provision across Greater Manchester \(GM\) and England. Researchers from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care \(CLAHRC\) evaluated two NHS schemes that provided 7\-day access to general practice \(GP\) health services across GM. The results highlighted the benefits and challenges of 7\-day access, which in turn led to the NHS in GM investing significantly in extended access provision for 2,800,000 people. The research also influenced the design and implementation of the resulting scheme. Subsequently, the innovative evaluation methodology developed by the Manchester team was adopted at the national level and informed Department of Health strategies, service provision and resource allocation for primary care across England. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Policymakers have suggested that primary care facilities have the potential to alleviate growing pressure on NHS hospital services by diverting patients from Accident and Emergency, and other urgent care services, to GP surgeries. However, GP services were limited in their capacity to ease the strain on hospitals because they did not open outside core weekday hours. In October 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a GBP50,000,000 Challenge Fund to improve access to general practice \(now called the GP Access Fund \(GPAF\)\). In the same year, NHS England GM announced a GBP4,100,000 investment to improve GP access in Greater Manchester. University of Manchester researchers, funded through CLAHRC, partnered with NHS England GM \(renamed in 2016 Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership \(GMHSCP\) and referred to here as ‘the NHS in GM’\) to evaluate this programme. The researchers evaluated the potential of 7\-day GP access to provide a range of benefits to patients and the NHS, including cost reductions, higher patient satisfaction and reduced A&E demand. Implementing 7\-day access to general practice was a priority in GM following the devolved health and social care funding settlement in 2016, and coproduction between CLAHRC researchers and the NHS in GM resulted in timely evidence for implementation. 

 Prior to the work of the CLAHRC team, researchers and policy makers employed before\-and\-after assessment methodologies without effective comparators. The CLAHRC research team argued this approach did not provide accurate data for decision\-makers in the NHS because they had the potential to severely over\- or under\-estimate the effects of the service \[1\]. Professor Ruth Boaden, Professor Damian Hodgson and Dr William Whittaker devised a novel research methodology which combined a quantitative Difference in Difference \(DiD\) approach \(rather than a before\-and\-after approach\) with qualitative analyses \[1\], \[2\]. Combining this quantitative method with the addition of qualitative data enabled the research team to generate evidence based not only on health outcomes but also on organisational processes and activities, which had not previously been included in the analysis of 7\-day access. The significance of this innovative methodology was that it enabled a more robust assessment of the benefits and challenges of 7\-day access than the simple before\-after assessment without qualitative data that was commonly used to evaluate healthcare provision in the NHS. 

 The CLAHRC team subsequently received funding from the NHS in GM and developed two projects that used its new methodology to evaluate two schemes designed by the NHS in GM to deliver evening and weekend GP appointments. 

 An initial project, known as the Primary Care Demonstrator Evaluation \(October 2013 \- April 2015\), assessed the pilot scheme for 7\-day access in GM. The key findings were as follows \[3\]: 

-  Extended access reduced A&E activity leading to a 26.6% reduction in cost 

-  GP Practices with 7\-day appointments exhibited a 26.4% relative reduction in patient\-initiated referrals to A&E with minor problems \(10,933 fewer visits\), in comparison to practices without additional evening and weekend appointments 

-  The cost of fewer attendances at A&E amounted to GBP767,000 over a 12\-month period. However, this decrease did not release cash that could be reinvested elsewhere because there was no concomitant reduction in staff or facilities given that demand for A&E services from other sources continued to increase. 

-  No significant positive or negative impact was observed on patient satisfaction. 

 The initial research project provided robust evidence that whilst additional primary care appointments outside of working hours can reduce attendance at A&E, they might not result in cost savings to the health service as a whole unless staffing is reduced as a result. Based on these results, the CLAHRC team recommended that 7\-day access interventions would need to see significant health gains and/or need to address issues of spare capacity in uptake in order to justify the financial investment \[3\]. The research also identified a number of aspects of system design in primary care that needed to be taken into consideration when delivering extended hours.  Specifically, the team identified and recommended six key enablers for successful extended access: workforce and organisational development, information technology, information governance, engagement and communication, inter\-organisational collaboration, and supporting infrastructure. These aspects of system design emerged as important but could not all be addressed because extensive system redesign was impractical in a pilot scheme. Accordingly, the team highlighted the need for further research to examine how 7\-day access could be scaled\-up across the whole of GM. 

 Based on insights gained from the first research project, the NHS in GM agreed to partner with the CLAHRC team to assess the subsequent roll\-out of the 7\-day Access scheme to all 2,800,000 million people in GM during 2016 \[6\]. This second research project identified barriers and enablers when scaling\-up the scheme beyond self\-selected pilot sites to cover the whole of GM, thus addressing the limitations of piloting identified in the first report \[3\], \[4\]. The key findings of this second project were \[5\]: 

-  A total of 51,806 appointments were made available in 2016, of which 37,560 were booked and 33,266 were attended by patients 

-  Patients using the extended service tended to be younger and a greater proportion were women, compared to patients attending during core hours \[6\] 

-  Provision and uptake of extended access varied greatly between areas within GM but increased during the period of analysis \(2016\), including on Sundays \[6\] 

-  Provision and uptake were influenced significantly by variations in service design and implementation, particularly variations in the process of referral and the location of the extended access hubs across the different areas of GM \[6\]. 

 As explained below, this body of work had a significant influence on resource allocation, evidence\-based service design, and the strategy and implementation plan for the rollout of 7\-day access, which in turn improved service provision for patients across Greater Manchester and the rest of England.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact on Resource Allocation** 

 The impact of the research has been on government resource allocation for primary care, both within GM and at the national level. 

 The CLAHRC team’s first study \[3\], evaluating the GM pilot programme, provided key evidence to the NHS in GM and had an important influence on the commissioning of 7\-day access schemes across Greater Manchester, which resulted in significant resource allocation from local and national health funds. The Head of Primary Care Transformation at the GMHSCP stated that the CLAHRC report “ *provided vital evidence that was at the forefront of informing our decision to commit to rolling out extended access to the 2.8 million people living in Greater Manchester under our Primary Care Reform Programme”* \[A\]. The rollout commenced in 2017 and, informed by CLARHC research, was funded in Bury, Manchester and Wigan through a successful bidding process to the national GP Access Fund \(GPAF\) and the rest of the region by a significant investment of GBP41,000,000 in the Primary Care Reform programme across Greater Manchester \[B\] for areas not in receipt of GPAF funding.  The GMHSCP said that CLAHRC research “ *informed the design of the successful Greater Manchester bids for the national GP Access Fund worth a total of GBP10,700,000*” \[A\]. Overall, the evidence provided in the CLAHRC report informed resource allocation in GM totalling in excess of GBP50,000,000. 

 The impact of CLAHRC’s evaluation research has also extended beyond GM.  Based on the CLAHRC report \[3\], in 2015, the Manchester research team was approached by the successful bidders \(two consultancies, Mott MacDonald and SQW\) to be the evaluation provider for the NHS England GPAF, Phases 1 and 2.  Initially, the CLAHRC team was asked to provide methodological advice on the phase 1 evaluation of the GPAF initiative. Subsequently, the team embarked on a formal partnership for the evaluation of the national phase 2 GPAF scheme, which covered approximately 10,600,000 patients in over 1,400 GP practices through 37 different schemes \[C\]. Whittaker and Hodgson provided advice on metrics to capture appointment and cost data to inform cost\-effectiveness calculations. Whittaker also provided advice on the methodology for the quantitative analysis of A&E impacts of the GPAF schemes. 

 NHS England provided support to continue extended access in the areas it had funded through GPAF until March 2018.  From April 2018 Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) were required to commission and fund additional capacity in general practice to ensure improved access – including sufficient routine appointments at evenings and weekends to meet locally determined demand, thereby meeting requirements specified at the national level \[D\] \[E\], as detailed in Operational Planning Guidance \[F\]. In terms of resource allocation, commissioners were provided with funding of GBP6 per head of population \(weighted\) for each patient, to cover the full cost of the extended access service, on a recurrent basis, up to and including the financial year 2019/20 \[F\]. This figure was rounded up by NHS England from the cost per patient of GBP5.60 calculated by the CLAHRC team in their analysis for the first project \[G\]. 

 **Impacts on the Design of Strategies and Implementation Plans** 

 In addition to its influence on the allocation of public funds, the first CLAHRC report \[4\] also shaped the design and implementation of the 7\-day access scheme across Greater Manchester. As noted above, the report recommended six ‘enablers’ for the successful implementation of 7\-day access, supported by an implementation checklist, all of which were referenced as critical enablers in the GM Primary Care Strategy \[A\]. The Head of Primary Care Transformation at the GMHSCP, stated that “ *the plans and service specifications \[of the rollout\] were also heavily shaped by the evidence provided by the \[CLAHRC\] evaluation. This was supported by an implementation checklist that collated the learning from the evaluation concerning the enablers and barriers to implementation, a resource we now use to inform implementation of an array of new innovations or services in primary care*” \[A\]. 

 One particular enabler suggested by the CLAHRC report – a sufficient primary care workforce – has resulted in further commitments to innovative service design and organisational change by the NHS in GM. The importance of workforce highlighted in the CLAHRC research led to the creation of a Primary Care Workforce Strategy Group in December 2017.  The CLARHC team provided the evidence that influenced the workforce policies and strategic plans of the NHS in GM, with follow on CLAHRC work exploring the workforce challenges facing General Practices across GM being referenced in *The Greater Manchester Primary Care Workforce Strategy 2019 – 2024* \[H\], which was devised to address these challenges. 

 The CLAHRC research also influenced extended access to primary care nationally. Three of the seven core requirements \[E\] published in the national planning guidance draw on the results of both phases of the CLAHRC’s GPAF evaluation \[G\]: 

-  Timing of appointments: specified to meet local population needs. CLAHRC and national evaluations showed that demand was not uniform across the weekend \[6\] 

-  Capacity: Phase 1 evaluation showed that pilots were providing an additional 30 minutes of consultation time per 1,000 patients \[G\] and this figure has been directly used in the planning guidance \[F\] 

-  Measurement: the challenges of identifying and measuring appointment activity were noted in the CLAHRC reports \[3, 5\] and the national evaluations. Consequently, a new national tool has been commissioned to automatically measure appointment activity. In the interim, data is being produced from existing systems. 

 In addition, findings from the first report \[3\] and paper \[1\] were included in an evidence review by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) which was part of national guidance on emergency care in 2018 \[I\]. 

 **Impacts on Service Provision** 

 CLAHRC’s research into the rollout of the 7\-day access scheme helped to improve access to primary care and enhance service provision.  The Head of Primary Care Transformation at GMHSCP states that CLAHRC’s evidence was “ *vital”* to the rollout of the scheme, which resulted “ *in an additional 1,500 hours per week of GP and practice nurse time being available to patients across the region*” \[A\]. These additional hours equated to 51,806 extra out\-of\-hours appointments in 2016, with a significant increase in uptake by young and female patients, and a steady increase in uptake for weekend appointments \[6\]. By 2019 extended access was available to all patients across GM \[J\]. 

 By providing robust evidence for key decision\-makers and informing the design of successful implementation plans, the CLAHRC research helped to increase the volume, accessibility and convenience of primary care service provision for 2.8 million patients across the Greater Manchester region.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton \(UoS\) research into new electrochemical processes for the development of smaller\-faster\-smarter electronic devices has been used to introduce new audiences to electrochemistry, enhancing public awareness and understanding of its importance in our daily lives. Researchers worked with teachers and other professionals to develop a public engagement programme, built around hands\-on demonstrations of the *Electrochemical Circus* and a 6 m  2 m interactive *Water Transistor* exhibit, reaching >100,000 people at science venues and festivals, delivering \~6,000 face\-to\-face interactions, including with widening\-access schools, and engaging \~30,000 people through digital animations. Rigorous evaluations revealed significant percentage rises \(as much as 50% for some learning outcomes\) in the number of people displaying enhanced knowledge of electrodeposition and transistors and provided evidence of inspiring STEM study.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The deposition of functional materials on electrode surfaces in a patterned form underpins the fabrication of all the computer chips, data storage devices and solid\-state lasers in everyday use. Advances in electrodeposition methods, such as supercritical fluid electrodeposition \(SCFED\), offer new opportunities for novel nanomaterials that can be deposited with greater precision and the complexity of the nanostructures that can be formed. They open up the possibility of developing higher performing devices across a broad range of applications, for example ultra\-high\-density memory for computers, micro\-thrusters for satellites, energy\-harvesting and nanomedicine. 

 Multidisciplinary research led by the School of Chemistry has addressed an overarching objective: the development of \(non\-aqueous\) electrodeposition as an industrially viable technology that enables electrodeposition of metals and semiconductors inside 2D and 3D patterned templates. UoS researchers saw an opportunity for this fundamental science to have an immediate impact by addressing low public knowledge of the electrochemistry that underpins modern electronic devices. A concurrent public engagement programme was designed to provide inspiring and interactive examples of how UoS researchers are exploiting the distinctive attributes of electrochemical processes to advance technologies that are fundamental to everyone’s lives. 

 Since 2011, two EPSRC programme grants worth a combined £11.5m, along with responsive mode grants totalling £1.7m, have led to significant advances in the field of electrodeposition. The principles underlying these breakthroughs directly informed public engagement exhibits, hands\-on activities, and online and offline educational resources. Under the first programme \[ **G1**, **G3**\], the research team exploited the unique pore penetrating ability of supercritical fluids to develop a novel process for the electrodeposition of copper, silver and tellurium inside extreme nanoscale pores \[ **3.1**, **3.3**\]. Anodic aluminium oxide membranes were used as templates for the electrodeposition \[ **3.3**\]; these principles were reflected in a hands\-on, gold\-plated fingerprinting activity that became a core component of the Electrochemical Circus programme described in Section 4. Transistor devices were fabricated from individual tellurium nanowires and their electrical properties were characterised \[ **3.3**\]. This work gave rise to the interactive Water Transistor exhibit \(Section 4\), as a physical analogue of a field effect transistor \(FET\), to demonstrate the importance of transistors in modern electronics and how the UoS is developing nanoscale transistors for even smaller and faster devices. Through the ADEPT programme \[ **G2**\], UoS researchers further developed the emerging technologies, including the production of sub\-7 nm tin nanowires by electrodeposition from a supercritical fluid \[ **3.4**\]. Through \[ **G3**\], UoS researchers reported a new method for electrodeposition of metal chalcogenide semiconductor films and nanostructures to create switchable phase change memory devices \[ **3.2**\]. This opened up the prospect of electrochemical growth of other metal chalcogenides with applications ranging from electronics to thermoelectric devices and photovoltaics. The method was developed \[ **G2**\] to produce a 3D patterned phase change memory matrix with an integrated selector \[ **3.5**\].  Researchers also developed a new method for the electrodeposition of mono\- and few\-layer 2D transition metal dichalcogenides \(TMDCs\) \[ **G4**, **3.6**\]. 2D TMDCs are an emerging class of semiconductors whose properties depend on the combination of metal and chalcogen, as well as the layer thickness, with emerging prospects in multiple high\-tech devices. Our gold fingerprinting PE activity was developed to demonstrate electroplating into the pattern formed by a person’s fingerprint as a visual analogue to patterned templates used for next generation electronic devices.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The role of electrochemical processes in the fabrication of electronic devices on which society is wholly reliant is poorly appreciated. In 2014, School of Chemistry researchers embarked on a public engagement programme to address the imbalance between a lack of public knowledge of transistors and electrochemistry and the ubiquity of consumer devices that were only made possible through advances in these fields. In engaging the public in their pursuit of novel electrodeposition technologies for the next generation of electronic devices, the team set two key objectives: introduce new audiences, including schoolchildren, to electrochemistry and inspire them to learn more; enhance and sustain public knowledge of electrochemical principles and their intrinsic relevance to daily life. Three key principles underpinned the approach: dedicated funding, team\-based delivery and rigorous evaluation to guide continuous feedback and improvement. A 0.3 FTE public engagement role was costed into the ADEPT \[ **G2**\] grant. A further £30,000 came from the ESPRC Impact Acceleration Account, along with an Institute of Physics grant and UoS internal funds. Engagement ideas were generated across the School of Chemistry and volunteers, including UGs, were invited to participate in delivery. The programme was designed and evaluated according to Arts Council England’s Generic Learning Outcomes, with a focus on two criteria: ‘Knowledge & Understanding’ and ‘Enjoyment, Inspiration, Creativity’. Outcomes shaped an iterative design process, allowing methods and exhibits to evolve. The overall programme, centred around the Electrochemical Circus and Water Transistor, reached an in\-person audience of >100,000 over the impact period, delivering 6,000 direct, face\-to\-face interactions between researchers and the public. Learning outcomes are detailed below. 

 
**Enhancing public understanding of electrochemistry at large\-scale science events:** Initially researchers developed two interactive demonstrations that formed the core of their public engagement at large\-scale science events. They built the mobile Water Transistor, a physical analogue of an FET, to demonstrate how switches inside computers function. It used water to represent electrical charge, with pressurised squeezing affecting flow through a long, thin balloon. It reflected the underlying research principles and the motivation for research on the electrodeposition of nanostructured semiconductors \[ **G1**, **G3**, **3.1**, **3.3**\]. They also created an activity that demonstrated how gold is electroplated from solution. Naturally occurring oils on people’s fingers were used to template gold deposition around the fingerprint pattern and people took home their own gold\-plated fingerprint. This represented the templated electrodeposition process used to produce semiconductors for phase change memory, infrared detection, and other applications \( **3.2**\- **3.5**\). The 3\-minute activity provided an opportunity to discuss the underpinning science at a level of complexity appropriate to age or knowledge levels, the relevance of this chemistry to modern electronic devices and how UoS researchers were advancing the technologies. Both demonstrations visited the National Big Bang Fair 2014, the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition \(RSSSE\) 2015 and Southampton Science and Engineering Festival \(SotSEF\) 2014\-2019. Footfall of >40,000 people and 6,000 face\-to\-face interactions were recorded across these events **\[5.1\]**. Data collected at RSSSE 2015 showed that as a result of engaging with SCFED research, there was the following transfer of knowledge: an increase in the number of people who could identify a supercritical fluid as ‘a hot, dense gas’ from 5% to 54%; an increase in those who identified electroplating as ‘a bottom\-up, atom\-by\-atom process’ from 28% to 46%; and an increase in those who correctly identified a transistor as ‘an electrically\-operated switch’ from 34% to 69% \[ **5.1**\]. The gold fingerprinting activity was as popular with children as it was with industry professionals and proved a versatile vehicle for engaging with varied publics. The souvenir fingerprint ensured the impact of the interaction lasted longer than the activity itself. Representative comments from people who interacted with the demonstrations included: “awesome”; “it’s fascinating, thank you so much”; “very informative and well explained” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **Design of a permanent exhibit to increase audience diversity, further improve public knowledge of transistors and sustain impact beyond annual events:** The mobile Water 

 Water Transistor at WSC 

Transistor went through five design iterations to make improvements on the basis of audience feedback. Building on lessons learned, in 2017 the team commissioned interactive exhibit specialists Science Projects to build a permanent, large\-scale Water Transistor exhibit at Winchester Science Centre \(WSC\). Researchers took this decision in order to engage a broader audience \(WSC targets 5\-12 year olds and their families\) on a consistent, daily basis. The exhibit was installed in Jan. 2019. At 6 m long and 2 m high it occupies a prominent position in the main visitor space. Modules demonstrate how transistors help computers make calculations and allow people to ‘race’ transistors used in electronic devices to see how fast they are. A video explains the underpinning research \[ **3.1**\- **3.4**\], how UoS researchers are developing nano\-transistors for even faster electronic devices, and introduces the researchers involved. Feedback is gathered via a touch screen panel.  Using observation data, the number of people interacting with the Water Transistor from Jan. 2019 to Mar. 2020 was >75,000 based on an average of 30 visitors per hour \[ **5.2**\]. This equates to one in three visitors to WSC. The video was played 5,420 times, and there were 11,629 responses to the feedback questionnaire. Key outcomes \[ **5.2**\] were: 77% of people found the water transistor enjoyable to use; 65% said it helped them to understand how transistors work; 64% correctly identified transistors as electrically operated switches; 79% recognised that transistors are faster than humans; and 71% understood that computers are fast because of transistors. Further evaluation \[ **5.2**\] was carried out in person by a student intern in summer 2019; 96% of adults either strongly agreed or agreed with the statement ‘I enjoyed using the water transistor’. Data revealed clear evidence that the exhibit increased public awareness of the role of the transistor in everyday consumer electronics, and how electrochemistry research can enhance our lives. Before interacting with the exhibit, only 35% of people recognised the word transistor and knew of its role in modern electronics, but afterwards this proportion increased to 80% and 75%, respectively. Furthermore, 84% agreed they had learnt something new about computers/transistors; 89% said they had a better understanding of how chemistry improves our lives; 71% were inspired to find out more about electronics; 74% recognised that UoS scientists are working on new devices; 95% of people would recommend the water transistor to others. Ben Ward \(Chief Executive, WSC\) highlighted “ *the value of incorporating real, recent, internationally\-published research in the exhibit*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Creating the Electrochemical Circus to widen access and inspire further STEM study:** In 2017, in order to both widen access to children less likely to attend science venues, and strengthen wider appeal of the programme, existing activities were consolidated under a new Electrochemical Circus brand. A range of activities were brought together, including making batteries out of fruit, the passing of a current through a red cabbage to explain electrochemical reactions and the Suitcase of Curiosities, a collection of objects related to electrochemistry research relevant to \[ **3.1\-3.6**\]. PGR/ECR electrochemists and undergraduate chemistry students at UoS were trained as Electrochemical Circus volunteers. Data from SotSEF 2019 \[ **5.4**\] showed that of those visitors surveyed after interacting with the Electrochemical Circus, 71% identified that electrons move from high to low potential; 94% of people understood that an electrical current refers to the flow of electrons through a circuit; >90% identified that electrons flow through an electrolyte, a metal wire, a lemon, but not a chocolate bar; 72% understood that electrodeposition is a process during which metal ions in the solution move to form a layer of metal atoms on the electrode; 87% said they were interested in learning more about electrochemistry. A large majority of people surveyed \(87%\) did not identify as having high levels of prior electrochemistry knowledge. The team was presented with the ‘Wow Factor’ award by the SotSEF organising committee. 

 The Water Transistor formed the centrepiece of a series of Electrochemical Circus school visits at WSC in June and July 2019. Harder\-to\-reach pupils were targeted specifically according to widening access criteria and workshops were designed to complement the schools’ own science curricula. A total of 128 Year 8 pupils and eight teachers attended. Questionnaires \[ **5.5**\] demonstrated the following changes in understanding: that electricity can be made by chemical reactions \(from 43% to 70%\); that digital electronics depends upon transistors \(from 30% to 80%\); that transistors are electrically operated switches \(from 29% to 74%\); and that computers are ‘clever’ because transistors are fast \(from 36% to 88%\). Data collected at follow\-up visits to schools in December 2019 showed retention of this knowledge: 45% of pupils remembered that transistors are electrical switches; 51% of pupils remembered that computers are fast because of transistors. Pupils rated their overall enjoyment of the Electrochemical Circus at 4.2/5. On our return to the schools we asked students what they remembered from their summer WSC visit: 95% of students remembered visiting the centre, 86% said that they had enjoyed their visit, and 81% remembered meeting scientists at the WSC. Students remembered the individual activities, with gold fingerprinting being remembered by almost all \(98%\) students; some students still had their gold fingerprints in their wallets and purses and showed them to the team. 

 In 2019, the Electrochemical Circus featured at two festivals. The first was *Light Up Poole\!* Digital Arts Festival \(February 2019\), with the aim of engaging an audience that might typically favour arts events over science. A total of 1,071 people took part in The Photon Shop, a series of activities relating to the science of light. Gold fingerprinting was presented in the context of electroplating to make materials for infrared sensing. It featured prominently in the overall evaluation data as an activity that the audience had enjoyed and understood \[ **5.6**\]. In addition, 100% agreed that the event was enjoyable and would recommend it to others; 90% said that they had learnt something new about science; 81% gained a better understanding of what scientists do; 87% were inspired to find out more about science; and 71% of visitors were more likely to consider studying science or recommend science to others. The Electrochemical Circus visited the Science Museum in April 2019 to take part in CHEMFEST, in celebration of the International Year of the Periodic Table. Visitor numbers were 7,000 \(4,000 adults, 3,000 children\) and the UoS team created >800 gold fingerprints over a four\-day residency. The event coordinator said \[ **5.7**\]: “ *The families had a great time and it’s amazing to have something so memorable to take home with them. I know many were also inspired by electrochemistry, a field many were unaware of how vast and important it is.*” 

 While demonstrating impact of public engagement on uptake of STEM subjects is extremely difficult, the evaluation of the Electrochemical Circus included a survey question with a 5\-point Likert scale asking how likely people were to consider further study or encouraging others towards further study of science. These showed an increase from 18% to 31% in positive responses \[ **5.5\].** 

 **Engaging online audiences in electrochemistry** \[ **5.8**\]: In 2019 the UoS research team worked with Errant Science to create animated gifs as a novel way to communicate key electrochemical principles to a new online audience. The animations were published via the Electrochemical Circus Twitter account. The first animation \(April 2019\) featured the Daniell Cell and achieved 11,554 impressions, 3,389 media views, and 693 engagements. A second animation communicating the electroplating process \(July 2019\) achieved 7,266 impressions, 1,082 media views, and 231 engagements. There was particular interest from teachers in the UK and overseas, with most highlighting the content to their A Level/AP Chemistry students. The second animation \(July 2019\) featured the reduction of gold at the electrode during electroplating and was designed to complement the gold fingerprinting activity. It achieved 6934 impressions, 1050 views and 186 engagements, and was described as being ‘ *superbly explained*’. The account reached 345 followers, with 120 of those being linked to the two animations. 

 Feedback from 80 teachers stimulated further developments through the production of a bespoke set of teacher resources in response to a need identified by researchers in the UoS Chemical Education Research Group \(S. Barnes, PhD Thesis, UoS, 2020\) \[ **5.9**\]. Electrochemistry was the theme for the 2020 Wessex Group Chemistry Teachers’ Conference \(100 delegates\), with a Keynote presentation by P Bartlett that was well received \(100% of respondents rated the talk as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ \[ **5.10**\]\). Feedback at this event and from teacher focus groups was used to create a series of resources hosted at *discoverelectrochemistry* \[ **5.11**\]; Robert Campbell \(former Chemistry teacher and current lead on the secondary science PGCE course at St Mary’s University says, “ *recommending the Discover Electrochemistry website to trainee teachers has been invaluable*”, describing them as “ *a critical tool to support teachers develop their confidence in teaching electrochemistry*” \[ **5.12**\]; Dr Emma Wright \(KS5 Science Coordinator, Queen Elizabeth’s Girls’ School\) says, “ *genuinely, the resources are brilliant and I will use them every year*” \[ **5.13**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research produced by UoG researchers has been used to transform policy, practice and training at national and local levels concerning crime reduction in urban retail and entertainment locations. Examining business crime reduction partnership activity, and working alongside national organisations, police forces, crime prevention practitioners and businesses, UoG researchers identified principles of effective crime reduction partnership design and for increasing communication, community cohesion, feelings of safety, and information sharing practices within partnerships. The researchers used these principles to fundamentally reshape national and local public policy, practice, services and training and secure funding for business crime reduction, bringing demonstrable benefits to thousands involved in UK crime reduction schemes and to the countless others using and working in the businesses involved. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to the authors’ work, there had been a distinct lack of academic study in the UK and internationally concerning: 

-  The occurrence and impact of crime and associated disorder affecting businesses in urban retail and entertainment districts; 

-  The offending behaviour of those who commit these offences; 

-  The approaches being employed by business crime reduction schemes to tackle these issues and the operation and management of such schemes. 

 As a result of this, UK national guidance on best practice for business crime reduction was not underpinned by rigorous academic evidence and was lacking in numerous areas. Identifying this shortfall, Stafford and Hobson, both experts on community crime reduction through partnership approaches, conducted the following body of research. This comprised: qualitative analysis of 149 interviews with businesses involved in the Business Crime Reduction Partnership \(BCRP\) Gloucester City Safe conducted between 2014 and 2017 \(output 1\); inferential and regression analysis of business crime data \(c.5000 incidents\) between 2014 and 2018 \(output 3\); and a national survey of 243 business crime reduction scheme managers conducted in 2018 \(output 2\). 

 The findings from this research that underpin the impacts described in this case study are: 

-  Almost all members of Gloucester’s BCRP were positive about the achievements of the partnership and the approach to crime reduction that it employs. Members reported an increased sense of community cohesion and feelings of safety arising from their involvement \(output 1\); 

-  Key characteristics of the partnership’s approach were found to offer unique benefits and were clear means of best practice for tackling crime and increasing safety. These included the breadth of the partnership’s crime\-tackling focus, the commercial diversity among members, and its day and night\-time operation. Because some offenders commit offences against more than one type of business, offend during both the daytime and night\-time trading hours and commit more than one type of offence, BCRPs without the breadth of focus that span these parameters might not be aware of the extent of this group’s activity \(outputs 1\-3\); 

-  The partnership’s crime reduction and safety increasing successes arose largely from high levels of member communication, close\-working and timely information sharing. There were techniques employed by the partnership that were particularly effective for facilitating close working among members and for recruiting new members. Factors that limited information sharing or usage did exist, however, and in some instances were restricting offending prevention efforts \(outputs 1\-3\); 

-  Place\-based zonal exclusion or banning schemes were found to be a useful tool for tackling offending behaviour. They require high levels of communication between members, clear terms and conditions and appropriate policies in place concerning data sharing and storage \(output 3\); 

-  Valuable insight into risk and patterns of offending behaviour can be generated through the analysis of crime reduction scheme data. For example, in Gloucester individuals who continued to offend after the receipt of the BCRP’s sanction were found to be more likely to commit further offences at another business location rather than revisit the premise at which they committed their original offence. This offending displacement highlights further the importance of information sharing between partnership members \(output 2\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prior to the authors’ efforts, there was a distinct lack of robust evidence underpinning UK national guidance and training on best practice for business crime reduction and BCRP operation. The authors’ achievements have brought about significant improvements to national and local public policy and services in these areas and brought demonstrable benefits to thousands involved in UK business crime reduction and to the retailers and members of the public who are affected by business crime. 

### 1.  Transformation of BCRP UK National Standards 

 Stafford was appointed Chair of the National Business Crime Centre’s \(NBCC\) Governing Board \(responsible for BCRP accreditation to National Standards\) in September 2018, and subsequently led a review of the organisation’s BCRP National Standards and supporting application and assessment guidance. According to the Chief Inspector and NBCC lead for the Metropolitan Police \(source d\); ‘Dr Stafford’s research now firmly underpins the revised Standards \(source a\), and the assessor \(source b\) and applicant \(source c\) guidance documents make direct reference to the findings from Dr Stafford’s research, promoting best practice in nine key areas’ \(including partnership design, data analysis, member activity, information sharing and communication and the use of sanction and exclusion schemes\). Since the revised Standards were made public in November 2019, 25 new BCRP assessments against the standards have commenced and a further 36 partnerships are registered to be assessed. This illustrates that these 61 partnerships all claim to have adopted the principles of best practice that Stafford and Hobson’s research identified. 

### 1.  ‘Purple Flag’ accreditation and £140,000 funding gained for business crime reduction in Gloucester, and counter\-business crime communications informed in Brighton & Hove 

 Researchers at UoG began working with Gloucester City Safe in 2014. Since then, Stafford and Hobson have conducted research into the operation and effectiveness of this BCRP, providing it with much needed insight into public perceptions of crime and safety and into its performance and achievements. Findings from output 1 were included in Gloucester’s successful application for Purple Flag accreditation from the Association of Town and City Management in February 2018. The researchers’ findings concerning the importance of effective, efficient and timely information sharing prompted the partnership in 2018 to reorganise its online offender image galleries for members and eliminate the requirement for members to report incidents to both the partnership and to the police by introducing a new automated process. The partnership uses Stafford’s research as a promotional tool and its manager acknowledges \(source e\) that this will have played a part in the recruitment of over 50 more members and in increased incident report volumes \(from approximately 1000 in year 1 to 1,807 in 2019\). Evidence of the partnership’s success and achievements captured by the research were also used to bring about increased support, resources and £140,000 funding for City Protection Officers. 

 The statistical analysis conducted in output 3 for Gloucester City Safe was repeated using similar data from Brighton and Hove BCRP. According to supporting testimony from its Director \(source f\), this partnership has benefitted from the insight into offending activity provided by this research and has used this evidence to ‘inform its communications with stakeholders concerning risk and the importance of information sharing’. 

### 1.  Guidance for increasing safety and reducing business crime embedded in crime reporting training and shared with 450 UK crime reduction initiatives 

 Littoralis, the company that provides the crime reporting platform  [Disc](https://www.discagainstcrime.com/) \(used by Gloucester City Safe, Brighton and Hove BCRP and over 450 other UK crime reduction schemes\), has used Stafford’s research to promote the benefits of the platform, and through training underpinned by this research helped the platform’s users reduce business crime, improve their practice and increase levels of safety, community cohesion, information sharing and communication. 

 Stafford began working with Littoralis in 2018, and in partnership with the company conducted a national survey of 243 crime reduction scheme managers. According to supporting testimony from its Director \(source i\), Littoralis used the findings from Stafford’s research \(outputs 2&3\) in a series of press releases and a twitter campaign to promote the value and benefits of business crime reduction partnerships \(source g\) and of offender exclusion schemes \(source h\), and shared the output 2 report with all of its 450\+ users and stakeholders. The company’s training for Disc users is underpinned firmly by Stafford’s research. Littoralis uses examples from this research to promote the Disc system and encourage best practice concerning business crime reduction and scheme management. The Littoralis Director also states \(source i\) that the research has played a significant part in winning at least 10 new customers in the last 12 months.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Worldwide companies in nuclear, chemical, automotive, and micro\-electronics industries regularly use an approach called ‘density functional theory’ \(DFT\) in the design and selection of new materials. To do this requires an efficient, reliable, and scalable method to analyse DFT output at the core of this process. Research undertaken at Loughborough University developed an algorithm for analysing DFT output that has been adopted worldwide. The beneficial impacts on the national and global commercial users of the algorithm have been: 1\) accelerated product development and reduced research and development costs, 2\) influenced the design and selection of new materials for improved performance and reduced operational costs, and 3\) improved safety in the development and storage of nuclear materials.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 DFT is a method for solving the equations of quantum mechanics for the probability distribution of electrons in molecules and materials. It is used around the globe by industry and academia in the development of new materials and chemicals. Loughborough researchers have created a numerical method to partition charge distributions from DFT electronic structure calculations into atomic volumes, allowing for the visualisation of atomic bonding and for charge analysis. This methodology has become a standard analysis tool that works in conjunction with and has been incorporated into commercially available DFT software packages such as VASP, CASTEP and GAUSSIAN. For example, the algorithm is bundled with the VASP DFT code that has 15,000 organisational users worldwide. It is routinely used by both industry and academia to understand chemical and materials properties. This fundamental insight into such charge distributions has underpinned the computational design of new materials from over 50 companies. 

 The developed method uses Bader’s charge analysis, which is a way of partitioning the charge between atoms from electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials, into atomic volumes based only on the electronic charge density. These atomic volumes are separated by zero flux surfaces, where the charge density is a minimum perpendicular to the surface. Finding these surfaces is challenging because the definition of the surface is non\-local – one cannot determine if a single point is on a zero\-flux surface without knowing the neighbouring points on the surface that define the surface normal. Our methodology provides an elegant solution to this problem that is qualitatively different from previous approaches and is an order of magnitude faster and more accurate. 

 Before our work, to do a Bader charge analysis in an accurate and numerically efficient way, processing the output of DFT quantum chemistry packages, was inefficient and not robust. While the analysis of small molecules was possible, the complex atomic topologies found in material systems could not, in general, be analysed. Underpinning publications \[ **R1**\] and \[ **R2**\] describe numerical methods that not only do this accurately but also scale linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces in the system, so now large systems are feasible even on a small computer. This improved method is currently used in conjunction with all the widely used commercial quantum chemistry packages. The methodology described in \[ **R1**\] and \[ **R2**\] was devised in conjunction with Henkelman’s group at UT Austin and the associated software is now publicly available from the UT Austin web site. The main coding was done by a postdoctoral researcher, Ed Sanville, at Loughborough under the supervision of Prof. Smith and Dr Kenny. Importantly, the work at Loughborough identified an orientation bias in an earlier algorithm and the collaborative work described in \[ **R1**\] and \[ **R2**\] removes this bias and is now the established method for doing Bader’s analysis in materials. 

 An additional application of the Bader method allows the potential energy in a quantum system to be allocated to an atom. In a quantum description of a solid, the concept of a potential energy per atom is not defined. Reference \[ **R1**\] uses the Bader charge allocation to define a potential energy per atom in a quantum system in a unique way, which can then be used to accurately parameterise classical potential functions, thus allowing computation for large systems of atoms beyond the scope of numerical quantum calculations.

 “I am able to corroborate the significant impact of the Bader charge analysis code” which “was incredibly useful to us in the investigation of hydrogen adsorption on a range of actinide oxide surfaces where the actinides investigated included Np, U and Pu.” \[ **S3**\] 

  

 He also says that their use of the Loughborough code 

 “has important implication for understanding long\-term storage behaviour of these materials” … “Understanding actinide materials and the hydridising process is a key focus for AWE and the ability to investigate this process in silico ahead of experimental investigations enables a more focussed programme of work to be undertaken and hence maximise research outcomes.” \[ **S3**\] 

 Thus, the use of the Bader charge analysis code has enabled them over the impact period to save significant time and money as they discharge their duty to the UK. 

 In a similar way, <ins>Johnson Matthey PLC</ins>, a British  [multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation) specialising in speciality chemicals and  [sustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) technologies, operating in over 30 countries, with annual sales of £4.2 bn and having >15,000 employees worldwide, used the Loughborough code to develop 

 “new materials for new product developments in e.g. rechargeable battery for electric vehicles, fuel cells and other key sustainable technologies across a wide range of application sectors” … “The main impact of the research translated into an **improved development time for new products and processes**. The insight given by the Bader charge analysis code enables us to select in silico new potential materials faster and with more confidence for experimental testing” … “A good indicator of the importance and benefit it brings to JM is the fact that **we now use it in approximately 30% of our projects**” \[ **S4**\]. 

 International reach of our code can be seen for example from its use by <ins>Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd</ins> \(a Japanese manufacturer of electronic components\). Their Senior Researcher, Yasuaki Okada, wrote that 

 “\[t\]he theoretical prediction was utilized by R&D members to clarify promising cation species in electrolyte and we could reduce the number of experiments for the development of this electrochemical capacitor products” \[ **S5**\]. 

 A similar statement is made in a letter of support from <ins>Umicore Denmark</ins> \[ **S5**\]. 

 **Impact 2: Influenced design and selection of new materials for improved performance and reduced operational costs** 

 At the <ins>Government of India</ins> <ins>Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</ins> \(BARC\) new materials for thorium fuel based nuclear reactors are developed. The Loughborough Bader charge analysis code was used as an integral part of their work, in a manner typical of the ways the code is applied in new materials development. They tested various fuels containing compounds of thorium, using the code to identify the interaction between gases such as Helium produced in the fuel rod by the fission, which then affects over time the structure of the rod, leading to swelling and reducing its lifespan. In their letter of support \[ **S6**\], Dr Arya, the Head of the Glass and Advanced Materials Division writes that the freely downloadable Loughborough code was 

 “used in conjunction with quantum mechanical software packages \[and\] was incredibly useful to us”. He then goes on to write “The impact of the research was therefore a change in the design of the composition of the fuel to minimise adverse effects of fission gases and frequency of refuelling, thereby saving significant amounts of money.” 

 The same benefit of influencing design and selection of new materials is articulated by <ins>Johnson Matthey PLC</ins> \[ **S4**\] which says the Bader code “allows us to guide, make and test different materials”. Similarly, in their letter of support, <ins>Murata</ins> <ins>Manufacturing Co. Ltd</ins> \[ **S5**\] state that the code “was utilized by R&D members to clarify promising cation species in electrolyte” also shows this impact. 

 Also, from the publications that cite the use of the Bader code, one finds more examples of the code influencing the design and selection of new materials by non\-academic users. For example, <ins>BASF</ins>, the German multinational chemicals company \(the largest chemicals producer in the world\), rejected a potential cathode material for lithium ion batteries after using the Bader code \[ **S5**\]. Similarly, <ins>CNEA</ins>, the main nuclear energy research laboratory in Argentina, used the Bader charge methodology to help assess the use of ThC as a potential material for future fission reactors \[ **S5**\]. 

 **Impact 3: Improved safety in the development and storage of nuclear materials** 

 The <ins>Government of India</ins> <ins>Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</ins> \(BARC\), who used the Loughborough code in their development of new materials for thorium fuel based nuclear reactors, emphasized in their letter of support \[ **S6**\] the impact on **safety** that our research has had – and will continue to have in the future –  writing that 

 “the modelling involved in getting the correct fuel design is absolutely crucial which will drastically reduce the financial burden and will provide safeguard against any fatal nuclear accident. We will continue to test new fuel compositions to determine the optimum and the Bader charge analysis will continue to play a crucial role in this design process.” 

 The Government of India Bhabha Atomic Research Centre \[ **S6**\] also commented that “by proper designing, the integrity of nuclear fuel can be maintained over a longer time scale with all safety features intact.” 

 Similarly, the <ins>Atomic Weapons Establishment</ins> \(AWE\) \[ **S3**\] emphasized the safety impact related to the long\-term storage of nuclear materials from their research using the Loughborough code.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by Surrey’s Photonics & Quantum Sciences Group has played a transformative role in establishing UK SME Plastipack as a world leader in innovative swimming pool cover technology. Working in close collaboration with Plastipack, Surrey’s research has led to the successful development of mass\-producible polymer\-based functional materials for increased efficiency in solar heating of swimming pools, while simultaneously preventing the growth of algae. This led to the development of new products for the company resulting in a substantial increase in revenue and an Institute of Physics Business Innovation award in 2018. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Surrey’s experience in the advanced design and optical and electrical characterisation of photonics and electronic materials underpins the research that led to the innovations and impact as described here. Since its invention of the strained layer quantum well laser, the group has been successful in developing new optical and photonic materials for commercialisation. Some examples of this include local self\-uniform materials **\[R1\]** and new materials for high efficiency light sources **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Owing to the Surrey group’s experience in the characterisation of thin films for photonic applications **\[R2, R3\]** and track record of engaging with industry **\[R4\]**, in 2011 Professor Sweeney was approached by Plastipack Ltd to help them to innovate their swimming pool\-covers. The research challenge was to create an affordable masterbatch \(the blend of additives introduced to the polymer during the extrusion manufacturing of the cover\) that would give selective transmission to maximise heating through solar radiation, while inhibiting photosynthesis to prevent algae growth, thus minimising use of chemicals harmful to the environment. This research project, led by Dr Steven Clowes, took the idea through all stages on the technology readiness scale \(from TRL1 to TRL9\). 

 Achieving the maximum solar heating from a pool cover, while inhibiting algae growth, requires a consideration of several factors. To prevent the algae growth, transmission of wavelengths below 750 nm must be filtered, whereas to heat the underlying water, the transmission of wavelengths around 750 nm must be optimised, while also considering the wavelength\-dependent absorption depths of water and the solar irradiance spectra. Existing heat models of swimming pools in the literature did not address the wavelength dependence of absorption and reflection in covers that is necessary to understand the heating performance of the selective transmission cover. The Surrey team developed new models for the solar energy balance **\[R5\]** and created simulations using finite element analysis. We studied how reflection is affected by the interaction of light with the pigments and the cover layer structure **\[R6\]** and explored non\-standard pigments **\[R5\]** to achieve the desired optical properties. Using the measured optical properties of the cover materials, these models were able to predict absolute solar heating efficiencies of the cover, i.e., the efficiency of converting solar energy into stored thermal energy in the pool’s water **\[R5\]**. Prior to a full large\-scale trial, laboratory\-based experiments were undertaken to optimise the composition of the cover material. 

 Through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Plastipack, the team designed a full\-scale test pool facility based at the company’s factory. This purpose\-built test facility provides five identical swimming pools with integrated temperature, radiation and weather data acquisition. Using this internationally unique facility, the Surrey team performed a full\-scale study to provide key empirical data to quantify the energy efficiencies of various cover materials. Our research showed that the selective\-transmission cover \(called new EnergyGuard™\) had a measurable efficiency of 56±3%, which is 12% higher than a standard opaque blue cover, while also retaining the algae inhibiting properties **\[R4\]**. Putting this into context, comparing with solar\-cell development, this magnitude of increase in the efficiency would take decades to achieve.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Established in 1998, Plastipack is a medium\-size UK company supplying a range of pool cover materials that cater for a diverse operating environment. Their business strategy of leading through innovation led them to develop their patented GeoBubble™ cover design prior to their collaboration with the University of Surrey. Our research has enabled Plastipack to maintain their position as leading innovators and stay ahead of commercial rivals in a very competitive market. 

###  Economic benefits of an internationally leading product 

 Laboratory based research at Surrey developed a patented **\[S1\]** low\-density polyethylene \(LDPE\) formula **\[R5\]** which enabled Plastipack’s existing opaque cover material \(EnergyGuard™\) to have wavelength selective transmission. Critical to success of this product was the ability to provide customers \(an international network of swimming pool cover suppliers\) with empirical evidence of the enhanced performance of the new EnergyGuard™ material **\[S2\]**.  The creation of the research test facility **\[S3\]** and the demonstration of experimental evidence, both led by Surrey, enabled the company to provide scientific data on the benefits of their products. The new EnergyGuard™ product was launched in 2015 and sales of this product saw a more than sixfold increase by 2020 **\[S4\]**. Sales of this product continue to grow, with a 41% market share increase in 2020 despite the pandemic and the company has now sold nearly 2 million square metres of the new EnergyGuard™ cover **\[S4\]**. This is equivalent to approximately 62,500 covered swimming pools. Owing to our research, it is possible to quantify the economic and environmental impact of this product using the cover efficiencies as measured from the pool test facility based at Plastipack and the analysis **\[R4\]**. With the success of the new EnergyGuard™, Plastipack have been able to expand their patented GeoBubble™ materials from 42% in 2015 to 59% in 2020, with their Guard high performance covers now representing between 21\-27% of their total production **\[S4\]**. Since the KTP project, Plastipack has increased its total number of staff by 18, representing a 156% increase **\[S4\]**. In November 2018, the research collaboration between Plastipack and Surrey was recognised with the Institute of Physics Business Innovation Award **\[S5\]**, cementing Plastipack’s standing as the leading innovator in the sector. 

###  Economic impact of environmental efficiency 

 Key to the success of the EnergyGuard™ cover is its environmental efficiency, which also provides economic benefit to Plastipak’s customers **\[S6\]**. We showed that the selective transmission cover has a measured heating efficiency of 56%, compared with an opaque cover with an efficiency of 44%. Most of the new cover material is sold to the European market, which is typically used in the spring and autumn months to extend the swimming pool season. For the covers currently in use worldwide, as at 2020, we can show that by reducing the need for electrical pool heating, this corresponds to a CO<sub>2</sub>e saving of over 28,800 tonnes per year **\[S7\]** when replacing a standard opaque cover with the new EnergyGuard™. This is combined with the prevention of algae blooms which require concentrated chlorine \(shock\) treatments to remove. These high levels of chlorine can be harmful to the environment and human health. 

###  Economic Benefit of an embedded culture of innovation 

 Another major impact of this initial research project was that Plastipack were able to embed this knowledge within the company. Using the new research facility and continuing the partnership with Surrey, which included the optical characterisation of new materials and analysis of the energy balance, Plastipack has improved the performance of their other products. This has been achieved in conjunction with our undergraduate professional training year placement programme **\[S8\]** from the University of Surrey \(five student placements as at 2020\). A good example of success is the enhanced performance of their CoolGuard™ cover, now branded Ultra CoolGuard™ **\[S9\]** which maximises reflection of solar irradiation to maintain a pool temperature in hot climates. This new product was launched in 2018, and its development would not have been possible without the original research on the EnergyGuard™ product at Surrey. Plastipack has continually innovated their products through Surrey research, and in doing so, they have been able to stay ahead of international competitors. As quoted by Peter Adlington, Managing Director of Plastipack, “If we hadn’t have gone down this route, we really wouldn’t be here today.” **\[S10\]**.

Calculation of energy saving: For a latitude of 45°\(South of France\) the typical daily solar irradiation is 8.98 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>  per day in months of April and May and 7.86 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>  per day in August and September when it would be used to extend the swimming pool season. Using a cloud cover factor of 0.65 and assuming that the cover is in use for 5 days out of 7 in the total 120 days, the total solar energy is \(8.98 \+ 7.86\) x 0.65 x60 x \(5/7\) = 470 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>. For 2,000,000 m<sup>2</sup>  and a 12% enhanced efficiency **\[R5\]**, the increased energy saving per year is 2.0x10<sup>6</sup> x 470 x 0.12 = 9x10<sup>7</sup> kWh. At cost of UK grid electricity \(0.256 CO<sub>2</sub>e/KWh, UK Government\) this corresponds to 28,800 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Brighton \(UoB\) research has made life\-saving advances in the fight against excreta\-borne disease. It has reduced human health risk from diseases including cholera, Ebola, typhoid and childhood diarrhoea in regions of Africa, Asia and South America. Research has strengthened WHO and UNICEF sanitation guidance that has been deployed by Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\) in Mozambique to protect 446 staff and 4,330 patients at cholera treatment centres. Low\-cost bacteriophage\-based tools have helped the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases to prioritise effective public health interventions in urban slum districts in India \(home to >100,000 people\) and the Kenyan Medical Research Institute to protect 1,170 rural inhabitants. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Infectious diseases caused by pathogens associated with poor water, sanitation and hygiene, such as *Vibrio cholerae* \(cholera\) and *Salmonella typhi* \(typhoid\), are responsible for 95,000 and 178,000 global deaths/year respectively. Understanding how these and other agents of disease such as *Ebolavirus* \(11,315 deaths from 2013 – 16\) are spread in low\-income settings is critical for the prevention of onward transmission and for identifying the most effective control measures. Working with NGOs and humanitarian funders, UoB scientists have developed low\-cost excreta management interventions and bacteriophage\-based tracking tools to detect contamination sources, disrupt pathogen transmission and protect human health from a variety of infectious diseases. 

##  2.1 Safer excreta management 

 When cholera or Ebola outbreaks occur in a low\-income country, the rapid construction and successful operation of cholera treatment centres \(CTC\) and Ebola treatment centres \(ETC\) by NGOs can reduce mortality rates significantly. However, such emergency field centres generate considerable quantities of human excreta that can be the source of further disease transmission amongst patients, health\-workers and local populations. Approaches for safely handling, containing and treating infectious waste are vital to safeguard health and prevent infection. 

 To address this challenge, UoB researchers developed a low\-cost hydrated lime\-based treatment capable of raising the pH of excreta to very high levels \(>14\) to inactivate pathogens, before encapsulating them within a lime slurry where they no longer pose an infection risk. The method was deployed initially by MSF to treat 600,000 litres of cholera\-laden wastewater from three CTCs in Haiti \[reference 3.1\]. It has been optimised further with MSF and USAID funding in studies that compared the effect of excreta consistency \(organic content\), lime and chlorine dosing, mixing and contact time on treatment performance \[3.2, 3.3\]. UoB researchers conducted these optimisation studies in full\-scale OXFAM® buckets using commercially available, locally sourced lime and chlorine solutions. The results provided the first validation of how the novel lime\-based methods were performing in a real\-world context and bridged the historical disconnect between lab\-based observations and treatment performance reported from the field during humanitarian crises. The optimisation studies were significant as they maximised the removal of pathogens, ensuring that MSF and other NGOs could use the lime\-based approach to protect human health in a cost\-effective manner \[3.3\]. 

 Unlike chlorine\-based excreta treatment \(formerly prescribed in 2004 MSF Guidelines \[source 5.1a\]\), lime does not readily produce explosive gases or toxic by\-products, is less prone to spills and is better suited to treating waste with a high organic content \(eg faeces, vomitus\) \[3.1\-3.3\]. As such, the method devised at UoB offers a safer and more effective means of excreta management, especially in situations where underlying geology or proximity to the water table prevents burial of waste. The low\-cost *in situ* treatment plants also eliminate the hazardous practice of transporting contagious materials by truck to uncontrolled disposal sites. 

##  2.2 Improved low\-cost contaminant tracking 

 In 2012, Dr James Ebdon and Professor Huw Taylor published key evidence that *bacteriophages* \(viruses\) capable of infecting certain strains of bacteria \(eg *Bacteroides* GB124\) are restricted to the human gut in populations across the globe \[3.4, 3.5\] and hence indicate pathways of human faecal contamination in the environment. Detection and cultivation of these human\-specific phages is low\-cost, and unlike other Microbial Source Tracking \(MST\) approaches, does not rely upon complex expertise or equipment to detect the DNA or RNA of the organisms. The method is suitable for deployment in parts of the world where poor water quality and infectious disease have the greatest impact on health and where monitoring is most urgently needed. 

 Ebdon has enhanced this MST approach and its ability to detect phages, allowing scientists at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases \(NICED\), India, to identify human faecal contamination of unwashed raw produce, street food, latrine surfaces and floodwaters. To apply the research and analyse outcomes, monitoring was carried out at 12 households in 2 urban slum districts \(including typhoid positive dwellings\). This allowed risk of exposure to be established and appropriate interventions to be identified \[3.7\]. Dr Diogo Gomes Da Silva and Ebdon have also used phages present in the faeces of cattle, goats, and poultry to improve monitoring of household drinking water in rural Kenya \[3.6\]. Stored household water was shown to be susceptible to cross\-contamination by animal faeces \(known to contain diarrhoeal pathogens eg *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *Cryptosporidium*, *Giardia*\) during an MRC\-funded initiative \(2017 – 19\) involving 1,170 inhabitants of Siaya County. Findings were relayed to 234 participating households and stakeholders by partners the Kenyan Medical Research Institute \(KEMRI\) to identify the most appropriate interventions to take forward \(eg fencing\-off drinking troughs, household water treatment\) to prevent life\-threatening diarrhoeal diseases.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The research breakthroughs at UoB have helped protect some of the most vulnerable human populations globally, by supporting a ‘multiple barrier approach’ to disease control, particularly in low\-resource and emergency settings. By collaborating with NGOs, policymakers and communities, UoB research has protected human health through evidence\-led interventions into global\-health policy \(WHO/UNICEF\) and on\-site treatment practice to reduce risk to families, communities and those working to support the most vulnerable to virus and infection. 

##  4.1 Protocols for the safe handling and disposal of human excreta 

 UoB scientists were mobilised initially to help MSF with the humanitarian response in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak, via the development and application of low\-cost lime\-based methods to protect communities located downstream of three CTCs from infection. Following subsequent USAID funding, the intervention extended to encompass the containment of *Ebolavirus* in response to the 2013 – 2016 outbreak. This work revealed critical knowledge gaps relating to the water, sanitation and hygiene \(WASH\) activities of international NGOs. In particular, the absence of information on the survival of the *Ebolavirus* within human excreta prompted the WHO/UNICEF to invite an international panel of experts \(including Taylor for his microbial ecology expertise\) to review critically existing WASH practices. 

 In October 2014, with direct input from Taylor, the WHO/UNICEF panel revised their guidance due to concerns about the potential dangers of using excreta chlorination protocols prescribed in 2004 MSF Guidelines \[5.1a\]. The revised guidance now recommends the lime\-based procedures developed at the UoB to counter these concerns. WHO/UNICEF WASH guidelines on Ebola virus disease also now include protocols for managing excreta from ETC patients to accelerate ‘ *the inactivation of the Ebola Virus using lime*’ \[5.2\]; these guidelines are recommended by WHO/UNICEF as best operating practice for all international NGOs working in Ebola\-affected areas of West Africa \(including UNICEF, OXFAM, Save the Children and MSF\). Subsequent collaboration with Tufts University \(2015 – 16\), during which the UoB team compared the efficacy of emerging lime and existing chlorine approaches, resulted in further improvements in treatment efficacy \(by refining the dosage, including a mixing step for lime and identifying the optimum duration of contact\). UoB research is also referenced in the WHO’s 2018 *Guidelines on sanitation and health* to demonstrate the suitability of phage and lime\-based approaches for detecting and preventing faecal contamination in emergency settings \[5.3\]. 

 In 2017, UoB’s optimised lime\-based protocols were adopted as part of revised Standard Operating Procedures \(SOP\) for MSF’s CTC facilities \[5.1\]. In 2018, MSF treated 63,722 people for cholera in 16 outbreaks affecting 6 countries \(Cameroon, DR Congo, Haiti, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan\) using UoB protocols for excreta management. This figure rose further in 2019 as MSF responded to outbreaks in Yemen and Mozambique in the wake of cyclones Idai and Kenneth; in Beira \(Mozambique\), MSF had 446 staff assisting with WASH activities at three purpose\-built CTCs treating 4,330 patients \[5.4\]. UoB researchers continue to work closely with ‘on\-the\-ground’ MSF staff on refinements to the SOP and through the provision of real\-time advice on the safe handling of cholera\-laden waste. In March 2020, MSF released a revised SOP \(Comprehensive Method\) for use at all its on\-site treatment Centres \[5.1b\]. 

##  4.2 Improved approaches for the surveillance of potential disease transmission routes 

 In 2017, UoB scientists were sub\-contracted by Emory University to provide MST expertise to a Gates Foundation\-funded collaboration with NICED, India. The initiative aimed to protect slum\-dwellers from typhoid fever \(an important cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality\) in Kolkata’s slums, home to over 1.5 million people. The UoB contribution to the SaniPath typhoid project has, for the first time, made it possible for NICED staff to separate the human faecal pollution pathways \(along which *S. typhi* and/or *Paratyphi A* travels\) from the pervasive ‘background noise’ of non\-human faecal contamination in such settings \[5.5\]. 

 The new capability within the SaniPath Exposure Assessment Tool \(not available before 2017\) allows users, including staff at NICED, to gain valuable understanding of the relative importance of human faecal contamination pathways and to identify high risk practices and situations \[5.5, 5.6\]. Our ability to pin\-point human faecal transmission within domestic and environmental settings is providing local communities in three districts of Kolkata \(home to >100,000 people\) with the knowledge necessary to avoid hazardous activities such as eating unwashed raw produce or the use of unhygienic food preparation areas. UoB findings have demonstrated to NICED and the SaniPath international scientific advisory committee why previous WASH interventions targeting alternative transmission routes \(eg drinking water supplies\) were not accompanied by declines in typhoid incidence \[5.5, 5.6\]. 

 Phage\-based monitoring has been utilised by KEMRI to improve the protection of 1,170 inhabitants \(234 households\) in rural Kenya, where 29% of households rely on unprotected surface waters for drinking water supply and where childhood diarrhoea from livestock affects 20% of children under five. UoB methods in Kenya work by quantifying faecal contamination arising from animal sources and the risk of encountering ‘zoonotic’ pathogens. Regional water quality testing capacity has been strengthened by the training of 16 laboratory researchers, academics, and technicians from institutions across the region in rapid, low\-cost, phage\-based approaches in 2019. The MRC\-funded project has facilitated more effective management of rural water supplies in Kenya by indicating which interventions stakeholders and householders need to invest in and builds on other laboratory training events staged by UoB researchers in Brazil \(44 participants, 2015\) and India \(22 participants, 2017\) \[5.7\]. 

 In April 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency \(EPA\) conducted a high\-level review \[5.8\] into alternative water quality indicators, as evidence emerged that bacterial indicators \(used for the last 100 years\) do not adequately indicate risk from viral pathogens, a leading cause of recreational waterborne illness \[5.9\]. This review and the subsequent EPA Experts Workshop \[5.9\] held in March 2016 used evidence from 9 UoB publications on phage\-based recreational water quality indicators, eg their removal by wastewater treatment, relationship with viral pathogens \( *norovirus*, *Adenovirus*\) and their densities in faecally\-impacted waters from the US, EU and UK. As such, UoB research has made it possible for the EPA to develop criteria for water quality that reflect accurately the ‘latest scientific knowledge’ \(as required in the US Clean Water Act\) and effectively protect the health of 331 million US citizens. 

 Most recently, in response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, WHO/UNICEF have produced interim guidance entitled *Water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management for the COVID\-19 virus* to aid global efforts to control the disease. UoB’s phage and lime\-based research are used in this guidance, which highlights that ‘ *chlorine is ineffective for disinfecting media containing large amounts of solid and dissolved organic matter*’ and that ‘ *where there is no off\-site treatment, in\-situ treatment can be done using lime*’\). This early policy development to contain, control and remove a virulent new virus from human waste serves to demonstrate the flexibility of solutions developed at UoB to protect human health in low\-resource settings \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into ecosystems and environments that support social innovation at GCU has led directly to the establishment of 21 Social Innovation Support Units in Latin America, Southeast Asia and five European regions, driving the development of new ideas to meet social needs that are unmet by economic markets. Devising a suite of tools and services and fully equipped co\-working maker spaces, attracting funding totalling EUR3m, these units/networks have directly enabled the creation, incubation and development of over 200 new social innovations and enterprises, from collaborative housing initiatives in Rio de Janeiro, to a mine clearance social enterprise in Phnom Penh. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In the past decade, social innovation has increasingly been considered an essential tool for identifying and responding to social challenges where the market and the public sector have failed. GCU researchers have developed an interdisciplinary programme of research around ‘Supportive ecosystems and environments for social innovation’ which has directly informed the design of Social Innovation Support Units. 

 In 2013\-14 we conducted systematic reviews of academic literature to conceptualise and theorise social innovation. Synthesis of this literature led us to theorise social innovation as involving new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration \(also including research users\) \(R1\); such collaboration leads to ‘better’ ideas \(or innovations\) for addressing social problems. In turn, these social innovations can lead to wider social change when implemented in participatory ways. \(R1, R2\) 

 Subsequently we sought to understand how social innovation can be supported. The EFESIIS Project \(Enabling the Flourishing and Evolution of Social Entrepreneurship for Innovative and Inclusive Societies \- GBP2m\) involved partners from 11 countries across Europe. Findings from an extensive survey of 258 stakeholders led to the development of a typology of ecosystems that can support the growth and flourishing of social innovation \(R3\). This was supplemented by an explanation of how social innovations \(e.g. social impact bonds\) interact with these ecosystems. \(R4\) 

 Research on social innovation ‘Hubs’ \(funded by EMES and Impact Hub in 2014\) sought to understand how they could be made more inclusive and attract more diverse participants. Findings showed that existing support structures favoured relatively privileged entrepreneurs rather than encompassing those in the greatest need. Recommendations were that Hubs should seek to offer financial support packages to less privileged participants; and ‘reach out’ into local communities through developing capacity, motivation and experience. \(R5\) 

 An in\-depth auto\-ethnographic case study on social innovation education \(in 2014\) focused on five management students developing links with practitioners \(from Nepal\), and supported by academics from different disciplinary backgrounds, as part of the Hult Challenge Competition \( [https://www.hultprize.org](https://www.hultprize.org/)\). Findings were that practice\-based co\-curricular activities are not an easy option for faculty: that students need extensive support, and that learning outcomes are enhanced through students working closely with those with a deep, contextualised familiarity of context in order to co\-produce solutions. \(R6\) 

 Findings from the research \(R1\-R6\) were combined to conceptualise a new approach to Knowledge Exchange which centred upon the development of a specialised Social Innovation Support Unit. The model aimed to: 

1.  Increase the generation of new social innovations, social enterprises and projects through the development of supportive ecosystems. \(R4, R1\) 

1.  Generate new collaborations between university academics, students, communities and social programmes at both a local and international level, in particular in low\- and middle\-income countries, benefitting more disadvantaged or marginalised \(potential\) entrepreneurs in resource poor environments. \(R6, R5\) 

1.  Provide all students with opportunities for entrepreneurial co\-curricular activities to enhance the curriculum. \(R6\) 

1.  Lead to new funding opportunities, including microcredit resources. \(R5\) 

1.  Facilitate university engagement with communities \(R6, R5, R1\), providing students and academics with the capacity, motivation and experience to do so. 

1.  Develop tools to demonstrate and measure impact as well as the potential to develop new innovative models for social change. \(R4\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Type of Impact: Contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity through the design and delivery of new products or services</ins> 

 GCU organised a series of international brokerage events to present its research and concept, culminating in  [‘Social Frontiers \- The next edge of social innovation research’](https://www.nesta.org.uk/event/social-frontiers/), hosted by GCU in collaboration with NESTA and the Young Foundation with 17 countries represented. This led to opportunities to apply its approach to social innovation support in low/middle income regions across the world. \(R1\) 

 <ins>Latin America</ins> 

 GCU\-led a consortium of 15 partners including eight universities from Colombia, Panama, Chile and Brazil, to form the Latin American Social Innovation Network \(LASIN \-  [https://lasinsisu.net/](https://lasinsisu.net/)\) attracting national and international funding, including European Commission’s CBHE Programme \(EUR992,578\). Applying GCU’s locally contextualised approach \(R2, R4\), the consortium established eight pilot ‘Social Innovation Support Units’ \(SISUs\). Each unit consisted of a maker space equipped with digital tools, 3D printing and VR resources \(with the value of approximately EUR30,000\) in order to prototype social innovation projects, at the disposal of students, academics and external stakeholders \(R1, R3\). They also organised regional social innovation awards programmes and six complementary workshops to mixed cohorts of a total of 180 students, academics, community groups and social innovators. \(R5, R6\) 

 As a result of their activities, between 2015 and 2018, the SISUs in Latin America have developed and incubated 127 social innovations/enterprises \(C1\), involving 275 students and community practitioners \(C2\). Innovations included: 

-  Brazil: Theatre In Communities; Universidade Das Quebradas 

-  Chile: Balloon Latam; Take A Hand 

-  Colombia: Music Schools‘ Network of Medellin; Park Of Life; Asakaa, The Greeting of Areandina 

-  Panama: School Farm Casiciaco Maria Haren; Youths United For Dialogue; Art With Cause 

 The SISUs continue to thrive as borne out by testimonials from the university partners: for example, from UFRJ, Brazil: ‘The social innovation work developed by GCU has had a continuous impact on the UFRJ and the way we are providing support to social innovators and developing social innovations in the city of Rio de Janeiro.’ \(C3\) 

 Two large\-scale conferences promoting the SISU model in Panama and Colombia with over 400 attendees from across Latin America increased LASIN membership to 67 institutions across the region. \(C4\) 

 A letter from the European Commission to EU Ambassadors in Panama, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, highlighted the ‘remarkable results achieved’ and underlined that ‘Thanks to the contribution made by the project, Social innovation issues are now at the top of the Partner Countries' public agenda and public policies and there is an increased number of local private and public funds aimed at promoting social innovation and financing social innovation ventures.’ \(C5\) 

 <ins>Southeast Asia</ins> 

 A follow\-up project, also led by GCU, was launched in Southeast Asia in 2016 with partners in Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand. With funding of EUR999,445, the Southeast Asian Social Innovation Network \( [http://www.seasin\-eu.org/](http://www.seasin-eu.org/)\) established SISUs which are currently incubating and supporting 74 new social innovation projects and enterprises \(C6\). The impact of the project in the region has been endorsed by the British Council which states ‘The SEASIN project led by GCU has strengthened the fledgling social innovation eco\-system within universities in Southeast Asia. It has done this by offering new approaches and models to developing organisations and initiatives \(including social enterprises\) that are addressing social needs that are currently unmet by either the public or private sector.’ \(C7\) 

 Social innovations and enterprises supported by the SISUs include: 

-  Cambodia: Color Silk Enterprise Cambodia; Tree Alliance 

-  Malaysia: The Good Tavern Social Market; Agricultural Transformation Project involving Indigenous People in Lojing Highland, Gua Musang, Kelantan; Human Library Malaysia 

-  Myanmar: Career Enhancement Program for Social Enterprises /Entrepreneurs by Myanmar Business Executives Association; Recycle Myanmar 

-  Thailand: Local Alike, a Travel Social Enterprise; GLab; The Guidelight 

 The SISUs continue to be operational as supported by testimonials: for example, the Dean of the International College at the National University of Management, Phnom Penh states “In terms of sustainability, our university's Social Innovation Lab is now fully sustainable… and we continue to run design thinking workshops and design challenges for both our students and also social sector organizations ....all of this would not have been possible without the support from Glasgow Caledonian University.” \(C8\) 

 <ins>Europe</ins> 

 Further initiatives \- including Social Innovation through Knowledge Exchange \(SIKE \-  [https://sike\-eu.org/](https://sike-eu.org/) \(976,575 Euros funding\)\), which was showcased at the 8th European University Business Forum \( [https://ec.europa.eu/education/events/8th\-university\-business\-forum\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/education/events/8th-university-business-forum_en)\), have focussed on applying the same conceptual approach within Europe. This has led to the establishment of SISUs supporting 75 new projects in Scotland, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Croatia, and has culminated in GCU being endorsed by Scottish Government as the UK’s National Social Innovation Competence Centre. \(C9\)

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Forests are important economically, ecologically and recreationally. They provide timber, sustain wildlife habitat and act as a carbon sink for many ecosystems. Thus, it is crucial to monitor forest health and use this information in forest management decisions. 

 At University of Bath, we have developed methods using Generalised Additive Mixed Models \(GAMMs\) to estimate spatio\-temporal trends of forest health. This methodology has been developed in close collaboration with forestry experts in Germany. It has been adopted for official reporting in the national survey of German forest soil, and in reports on forest health for the states of Baden\-Württemberg \(BW\), Saxony, and North Rhine\-Westphalia, thereby improving the monitoring of forest health in Germany. These reports have major impact on regional and national strategic policy decisions on forest maintenance. In particular, the research has had significant influence on spending decisions of the EUR40,000,000 emergency planning budget of BW on forest strategy. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **A spatio\-temporal model for forest health** 

 Paper \[1\] presents a spatio\-temporal model developed by Augustin and Wood at University of Bath with scientists at the Forest Research Institute \(FRI\) in Baden\-Württemberg \(BW\). The method uses Generalised Additive Mixed Models \(GAMMs\) to capture spatial and temporal correlations in the data and to incorporate important predictors of measures of forest health. Previous methods ignored correlations in the data, leading to biases in trend and variance estimates. The methods in \[1\] avoid such problems, producing accurate estimates and confidence statements. The improved estimates of spatio\-temporal trends allow earlier identification of forest deterioration and enhance understanding of its causes. In paper \[1\] the methodology is demonstrated in an analysis of defoliation in spruce trees in BW from 1985 to 2007. Paper \[2\] reports an analysis, using the model developed in \[1\], of defoliation in spruce, beech, pine and oak trees across 13 regions of Germany from 1989 to 2015. 

 **Optimising the monitoring grid resolution** 

 The condition of forest trees in Germany has been monitored since the late 1980s. Standard practice has been to create a 16 × 16km grid, mark a sample of 24 trees at each grid location, then record measurements for these trees annually. However, different grid densities occur: in BW, 4 × 4, 8 × 8 and 16 × 16km grids have been used, while in other states the grid density has changed over time. 

 Paper \[2\] examines the suitability of different monitoring grid resolutions. The paper reports a simulation study comparing different survey grid resolutions. The analysis shows that, while a 16 x 16km grid is sufficient to model nationwide time trends, an 8 × 8km grid is needed in order to estimate spatio\-temporal trends, especially for oaks. Thus, a finer grid resolution is crucial for the early detection of hotspots with a high rate of defoliation. 

 **Modelling tree health and mortality** 

 The book chapter \[3\] uses the methods proposed in \[1\] and \[2\] to model the nutritional status of trees across Germany and to relate defoliation to soil condition and weather variables.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 \(a\) **Improved current reporting of forest health.** 

 Research at University of Bath is the underpinning methodology for analyses of forest data in official national and regional reports: forest health for the state of Baden\-Württemberg \(BW\) from 2014 to 2019 \[A\-F\]; the national survey of forest soil produced for the German Ministry of Food and Agriculture in 2016 \[G\]; the forest soil report for Saxony in 2018 \[H\]; and the report on the forest condition in North Rhine\-Westphalia in 2020 \[I\].These reports are prepared for policy makers to guide strategy and funding decisions at both state and national level. 

 The BW reports use the research from paper \[1\], for example, the 2019 report \[F, p. 20 translated from German\] states: 

 *“The needle/leaf loss is calculated as a function of the age of the tree, the spatial position and the time, whereby correlations in time and space are taken into account \(Augustin et al. 2009\). The model enables an age\-adjusted representation of the space\-time trend …”.* 

 An example of the results of this modelling for BW in 2019 \[F, p 20, Figure 18\] is shown below in figure 1. 



 *Figure. 1: Spatial distribution of the needle/leaf losses of the main tree species in* 

 *Baden\-Württemberg, age\-adjusted for the median age of the respective tree species* 

 *\(Fichte: Spruce, Tanne: Fir, Kiefer: Pine, Buche: Beech, Eiche: Oak, Esche: Ash\)* 

 The national survey of German forest soil \[G, p. I\-387, translated\] states: 

 *“Irregular grids are just one of the various properties of the crown loss data, due to which the space\-time evaluation becomes a statistical challenge. … For the space\-time modelling of these data, Generalized Additive Mixed Models \(GAMMs\) show promise \(Augustin et al. 2009, Wood 2006a\)”.* 

 and the survey presents analyses that use GAMMs to model forest health across the whole of Germany. An example \[G, p. A\-42, Figure A\-11\-13\] of results obtained is shown in figure 2: 



 *Figure 2. Estimated mean crown thinning with confidence interval for the four main tree species from 1989 to 2015 using grid 2 \(16 x 16 km EU grid of 2014\) and a nationwide uniform age of 120 years.* 

 The forest soil report for Saxony \[H, p.18, translated\] refers to paper \[1\]: 

 *“The space\-time modelling was done with generalized Additive Mixed Models \(GAMMs; Augustin et al. 2009 … \)”.* 

 Impact of the methods in \[1\] and \[2\] on forest management policy is confirmed by a Head of Department at LANUV, Nordrhein\-Westfalen \[J\]: 

 *“I was a co\-author of Thünen Report 43* \[G\] *… I have been involved in writing the Forest Condition Report for North\-Rhine Westphalia 2020* \[I\] *. Both these reports present analyses using the methodology of Augustin et al \(2009\)* \[1\] *and Eickenscheidt, Augustin and Wellbrock \(2019\)* \[2\] *. The reports form the basis for determining forest management policy \(like tree species choice or liming activity\): in the case of the first report at national level, and for the second report at state level”.* 

 **\(b\) Guidance on sampling scheme to ensure effective monitoring of forest health** 

 In order to take policy decisions early enough to protect tree species it is crucial to detect hotspots with a high rate of defoliation in a timely manner. The research in paper \[2\] highlighted the need to consider carefully the grid size used in order to make effective local decisions on hotspots. The national survey of German forest soil reflects this finding in stating \[G, p. I\-387, translated\]: 

 *“Generalized Additive Mixed Models can also be used to check the suitability of grid densities and to identify weak points”.* 

 and goes on to recommend the adoption of 8 x 8 km grids to protect the oak in the national guidance \[G, p. I\-454, translated\]: 

 *“A nationwide statement about temporal and spatial trends of crown defoliation, with the help of GAMMs, is necessary to identify risk areas at an early stage. There are weak points for all four main tree species, in particular for the oak. … Most of the federal states affected now report for these weak points on grid sizes of 8 x 8 km … . In the case of the oak, a nationwide consolidation to the 8 x 8 km grid should be considered”.* 

 **\(c\) Forest management strategies to mitigate nutrient deficiency and climate change** 

 The book chapter \[3\] models the relationship between forest health and soil condition and weather variables and reports that soil condition can exacerbate the effects of adverse weather conditions. The 2019 report for BW \[F, pp. 3\-4, translated\] paints a bleak picture following the extreme heat and drought of 2018 and 2019: 

 *“… tree species that we have previously classified as climate\-resilient have suffered from the effects of heat, drought and storms in recent years … Against the background of the dramatic situation in the forests of Baden\-Württemberg a summit took place in Stuttgart on September 2, 2019 \[2 September 2019\]. Representatives from the fields of forestry, agriculture, nature conservation … were invited. The draft of the Baden\-Württemberg emergency plan drawn up by the ministry was discussed with the participants”.* 

 The key role of our research in addressing these problems is explained in the letter \[K\] from the Head of the Soil and Environment Department of the Forest Experimental and Research Institute, BW: 

 *“The space\-time model developed by Augustin and Wood has been used for our yearly reports of forest health in Baden\-Württemberg every year since 2006. The results and analysis presented in these reports form the basis for policy decisions in the state. A key example is in 2019 when an emergency plan with a yearly budget of 40 Million Euros \[EUR40,000,000\] was set up by the Ministry of Rural Space and Consumer Protection of Baden\-Württemberg. This was followed in 2020 by a longer term forest strategy. Actions which directly follow from the recommendations in the reports of 2019 and preceding years, which are based on analyses using the methods of Augustin and Wood, include:* 

-  *Site and tree species suitability maps as a basis for decision\-making are firmly established in operational forest management.* 

-  *Updated maps on site conditions \(climate, soils, hydrology, nutritional status\) for upcoming reforestation and forest conversion are provided.* 

-  *Forest soil mapping will be promoted and implemented in a timely manner where initial mapping is still pending in private and corporate forests.* 

-  *Trials of comparative plantings of potentially sustainable tree species will be expanded.* 

-  *By means of a site\-specific damage analysis, further bases and indications for a future\-oriented forest conversion with climate\-sensitive stands as well as adapted silvicultural procedures will be developed.* 

 *The nature of the policy actions and their alignment with the analysis in the reports are evidence of the impact the work of Augustin and Wood \[1\] has had on policy”.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Innovative research conducted by Professor Bates and Dr Batson at the University of Nottingham \(UoN\) led to the development of a revolutionary new treatment for neovascular eye disease *via* eye drops. The company Exonate was spun out to develop this eye drop treatment in December 2013 and licensed a UoN patent for the use of the novel compounds in neovascular eye disease in April 2014. As of December 2020, Exonate employs 18 people, has raised approximately GBP9,000,000 in investment and has secured a collaboration deal with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, part of Johnson & Johnson \[redacted text\].The first in human clinical trials of the eye drop commenced in November 2020 in Australia. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Neovascular eye disease is the leading cause of sight loss in developed countries, of which Age\-related Macular Degeneration \(AMD\) and Diabetic Macular Oedema \(DMO\) are the most common. AMD is the UK’s leading cause of sight loss affecting over 600,000 people, with 70,000 new cases diagnosed each year. In 2016, the Macular Society projected that the number of people with AMD is expected to double by 2050 to 1,300,000 – equivalent to 400 new cases every day. 

 There are two types of AMD, wet and dry. Wet AMD is the more severe form and occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina. DMO is the leading cause of blindness in the working population and is also caused by increased blood vessel growth into the retina, driven by excess of the angiogenic protein VEGF. 

 Angiogenesis, or blood vessel growth, is normally regulated by VEGF, which naturally exists in both pro\- and anti\-angiogenic variants. The pro\-angiogenic isoforms are known to promote angiogenesis in many conditions, including wet AMD and DMO. Current treatments for wet AMD and DMO are antibody\-based and do not differentiate between pro\- and anti\-angiogenic VEGF isoforms and so inhibit both. Consequently, there could be potential side effects from long\-term treatments that deplete both forms of VEGF. Current antibody\-based treatments are delivered as monthly intraocular injections, which are uncomfortable, carry an infection risk, and require administration by medical staff. Consequently, there is a need to develop a cheaper, safer, and more precise treatment that can be self\-administered. 

 Previous work undertaken by Professor Bates while at the University of Bristol working in collaboration with Professor Steven Harper demonstrated that Serine/Arginine protein Kinase 1 \(SRPK1\) inhibition led to reduced expression of specifically pro\-angiogenic VEGF\-A isoforms, restoring the balance of pro and anti\-angiogenic isoforms to normal physiological levels. This downstream splicing of VEGF as the target for inhibitors was patented by the University of Bristol and an initial class of inhibitors was patented by Professor Bates at the University of Bristol with Professor Jonathan Morris from University of New South Wales \(UNSW\) and further licensed to the University of Nottingham \(UoN\). Professors Bates and Harper and Professor Lucy Donaldson at UoN had shown that SRPK1 inhibitors were capable of modifying VEGF signalling in ocular diseases, but also in pain, cancer, and kidney diseases. 

 In April 2013, Professor Bates joined the UoN and set up an in\-house screening assay for selective SPRK1 inhibitors. Professor Bates \(UoN\) and co\-inventor Professor Morris \(UNSW\) designed novel compounds \(piperazine derivatives\), which were subsequently synthesised in Professor Morris’ laboratory. An initial screening of 23 of these compounds conducted between April and December 2013 at UoN produced initial data on four compounds that demonstrated for the first time that there were potent compounds that inhibited SRPK1 selectively **\[1\]**. The promising results from this initial screening led to Professor Bates gaining a GBP50,000 Hermes Enterprise Fellowship **\[4\]** for Dr Batson to join the team in November 2013. The positive results provided the motivation for Professors Bates \(UoN\), Donaldson \(UoN\) and Harper \(University of Bristol\) to spin out Exonate Ltd in 2013. 

 From November 2013 to April 2014, Dr Batson continued to work at UoN to screen the piperazine derivatives and identified Sphinx31, which showed high selectivity and efficacy for inhibiting SRPK1 and thereby selectively inhibiting pro\-angiogenic VEGF **\[1\]**. Further analysis using a novel porcine eye\-permeability assay developed by Professor Bates and Dr Batson demonstrated that these compounds had scleral permeability, which revealed clinical potential for these compounds to be delivered in the form of eye drops **\[2\]**. This data was submitted in Patent Application WO 2015/159103 A1 in April 2014, published in October 2015 and granted in 2018 **\[3\]**. This composition of matter patent covered the novel chemistry of the compound, its mode of delivery and its function to alter splicing of VEGF, acknowledging the novelty of targeting SRPK1.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 DMO and wet AMD are progressive eye diseases that create difficulties in carrying out everyday tasks like reading, recognising faces and driving, and thus represent a substantial impairment to people’s independence and quality of life. The potential to revolutionise treatment for a healthcare issue that affects hundreds of millions of people globally has made Exonate a highly investable opportunity. Exonate received investment of over **GBP9,000,000** between 2014 and 2019. It also secured a collaboration deal with the international pharmaceutical company Janssen Pharmaceuticals to develop an eye drop for the treatment of wet AMD and DMO \[redacted text\]. This successful international investment into a UK company has created employment for **18 employees** at Exonate **\[S1\]**. 

 <ins>Incorporation of Exonate</ins> <ins>linked to compound</ins> <ins>early</ins> <ins>development</ins> 

 Early screening data generated by Professor Bates and Dr Batson \(April\-December 2013\) demonstrated efficacy at low concentrations of SRPK1 inhibitors **\[1\]**. This efficacy was a strong indicator of high potential for clinical use and alongside the patent and existing know\-how from the University of Bristol consequently provided the impetus to spin out Exonate **\[S1\]**. Exonate Ltd was spun out of the UoN in 2013 by Professors Bates and Donaldson \(UoN\) and Professor Steven Harper \(University of Bristol\) based on their intellectual property, along with that of Professor Jonathan Morris \(University of New South Wales\) who designed, synthesised and provided the compounds **\[S1\]**. 

 In April 2014 a licence and pipeline agreement between the UoN and Exonate meant UoN knowhow was shared with Exonate and continued to contribute to the development of the company. Sphinx31 was the primary candidate compound used in the drug discovery process and led to the nomination of the final optimised clinical candidate – EXN407. Dr Batson left the UoN in 2015 to join Exonate as the company’s principal scientist. Professor Bates remained at UoN and also serves as Exonate’s Chief Scientific Officer. 

 In 2018, the piperazines, including Sphinx31, led Exonate researchers to identify that a heterocyclic substituent was important for potency and permeability, and optimisation led to compounds like the drug nominated as the preferred compound. Patent WO2015/159103 A1 was formally licenced to Exonate in 2018 **\[3\]**. Further specific patents, owned by the company, have been developed to protect three elements: the compound’s efficacy against the target; permeability properties that allow the compound to get to the retina through the eyeball; and the way it is engineered to disintegrate in the bloodstream in order to avoid systemic off\-target effects **\[S2,**  [WO2019063996A1](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search?q=pn%3DWO2019063996A1), GB202010829D0 **\]**.

1.  <ins>First funding round</ins> <ins>closed in April 2014 and raised GBP400,000</ins> **\[S3\]**: early data generated by Professor Bates and Dr Batson at UoN, alongside data on pain generated by Professor Lucy Donaldson at UoN, was presented to potential investors during the first funding round. Investors included IPGroup, Fusion IP \(now part of IPGroup\), University of Nottingham, Nottingham Angels and private investors. The first funding round was used to set the company up, to invest in an initial prototype project to test feasibility of the approach for developing permeable SRPK1 inhibitors and to fund the patents on the first compounds **\[S2,** WO2017064512A1 **\]**. 

1.  <ins>Second funding round</ins> <ins>closed in October 2015 and raised just under GBP800,000</ins> **\[S4\]**: investors included the Angel CoFund. This funding round allowed Exonate to enable *in vivo* testing and expand the chemistry studies to identify new clinically promising candidates with better potency, permeability, solubility and distribution in the retina and less toxicity. 

1.  <ins>Third funding round</ins> <ins>closed in November 2016 and raised just under GBP1,500,000</ins> **\[S5\]**: investors included the Angel CoFund and new investment from the Australian venture fund Uniseed, the University of Bristol Enterprise Fund \(managed by Parkwalk\), Martlet of Cambridge, Wren Capital, as well as further Angel Investors and O2h Ventures. This investment allowed Exonate to develop business partnerships that could lead to licensing deals, to employ a clinical advisory team to aid the planning and design of a clinical trial, and to undertake *in vivo* proof\-of\-concept studies in relevant species to further guide research towards a lead candidate. 

1.  <ins>The</ins> <ins>Wellcome Trust Seeding Drug Discovery Award</ins> <ins>in February 2017 secured</ins> <ins>GBP4,900,000</ins> <ins> **\[S6</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>:</ins> the award funded the continued development of an eye drop treatment, allowing Exonate to move from a lead candidate to an optimised compound that became the clinical candidate compound, and to undertake safety pharmacology and chemical manufacturing and testing. Uniseed Chief Executive Officer said: *“the Wellcome Trust award further validates the decision to invest into Exonate as it has provided a unique opportunity for Uniseed to get in at the “ground floor” of a drug development program that has been de\-risked by being supported by the world’s largest pre\-eminent medical research charity funding research into human health”* **\[S7\]**. In July 2017, Exonate secured the *‘One to Watch’* award at the UK Business Angels Association Investment Awards, with the judges stating that *‘Exonate is showing promise in developing revolutionary approaches to treatments for eye conditions, and has been backed by investors with deep industry knowledge’* **\[S8\]**. 

1.  <ins>Fourth funding round</ins> <ins>closed in January 2019 and raised GBP1,500,000: investors included</ins> the Angel CoFund, the Australian venture fund Uniseed, the University of Bristol Enterprise Fund \(managed by Parkwalk\), Martlet of Cambridge, Wren Capital, O2h Ventures, as well as further Angel investors. Funds were used to undertake business development and complete crucial critical path experiments \(e.g. reactive metabolite and other safety tests\) to secure a commercial deal with the global pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson **\[S9\]**. 

 <ins>Exonate secured a</ins> <ins>treatment</ins> <ins>development deal</ins> <ins>with Janssen P</ins><ins>harmaceuticals</ins> <ins>\[redacted text\]:</ins> 

 In December 2019, Exonate Ltd secured a major collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a pharmaceutical company based in New Jersey \(USA\) and part of the Johnson & Johnson family of companies **\[S10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Problem gambling is a major issue worldwide with prevalence rates between 0.5%\-2% in most countries. NTU research into the many factors that contribute to problematic gambling behaviour has driven major developments in responsible gaming \(RG\) tools which reduce the risk of problem gambling. Professor Griffiths’ research has underpinned the design and continued optimisation of RG tools used by international gambling operators and regulators with a global reach of tens of millions of individuals, including: 

1.  *GAM\-GaRD,* adopted into the company social responsibility protocols of over 50 gambling operators and regulators in over 20 countries, and is stipulated countrywide in some cases; 

1.  *Mentor,* used by leading European gambling operators and independently evaluated as helping clients gamble more responsibly. 

 Griffiths research has also underpinned the national and international development of RG Codes of Conduct, including those implemented by the *Association of British Bookmakers* \(overseeing 85% of UK sports betting shops\) and the *China Sports Lottery* \(overseeing all 31 provinces in China\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2000, Griffiths has published over 30 research papers identifying the structural characteristics of games that encourage gambling. These include event frequency, stake size, size of the jackpot, speed of the game, and illusion of control elements \[ **R1**\]. Understanding elements associated with problematic play can help in harm minimisation and the design of safer games. This research formed the basis of the responsible gambling \[RG\] tool GAM\-GaRD \[Gambling Assessment Measure: Guidance about Responsible Design\] as follows: 

-  Griffiths’ research into the structural and situational characteristics \(i.e., features that are external to the gambler such as marketing, advertising, and the number of gambling venues in the environment\) of gambling pinpointed the most important factors associated with problem gambling and co\-developed GAM\-GaRD with Dr. Richard Wood \(CEO, GamRes, Canada\) to help game developers design more responsible lower\-risk games for vulnerable and susceptible individuals \(Funder: Camelot Plc £40,000\). This research began in 2006 and led to the commercial development of GAM\-GaRD\). 

-  In 2010, Griffiths and Wood developed the Responsible Gambling Impact Index \(commissioned by Nova Scotia Gaming Corporation CAD$250,000\), a tool which was designed for gambling operators to make well\-informed decisions about developing and implementing RG tools and features. The tool was based on situational characteristics \[ **R2**\] rather than the structural factors identified in GAM\-GaRD. The index was then incorporated into GAM\-GaRD and since the last REF cycle has been sold and licensed as GAM\-GaRD 2.0 in 2014. 

-  Subsequently, Griffiths’ research \(particularly on limit\-setting as a responsible gambling tool \[ **R3**\]\) was used in the development of GAM\-GaRD 3.0 in 2016 in which game risk scores on GAM\-GaRD could be mitigated by use of limit\-setting tools by gambling operators. In the last six years, the number of gambling operators using GAM\-GaRD has almost doubled. Furthermore, its national use across every province in China and Canada has led to significant increase in terms of reach since 2014. 

 With Dr Michael Auer \(former NTU PhD student\), Griffiths carried out a study in 2013 with 100,000 real online gamblers and developed a new measure of gambling intensity called ‘theoretical loss’ \[ **R4**\]. This measure was used as the basis for Griffiths’ subsequent research demonstrating the effectiveness of RG tools such as limit\-setting \[ **R4**\], pop\-up messaging \[ **R5**\], and personalised feedback \[ **R6**\] using ‘big data’ provided by the gambling industry. These are just three of the many studies that Griffiths has published showing that limit\-setting and bespoke personalized feedback are particularly effective in significantly reducing the amount of money spent by gambling\-intense individuals. As the Association of British Bookmakers note: 

 “*One of Professor Griffiths’ most valuable contributions was in the area of limit setting. His 2013 paper…is the only study to date carried out with real gamblers \(n=100,000\) in real time on a real gambling site \(win2day\), and demonstrated that limit setting is an effective responsible gambling tool for the most gambling intense players*,” \[ **S5**\]. 

 This research \[ **R4**\- **R6**\] also underpinned the development of another RG tool \(Mentor – developed by Griffiths and Auer between 2012 and 2014\) with Neccton, an Austrian data mining company with expertise in the European banking and gambling sector. Mentor provides personalised feedback to gamblers in real time about their gambling behaviour and is used by leading gambling operators across Europe including the Gauselmann Group \(Germany, Austria, Denmark\), Austrian Lotteries \(Austria\), ComeOn \(Sweden\), Greentube \(UK, Spain\), The Mill Adventure \(Sweden\) and Skillonnet \(UK, Denmark, Spain\). The tool provides gamblers with accurate information about their actual gambling behaviour \(e.g., time and money spent gambling\) across different time periods \(e.g., weekly, monthly, half\-yearly\) and also presents players with normative data from other gamblers in the database so that gamblers can compare their own behaviour with others and facilitate self\-appraisal and help enable behavioural change \[ **R5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Griffiths’ research has provided unique evidence for the development of two Responsible Gaming \(RG\) tools, GAM\-GaRD and Mentor, which have significantly changed day\-to\-day practices in world\-wide gambling operators, and underpinned UK and international codes of conduct which aim to significantly reduce problem gambling. The development and initial implementation of GAM\-GaRD formed part of a REF2014 impact case study, but its optimization in versions 2.0 and 3.0 and international implementation represents new impact with greater international reach and significance. The development and implementation of Mentor, and Griffiths’ influence on international codes of conduct are also new developments. Following his 2013 research, Griffiths was commissioned by the Association of British Bookmakers \(ABB \- £13,300 over three projects\) in 2013 and 2014 \[ **S6**\- **S8**\] to support the development of their Code of Conduct for Responsible Gambling \(which came into operation nationally from March 2015\). NTU research on limit\-setting was referenced in the Code and, consequently, a limit\-setting feature was included on every fixed\-odds betting terminal in every UK betting shop based on Griffiths’ research \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Optimisation and Adoption of GAM\-GaRD RG tool 

 GAM\-GaRD \(GAM\-GaRD 2.0 since 2014 and GAM\-GaRD 3.0 since 2016\) is a commercially available online tool used by gaming companies, and co\-developed by Griffiths. This tool assesses the ten most addictive characteristics of gambling games \(e.g. accessibility, prize\-back percentage, etc.\) and offers gaming operators practical ways to reduce the risks of gambling addiction by altering the game’s structural characteristics before marketing it. The World Lottery Association recommended that all its companies use such a tool as part of their social responsibility accreditation procedures \[ **S1**\]. The testimonial letter notes: “ *Dr. Griffiths’ research findings have been applied by many lottery companies around the world in improving their day\-to\-day practices in the areas of player protection and harm minimization including Camelot \(UK\), Premier Lotteries \(Eire\), Norsk Tipping \(Norway\), Veikkaus \(Finland\), Svenska Spel \(Sweden\), Danske Spil \(Denmark\), West Lotto \(Germany\), Austrian Lottery \(Austria\), Loterie Romande \(Switzerland\), Postcode Lottery \(The Netherlands\), Atlantic Lottery Corporation \(Canada\), Nova Scotia Provincial Lotteries and Casino Corporation \(Canada\), Interprovincial Lottery Corporation \(Canada\), and Singapore Pools \(Singapore\)*”. Additionally, the World Lottery Association recommends that all its member organisations \(combined revenue of $250bn across 80 countries\) use a tool such as GAM\-GaRD. 

 This latest version of GAM\-GaRD is now used by over 50 of the world’s biggest operators and gambling regulators in over 20 countries, including operators in Canada, UK, USA, China, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Poland, Morocco, Hong Kong, South Korea and Uruguay \[ **S2**\]. The tool is also used by gaming regulators \(e.g., Norway, Sweden, UK\).  In certain countries, \(e.g., Norway\) it is not possible to obtain gambling licences without GAM\-GaRD accreditation. In 2015, Canada bought a countrywide site license, and each state\-owned gambling company uses GAM\-GaRD \(i.e., a minimum of one gaming company in every Canadian province\). In 2019, the China Sports Lottery bought a countrywide license across all 31 provinces \(1.4 billion reach\). According to the General Manager of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, who also works for the China Sports Lottery ‘ *We wanted to use Professor Griffiths' long\-standing research expertise and experience to help us run our gambling business in a more social responsible way and for us to change and/or enhance our day\-to\-day policies on player protection and harm minimization*’ \[ **S9**\]. Beneficiaries include the tens of millions of gamblers in over 20 different countries playing games that have undergone rigorous GAM\-GaRD testing during the product development phase. Independent evaluation of GAM\-GaRD also highlighted how beneficial it had been for both gambling operators and regulators \[ **S3**\]. 

###  Development and introduction of Mentor RG tool 

 Griffiths and Auer also co\-developed the world’s first personalized messaging system \[Mentor, **S4**\] that uses gamblers’ online tracking data to provide bespoke information and feedback to gamblers about their wins, losses, deposits and time spent gambling. Since 2014, a number of operators in Europe now use this tool \(e.g. Germany, Austria, Spain, UK, Sweden and Norway\) \[ **S4**\]. The beneficiaries are the estimated five million gamblers who use Mentor as a way of reducing their risk of developing gambling problems \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Impact on UK and international regulators of commercial gambling 

 Griffiths’ research with Auer underpins the recent Association of British Bookmakers’ \(ABB\) Code of Conduct for Responsible Gambling \[ **S5**\- **S8**\]. A key consequence of this work is that since 2015, every fixed\-odds betting machine in every UK betting shop now allows players to set their own limits on how much time and/or money they want to spend gambling \[ **S5**\]. The research was instrumental in the ABB’s introduction of limit\-setting features on every FOBT. Beneficiaries of both the Code of Conduct and the specific responsible gambling tools are the 2.6 million gamblers who frequent British betting shops, and the hundreds of thousands of gamblers who specifically play FOBTs.  The Chief Executive of the Association of British Bookmakers states: 

 “*Professor Griffiths’ research is of great utility to the ABB and is used to help update our national policies regarding responsible gambling, social responsibility, player protection, and harm minimization*,” \[ **S5**\]. 

 Griffiths also won an international competitive tender by the Norwegian Government’s monopoly gaming operator to evaluate Norsk Tipping’s responsible gambling portfolio. To date, this research has assessed the efficacy of the company’s new \(i\) global loss limit \(introduced in November 2016\), \(ii\) the loss\-limit reminder informing players when they have reached 80% of their loss limits, and \(iii\) mandatory play breaks. As the operator notes: 

 “*Norsk Tipping have used these findings…to help the all gamblers \(currently more than two million players\) who play our games. Dr. Griffiths’ research has fed directly into all our constantly evolving player protection practices*,” \[ **S10**\]. 

 Griffiths was commissioned by the Hong Kong Jockey Club to help develop the China Sports Lottery’s codes of conduct in relation to player protection and harm minimization across all 31 provinces in China. Alongside this consultation, Griffiths ran a series of workshops in Beijing \(December 2018\) which led to the implementation of new policies and procedures across all 31 provinces in China \[ **S9**\]. 

 Ultimately, Griffiths’ research has played a critical role in the development of RG tools and RG Codes of Conduct across four continents. Testimonials demonstrate that these codes have informed the day\-to\-day practices of international gambling operators and that recommendations from Griffiths’ research has enhanced socially responsible practices with the aim of reducing problem gambling among tens of millions of gamblers.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This award\-winning research informed the Civil Authorisation Authority \(CAA\) in mandating changes to North Sea helicopter operations concerning body size and emergency escape. Following RGU’s 3D scanning survey of offshore workers, the industry body ‘Step Change in Safety’ commissioned a strategy for measuring the entire 75,000\-strong workforce. This means that each person’s body size is now directly input into the vantage personal identity system, matching seat allocation to size\-designated seats across nine aircraft types. This study thus enabled the implementation of a critical legislative change designed to reduce the risks of fatalities in helicopter operations in the North Sea. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Global obesity has trebled since 1984’s survey on body size and shape of offshore workers, making the data obsolete and creating problems for the design of critical infrastructure, safety systems, and workers’ health. 

 RGU’s size and shape survey with Oil & Gas UK showed how offshore workers had increased in size and differed from a general population. Scanned body shapes revealed risk factors for workers’ health and safety\-critical areas adversely affecting larger individuals’ capacity for evacuation. Implementing a 'size standard' informed by the study became enshrined in law in 2015. 

 Funding of £137,831 from the Technology Strategy Board for the KTP with OGUK was augmented by £7,533 and in\-kind from 20 industry sponsors at industry safety briefings, where the risks of the unknown body size of offshore workers were presented. The project won the Ewan MacDonald Prize for Excellence in Occupational Health Audit or Processes, 2013; and the coveted William Floyd Award for Best project for innovation in ergonomics in the UK, 2018. 

 RGU’s Benchmarking of novel portable 3D scanners preceded the main study at stakeholder premises, heliports, and one offshore platform. 

 Quota\-sampling across seven weight categories ensured a representative sample within a daily weight fluctuation \(1.1kg\). 588 individuals each provided seven 3D body scans, yielding 26 multi\-dimensional measurements. The dataset compiled in percentile format was licenced to the industry as a design standard and for OGUK income generation. 

 The dramatic size increase and obesity prevalence of offshore workers exceeded that of the general population<sup>1</sup>. Observed girth increase at the neck, chest, and waist depicted a shape centralisation indicative of health\-harming visceral fat, and disease risk<sup>2</sup>. The study revealed how such an enlarged and centralised body shape make it extremely challenging for workers to pass one another in a narrow corridor in an offshore installation evacuation scenario<sup>3</sup>, and identified which body measurement best predicted successful escape from a helicopter emergency exit<sup>4</sup>. It also revealed that larger individuals could become critically buoyant when submersed in water due to trapped air in their survival suits<sup>5</sup>. The range of body types revealed a physique clustering, where self\-selected suit size did not always correspond with individual body shape<sup>6</sup>. 

 Preliminary data from 210 individuals were presented to the Helicopter Safety Passenger Size Working Group following the CAA mandate in the wake of a fatal accident in 2013, which identified body size as a critical factor in helicopter escape. Stewart identified anatomical measures that best predict escape capability and threshold values to estimate the prevalence of extra\-broad individuals unlikely to egress through a minimum escape exit. This established protocols for replicating critical measurements across the workforce, including shoulder breadth and chest depth dimensions. 

 A measuring programme for the 75,000\-strong workforce was implemented with Step Change in Safety. This licensed 88 trainers to teach approximately 300 measurers to assess shoulder breadth in a standardised way, thereby quality\-assuring these measurements. 

 This identified workers as ‘standard’ or ‘extra\-broad’, carrying industry\-enforced restrictions on aircraft seating, thereby preventing large persons from blocking smaller individuals’ egress path.

 **Reach and Significance** 

 RGU provided the offshore industry with an up\-to\-date and accurate size survey of its workforce and an enduring capability for conducting future surveys as required<sup>1</sup>. Such data have informed installation designers, survival suit designers, helicopter manufacturers, and the UK’s Health & Safety Executive’s review of lifeboat capacity<sup>7</sup>. Following the CAA mandate, the measuring programme implemented in conjunction with Step Change in Safety culminated in a series of train\-the\-trainer events, which licenced 88 trainers from the UK, The Netherlands, Poland and Norway to train approximately 300 measurers. Between them within three months, they measured the shoulder breadths of 100% of the 75000\-strong UK offshore workforce, each of whom must travel to offshore installations by helicopter, fully achieving the requirement and target set out by the CAA. 

 **Policy Impact \(UK & Europe\)** 

 With effect from 01 April 2015, the CAA prohibited helicopter operators from carrying passengers on offshore flights, except in response to an offshore emergency, whose body size, including required safety and survival equipment, is incompatible with push\-out window emergency exit size. Originally mandated for UK operations only via the issue of a CAA Safety Directive, all these measures have now been underpinned through incorporation in the European Air Operating Rules published by the European Aviation Safety Agency <sup>6</sup>. 

 **Economic Impact** 

 Step Change in Safety estimated the theoretical full cost of measuring the workforce at £15 million, but in reality the cost to the industry was reduced to approximately £1 million because of the advantage created by offshore medics not charging for measuring<sup>3</sup>. 

 According to Les Linklater, Executive Director of Step Change in Safety *“working with RGU was vital to ensure the success of Step Change in Safety’s passenger size project, and the safety of the offshore workforce”. By defining a simple, sustainable measurement criteria and together developing the Train the Trainer methodology, the industry was able to meet the deadline and avoid costs of £14 million.”* 

 **Health and Safety Impact** 

 RGU’s size and shape study raised awareness of the need to quantify the size increase of offshore workers to identify this as a risk, potentially saving lives in emergency escape scenarios. This has brought a range of health and safety measure changes to the industry, including informing the design of survival suits, which has been impacted due to the demonstrable changes in body size that may not be accommodated by available suit designs<sup>6</sup>. Ill\-fitting suits perform poorly at maintaining body temperature because cold seawater enters through the neck and wrist seals<sup>7</sup>. 

 Furthermore, the RGU study is mentioned on three occasions in the CAA’s report of 20th February 2014<sup>4</sup>, which followed the loss of an aircraft in Shetland in August 2013 with four fatalities. It specifically makes reference to reviewing minimum exit size, informing the increased size of exits and the possibility of restricting flights and seat choice for some workers next to small exits. 

 Robert Paterson, Oil & Gas UK Health and Safety Director at the time of the study noted several safety aspects in addition to those of the CAA, including design and health aspects.  He specifically commented that the industry was fortunate that the RGU study was so well advanced at the time of the fatal helicopter accident<sup>6</sup>.  The visibility of the research to the industry was maintained via a number of conference presentations, most notably an invitation to present the study to ministers at the Scottish Parliament in January 2015 in an event entitled ‘Research with Impact’.  The long\-awaited evidence that confirmed the fears that offshore workers’ health was threatened by their shape and increased size added impetus to the health promotion initiatives underway in order to remedy the challenge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle offshore. 

 Mick Borwell, health and safety director with Oil & Gas UK, added: *“Many offshore facilities were designed more than 40 years ago based on size information of offshore workers available at that time and which we now know to be very different today. The findings from the research will be invaluable to those designing future offshore safety equipment, survival clothing and space and accommodation requirements offshore.”* 

 **Awards** 

 In May 2013, the research won the Ewan MacDonald Prize for Excellence in Occupational Health audit or processes by the Society for Occupational Medicine. 

 Further recognition of the significance of its impact, this study received The William Floyd Award for outstanding and innovative contribution to ergonomics and human factors in 2018, by the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics & Human Factors.

 **6. Statement from the Health and Safety director of Oil & Gas UK at the time of the study.** 

 *“The RGU Size and Shape of Offshore workers Study \(2013/14\) has made a number of contributions to both the safety and health of the offshore workforce arising from that work, and will continue to do so in the years to come. It was fortunate that the study work was well advanced at the time when the UK Civil Aviation Authority made a number of new requirements following a helicopter crash in 2013. Following the fatal loss of a helicopter off Sumburgh Airport, Shetland islands on 23 August 2013 with 4 fatalities, the UK Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\) launched a rapid review of offshore helicopter safety. On 20 February 2014 the CAA published the results of their review in a report \(CAP1145\)*<sup>4</sup> *which included an intention to prohibit helicopter operators from carrying passengers whose body size was incompatible with the push\-out window emergency exit size. The RGU study was instrumental in providing a basis for determining that the relationship between shoulder width and the diagonal dimension of the window exit was the most reliable ‘compatibility’ test. This resulted in shoulder measurements being undertaken for all offshore workers, and armbands being issued to certain individuals to ensure they use only certain specific seats. Helicopter OEMs \(original equipment manufacturers\) and helicopter operators have shown interest in the study data. Historically the weight of a person had been used to determine the seating layout arrangements and numbers of seats in the offshore lifeboats \(TEMPSC \- totally enclosed motor\-propelled survival craft\). HSE \(the offshore safety regulator\) planned to review their TEMPSC guidance as the RGU study showed the average offshore worker was now much wider. Survival suit manufacturers and suppliers have also shown interest in the data for application in the design of next generation of survival suits, with particular reference to ensuring wrist and neck seals are effective. There were also indications that the companies involved with the design and specification of installations were looking at the data in respect of corridor widths, escape stairs and muster point dimension. Lastly there was some anecdotal evidence that some installation operators were starting to look more carefully at the offshore diet and the potential for the inclusion of health\-related eating criteria in future contracts with the offshore catering contractors.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Blanche’s research produced a model that opened the door for the creation of innovative frameworks and practical toolkits to support quality outcomes in participatory arts in three countries profiled in this case study – ‘participatory arts’ referring here to work engaging \(often vulnerable\) people as creative or co\-creative participants for a range of therapeutic, social or educational outcomes.  A “ *threshold moment”* \(corroborating source 5.2\) for the sector, Blanche’s model provided the *“missing piece*” \(5.1\) that has since enabled completely new systems for supporting quality to be created in Scotland, Wales and Portugal, credited by the respective policymakers to Blanche’s work as having a “ *direct*”, “ *profound*” and “ *instrumental*” impact \(5.1, 5.2, 5.3\). 

 Impacts include visible shifts in funders’ quality management and evaluation approaches, and a significant refocus on quality processes at the planning stage. Empowered by new frameworks to define their own excellence, practitioners enjoy increased agency in relationships with funders and feel professionally validated and equipped for the first time.  Artists confirm that the new approach enhances the quality of their practice, their outputs, their delivery partnerships and the quality of what is experienced by participant end\-users. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2013 Creative Scotland commissioned Blanche to **review the existing body of knowledge** on quality in participatory arts and creative learning to underpin an updated quality framework in Scotland \( **Blanche 2014a** \(output 3.1 below\), p23\), arising from **a longstanding need** for clear indicators of what represents quality in this field \(5.2, 5.3\).   Funders and sector leaders had highlighted an **urgent need** to assure quality of engagement with participants in arts\-led work and “create a more professional and confident sector whose work is validated and valued” \(dha 2015:2\), supplement what was known about quality “through the examination of tangible and less tangible contributory factors” and translate these into “solutions further down the line” \(Schwartz 2014:5\). 

 **Blanche’s analysis fulfilled all of these requirements. ** The publication of her findings and model in *Developing a Foundation for Quality* \(3.1\) was hailed by the Director of ArtWorks UK, a nationwide research and development programme for participatory arts, as *“close to the holy grail”* \(5.5\).   ArtWorks immediately commissioned Blanche to produce a sector\-facing summary  [report](https://www.phf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ArtWorks-Insights-in-facilitating-quality.pdf) to bring her recommendations to the wider attention of policymakers and funders of participatory arts \(5.5\).  A peer\-reviewed academic paper was also published in a special journal edition dedicated to ArtWorks \( **Blanche 2014b**, 3.2\). The three policy stakeholders in Scotland, Wales and Portugal have since engaged closely with Blanche’s ongoing research to study the implementation of her model and explore sectoral impacts, resulting in further academic publications **Blanche 2018** \(3.3\) and **Blanche 2020** \(3.4\). 

 The value of Blanche’s research lies in generating **new insights and understanding** about quality in participation, **translating knowledge** **from non\-arts disciplines** and sectors into a roadmap for funders and policymakers showing how to support artists in delivering the best quality outputs, experiences and impacts for arts participants. This **original and** **innovative research approach** is credited by ArtWorks as having finally “ *cracked something we have all been searching for for years and yet have failed to conceptualise*” \(5.5\).  Creative Scotland noted the rigour in the way Blanche’s analysis “ *brought a quality of breadth, depth and new thinking to the subject”, “interrogating it sensitively and in depth” to produce “a well thought through and articulated philosophical framework”* \(5.5\). 

 Blanche’s original research \(3.1, 3.2\) made a unique **material contribution** by **identifying and explaining dysfunctions in existing systems** evidenced to undermine quality and, going significantly beyond a conventional literature review, **devising a holistic model** incorporating the measures and operational conditions required to create the optimal environment for participatory artists to achieve their highest quality work. 

 Testimonies from policymakers and funders \(5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4\) pinpoint the key **original contributions** of Blanche’s research and model as: 

-  Generating a set of guiding **quality indicators \(‘Principles’\)** for participatory arts \- adopted almost verbatim by policymakers with endorsement from their sectors 

-  Highlighting factors beyond artists’ control for fulfilling core quality pre\-conditions, recognising the **influence and therefore shared responsibility of partners** ‘outside the room’ where participation takes place 

-  Rationalising that meaningful **quality can only be ‘built in’** at the start through partnership, rather than retrospectively captured 

-  Showing that quality must be **defined in context by artists** for each project through **multiple stakeholder lenses,** encouraging a focus on what it ‘looks and feels like’. 

 The academic rigour and quality of the research was instrumental in the reception of the model by policymakers according to testimonies 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5: 

 *The connection to an academic institution gave the report value and authority. It came from a different place but was instrumental in focusing the insights into quality that arts organisations were putting forward from a practice\-based point of view* \(5.2\). 

 *The fact you are an academic also gave weight to it.  And, especially with an organisation like Gulbenkian, it’s very important to back up all the proposals with proper research and proper evidence* \(5.4\)

Creative Scotland’s Toolkit ‘Is This The Best It Can Be?’ was built on Blanche’s findings, conclusions and model: “ *Blanche’s insights and model became fundamental principles for developing the toolkit*” \(5.1\).   This is reinforced in a film  [*Behind the Research*](https://www.creativescotland.com/what-we-do/major-projects/creative-learning-and-young-people/artworks-scotland/is-this-the-best-it-can-be) produced by Creative Scotland for the toolkit webpage and acknowledgements in the toolkit  [*Guidance Notes*](https://www.creativescotland.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/35597/ArtWorks-Toolkit-Is-this-the-best-it-can-be1.pdf) \(p26\). 

 ArtWorks Cymru’s Director credits Blanche’s report with “ *put\[ting\] me in a position to go to the Arts Council with a new way of looking at this and to move forward our journey to make participatory arts more professional and valued*” resulting directly in the creation of Wales’ Quality Principles framework \(5.2\). It visibly mirrors Blanche’s quality principles, uses Blanche’s language and implements her recommended quality approach, following expert briefing by Blanche to the Welsh steering committee in 2015. The published  [toolkit document](https://artworks.cymru/uploads/documents/frameworkDownloads/QualityPrinciples-Booklet-v7-ENGLISH.pdf) acknowledges Blanche’s contribution \(p20\). 

 Blanche’s report *provided answers to questions that “the sector has been wrangling with since at least the 1990s*” \(5.3\), enabling the Traditional Music Forum to present its own Code of Practice framework in 2018.  Acknowledging Blanche on p29,  [this framework](https://tracscotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Code-of-P-QF-PDF-1.3.2.pdf) directly applies key principles and concepts from her research as the foundation for the first sector\-wide code of practice used by traditional musicians in Scotland working with at least 23,500 participants \(5.3\). 

 Additionally **Portugal’s main funder of participatory arts, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, applied Blanche’s quality approach in its participatory arts programme PARTIS** \(5.8: p78\-79. 5.4\). Since 2017, all projects funded through PARTIS have been supported by the programme’s artistic evaluator to use tools from Scotland’s toolkit translated into Portuguese \(5.7.3, 5.8: p84\) with the aim to *positively imprint best practice “in the dna” of the “embryonic participatory arts sector”* in Portugal \(5.4\). The new approach has become mainstreamed in PARTIS resulting in changes in the programme’s structure and evaluation format \(5.4, 5.8: p84\). 

  

 **All of these policymakers in the UK and Portugal have adopted the list of quality principles defined in Blanche’s research.**  Their new approaches each incorporate core elements from her recommended quality model discussed in section 2 above. 

 Through these frameworks **a visible shift in quality management has occurred emphasising early conception and planning stages of work,** a phase previously deprioritised in the funding culture \(5.6\). In all three countries this application of Blanche’s model has **enabled glitches and weaknesses to be identified and fixed** in planning before they undermine quality for participants \(5.6, 5.4, 5.8:p81\-82\) and has **strengthened project delivery partnerships** \(5.6\).  In Portugal this refocus resulted in the creation of **a new funded ‘R&D phase’** in the first months of the PARTIS programme, enabling projects to roadtest and refine their plans to establish the best conditions for quality \(5.4, 5.8: p83\-84\). 

 **Implementation of Blanche’s model has led to positive changes in evaluation conventions**.  In Scotland and Wales 4 in 5 practitioners say the new quality approach **helps shape more meaningful evaluation** \(5.6, films 5.7.2 and 5.7.3\), enabling them to place their values at the core of their work \(films 5.7.2 and 5.7.4\) and to *“hold projects accountable for delivering well for participants”* \(5.7.5, 5.6\). This **has empowered practitioners to advocate more definitively** for their work **and to lever funding** \(5.6\) while feeling more ownership of evaluation \(5.7.3\): “ *As an artist one of the main benefits is a reassurance that our values are embedded in the project and that's what we're being asked to evaluate it by”* \(5.7.2\). 

 In Portugal **the formal evaluation structure for PARTIS now includes an additional strand** dedicated to artistic quality based around Blanche’s quality principles that recognises each project on its own merits while enabling programmes of work to be cross\-evaluated \(5.4, 5.7.3\) *.* Final reporting now captures not only strengths but reflective learning from what has impeded quality in the projects; **a new evaluation paradigm** filling a gap in Portugal \(5.4\). 

 **The implementation of Blanche’s quality model has produced deep and potentially permanent changes in sector practice** characterised as “ *a real change in outlook*” \(5.3\) **.** Arts practitioners and managers surveyed in Scotland, Wales and Portugal are consistently embedding the new approach in their practice: all but two artists surveyed on the toolkits had already applied the new tools in their work multiple times, with 1 in 4 having used them *more than ten times* \(5.6\). The toolkits are valued highly as **professional development** resources by artists at all career stages \(5.6\) and are regarded as **fundamental for training** and supporting emerging practitioners \(5.6, 5.3\). *“As a freelancer it is the tool that I have been looking for and never had”* \(5.6\). 

 **All sector users have reported positive impacts** ascribed variously as *early impact*, *noticeable and important impact* and in some cases *transformational impact*, specifically in how they: understand the quality of their own work • engage with partners and participants • evaluate and report externally on the quality of their work • reflect internally for continuous quality improvement \(5.6\). 

 **Artists have been empowered in defined ways as a result of the new operating environment promoted by the frameworks.**  Being able to define the quality of their own work has turned the debate around and “ *changed the conversation*” with funders \(5.2\), moving it forward and granting practitioners “ *greater ownership of excellence and evaluation*” \(5.7.3, 5.6\) \- loaded issues characterised as “battlegrounds” before \(5.2\).  The frameworks make **artists feel professionally validated, mandated and equipped** \(5.2, 5.6\).  Blanche’s framing of terms and concepts has **given the sector and policymakers a common language** for the first time **;** this stands out as a major theme across the testimony gathered, singled out by one artist as ‘ *a large and transforming impact’* for her practice \(5.6\) *.* 

 Responding artists confirm that the new approach embodying Blanche’s model has **enhanced the quality of their practice, their outputs, their delivery partnerships and**, most importantly, **the quality of what is experienced by their beneficiaries** \(5.6\). The policymakers/funders in Scotland and Portugal believe their new approach **supports continual improvement** in their sectors \(5.1, 5.4, 5.8\).  The value of this flexible, reflexive quality model has been appreciated by practitioners **during the Covid crisis** to consider what quality looks and feels like under radically adjusted circumstances, supporting them to recalibrate their practice to be ‘the best it can be’ in *any* context \(5.6, films 5.7.4 and 5.7.5\). 

 Testimonies from those involved with operationalising the model strongly suggest that these impacts would not have been possible without Blanche’s research providing *the missing piece* \(5.1\): “ *ArtWorks Cymru wouldn’t have been able to move on with such confidence without Blanche’s report*” \(5.2\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Atmospheric science research in the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge has played a leading role in demonstrating the depletion of the ozone layer following anthropogenic emissions of halogenated compounds and other Ozone Depleting Substances \(ODS\). This research has been a key input into the series of assessment reports that have made the case to policy makers for strengthening the phase\-out schedules for these compounds under the Montreal Protocol. The research underpinning these reports has made a vital contribution to a number of changes to the Protocol that have ensured a more rapid phase\-out of a wider range of ODS and their replacements, leading to significant global health and climate benefits during the REF period. Researchers at Cambridge have helped to raise global awareness of these benefits, helping to maintain support for the Protocol among policy makers, and supporting the development of legislation to limit the environmental impact of ODS and their replacements. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor John Pyle was a founder and co\-director of the Centre for Atmospheric Science, an interdisciplinary research centre involving scientists from the Departments of Chemistry, Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and Geography, and subsequently of Cambridge Centre for Climate Science at the University of Cambridge. Pyle has made a world\-leading contribution to the work of these centres. His major contribution has been the development of integrated chemistry–climate numerical models for the stratosphere, which have been successfully evaluated against atmospheric observations. These include the UM\_UKCA model developed in collaboration with the Met Office, which is now established as a gold standard in climate prediction. This model is widely used internationally and is a key component of the UK Earth System Model \(UKESM1\).\[R1,R2\] UM\_UKCA and its predecessors have been used to explain the role of ozone depleting substances \(ODS\) in past changes in atmospheric composition and to make projections about future changes. Since 2000, Pyle and his colleagues in the Centre for Atmospheric Science have published over 60 original scientific papers that have greatly increased our understanding of the extent and causes of ozone depletion in the stratosphere, the factors that determine the rate of recovery of the ozone layer, the relationship between climate and chemical reactions of ODS with ozone, and the threat of anthropogenic, short\-lived ODS that are currently outside the remit of the Montreal Protocol. 

 **Understanding ozone depletion in the stratosphere.** In 2000, calculations performed by the Pyle group demonstrated that chlorofluorocarbons \(CFC\) and other halogenated compounds had led to depletion of ozone in the Arctic. Their model calculations also showed that the severe Arctic ozone loss that occurs in some winters follows the same chemical mechanism as found in Antarctica.\[R3\] The Pyle group have also been pioneers in studying the relationship between stratospheric ozone levels and climate, which is now a major concern of the Montreal Protocol. Many global warming projection models use simplified estimates of atmospheric composition changes, often setting stratospheric ozone at constant pre\-industrial levels. Calculations by the Pyle group on the complex feedback effects between atmosphere, land surface, ocean and sea ice have demonstrated that chemistry\-climate feedbacks exert a significantly more important influence on global warming projections than previously realised.\[R1,R2\] 

 **Demonstrating the Effect of the Montreal Protocol.** Pyle’s calculations project the future evolution of ozone, explaining how atmospheric ozone concentrations are responding to regulation, with slow recovery this century.\[R4\] These chemistry–climate model projections show that, had the Montreal Protocol not been enacted, ozone depletion would have been even more severe, an Arctic ozone hole would have developed, and that consequently large changes in surface temperature and UV radiation would have occurred.\[R5\] In collaboration with epidemiologists, Pyle has extended these studies to demonstrate the very significant benefit of the Montreal Protocol in human health by reducing future increases in skin cancer.\[R6\] 

 **Short\-lived ozone depleting substances.** The Pyle group has shown that the scientific framework for regulation of short\-lived ozone depleting substances must be different to that for regulation of the longer\-lived gases, like the CFCs. For short\-lived gases, the ozone depletion potential \(a concept enshrined in legislation\) varies with region and season of emission, whereas for long\-lived gases it is a constant.\[R7\] Pyle has also demonstrated the threat posed to the environment by the very short\-lived substance dichloromethane, an ODS that is not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Very short\-lived ODS were previously thought to play a minor role in ozone depletion due to their short atmospheric lifetimes. Pyle showed that atmospheric concentrations of dichloromethane have risen recently and are continuing to increase rapidly, which will delay the recovery of the Earth’s ozone layer.\[R8\] The issue of dichloromethane and other short\-lived ODS is now at the forefront of discussions of future regulation by the Montreal Protocol.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **The Montreal Protocol.** To quote Kofi Annan’s address to the United Nations, “ *It is impossible to devise effective environmental policy unless it is based on sound scientific information*”. Annan went on to point out “ *Perhaps the single most successful international environmental agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol, in which states accepted the need to phase\-out the use of ozone\-depleting substances*.” Over the last seven years, Pyle’s work has continued to have a major impact on measures to strengthen the Montreal Protocol. As the Executive Secretary of the UNEP Ozone Secretariat said: “ *His \[Professor Pyle’s\] scientific research, analysis and observations have made significant contributions to further the understanding of the effects of ozone\-depleting substances on the ozone layer and have been providing the basis for policy actions*”.\[E1\] Pyle’s work has contributed directly to national and international discussions and agreements on the phase\-out of ODS, and, most recently, on the additional phase\-out or phase\-down of some of their replacements. 

 The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer came into force in response to the scientific evidence that human\-induced depletion of the ozone layer was indeed occurring. Every country in the world has signed up to the Protocol. Initially, the Protocol regulated only a handful of CFCs and set a schedule to phase\-down their use. However, it is an agreement which is continually evolving as new scientific evidence comes to light, so changes to the Protocol have led to more rapid phase\-out of CFCs and the addition of new controls for many more ODS \(e.g. the HCFCs\). The most recent 2016 amendment to the Protocol added hydrofluorocarbons \(HFCs\), which are potent climate gases, to the list of controlled substances with an agreement to phase\-down their use over the next 30 years.\[E2,E3\] 

 **Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion.** Every four years, the measures introduced by the Protocol are assessed on the basis of available scientific, environmental, technical, and economic information. An international panel of experts, the Scientific Assessment Panel to the Montreal Protocol \(SAP\), carries out the scientific assessments by preparing reports to guide policymakers in their decisions regarding the Protocol, and these reports are published by the World Meteorological Organisation \(WMO\). Pyle has contributed scientific evidence to all the WMO Assessments to date, and for the most recent Assessments in 2014 and 2018, he was one of the four international co\-chairs of the SAP.\[E4,E5\] The 2018 WMO Assessment contains over 45 citations to original research authored by Pyle, including the publications listed above.\[E5\] All of the WMO Assessments feed into the on\-going Montreal Protocol regulation process and hence have continuing and wide\-reaching impact. 

 **Addressing Short\-lived Ozone Depleting Substances.** At least twice a year, there are meetings of the representatives of the governments of all 197 signatories of the Protocol, which are called the Conference of the Parties, Meetings of the Parties, and Open Ended Working Groups. The WMO Assessments produced by the SAP feed directly into these meetings, advising and supporting decision makers in modifying the Protocol. Pyle attends these meetings to present the scientific evidence on which the decisions taken are based. Pyle’s work on short\-lived ODS led to a specific plenary discussion of this problem at the Meetings of the Parties at MOP29 in 2017, and is discussed in the Executive Summary of the 2018 Assessment.\[E5, E6\] These discussions have placed short\-lived ODS firmly on the agenda for regulation under the Protocol. 

 **Impact of the Montreal Protocol.** The controls put in place by the Montreal Protocol have had a significant impact on the sustainability of the planet and have averted long\-term threats to future health. In 2018, definitive evidence was obtained to show that the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica has begun to shrink.\[E5\] The models that originally pointed out the problems with the levels of CFCs in the stratosphere and the consequences for ozone depletion were confirmed by the experimental observation of the Antarctic ozone hole. These models can therefore be used with confidence to project what would have happened to the ozone layer in the absence of the Protocol. For example, Pyle’s prediction studies showed that, without the Montreal Protocol, an Arctic ozone hole, similar to that seen in the south, would have occurred during the last decade with consequently large increases in UV. There are also important additional indirect impacts of the Protocol, for example on human health. The predictions show that many millions of skin cancers are avoided annually as a direct result of the reduction in UV dosage due to the measures put in place by the Protocol.\[E7\] There can be no doubt that the Protocol has had a major impact in avoiding further ozone depletion, in avoiding climate change thanks to the phase\-out of those ODS which are also greenhouse gases, and in preventing UV\-related health issues. Ensuring that the Protocol is continually adjusted and amended according to the latest scientific developments is essential to their continuing impact, and the chemistry\-climate models developed by Pyle are vital for reminding the public and the governments of the world that the consequences of non\-compliance would be catastrophic. 

 In conclusion, Pyle’s research has not only provided valuable scientific input into the Montreal Protocol, which continues to have major long\-term impact on the habitability of the planet, but also provided Pyle with a platform to directly influence government policy in every single country in the world through his role as co\-chair of the Scientific Assessment Panel. In 2018 the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Ozone Secretariat, said “ *We, in the ozone community, are so proud to have Professor John Pyle guiding the decision making of the parties to the Montreal Protocol ... His work has vastly contributed to our global efforts to protect the ozone layer*”.\[E8\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Birkbeck researchers Roussos, Poulton and Weston worked with the London Ambulance Service \(LAS\) to create software developed using a novel data\-driven model, which predicts ambulance response times within the LAS area of responsibility with 80% greater accuracy than was previously possible. Specifically, the Birkbeck model was incorporated into two new software tools: \(i\) Geotracker, a visualization tool which gives ambulance shift leaders an overview of their capacity to respond to incidents within the mandated time; and \(ii\) the QUEST simulator that helps assess the impact of strategy changes on the performance of the service and in particular on incident response times. Geotracker and QUEST have enabled LAS to deploy its ambulances more effectively and, as a result, to save more Londoners’ lives.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The speed with which emergency medical services arrive following a life\-threatening incident is a critical factor in patient survival rates and is, consequently, a key performance indicator against which ambulance services are assessed in the UK and internationally. Notably, the Handbook to the NHS Constitution mandates that all ambulance trusts must respond to Category 1 calls \(that is, calls classified as life\-threatening and needing immediate intervention and/or resuscitation\) within 7 minutes on average and to 90% of these calls within 15 minutes. Research in urban analytics has been underway at Birkbeck’s department of Computer Science and Information Systems since 2005, extending earlier work on data\-driven algorithms for the analysis of consumer navigation patterns in retail \[1\]. Our contributions \[2, 3, 5\] include methods and techniques for the analysis of personal mobility patterns, for landmark identification and itinerary personalization, and for the exploration of the relationships between personal motivations and patterns of urban navigation. 

 In 2010, research student Marcus Poulton joined the department, bringing a detailed knowledge of the London Ambulance Service \(LAS\) information systems and a desire to apply modern data\-driven techniques to improve the efficiency of emergency response. Marcus was attracted by the department’s expertise in urban navigation analytics \(as detailed above\), and his arrival precipitated the development of a programme of research focussing specifically on the problem of improving the efficiency of ambulance emergency response. In particular, the Birkbeck team, led by Roussos, identified the analysis of mobility patterns as the key element in predicting ambulance travel times. 

 Between 2010 and 2013, Roussos and Poulton investigated methods for the identification of gaps within the LAS area of responsibility: that is, regions where under certain circumstances LAS ambulances would be unable to reach the location of an emergency incident within the mandated timeframe. This problem was addressed by developing algorithms incorporating route selection and arrival time prediction techniques that could be applied to estimate operational coverage reflecting the specifics of a particular configuration of ambulance resources \[4\]. These techniques were developed using a data\-driven approach whereby historical incident and ambulance tracking data were employed to build dynamic predictive models. Moreover, the approach is adaptive to changing traffic conditions depending on the time of the week, and it facilitated the development of a new method for resource relocation that significantly improved area coverage \[4\]. 

 Between 2014 and 2018, Roussos, Poulton and Weston extended the work presented in \[4\] to account for the interplay between strategy and tactics so as to improve the ability of LAS to cover its full area of responsibility more efficiently. Specifically, working on a road network graph representation that was modified to reflect the differences between emergency and regular vehicle traffic \(a key innovation over previous predictive models based on patterns of civilian traffic\), they developed a methodology for precisely matching low\-frequency and often erroneous GPS coordinates emitted by ambulances to the road segments travelled. This approach permits reconstruction of complete ambulance tracks in detail and gives an accurate characterization of how long a particular road segment takes to traverse under specific traffic conditions at a particular time during the week. This novel methodology for improving the quality of the data employed to build their models provides one of the key ingredients for the development of methods that can be used to calculate significantly more precise estimates of future travel times for different types of ambulatory response vehicles. 

 Further, from this foundation Roussos, Poulton and Weston introduced the novel hybrid multi\-dimensional model presented in \[6\], which can precisely predict the actual route taken by an ambulance travelling under blue lights and sirens, while minimizing the journey duration estimate error. This was accomplished by combining a method which correctly predicted routes selected by LAS’s ambulance navigation system in current use, and the Birkbeck team’s best\-performing speed estimation method selected from several alternatives presented also in \[6\]. Assisted by Noulas of the New York University Data Science Institute, the Birkbeck team conducted experiments demonstrating that this model significantly outperforms alternative mobility models in its ability to predict the time taken by an ambulance to travel from its point of departure to its destination \[6\]. This finding also suggests that an operational navigation system for LAS tailored specifically to ambulance mobility and the traffic patterns of London would offer substantial operational improvements. The model described in \[6\] provides the computational basis underpinning the development of the two software systems developed with LAS, namely Geotracker and QUEST described in Section 4 below.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Birkbeck’s novel hybrid model for metropolitan\-scale ambulance route selection provides the computational basis of Geotracker and QUEST, two bespoke software tools used operationally on a daily basis by the London Ambulance Service. The improved accuracy in route planning and optimization offered by this software is especially critical for LAS as it is the busiest ambulance service nationally, having responsibility for an area with the highest population density in the UK. Capitalizing on the ability of the Birkbeck model to predict more precisely the time required for an ambulance to reach a particular incident, the software has helped improve the accuracy of service area coverage, the efficiency of resource deployment strategies, and the ease with which this information can be accessed and interpreted. This enables LAS staff to make informed and effective decisions more quickly, furthering the Service’s lifesaving mission. Ambulance control room shift supervisors rely on the predictions of the software to make rapid decisions about how best to deploy their fleet. The Assistant Director of Information Management and Technology at the LAS states that “The work from Birkbeck has changed the way we map and deploy ambulances for the better, and that means helping to save lives. I can’t think of a more important application of research than that.” \[B\] 

 The two software tools developed in collaboration with Birkbeck have assisted LAS to achieve shorter response times, thus addressing a well\-established clinical finding of critical importance for the survival of individuals involved in high\-severity emergency incidents \[F\]. In the UK, ambulance services operating under the National Health Service treat approximately 30,000 Category 1 out\-of\-hospital cardiac arrest patients every year \[G\] with a survival rate of approximately 9% for those reaching hospital discharge \[H\]. Short ambulance response times are a key factor in attaining improved clinical outcomes because longer delays between collapse and the commencement of emergency life support result in significantly reduced survival rates \[I\]. After 10 minutes, very few patients survive \[J\]. Achieving this level of performance is particularly difficult in London:  the LAS attends to over 3,000 emergency incidents every day, making it the busiest service in the country. It does so across a region with the highest population density in the United Kingdom: 8,770,000 people inhabiting an area of approximately 1,572 km<sup>2</sup>. This population distribution is associated not only with a high number of medical emergencies but also with traffic congestion that presents particular challenges to rapid ambulance movement across the city. 

 Roussos, Poulton and Weston worked with LAS to address this problem, using historical incident and response performance data maintained by the Service. They employed a data\-driven methodology to adaptively reconstruct ambulance mobility patterns across the city which they encapsulated in a hybrid model for route prediction \[6\]. This model also incorporates a bespoke road map of London derived from Ordnance Survey data and tailored specifically to emergency vehicle traffic travelling under blue lights and sirens. In particular, the map reflects the fact that ambulances can take routes that civilian vehicles cannot; for example, they can make right\-hand turns where civilian traffic is forbidden from doing so. The model developed by Roussos, Poulton, Weston, and validated with the support of Noulas, allows accurate estimates for travel speeds over particular road segments at different times of the week and under different conditions. This approach results in 80% better accuracy in predicting the time taken by an ambulance crew to reach an emergency incident compared with alternative systems, for example the industry\-leading Google Distance Matrix API \[F\]. 

 Geotracker capitalizes on the performance gains enabled by the Birkbeck model to provide a comprehensive software application that allows LAS shift managers to track ambulances across the city and use available resources with considerably improved effectiveness. The software incorporates a visualization tool, also powered by the Birkbeck model, which provides control room staff with an intuitive “heatmap” of ambulance coverage across the LAS area of responsibility. Geotracker continuously calculates which locations can be reached by available ambulances within the time limit set by the NHS performance targets. The software responds to changing patterns of the overall demand on the service, generating notifications when increased demand is predicted to adversely impact LAS resources. It also enables staff to make fully\-informed decisions about how best to deploy the approximately 300 LAS vehicles that are operational at any one time. This goal is achieved through interactive exploration of alternative tactics via a ‘drag\-and\-drop’ user interface feature, which assesses the effect of deploying a particular vehicle to a specific incident or standby point. 

 Geotracker is now routinely used in the control room at LAS. The Head of Quality Assurance at LAS explains that its use represents a milestone for the Service, which had attempted to introduce a dynamic emergency vehicle deployment system for some time but had found predecessors to Geotracker limited. The updated Geotracker which Marcus, George and David built has benefited the LAS by allowing the service to use resources more effectively and efficiently, basing decision\-making on historical information as well as on an accurate real\-time picture of its crews at work. This in turn benefits the patients served by enabling the LAS to respond more quickly to emergency calls. Such increased effectiveness also benefits the taxpayers whose money supports this publicly\-funded service. 

 As well as increasing its efficiency today, the tool also enables the LAS to plan more effectively for the future. Having an accurate understanding of the time taken by our vehicles to cover specific routes allows the LAS to identify hotspots where crews can most usefully be stationed during key periods of demand. Geotracker also allows them to monitor the coverage of these hotspots, informing discussions around coverage and resourcing at the local station level \(e.g. this information might be used to make a case for stationing more vehicles at a particular location\). Indeed, \[redacted\] also reports that local managers have found the system so useful that access to the server has had to be rationed to cope with demand \[A\]. 

 This forward\-planning functionality combines with that of the QUEST routing engine, also powered by the hybrid model described in \[6\]. QUEST provides an accurate simulation of ambulance movement, which allows the LAS planning department to assess the likely impact of new NHS policies or response strategies on service delivery. The availability of an accurate simulator to predict the implications of strategic change enables LAS to anticipate and pre\-empt problems that have direct implications for people’s lives: ‘LAS needs to make absolutely sure that the system works well all of the time’ \[C\]. 

 Moreover, QUEST provides an open application programming interface \(API\), which facilitates innovation by supporting further research in effective response strategies by others. In 2018, a group of researchers at King’s College London visited LAS as part of the ESRC\-funded project ‘Improving Efficiency and Equity of Ambulance Services through Advanced Demand Modelling.’ By using the QUEST API, they were able to investigate a family of novel incident response allocation strategies inspired by bio\-memetic robotics, with preliminary experiments suggesting a potential reduction in response time of approximately 50% \[E\]. QUEST enabled this experimentation without the need for LAS to share historical data of incident occurrence and response, which incorporate sensitive personal information, and demonstrates how the work of Roussos, Poulton and Weston can also enable innovation by others by removing barriers related to open data sharing. 

 In 2019, London Higher, the membership body representing over 40 higher education institutions in London, selected the work undertaken by Roussos, Poulton and Weston with the LAS for their London Impact Catalogue. The catalogue exemplifies the distinct contributions London’s universities make for, and to, the Capital with the Birkbeck work selected specifically as a demonstration of impact on health and analytics. This work was also presented at the event ‘Impacting London – What London’s Universities do for London’ which took place at the House of Lords in December 2019. 

 In summary, by substantially improving the way ambulances are tracked and deployed, Birkbeck’s novel model of metropolitan\-scale route selection for ambulances and the resulting Geotracker and QUEST software, have enabled the LAS to enhance their vehicle deployment strategy and hence further their lifesaving mission. The computational tools developed in collaboration with Birkbeck achieve this through their tailored design to match the unique challenges of the Capital’s characteristics, namely the nationally highest emergency call volume, highest population density and lowest traffic speed. The tools enable LAS staff in operational and management roles to make informed and effective decisions on a day\-to\-day basis more quickly, and thus to make the best use of fixed resources under high demand. By providing concrete evidence to inform discussions around coverage and resourcing and by facilitating further research, the work by Roussos, Poulton and Weston makes a significant contribution towards supporting LAS to deploy its ambulances more effectively and as a result, to save more Londoners’ lives.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Participatory action research led by Dr. Caroline Mitchell underpins **Radio Garden,** the global radio streaming platform used by 10 million people per month that changes how listeners access and engage with \(community\) radio; puts mainstream and community stations on an equal footing; enables cultural connections; and is used to train and inspire the future broadcasting workforce. With Prof. Trish Winter, it also led to a transformative hyper\-local community culture project, **Putting Southwick on the Map.** It has enhanced residents' wellbeing and professional development; produced a new and self\-sustaining community organisation; improved cultural participation and inclusivity in programming; and enabled a major cultural commissioner to engage underserved individuals.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr. Caroline Mitchell has had a leading role in developing participatory research combining community media and participatory mapping. Her work seeks to understand how marginalised communities establish their own cultural spaces, what barriers to cultural participation they encounter \(and their experience of policy\-led interventions\), and how community stories and experiences are archived. The participatory method Mitchell advances, together with these objectives, link exemplar projects **Transnational Radio Encounters** and \(with Prof. Trish Winter\) **Putting Southwick on the Map.** 

 
In the HERA\-funded **Transnational Radio Encounters** \(2013\-16\), Mitchell \(in partnership with five universities in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK\) examined radio’s transnationality in six independent research projects. Mitchell, as PI for the ‘Minority Radio: social and cultural identifies and Black and minority ethic radio’ project, led community researchers drawn from stations, voluntary associations, and communities who listen to and contribute to radio made by/for minority groups **\[R1\]**. Using ‘sharing experience’ workshops throughout the project duration, interviews, and PAR projects \(e.g. radio programme making\), community researchers explored the nature of ‘ [accented’ radio](https://web.archive.org/web/20170522163021/http:/www.transnationalradio.org/node/41) in community radio output, the infrastructural conditions that best suited transnational radio, and, drawing on Mitchell’s work on the role of archives in creating cultural memory **\[R2\]**, the importance of archives for transnational community radio networking and recirculation of programming. One PAR activity, webcasting live from a community festival, involved a ‘Transnational Radio table’ where people could map, record and listen to experiences of students, refugees and mixed\-race families. This activity formed ideas that led to the development of Radio Garden **\[R3\]**, the project’s final output. Interviews, audio archive fragments and stories gathered in these PAR projects were brought together and fed back via community radio programmes and at workshops held with the community researchers and their radio partners. They were also ‘planted’ in Radio Garden, adding a rich ‘voicing’ of participants’ transnational radio experiences to the platform. This work, along with Mitchell’s databases of community stations that were added to the platform, meant that community radio is not only represented on Radio Garden, but is in its DNA. 

 In **Putting Southwick on the Map** \(2015\-17\) *,* Mitchell and Prof. Trish Winter developed the C.MAP \(Culture Mapping and Participation\) method, a new PAR approach combining participatory mapping, community media and arts\-based methods. It offers a new method for working with communities to investigate the existing cultural life of place from their perspective; to create knowledge about the experience of policy\-led cultural interventions from the perspective of those that they target; and to take action on grassroots cultural initiatives developed by participants. The framework for the research brought together praxis from participatory mapping, community media, arts\-based methods and action\-oriented media pedagogy. The research, undertaken with community researchers from the project’s geographic target area, took an iterative approach that cycled between methods: workshops to map tangible and intangible cultural resources and stories; training in community media, research and digital mapping; community events; arts\-based workshops in writing, music and visual arts. Community researchers led their own research projects, and relationships were developed with key community organizations. Research materials produced included audio recordings, interviews, new and archive photographs and original artworks, captured in the final exhibition, *The Southwick Map* **\[R4\]**.

 Research by Mitchell underpins **Radio Garden,** the global radio streaming platform described as “ *irresistible*” \(Tina Jordan, New York Times\), and “ *extraordinary*” \(Sebastian Piñera, President of Chile\) **\[S1\]**, and **Putting Southwick on the Map** \(with Winter\) **,** a hyper\-local community culture project. While they share a methodology, their impacts operate on vastly different scales and emerged at different stages of the research process. 

 <ins> **Radio Garden**</ins> 

 
Radio Garden **\[R3\]**, launched in 2016, is the final output of the *Transnational Radio Encounters* project. Available freely online and on iOS and Android devices, the platform is a globe peppered with pinpoints linking users to over 33,000 stations’ streamed broadcasts, thereby providing a single point of entry to the world’s radio for millions of people. It had 100 million hits in its first year and won the 2017 Webby Media Streaming award. Radio Garden is now used by 10 million listeners per month **\[S2\]**, benefiting listeners and broadcasters around the globe. Humanities in the European Research Area \(HERA\) rate it as “ *one of the most successful humanities public engagement activities ever carried out*” **\[S3\]**; a user says it *“will change the way you listen to the world*” **\[S3\]**. Each year, UNESCO features Radio Garden in its annual World Radio Day. 

 **Transforming how listeners from around the world engage with radio.** Its spinning globe reintroduces curiosity and serendipity to engagement with radio, and extensive media has focussed on journalists’ journeys around the world and through time **\[S1\]**. A Vice writer ‘travels’ from Mexico, to Alaska, to Japan. A National Public Radio \(NPR\) writer recalls early memories of twisting the radio dial to drop into unknown stations. The Guardian says the joy “ *is in the spinning of the globe and*  [*landing who knows where*](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/29/radio-garden-the-archers-steven-benedict-review).” 

 **Making all stations equally accessible**; the same pinpricks mark, for example, ILC Tamil Radio and BBC Radio 1. The New York Times says that in this way, Radio Garden “ *obliterates all distinction between radio stations”* **\[S1\]**. The UK Community Media Association says this “ *gives community stations credibility and legitimacy. This is significant because community radio can often be seen as a poor relation to BBC and commercial radio. The interface, which encourages wandering and exploring, provides a new and fun way to pick a station to listen to. Stations are extremely keen to be included on Radio Garden*” **\[S4\]**. It transforms the visibility and accessibility of community radio stations, whose reach is traditionally limited to members of the community it serves: “ *this is significant … because listeners are the lifeblood of the station. Listeners validate the importance of the station, and the credibility and quality of the staff*” **\[S4\]**. 

 **A portal to cultures familiar and new**. Radio is a valuable medium for reconnecting listeners with homelands and diasporas, and Radio Garden enables migrants to maintain connections with their host or home community. An NPR writer says “ *Back in India, when I was little, I used radio to connect with faraway places. Now living in the U.S., I was using Radio Garden to go home again*” **\[S1\]**. A Cornish community station says: “ *\[it\] can be very important for people who have left their local area. In Cornwall, we have a large diaspora of people working in the mining industry around the world and often get people tuning in from these areas*” **\[S4\]**. The New York Times notes the platform’s power for revealing “ *the peculiarities of foreign cultures*”, saying “ *the window it opens onto other places is both exceptionally vivid and exceptionally limited, like looking through a keyhole, so that you’re compelled to start filling in the rest of the picture yourself*” **\[S1\]**. Fine Art Globe says “ *Such openness to unfamiliar cultures that Radio Garden encourages … is crucial during a time when some of our political leaders are hellbent on emphasizing cultural divides, encouraging xenophobia under the guise of nationalism and protectionism*” **\[S1\]**. The Guardian echoes the sentiment: “ *With global tensions high, anger at the political establishment and fake\-news dominating social media discussions, it feels like there has never been a better time to enable people to reflect on human communication on an international level”* **\[S1\]**. Covid\-19 lockdowns have highlighted the platform’s value in enabling cultural connections and exploration. A user writes, “ *Radio Garden continuing to come into its own while travelling feels like a pipe dream*” **\[S1\]**, and the Director of the Earth Institute calls it a “ *great way to explore the world sonically while homebound*” **\[S1\]**. 

 **Inspiring and training the future workforce.** Since 2018, 320 teenagers from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds have attended BBC careers workshops that use Radio Garden to demonstrate STEM occupations in broadcasting. The programme’s Project Manager says that demonstrating Radio Garden means that “ *For the first time, the events included an activity that encouraged thinking about careers at a global level. Most STEM careers events focus on UK careers/ opportunities. Radio Garden allowed us to broaden young people’s thinking about careers in the BBC beyond the UK”* **\[S5\].** A BBC Multimedia Trainer has also used it in training for over 1,000 people in the UK and Africa **\[S5\].** 

 <ins> **Putting Southwick on the Map**</ins> 

 Putting Southwick on the Map \(PSOTM\) underpinned a resurgence in cultural engagement in Southwick, Sunderland, one of England’s most deprived areas. As a Participatory Action Research project, impact came firstly through the research process, benefitting the project participants \(community researchers\) before extending its reach to benefit a major cultural commissioner, Being Human festival organisers, and the 310 members of the legacy project Southwick REACH \(Research Education Arts and Culture Home\). The research was captured in the final exhibition, *Southwick Map* **\[R4\]**, a digital map portraying Southwick’s cultural life past and present from the perspective of its people. 

 **Enhanced professional development and wellbeing.** 15 community members were trained in community research \(interviewing, recording, editing, digital mapping\) and event curation and organisation, before being supported to research, record and map Southwick’s creative and cultural past. One community researcher, now Creative Director of Southwick REACH, says “ *the experience has been instrumental to my career development as a freelance artist. … I have produced, managed, facilitated, and curated projects planned around the interests of Southwick people. ... My experience has helped me to develop my professional practice as an artist and participatory arts practitioner and I now feel that I am predominant in my field in Sunderland. … Not only has the journey accelerated my career but has developed lasting friendships with both professionals and community members*” **\[S6\]**. It also enhanced project members’ wellbeing. Members say that being involved gets them out of the house more and they’ve gained confidence, feel healthier, and feel less lonely **\[S6\]**. *Southwick Map* was launched as part of the Being Human festival. The festival’s external evaluator said *“The community researchers told me of a number of positive impacts of their involvement which ranged from learning new skills to an increased emotional connection with their environment and neighbours”* **\[S8\]**. 

 **Creation of a new organisation, Southwick REACH**. The organisation is a direct legacy of the project and delivers annual arts and culture programmes for the community, receiving funding from Sunderland City Council and Cultural Spring \(an Arts Council England\-funded cultural development project in Sunderland and South Tyneside\) **\[S7\]**. Cultural Spring’s Project Director commends Mitchell and Winter: “ *\[their\] work with the community gave them a new sense of agency and independence. Their work supported them to take ownership of arts and culture in their community, and to make their own decisions about how they want to engage with it. We recognise this as a successful and interesting model, and one that is replicable in other communities.*” **\[S7\]**. 

 **Improving participation in arts and culture.** The project’s hyper\-local focus was critical for ensuring that it met the needs of its traditionally under\-served members. PSOTM and Southwick REACH co\-created high quality programmes *with* the community, and delivered them *in* the community. Being Human’s evaluator said: “ *I was particularly impressed by how this project had the community very much at its heart. \[It\] was facilitated, developed and delivered by the community which in turn led to a project that speaks with the local community, not at the community. … It was refreshing to see a public engagement project that was enabling a depth of engagement and investing the time to develop valuable relationships within the community*” **\[S8\]**. The project was used as an exemplar on the Being Human website, and Winter and a community researcher contributed to the 2018 Being Human Masterclass for future festival organisers, during which Winter challenged how the relationship between cultural agencies and marginalised audiences is framed. Being Human’s Manager and Curator said that, as a result, he’ll “ *never again use the term ‘hard to reach audiences’”* **\[S8\]**. Other projects have since adopted the methodology, including a community research project with Young Asian Voices, a multicultural youth and community project, and a project with the Churches Conservation Trust. 

 Annual events programmes continue to fill gaps in cultural offering. The 2019 programme, ‘The Art of Coal Mining’, explored the region’s mining history through visits, talks and workshops. Artwork created in one workshop is exhibited on the Norman Cornish website **\[S9\]**. Sunderland’s wider cultural programming is likewise enhanced by incorporating Southwick REACH events, thus better representing the needs of the population. The Director of Sunderland’s ‘Summer Streets’ Festival, an annual music, arts and culture festival attended by over 5,000 people, says Southwick REACH’s involvement “ *is a great way of helping some of the community in being able to attend the festival, and be an important part of the celebrations*” **\[S10\]**. 

 **Enabling a major cultural commissioner to engage underserved people.** Cultural Spring’s Project Director says “ *The meaningful relationships \[Mitchell and Winter\] developed helped our work twofold: \(1\) they could uncover talent and refer those individuals to us for advice and support. We do not have the capacity to find hidden talent in the city in this way, so \[they\] were instrumental in prompting previously unengaged individuals to come to us for support. \(2\) They supported individuals and the community to identify what creative and cultural opportunities they wanted and needed, and empowered them to engage with us to seek our support*” **\[S7\]**. 

 **Changing perceptions of Southwick.** Cultural Spring’s Project Director says that prior to PSOTM, “ *there was a perception \[amongst community members and cultural commissioners\] that the Southwick community was not interested in arts and culture.*” The project, the way it brought community members together, and the way it enabled Cultural Spring’s engagement with them, *“not only challenged that perception, but demonstrated that there was an interest in arts and culture – and a desire among the community to actively engage in them. … The work – particularly PSOTM – revealed a wealth of information about the history of arts and culture in Southwick; this has underpinned ongoing activity by Southwick REACH*” **\[S7\]**.

1.  **1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\)** 

 UAL’s commitment to driving social, cultural and institutional change in relation to inequalities in the arts that result from issues around ethnic and national identity has had—and continues to have—extensive impact. UAL has enabled this by establishing within the University a range of influential academic positions and research projects, as well as research centres in the field, which are impacting the wider discourse. Key to this is UAL’s Black Artists and Modernism \(BAM\) project, which, by uncovering and making visible Black\-British artists and their work, has impacted on national collections’ development policy and strategy; archiving and accessions management; exhibition curation; the interpretation of works within museum and gallery settings, and supporting events in the UK and internationally. The project has changed public, professional and academic discourses, with these artists beginning to be properly positioned within narratives of historical and contemporary art.

1.  **2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

#  Key to expanding knowledge in the area of the representation of Black\-British artists in the UK and internationally was the publication of Boyce, Bailey and Baucom’s *Shades of Black: Assembling Black Arts in 1980s Britain* \(2005\), the outcome of research into the previous 20 years of Black Art in Britain. \[3.1.\] Focusing particularly on the Thatcher period and the explosion of the Black Arts Movement in the wake of civil unrest and rioting in British cities, the book created a dialogue between leading artists, curators, art historians and critics. Combining cultural theory with anecdotal testimonies and experience, it examined how Black\-British artists of the 1980s might be viewed historically and explored the political, cultural and artistic developments that sparked the movement. The book built on papers presented at a Duke University conference \(2001\) and included a comprehensive timeline of Black\-British art from 1960 onwards. Awarded the Historians of British Art Book Prize \(2007\), the first publication focused exclusively on Black arts to win the prize since it was established in 1996, *Shades of Black* has become an established point of reference for the study of Black Art and British cultural developments during the period. 

#  UAL’s *Black Artists and Modernism* research project \(2015–2018, AHRC, GBP722,681.00\) continued the University’s work in this area. The project recognised that, despite the fact that Black\-British artists have made a fundamental contribution to modernist discourse internationally, at that point, only a handful of references related to this field of practice directly. As part of the investigation into the impact of Black\-British art on the broader narratives of modern and contemporary art practice, the research team \(Boyce, lok, Dibosa with Goodwin, Dalal\-Clayton and Nasar as fellows\) developed the hypothesis that publicly funded galleries, museums and collections in the UK held works by artists of African and Asian heritage that are at best rarely and at worst never seen by the public or have become ‘lost’ or ‘hidden’, and that the quantity of this work and the artworks themselves needed to be scrutinised. A major question for the research was how to counter the tendency for contemporary discourse focused on the ethnicity of the artist and the general problematics of race and identity politics within the art establishment, thus deflecting attention away from how these artworks relate to or have influenced the development of 20<sup>th</sup>\-century art. \[3.2.\] 

#  The project comprised four interlocking areas. The ‘BAM Audit’, led by Dalal\-Clayton, researched artworks by artists of African, Caribbean, Asian and MENA Region \(Middle East and North Africa\) descent held in public collections in the UK. 30 UK collections were surveyed including the Government Art Collection, Pallant House Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts. BAM’s monographic strand examined the relationship to modernism of artworks by Black\-British artists; a museological strand examined the decision\-making and procedures of the public institutions in acquiring the artworks, and the interpretive strategies used to contextualise them within the wider narratives of the collections, while curatorial research reviewed key exhibitions, mainly from the 1980s, that involved Black\-British artists as curators. 

 UAL’s research into the Hayward Gallery’s pivotal 1989/90 exhibition, *The Other Story: Afro\-Asian artists in post\-war Britain* \(curated by Rasheed Aareen\), has played an important part in underpinning the University’s study of Black\-British artists. **Boyce** \(with Jean Fisher\) examined *The Other Story* as one of three case studies from 1989, a pivotal year for both art and politics. \[3.3.\] 

#  As a counterpoint to UAL’s long\-term investigation into Black\-British artists and their work, a key element of research in this area has been the consideration of ‘the audience’. Dibosa’s research considers the audience experience in relation to the work of the art museum. It does this from the perspectives of the art museum itself and of the visitors it seeks to attract. Through the analysis of material gathered from a major collaborative research project carried out at Tate Britain, the project reconfigured the relationship between art, culture and society conceptually in relation to race. \[3.4.\]

1.  **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 UAL has created a space in which a multiplicity of approaches can be debated, and conflicts in perspectives on Black\-British art and artists interrogated. Understanding of the processes involved in how works by Black\-British artists have become ‘lost’ or ‘hidden’ is increasing. UAL’s investment in the research has led to strategic internal appointments as well as UAL scholars being appointed to positions of influence in external organisations and institutions. The University’s support for research into issues around ethnic and national identity as they relate to art and design has led to the creation of UAL Research Centres. TrAIN \(2004, Research Centre for Transnational Art, Identity and Nation\) is a cross\-disciplinary hub for historical, theoretical and practice\-based research. In 2018, UAL invited Iniva \(Institute of International Visual Arts\) to relocate to Chelsea College of Arts; award\-winning artist and UAL alumnus, Yinka Shonibare MBE, commented that the relocation will “maximise the potential of the Stuart Hall Library whilst making a significant contribution to diverse perspectives within the college, in the community, across London, nationally and beyond”. \[5.1.\] In 2020, Shades of Noir \(SoN, established by Aisha Richards in 2009, taking *Shades of Black* as its inspiration\) became UAL’s Centre for Race and Practice\-Based Social Justice, with Richards as Director. The UAL Decolonising Arts Institute \(2019\) was established to challenge colonial and imperial legacies in order to drive cultural, social and institutional change. Through these centres and a number of key academic appointments, UAL is investing in creating social, cultural and institutional impact— **Boyce** was appointed as UAL Chair in Black Art & Design in 2013. UAL’s Decolonising the Arts Institute is working with 15 partners comprising major UK public art collections \(including Tate, Arts Council and British Council collections\) and arts charities \(e.g. Art UK and the Art Fund\) to explore potential collaborative ways of working. UAL researchers have been appointed to a range of high\-profile positions, which is contributing to the scale of the impact of UAL’s work in uncovering Black\-British artists— **Boyce** will represent Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2022, the first black woman to do so. 

 The critically acclaimed Diaspora Pavilion at the Venice Biennale 2017 \(a partnership with UAL co\-curated by David A. Bailey and Jessica Taylor\), brought together 19 international artists \(including UAL’s **lok**, Kimathi Donkor, Joy Gregory, the late Khadija Saye, and Erika Tan; and Isaac Julien, UAL Chair of Global Art, 2014–2016; UAL Honorary Fellow, Hew Locke; and Abbas Zahedi, TrAIN Co\-Lab Artist Research Residency, 2019–2020\), whose wide\-ranging practices variously expand, complicate and destabilise diaspora as an enduring critical concept. The exhibition was part of a larger two\-year programme through which 12 emerging artists were brought together with 10 mentors \(including Gregory, Julien and Locke\). Director, Tate: “The Diaspora pavilion was the greatest energy source of the whole Biennale”. \[5.2.\] 

 A collaboration between UAL and Middlesex University, Black Artists and Modernism \(BAM\) examined the artworks and practices of artists of African and Asian descent. One of the most impactful elements of the project has been the audit, which identified and catalogued a total of 2,085 works by over 300 Black\-British artists. The institutions that took part in the audit report ongoing impact on practices including collections and acquisitions management, archiving policy and methods, and curating practice. Database search functions and terms in many audit institutions have been reviewed. Selections from the extensive positive feedback from 14 audit participants include the Government Art Collection: “The impact of GAC having been part of the original BAM project in 2016 is illustrated in several important and continuing strands of our work… Most significantly of all, the GAC's  [Representation of the People Project](https://artcollection.culture.gov.uk/whats-happening/representation-of-the-people-project-2018-28/), was established in 2018 \[creating\] a seismic shift that has, and is, influencing and informing all aspects of our work. It is a ten\-year commitment to challenge and review under\-representation in the Collection across identities related to age, disability, gender, race, sexuality, and socio\-economic background.” \[5.3.\] Citing the audit during the period after the death of George Floyd in the US and the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, curator and writer Aindrea Emelife \( *The Independent*, June 2020\) identified how “The place where real change begins is in the storage units. What museums have and acquire into their permanent collections matters because museum acquisitions form the canon of black art”. \[5.4.\] 

 As part of the dissemination and the development of the thinking generated by the project, and to enable comprehensive interrogation of the issues, the BAM team created a series of events including two international conferences, a UK\-based symposium, study days and exhibitions *.* \(Selected activities were video\-documented and are available on the UAL Decolonising Arts Institute YouTube channel.\) This activity included a specific event addressing the impact of *The Other Story*, which was to form the basis for content in the digital archive of Afterall \(UAL Reader, Lucy Steeds’ *Retelling “The Other Story”—or What Now?,* 2018\), and a dedicated microsite, supported at the outset by a Digital Project Grant from the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art \(2015–2016\) and, subsequently, by two awards from the Teaching and Learning Exchange at UAL \(2016 and 2017\). Association of Research Institutes in Art History \(ARIAH, 2017–2018\) funding enabled publication of the first essay on this site to analyse the exhibition. \[5.5.\] 

#  Workshops at a one\-day symposium \(Tate Britain, 2016\), *The Work Between Us: Black\-British Artists and Exhibition Histories*, addressed the issue of exhibition texts and labels presenting work by artists of colour through a prism of identity, race and ethnicity. The Public Collections Study Day \(MAG 2018\), the concluding event of the BAM project *,* engaged with curators of museum collections. Focused on the research that the BAM team had conducted on public collections and their curation, the day featured papers given by speakers including Dalal\-Clayton, Dibosa and Nasar. An international conference, ‘Conceptualism—Intersectional Readings, International Framings: Situating ‘Black Artists and Modernism’ in Europe’ \(7–9 December 2017\), in collaboration with Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, proposed and developed new understandings of Conceptualism produced by artists based in Europe after the political and social upheavals of 1968, focusing on Europe in order to highlight the specificities and limits of discourses on ‘Blackness’ and Conceptualism between neighbouring contexts. Co\-convened by lok, Orlando and Aikens, speakers included lok, Boyce, Dibosa. The revised conference papers were edited by the convenors as a 444\-page e\-publication \(Van Abbemuseum, 2019\). \[5.6.\] 

 A special issue of the *Journal of Art History*, presenting essays that examine a range of artists looked at during the BAM project, is due \(summer 2021\), edited by **Boyce** and Dorothy Price. A book on the BAM project is forthcoming \(Duke University Press\). Kenneth Montague, Tate trustee: ""This project is a long\-overdue, absolutely essential resource. For too long the importance of this work to the British arts scene has been overlooked. This initiative is about legacy, setting the record straight."" \[5.7.\] **Dalal\-Clayton**’s article, published by *The Double Negative*, ‘Developing more representative art collections could not be more urgent’ offers an overview and a continuing call for action, post\-BAM. \[5.8.\] **lok** secured the commissioning of a one\-hour BBC4 documentary, *Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain's Hidden Art History*, which followed the research activity and elaborated on what was uncovered, through interviews and by outlining the historical context. \(Presented by **Boyce** and Brenda Emmanus, and featuring **Dibosa**, **Goodwin** and **Nasar**, and Melanie Keen, Director, Iniva. First screened in July 2018: 160,000 viewers; 30,000 iPlayer views. Repeat screenings in July and September 2018: approximately 6,000 viewers.\) 

#  Boyce invited Nasar to curate the exhibition *Speech Acts: Reflection\-Imagination\-Repetition* \(2018–19, Manchester Art Gallery, funded by the Paul Mellon Centre. GBP9,462.99\) as a response to the BAM project. The exhibition juxtaposed works by canonical white British artists with those by artists of Asian and African heritage, rather than presenting a selection based on the heritage of the artists. *Speech Acts* inspired a series of workshops and conferences in collaboration with institutions including Contemporary Art Society and Iniva. ‘The LYC Museum & Art Gallery and the Museum as Practice’, a symposium organised by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art \(PMC\) and UAL, in collaboration with Manchester Art Gallery and the University of Manchester \(with conveners including Nasar and Afterall’s Steeds\), at Manchester Art Gallery \(6–7 March 2019\), considered the LYC Museum as an extension of artist Li Yuan\-chia’s \(1929–1994\) pioneering participatory art practice. The event examined wide\-ranging questions such as: How does the example of LYC sit within wider histories of the museum as artwork? What does the LYC Museum contribute to wider considerations of Participatory Art practices? What forms and methodologies allow art historical enquiries into friendships and sites? \(The practice of Li Yuan\-chia and the LYC Museum were brought into the public domain by the work of BAM, and through the television programme, ‘Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain's Hidden Art history'.\) From *Speech Acts*, a collaborative exhibition is scheduled at Kettle’s Yard, University of Cambridge, bringing the LYC Museum and Kettle’s Yard together in conversation \(2022–2023\). Nasar works with MAG as a consulting curator, advising on the re\-hang of its permanent collection, and is co\-curator of *British Art Show 9* \(with MAG as his nominee\)—one of Britain’s most significant exhibitions of contemporary art organised every five years by Hayward Gallery Touring. 

 Middlesborough Insitute of Modern Art’s \(MIMA\) *Why Are We Here?*, a year\-long collaboration with BAM, through which the collection was audited for all contributions by artists of African, Asian and Middle East and North Africa Region descent in the UK in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, revealed new narratives within the collection. Described as “a huge success for MIMA, prompting serious discussion about who and what should be collected for the public good” \[5.9.\],  the project ran from March 2019 to August 2020, with results of this research unveiled as they are uncovered, making new material available to the institution and its publics. 

 **Goodwin** worked with artist Hannah Collins to curate *We Will Walk—*Art and Resistance in the American South \(Turner Contemporary, 2020\), to reveal the little\-known history of African\-American ‘yard art’, shaped by the Civil Rights period in the 1950s and 1960s. At a time of widespread protest on the streets, *We Will Walk* was the first exhibition of its kind in the UK. A symposium, ‘Art, Roots and The Abstract Truth’ \(March 2020\) and an online discussion, ‘We Will Walk: Black Art, Radical Transformation’ \(July 2020\) unpacked the issues further. A virtual tour of the exhibition has had over 11,000 views on YouTube. **“**The exhibition … articulates Southern\-ness through the lens of a too\-often neglected corpus of African\-American artists. In a genre\-bursting and affecting assemblage of works, co\-curators Hannah Collins and Paul Goodwin have sought to explore how the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and ’60s shaped the work of these artists.” \[5.10.\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Open University research on participatory performative methodologies led to two projects, *Who Are We?* and *Picturing Climate*. These enabled stakeholders to explore societal issues including migration and climate change leading to impact in two primary areas, namely \(1\) impact on creativity, culture and society, and \(2\) impact on understanding, learning and participation. They also had impact in two secondary areas, \(3\) impact on public services, and \(4\) impact on social welfare. These impacts were international in reach and significance \(in UK, Cuba, and Bosnia and Herzegovina\) with beneficiaries that included: the general public; migrant, refugee and BAME communities, including artists; arts and cultural organizations; young people; and educators. This work has opened up prestigious cultural institutions such as Tate Modern to marginalised groups and has enabled communities to confront issues they had not considered before.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Isin’s** research extends traditional conceptions of citizenship as formal membership in a polity **\[O1\]**. **Czajka’s** research extends traditional conceptions of democracy as grounded in and enacted through mechanisms and institutions of the state **\[O2, O3\]**. As **Isin** and **Czajka** separately argue, citizenship and democracy can also be conceptualised through the lens of performativity. This understanding of citizenship and democracy as performative – that is, as practices and processes that are differently enacted and contested through a variety of public, political ‘performances’ – contributed to the conceptualisation of the arts, and particularly, participatory arts, as both a site and a tool through which citizenship and democracy are enacted and contested. **Isin** and **Czajka’s** research conceptualises citizenship and democracy as performative and draws attention to the often unconventional ‘performances’ of groups and individuals marginalised in mainstream political discourses. This makes visible and places centre\-stage the political practices, participation and contribution of groups including migrants, refugees, ethnic and religious minorities, and youth, among others. These innovative approaches to citizenship and democracy underpinned the understanding of participatory arts as a site of citizenship and democracy, providing the impetus for the *Who Are We?* and *Picturing Climate* projects as creative and innovative pathways to impact. They were instrumental to the conceptualisation of participatory arts methodologies as open, accessible, and affective modes of engagement on salient contemporary political issues. They also served as a point of departure for conceptualising participatory arts methodologies as an effective method for making visible the contributions of minorities \(particularly migrants, refugees and BAME communities, regardless of their formal, legal status\) to discourses and practices of citizenship and democracy. 

 The programmes, in turn: 

1.  promoted learning, understanding, participation and action on two of the most urgent and contested political issues of the day – migration \( *Who Are We?*\) and climate change \( *Picturing Climate*\) – through the media and methodologies of performative and participatory arts; 

1.  made visible the political engagement by non\-citizen, migrant, refugee, and other un\- or under\-represented minority groups on issues of migration, citizenship and democracy \( *Who Are We?*\). 

 By foregrounding the work of migrant and refugee artists, and ensuring the involvement and participation of migrant, refugee, BAME and other marginalized communities, *Who Are We?* was itself a critical, participatory performance of citizenship and democracy by groups and individuals often marginalised or ‘othered’ by mainstream political discourses and practices **\[O4\]**. Through the deployment of performative methodologies, *Picturing Climate* democratised understanding of and engagement with climate change by bringing it to the forefront of agendas of groups and communities who had not previously perceived it as a priority issue.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The *Who Are We?* Programme \(2017\-2019\) was hosted by Tate Exchange at Tate Modern, while *Picturing Climate* activities \(2019\) took place in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Jordan, with a final four\-day programme at Tate Exchange. These public engagement and knowledge exchange programmes served as pathways to the following significant international impacts. 

###  \(1\) Impact on creativity, culture and society 

 *Who are We?* was a centrepiece programme by which “ *Tate Exchange and Tate \[Modern\] opened its doors to artistic and cultural expression from marginalised and diverse migrant audiences*” **\[C1\]**, enabling migrant, refugee, and BAME artists of 17 nationalities to participate in Tate Exchange **\[C8\]**. As noted by Counterpoints Arts, “ *our partnership with OU academics was paramount to the delivery of the Tate Exchange programme*”, because “ *by bringing together the work of migrant and refugee artists with interdisciplinary academic research, it became feasible to see how citizenship as performance occurs through the prism of public installation*” **\[C8\]**. Engagement with OU academics “ *resulted in a shared and publicly beneficial approach at the Tate Exchange \[…\] reconciling the narratives of performed citizenship through civic engagement with the arts*” **\[C8\]**. As attested to by the Head of Tate Exchange, the programme “ *\[…\] \[laid\] the path that culminated in the Tania Bruguera Hyundai Turbine Hall commission and that continues as embedded in the activity at Tate Exchange*” **\[C1\]**. Collaborations between OU academics and participating artists also led to the co\-production of new artistic and cultural artefacts that were displayed both during the programme and online, **\[C5, C9\]**, attracting the largest audience of any Tate Exchange programme **\[C2\]**. 

 *Who Are We?* not only contributed to changes in the professional practice of the aforementioned cultural organizations, Tate Exchange and Counterpoints Arts, but also to changes in the professional practice of individual artists **\[C7\]**, generating new ways of thinking that continue to influence their practice. **Czajka’s** work with photographer Eva Sajovic on migrants and refugees significantly influenced the artist’s individual creative practice, helping Sajovic “ *to construct a sound theoretical framework*” by “ *clarifying a lens through which \[she\] considered \[her\] practice*” **\[C7\]**. The collaboration also helped Sajovic work through key ethical and political questions that emerged in her work, questions “ *that were so profound that they had the potential to stall \[her\] practice*” **\[C7\]**. By collaborating with **Czajka**, the photographer was subsequently able to exhibit some of her work at Media Nox Gallery in Slovenia and at The Migration Museum in London. Sajovic further testified that the collaboration with **Czajka** “ *challenged some of the established ways of looking at the problem of representation of the displaced*” and “ *shifted the way \[participants\] viewed the topic*” **\[C7\]**. 

 *Picturing Climate* likewise impacted the professional practice of international cultural institutions and artists. Samuel Riera, Cuban artist and director of Riera Studio, Havana, said Riera Studio’s participation “ *had a significant impact on our own practice*” **\[C10\]**. As a “ *direct result of Picturing Climate \[…\] we went on to develop a series of work titled Evolving Natura \[…\] \[which\] explore\[d\] the relationships between the natural and man\-made worlds*”, and which was subsequently exhibited at the Thomas Nickles Project in New York **\[C10\]**. Riera Studio had never previously linked environment, climate change, food security and livelihoods with performative and arts methodologies **\[C10\]**. As a result of *Picturing Climate*, their work now embeds environmental principles \(e.g. sourcing local, eco\-friendly materials\) and includes more projects and collaborations exploring environmental issues through art **\[C10\]**. Riera noted that *Picturing Climate* was a “ *pioneering project*” in Cuba, where climate change is not high on the agenda, and where creative and arts\-based methodologies are rarely used to engage publics on social or political issues **\[C6, C10\]**. 

###  \(2\) Impact on understanding, learning and participation 

 As part of *Who Are We?* **Czajka’s** collaboration with designer Nele Vos resulted in an interactive installation titled, *Citizenshop*, which explored the controversial issue of “ *citizenship by investment*”. The installation engaged a diverse audience in a dialogue on citizenship, enhancing public understanding of the different paths to the acquisition of citizenship **\[C2\]**. Visitors’ conceptualisations of citizenship were critically challenged, enabling them to “ *reimagin\[e\] the concept*”, with one commenting: “ *It was shocking though to see the reality of the double standards*” **\[C2\]**. **Czajka** and Vos then co\-produced an interactive, open\-access educational game, *Uneven Journeys*, which created an immersive, online experience enabling students to learn about and compare the journey an asylum seeker, an economic migrant and an investor might take to the UK **\[C3\]**. *Who Are We?* also generated other open\-access educational materials on the use of participatory arts in education on social and political issues **\[C3\]**. The resources were utilised by 819 unique visitors from across Europe and the UK **\[C4\]**. 

 In the first year, *Who Are We?* attracted 4,768 visitors. 18% of these visitors self\-identified as BAME and 38% were under the age of 25, as compared with 15% and 27% respectively for the Tate Modern in general, contributing to the diversification of Tate Modern audiences **\[C8\]**. The programme also generated significant media interest, and was featured in *Arts Industry*, *The Big Issue*, *Southwark News* and *Frugl*, which, in turn, contributed to generating a more diverse audience for the programme and to widening impact beyond the directly participating audience **\[C2\]**. In its second year, *Who Are We?* expanded beyond Tate Modern and London to include underrepresented artists and communities in the north of England and the nations, “ *challeng\[ing\] the dominance and centricity of the capital in terms of funding and opportunity*”, and making it possible for “ *smaller, more locally based arts organisations and migrant artists to contribute to a process of mutual learning*” **\[C9\]**. Over its three years, the project also attracted a number of student groups who, according to one teacher, came away from the programme with “ *a new energy and interest around language learning which they did not have before*” **\[C5\]**. *Picturing Climate* attracted over 2,200 visitors, including a number of diverse student groups and young people, some of whom visited the programme as part of their school curriculum **\[C6\]**. 

###  \(3\) Impact on public services 

 *Picturing Climate*, using performative methodologies to explore the links between the environment and post\-conflict societies and economies, was described as novel and innovative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and had a significant impact on the learning of local artists and educators involved **\[C6\]**. They had been skeptical about exploring ‘soft’ issues like climate change in the context of a post\-conflict society, where much ‘harder’ political issues were at stake. They were surprised to learn how much environmental degradation there was in Bosnia, how closely tied it was to corruption and other political issues in post\-conflict environments, and how useful performative and arts methodologies were for exploring these issues with young people **\[C6\]**. 

 Climate change is not part of school curricula in either Cuba or Bosnia, and arts methodologies are largely absent, as rote learning is still the norm. *Picturing Climate* generated interest in including both environmental issues and creative methodologies in school curricula **\[C6, C10\]**. As noted by Riera Studio, following *Picturing Climate*, teachers and parents in schools in Havana were asking for similar programmes, with Riera Studio taking on a role in their delivery, and in training local teachers on how to deliver them **\[C6, C10\]**. Statements from teachers and a local government official in Bosnia suggest that the project has helped them to see how these issues and methodologies could be incorporated into the local curriculum and that changes would be made as a result **\[C6\]**. 

###  \(4\) Impact on social welfare 

 *Who Are We?* opened up access to Tate Modern, enabling refugees and other migrant and minority communities \(including artists\) to feel more included and better integrated into UK cultural institutions and spaces from which they previously felt excluded **\[C5, C8\]**. One artist noted, “ *A lot of the women…are quite marginalised and they are quite amazed at how their work has been valued and celebrated \[...\] and that's very, very, important*” **\[C5\]**. This impact has been multiplied by the prestige and reach of Tate Modern as a cultural institution, and the influence the programme had on Tate Exchange “ *open\[ing\] its doors to artistic and cultural expression from marginalised and diverse migrant audiences*” **\[C1\]**. 

 Other migrant, refugee and BAME visitors described as “healing” and “ *empowering*” hearing their languages, stories and experiences reflected at Tate Modern **\[C5, C8\]**. As one visitor described, “ *to hear my language \[…\] it makes me feel a lot more connected to everything that is going on*” **\[C5\]**. Another said, "" *It almost pushes me to cry \[…\] because for so many years what has been happening to the Kurdish people in Turkey has not had any space in the mainstream media \[...\]. You can’t underestimate the importance of an exhibition like this at the Tate Modern*” **\[C5\]**. 

 *Who Are We?* also enhanced public understanding of the experiences of marginalised groups, particularly refugees. Visitor feedback and evaluations indicated an enhanced or changed understanding of the experiences of migrants and refugees and, in at least one case, a visitor was inspired to volunteer at a refugee support organization, having gained a much clearer understanding of the experiences of migrants and refugees **\[C2, C5\]**.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research was conducted with £456,610 funding won from UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(DSTL\) as part of its “Research and Development into Persistent Surveillance” competition \(3.2\) and was published in 2020 \(3.1\). The objective was to design a high\-resolution imaging camera for deployment on HAPS aircraft. 

 Prototype HAPS aircraft \(flown only since 2010\) are powered exclusively by solar cells, have an operating altitude of \~20 km, and are designed to have mission durations of significantly greater than one month. The Airbus Zephyr aircraft, from which the instrument design requirements were derived, has a wingspan of 25 m and weighs less than 75 kg. 

 Because this technology is new, the platform development is significantly ahead of the development of suitable payloads. This research is the first published record of the design and manufacturing development of HAPS optical instrumentation. The design team consisted of the authors identified in the cited paper \(3.1\). During the research, all authors were employees of Glyndŵr University or contracted to the project. 

 The research was done in two design and build phases: November 2015 to March 2016 \(Phase 1\) and May 2016 to August 2017 \(Phase 2\). In Phase 1, a prototype was designed and manufactured using commercial off\-the\-shelf and 3D\-printed components to demonstrate the feasibility of meeting the SWaP \(Space Weight and Power\) requirements. In Phase 2, the optical design was developed to meet SWaP and optical performance requirements, detailed analysis was undertaken to assure thermal performance, and two bespoke prototypes were manufactured and tested. 

 The underpinning research centred on two areas: 

 **Development of a design methodology for optical instrumentation for HAPS aircraft** 

 The challenge was to design an optical instrument able to operate at its specified performance within a temperature range from \+30 Celsius \(pre\-flight calibration\) to \-40 Celsius \(operating altitude\). This required careful selection of both optical and structural materials to meet the environmental requirements in terms of structural behaviour and survival. To achieve the required athermal optical performance, the thermal expansion of all structural components were critically matched with that of the optical components. The design made heavy use of finite elements analysis and experimental performance assessment. The result was the use of a single glass type for all optical components and a diverse set of structural materials, including several metal alloys, carbon fibre composites and plastics. Environmental testing indicated the optical system to be capable of diffraction limited performance throughout its specified temperature range. 

 **Development of manufacturing methods for ultra\-light optical instrumentation** 

 To manufacture ultra\-light optical instrumentation for HAPS requires lightweight optical and structural components whilst ensuring the structural integrity over the expected environmental and shock loading. 

 To achieve optimum optical/weight performance, a mirror\-based design was chosen with an aperture of 150 mm diameter. The primary mirror is highly lightweighted \(65% material removal\) to minimise mass. The opto\-mechanical mounting was designed in conjunction with the lightweighting pattern to ensure optical performance is not degraded. The opto\-mechanical design is able to maintain its structural and optical performance. Glyndŵr Innovations Limited \(GIL\) is one of only four organisations in the UK able to perform this kind of optical fabrication. 

 The structural design of the instrument required the use of a diverse set of materials \(above\) to match the thermal behaviour of the optics. Interfaces between these materials included bolted and bonded interfaces. All interfaces required design and analysis to ensure the structural performance met the optical performance goals over the full range of specified environmental conditions. Bonded interfaces required extensive environmental testing to ensure structural failure did not occur at low temperatures.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Development of a Sovereign Capability for the Supply of Optical Instrumentation for HAPS and Persistent Surveillance Applications** 

 The objective of the DSTL/CDE competition on “Persistent surveillance from the air” was to develop sensor and communications packages that can be deployed on HAPS, and to produce solutions that are compatible with other airborne platforms and systems to improve export potential \(other airborne platforms include larger high\-altitude long endurance, HALE; medium\-altitude long\-endurance, MALE, vehicles\). This has not been done before. 

 **Technological and Economic Outcomes** 

1.  In successfully delivering the Phase 1 and Phase 2 \(November 2015 to August 2017\) prototype products for this competition, Glyndŵr University has established a UK sovereign capability in the design and manufacture of optical instrumentation for high\-altitude airborne persistent surveillance. This novel design and manufacture has led to sustained industry collaborations across Wales and internationally via commercial interest and investment in the new technology, stimulating economic growth for Wales and further collaborations for the University \( **sources 1, 3a, 4b**\). 

 This new capability in the UK led Ordnance Survey \(OS\) to engage with GIL in 2016 to develop prototype remote sensing instrumentation for deployment on the Astigan HAPS platform. As a result, GIL delivered two Phase 1 prototype systems to OS for environmental and flight testing \( **source 2**.\). 

1.  This sovereign capability has enabled a collaboration with QintetiQ Limited to develop a LIDAR system for the Zephyr HAPS platform \(from October 2018\). The LIDAR system is for military and commercial use. The contract award is from UK DSC \(Defence Solution Centre\) to QinetiQ and has a value of £2.25 M, including investment from other partners. QinetiQ is investing a further sum to bring the total value of the programme to £5 M. GIL is contracted to design and build the geometrical optics of this LIDAR system \( **sources 3a, 3b, 3c**\). 

 There is substantial market pull for this technology. QinetiQ is active in pre\-sale marketing for this product but is unable to provide a specific market value at this stage. What is clear is that “free space optical communications continues emerging as a key capability within the military and commercially, and is a multi\-million pound market area within the UK and beyond. However it is unclear how much of a role HAPS will play in future architecture yet, partly because key stakeholders are waiting to see how the critical technology performs/matures” \( **source 3c**\). 

1.  Airbus Defence and Space, UK, commented that they have responded to this capability “…by engaging GIL in a research programme to design, manufacture and system test a hyperspectral spectrometer intended for airborne and space borne deployment. The objective of the programme is to establish this capability within the UK and to develop a roadmap to deployment of this technology on airborne and space borne platforms. This research is being funded through Airbus Endeavr, a joint funding venture between Welsh Assembly Government and Airbus. The value of this investment to the Airbus\-led collaboration is approximately £750K” \( **sources 4a, 4b**\). 

 They further state that “Missions utilising airborne and space borne hyperspectral payloads are of specific interest to Airbus. Market research conducted by Airbus and funded by this programme estimates the value of the global market for airborne and space borne missions with hyperspectral payloads to have an anticipated value of £1Bn by 2027. In addition, the global market for the products of these hyperspectral missions is anticipated to increase from $220M in 2020 to $307M by 2026” \( **source 4b**\). 

1.  The work has led to communications with Airbus Endeavr from October 2018, a joint initiative between Airbus and Welsh Government to support innovation in Wales. It is committed to the research and development of technologies in the areas of Digital Economy, Low Carbon Economy and Advanced Engineering and Manufacturing. Airbus Endeavr looks upon the development of this capability within Wales as an opportunity to establish an important supply chain within the Welsh photonics community. The potential value of this supply chain to Wales is estimated to be £12M by 2025 and has the potential to attract additional R&D funding to the region from ESA \(European Space Agency\) and other international agencies \( **source 5**\). 

1.  From February 2018 Archangel Lightworks Limited has sought assistance from GIL with the design and manufacture of the fore optics to an airborne optical communications system operating within a similar environment to HAPS. The optical aperture is twice that of the underpinning research, but the design of the optical system is a direct design descendant of the DSTL/CDE Phase 2 instrument design. This forms part of an ESA\-funded demonstrator system for high bandwidth ground\-to\-space communication. The programme led by Archangel Lightworks has a projected global market value of approximately £1.5 Bn for Earth Observation data download. Other potential markets for this technology are quantum security \(approximately $32.5 Bn by 2028\), airborne broadband and hybrid telecommunications constellations \(>$130 Bn by 2028\), and military use \( **source 6**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, affecting >2,000,000 women globally each year. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with around 1,300,000 new cases globally each year. Cambridge University researchers led the development of the ‘PREDICT’ platforms. These are free\-of\-charge online tools which facilitate informed treatment decision making for clinicians and their patients with breast or prostate cancer. PREDICT Breast has had over 1,250,000 visits since 2014, including 330,000 in the UK and hundreds of thousands across North America, Europe, Australasia and South America. It is approved for clinical decision\-making by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \(NICE\). It is estimated that PREDICT Breast led to 7,500 NHS patients being offered chemotherapy who would otherwise have not received it and, conversely, 11,000 women being appropriately spared unnecessary chemotherapy. Modelled on PREDICT Breast, PREDICT Prostate launched in 2019 has received 19,000 visits from the UK alone. 35% of men using this NICE endorsed decision\-making tool opt against unnecessary radical treatment, producing potential savings to the NHS of GBP46,000,000.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease. Following diagnosis, cancer patients and their physicians together make an informed decision about which treatment options will provide the greatest chance of extending or increasing the quality of life. This dialogue often occurs in a variety of clinical settings, from primary to tertiary care, and should consider the benefits and harm of treatment for the individual patient. Prior to 2010, there were very few tools freely or widely available to facilitate this decision\-making process. 

 Development of evidence\-based decision\-making tools to inform cancer treatment 

 Breast cancer–the commonest cancer in woman–affects more than 2,000,000 women across the world each year \(World Cancer Research Fund statistics\). Those with early breast cancer are faced with the difficult decision of whether to have chemotherapy, in addition to surgery, to increase their chance of cure. In 2010, Cambridge University researchers developed PREDICT Breast 1.0 to help inform treatment decisions for patients with early breast cancer \[1\]. This model deployed survival\-time data on 5,700 women with early breast cancer treated between 1999 and 2003 \[1\] and was validated using two independent data sets of over 8,000 women from the west Midlands and Canada \[2\]. The overall predictive accuracy of PREDICT Breast 1.0, particularly its ability to predict the value of chemotherapy in the context of other key variables, was confirmed in multiple independent case series. However, the model proved less accurate at predicting mortality risk in women aged <40 years \[Wong et al, 2015\]. Therefore, in 2017 PREDICT Breast 2.0 was developed to address this issue and is currently hosted by Public Health England as a free online tool \( [www.predict.nhs.uk](http://www.predict.nhs.uk/)\). Extensive collaboration was undertaken with the Cambridge Winton Centre for Risk & Evidence Communication to ensure effective communication of the model data.  PREDICT Breast 2.0 has subsequently been validated by several other research groups using multiple independent data sets \(Mokbel et al 2017; van Maaren et al 2017; Wu et al 2017; Gray et al 2018\). 

 Prostate cancer accounts for 26% of all new cancer cases in males in the UK \(Cancer Research UK statistics: 2017\). This incidence is increasing as the mean age of the population increases and screening becomes more widespread. Cambridge University\-led research has shown that >84% of UK men with prostate cancer have non\-metastatic disease at diagnosis \[3\]. Immediate radical therapy for many of these patients carries a high risk of severe adverse effects, including incontinence, impotence and bowel dysfunction, while providing little therapeutic benefit \[4\]. Therefore, building on the success of PREDICT Breast 2.0, between 2016 and 2019 Cambridge University researchers developed PREDICT Prostate – using data from >12,000 prostate cancer patients in two international cohorts – as the first online resource for individualised treatment decision making in the management of non\-metastatic prostate cancer \[5\]. This model estimated 10 and 15\-year survival outcomes for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and was shown to outperform all other available international risk\-stratification models \(p<0.001\) \[5\]. A validation study involving >69,000 men showed that PREDICT Prostate was more effective at predicting outcome and the need for treatment compared with all other risk\-models \[6\]. PREDICT Prostate provides patients with estimated survival rates after treatment in the context of absolute mortality rate, i.e. the risk of death from prostate cancer alongside the absolute risk of dying, allowing the patient to make an informed decision as to the value of treatment and its potential side effects. Since March 2019 the model has been hosted by Public Health England as a free online tool \( [https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk](https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk/)\) **for men with non\-metastatic disease, where both conservative management and radical treatment options are being considered.**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impact on clinical practice 

 **Incorporation** **into UK guidelines:** 

-  In 2018, PREDICT Breast became the only tool recommended by UK NICE for planning the use of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and the management of early and locally advanced disease \(Guideline NG101\): *“Use the PREDICT tool to estimate prognosis and the absolute benefits of adjuvant therapy for women with invasive breast cancer*” \[A\]. 

-  NICE also recommend the use of PREDICT Breast for all patients with early breast cancer prior to other advanced molecular profiling \(Guideline NG34, 2018\) \[A\]. 

-  PREDICT Breast is also endorsed by the Breast Cancer Clinical Expert Group \[A\]. 

-  In 2019, NICE endorsed PREDICT Prostate as a resource to support decision making in the management of prostate cancer \(Guideline NG131\) \[B\]. 

-  The East of England Cancer Alliance \(EOECA\) also proposed PREDICT Prostate for clinical consideration in the Best Practice Prostate Pathway ‘ *...to provide a standardised personalised tool to help men make decisions via the MDT and clinic*’. 

-  Both PREDICT Breast and PREDICT Prostate are suggested by Cancer Research UK \(CRUK\) as tools to help patients make treatment decisions \[A, B\]. 

 **Incorporation into international guidelines:** In 2016, the American Joint Committee on Cancer \(AJCC\) established 13 criteria against which any new prognostic model should be evaluated before use in the clinical setting. PREDICT Breast was the only model to pass all criteria. It has since been officially endorsed in the 2018 edition of the AJCC: Cancer Staging manual *: “Thirty prognostication tools for breast cancer were identified and reviewed against a checklist derived from the PMC guidelines. Only two tools, Adjuvant\! Online* \[no longer available\] *and PREDICTv1.2 \(incorporation of HER2 into PREDICT, also known as PREDICT\-Plus\) were found to have met all predefined AJCC inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria”* \[C\]. 

 Impact on patient health and wellbeing 

 Breast cancer affects >2,000,000 women globally each year, while around 1,300,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed globally each year. PREDICT Breast and PREDICT Prostate are both provided as free online tools by Public Health England \( [https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/](https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/) and  [https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk](https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk/)\) to help cancer patients and physicians across the world make an informed decision about treatment options. Since 2014, PREDICT Breast received over 1,250,000 visits across the UK, North America, Europe, Australasia and South America \[D\]. Between its launch in March 2019 and November 2020, the PREDICT Prostate tool has been visited 28,000 times by 19,000 independent users from over 110 countries, and as of November 2020, it is averaging 250 visits a month with 51.5% as new users \[D\]. 

 In the breast units of most UK hospitals, PREDICT Breast has, as recommended by NICE guidelines \[A\], been adopted as the clinical management decision tool of choice; as of 2018, according to NICE, ‘ *most healthcare professionals \[…\] use the PREDICT \[Breast\] tool*’ \[E\]. The effectiveness and user\-friendly nature of the PREDICT Breast online tool is evidenced by qualitative user feedback from oncologists, such as that provided by clinicians to the Cambridge Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication \[E\], for example: 

-  “*I like the different ways of presenting the data to patients and the addition of the risk of death from causes other than breast cancer which provides a context for discussion*.” 

-  “*We use PREDICT tool often in clinic and find it very helpful in order to help patients understand and make informed decisions about their adjuvant treatment. Thank you\!*” 

 Patients have also provided feedback on PREDICT Breast \[E\]: 

-  24th Feb 2020: “ *Thank you, you have made my decision easier.*” 

-  23rd January 2019: “ *Hello. Thank you for this wonderful online tool for woman such as myself. By the way, I reside in Bangkok, Thailand*.” 

  

 Similarly, PREDICT Prostate has received positive user feedback from UK based Consultant Urologists and Prostate Cancer International, a cancer support website \[E\]: 

-  “*Predict is simply brilliant, Using it on my iPad with patients on a daily basis. Well done for producing such a great patient aid* “– JA, Stevenage, May 2019. 

-  “ *I use it and it’s a fantastic tool to guide discussions and help reassure patients\!*” \-HY, Kent, July 2020. 

-  “*Men ask me all the time, What is my risk for ED / incontinence / bowel dysfunction. My answer now will be that, ""That's impossible to project accurately on an individualized basis, but the PREDICT Prostate system can give you a decent estimate of that risk at 3 years post\-diagnosis"". I live in the very real world of ""What do you think I should I do?"" You've just made answering that question a lot easier for tens of thousands of men every year\!*” – Prostate Cancer International website **,** April 2019. 

 **Impact on treatment planning:** A clinical review of 200 patients managed by the Cambridge Breast Unit Multidisciplinary Team found 7.5% of breast cancer patients who would have been classified as low risk and not offered chemotherapy, were classified as high risk by PREDICT Breast and offered chemotherapy. Conversely, 11% of patients who would have been classified as high risk and offered chemotherapy, were reclassified as low risk and spared chemotherapy \[F\].  A conservative estimate – based on PREDICT Breast being the only tool recommended for adjuvant therapy planning by NICE and the number of online recorded visits to the website – is PREDICT Breast was used for at least 25% \(100,000\) of 400,000 new UK breast cancer cases recorded between 2013 and 2020. Extrapolation suggests that in the UK since 2013, PREDICT Breast will have resulted in \~7,500 women being offered chemotherapy who would otherwise not have been, and \~11,000 women being spared unnecessary chemotherapy. 

 A significant impact of PREDICT Prostate on treatment planning was shown also in a study of \~200 doctors and specialist nurses. This revealed PREDICT Prostate led to a \~60% reduction in the likelihood of recommending radical treatment to patients, with 80% of clinicians stating PREDICT Prostate is a useful clinical tool \[G\]. 

 The PREDICT Prostate patient impact study \(2018\-2020\) further demonstrated benefit to patients. This study involved 156 patients across eight UK centres, randomised to either standard of care \(SOC\) information \(n=75\), or SOC and the PREDICT Prostate web\-tool \(n=81\). Mean decisional conflict scores \(a measure of perception of uncertainty in choosing options\) were 21.5 and 15.9 in the SOC and PREDICT Prostate groups respectively, representing a 26% reduction \(p=0.01\). Anxiety was not increased in the PREDICT arm. In total, 58% of men reported PREDICT Prostate estimates for prostate cancer specific mortality were lower than expected and 35% were less likely to select radical treatment. Over 90% of patients in the PREDICT Prostate group found it useful and would recommend it to others \[H\]. 

 Impact on the economy 

 **Cost savings due to reduction in overtreatment of cancer:** Overtreatment of cancer incurs unnecessary costs for the NHS, principally through avoidable treatment expenses and the management of any side effects. As detailed above, it is estimated that PREDICT Breast has resulted in \~7,500 more women with breast cancer in the UK being offered chemotherapy, and \~11,000 women being spared unnecessary treatment, with associated cost savings to the NHS relating to the cost of adjuvant chemotherapy for 4,500 women. 

 Overtreatment of prostate cancer can result in significant costs for unnecessary therapy \(e.g. prostatectomy costs \~GBP7,000 \[2020/21 NHS National Tariff Payment System\]\) and side effect management \(e.g. incontinence, erectile failure, bowel dysfunction\) without any clear benefit to patient survival. Data from the National Prostate Cancer Audit shows that 4\-8% of men with low\-risk disease and 30\-40% of men with intermediate risk disease for whom use of PREDICT Prostate would be suitable, are receiving potentially unnecessary radical therapy every year \[G\].  Based on 19,000 UK visitors to PREDICT Prostate since 2019 \[A, H\], and on the figures from the PREDICT Prostate Study \[G\] in which 35% \(approximately 6,600\) decided not to proceed with radical treatment, such as prostatectomy, this would equate to NHS savings of approximately GBP46,000,000 per year. 

 **Licensing of PREDICT algorithm: the PREDICT Breast algorithm has been licensed to Portable Medical Technologies and is incorporated into their OncoAssist app. The PREDICT algorithm has been licensed by Cambridge Enterprise to Portable Medical Technologies \(whose clients include Microsoft, AMGEN, Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and The Clatterbridge NHS Cancer Centre\) and it is incorporated into their OncoAssist app.  **\[text removed for publication\]** \[I\]. In March 2020 PREDICT Breast and PREDICT Prostate were approved as medical devices under EU Directive 93/42/EEC allowing for rollout and use in clinical settings across Europe \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into Virtual Environments and Training Applications \(VETA\) created state\-of\-the\-art commercial tools for **radiotherapy** and **emergency service training**.  [VERT](https://www.vertual.co.uk/products/vert/) is a system for advanced radiotherapy training commercially offered by  [Vertual Ltd](https://www.vertual.co.uk/), a University spinout. Vertual occupies a global monopoly with 35 systems in UK hospitals and 154 systems worldwide, providing cost\-effective superior training on safe treatment methods and equipment calibration.  [LIMA \(Large Incident Multiple Agency\)](https://lampada.co/company_products/lima/) and  [VIC \(Virtual Incident Command\)](https://lampada.co/company_products/virtual-incident-commander/) are virtual environments that allow training through distributed simulation of major regional incidents.  [Lampada Ltd](https://lampada.co/) is a University\-owned company currently offering LIMA, VIC **,** and related products to a third of UK Fire Services. These systems allow realistic training and preparation for rare incidents off\-line, and without disruption to service provision. The impact of VETA is economic, via revenues and jobs, and social, via improvement of public services.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since 2001, the University of Hull \(UoH\) nurtured a vibrant research environment in the area of virtual and augmented reality, which has yielded a stream of innovative research applications with impact. The VETA case study reports on upscaling of research and impact first reported in the  [Vertual impact case study](https://impact.ref.ac.uk/casestudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=27478) of REF2014 and its expansion to other application areas. UoH’s research environment includes the Virtual and Augmented Reality and Simulation \( [VARS](https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/research/groups/virtual-augmented-reality-and-simulation)\) research group, and the Hull Immersive Visualisation centre \( [HIVE](https://www.hull.ac.uk/faculties/subjects/features/computer-science-facilities)\). Applied research in these two centres underpinned commercial applications that employ virtual environments and simulation for training professionals. Two areas were targeted: medical radiotherapy training \(section 2.1\) and emergency service personnel training for disaster management \(section 2.2\). 

 **2.1. Virtual training for radiation therapy and calibration** 

 The research underpinning the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training \(VERT\) started in 2006 in a collaboration between HIVE and the Medical Physics Department at the Health Education Yorkshire and Humber NHS Trust. The researchers involved were Roger Phillips, Andy Beavis and James Ward, the latter two are currently the CSO and CTO of Vertual Ltd \- the spin out commercialising the application \[e2\]. The objective of this research was to investigate innovative and beneficial applications of immersive environment technologies in radiotherapy treatment of cancer, in terms of dose, beams, anatomy, equipment and potential variations from planning to review of radiotherapy treatments. First results were published in 2007 \[1\] describing the development and evaluation of a basic training system for radiotherapy treatment machines. This was followed by significant awards of research grants and the publication of results on dosimetry enabling more advanced features \[2\]. The concept has since been enriched and VERT today provides detailed, realistic simulations of linear accelerator \(LINAC\) treatment machines from major manufacturers Varian, Elekta and Siemens. A LINAC is the device commonly used for external beam radiation treatments for patients with cancer. It delivers high\-energy x\-rays or electrons to the region of a tumour. Treatments are designed in such a way that they destroy the cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. Treatments using these machines must be done carefully for safety and effectiveness, and equipment must be calibrated accordingly. Typically, a radiation oncologist prescribes volume and dosage while a medical physicist and a dosimetrist determine how to deliver the dose and calculate the amount of time it will take the accelerator to deliver that dose. A radiation therapist then operates the LINAC and gives patients their daily treatments. In VERT, these processes are simulated in fine detail; for instance, authentic hand controls have been interfaced to control the LINAC, enabling trainees to develop psychomotor skills. Simulation extends to calibration and quality assurance processes. 

 From 2014 onwards, research focused on life\-sized virtual simulation of the treatment room with all its equipment, controls, a simulated patient and different radiation types. The branching out into different radiation therapies is significant, because such in situ training requires vastly different facilities, an issue not encountered for virtual training. This process of research\-led functionality continues, with the latest research on high precision implicit modelling from the Hull team \[3\] further strengthening the VR training software’s volumetric rendering capability. In a recent grant by the Welcome Grant \[4\], Xinhui Ma has advanced image analysis on CT and MRI datasets, a corner stone of VERT, as well as stereo photogrammetry images for the identification of homologous landmarks in soft tissue. The visualisation functionality within VERT also continues to advance drawing upon Qingde Li’s work on advanced segmentation and modelling. VERT provides visualizations that go beyond what the trainee would see in the actual treatment room. For example, the patient can be rendered transparent to reveal the location of suitably segmented tumour and neighbouring organs. Similarly, the normally invisible radiation beam can be made visible, to better understand its spatial relationship to other structures for planning and dose assessment. Overall, this type of virtual radiotherapy training which is continuously advancing through this research optimises the effectiveness of treatment whilst minimising the risk to patients and to very expensive equipment. 

 **2.2. Virtual emergency service training and disaster management** 

 Since 2014, VARS, HIVE and the Dependable Intelligent Systems \( [DEIS](https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/research/groups/dependable-intelligent-systems)\) research groups worked together with Humberside Fire and Rescue Service \(FRS\) to create the management of Large Incident Multiple Agency \(LIMA\) and Virtual Incident Command \(VIC\) \- two applications for training professionals in emergency services. VARS offered research expertise on Virtual Environments and gamification, while DEIS expertise on dependability of systems including that of communication protocols. LIMA is a now a software system that supports UK guidelines for *Control of Major Accident Hazards* regulatory multi agency training events through the simulation of regional incidents with application to the fire service. VIC is a virtual environment for the training and assessment of incident commanders in some of the most risk critical parts of the emergency services. The underpinning research of these two systems is partly founded on VERT technology for virtualisation, but also includes research on gamification specifically on creating useful interactive simulations of major disaster events that by their nature are too infrequent and complex to effectively train for \[5\]. 

 LIMA and VIC are distributed and communicate through networks providing multi\-nodal solutions for distributed training where firefighters are able to risk\-assess premises and disseminate the information to the command centre and vice versa, which in turn enables realistic and effective training. To this end, VIC and LIMA connect to other safety critical products within the  [Intelligent Response](https://lampada.co/companies/intelligent-response/) suite offered by Lampada; they include Command and Control \( [C&C](https://lampada.co/company_products/command-and-control/)\), Web Risk Management \( [WRM](https://lampada.co/company_products/risk-management/)\), and Technical Fire Safety \( [TFS](https://lampada.co/company_products/tfs/)\). These products can be used in the context of virtual training but also for real management of actual emergencies. They offer functionality for real\-time data collection and dissemination of risk assessments from multiple sites to support the critical tasks of tracking, mobilising and controlling all fire safety appliances and assets from headquarters during emergency operations. WRM, for example, communicates real\-time information about the risk faced by firefighters as they visit the site of an incident, for example any flammable exterior cladding on a building, like that in the Grenfell Tower disaster \[e1, e10\]. LIMA, VIC and Intelligent Response use a robust, resilient, domain specific communications protocol, an early version of which was developed and verified via HiP\-HOPS, simulation and model\-checking in the University of Hull \[6\]. The research that led to this continuous stream of impactful state\-of\-the\-art commercial systems integrates components that span from Virtual Environments through Digital Learning to Dependable Computing. We list six indicative papers and grants.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impacts primary occurred though the commercialisation of two university spinouts: Vertual Ltd \[e2\], and Lampada Digital Solutions \[e3\]. Significant impacts were achieved in two areas: **medical services** via improved radiotherapy training \(section 4.1\) **emergency services** via improved training and management of major disasters \(section 4.2\). The impacts are economic through creation of revenues and jobs, and social, through improvement of critical medical and emergency services. Virtual training incorporates digital learning; thus in section 4.3, we discuss developments in connecting VR with digital learning at Hull. 

 **4.1.** **Impact on medical services via radiotherapy training** 

 **Vertual** has effectively **a global monopoly** on VR radiation training, as the only provider of this type of VR training. The beneficial impact is evidenced by the adoption of VERT’s multi\-award\-winning system throughout the UK. There are currently **VERT systems** at **12 Universities** and over **35 radiotherapy teaching hospitals** in the **UK;** effectively covering all radiotherapy trainees in England. There are **154 VERT systems** installed across **33 countries** covering all continents. In comparison, in REF2014, we reported 92 installation in 16 countries. For an interactive map of installations and a list of users see \[e6\]. The company employs a network of **28 distributors** globally \[e1\]. The expansion is clear and success is due to VERT offering a safe and effective training environment that reduces training costs, increases capacity, provides more effective training and ultimately improves patient safety \(see **client testimonials** in \[e1\]\). 

 The above is translated to economic success. Since the last REF, the gross profit of Vertual grew to **£1.64M with £2.88M annual turnover in 2019** \[e1\]. In comparison, in REF2014, we reported a total 3\-year gross profit of £965k and £2M turnover. The company employs **20 people with an average salary of £36k** including eight full\-time software developers and four radiotherapy product specialists. In comparison, in REF2014, we reported 10 staff with an average salary of £30k. This is significant, as the company is based in the Humber region where traditional industrial employment is declining, creating a backdrop of higher unemployment and lower salaries. Furthermore, the economic knock\-on effects observed on an emerging supply chain are considerable. For example, within the UK, **Vertual Ltd partners** that supply hardware and services for VR systems reported over **£825k annual hardware sales in** the year ending **2019**, including installation and support services \[e1\]. In comparison, in REF2014 we reported annual benefits of £400K. 

 Vertual has grown substantially as the scope of VERT has grown with research that has led to more advanced features, and as radiotherapy professionals have identified innovative applications beyond its initial scope. Vertual has now expanded its activities to graduate and postgraduate RT training, continuing professional development, anatomy training, skills assessment, patient awareness, nurse training, staff training and research. Several nationally funded training programmes, including the UK, Australian and New Zealand health authorities all have adopted VERT systems for training purposes. The first six Australian installations were funded by the Department of Health and Ageing in Australia \[e4\]. The New Zealand government provided $1m in funding for VERT \[e5\]. 

 Vertual nurtures a community of professionals in the area of VR training. It provides financial support for research and educational projects, regularly sponsors student graduation awards and prizes in the UK, US and Canada, and funds attendance at conferences \[e1\]. Finally, there is now a vibrant **VERT user community** \[e7\], which continues to actively conduct and publish research and studies evaluating VERT, expanding its scope and application, and sharing best practice. The beneficiaries are users of VERT and professional in the area, evidenced by the strongly attended VERT User Meetings including a meeting for German speaking users held in Austria Wien University \(December 2019\), the VERT Int’l User Meeting 2019 held at Inholland University in Delft \(March 2019\) and VERT UK Users’ Research Meeting \(November 2018\-20\). An annual user meeting is held in the USA, to cater for the increasing number of US users \(39 VERT installations in the USA and Canada and growing\). 

 **4.2. Impact on emergency services** 

 Traditional training on responses of emergency services to incidents is essential but costly, especially for the larger scale events, which involve a great number of actors, and can cause a significant disruption to service provision. Our collaboration with Humberside FRS in this area goes back to 2004 when in the context of SEED, a European Development Fund project, we first started to investigate the problem. VIC and LIMA software applications were developed in the period with input from Humberside and North Staffordshire FRS precisely to address these requirements and training needs. A related suite of products called Intelligent Response with connectivity to LIMA and VIC also resulted from collaboration with Humberside FRS. Intelligent response includes applications C&C, WRM and TFS that can used beyond training for management of actual emergencies \[e10\]. 

 The input of the two FRS in the design of VIC and LIMA made the environments realistic and applicable for training purposes. The Operations director at HFR Solutions states:  “ *LIMA offers Incident Management Teams a professional platform to replicate realistic site incidents with clear visual perspective on the ensuing incident, actions required and the impact of these actions on the incident, both on and off\-site. **This training and incident management software transforms how we test the tactical & strategic management teams**, to effectively resolve emergency incidents. It has **enhanced the learning experience of our delegates and provides positive engagement at all levels** with fantastic feedback throughout our training courses*.” \[e9\] 

 Lampada, a University\-owned company, is commercialising LIMA, VIC and intelligent Response. Lampada is fast growing and now supplies software and services to a third of UK’s FRS \[e3\]. Clients of Lampada include Humberside, Cleveland, Norfolk, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, East Midlands, Hertfordshire, Hereford and Worcester FRS, and the list grows. Clients also include commercial suppliers of services to FRSs including Telent Ltd, a specialist company leading mission critical communications technology, and HFR Solutions, a company transferring FRS experience to the private sector. This client base has grown fast because users experience and report improved training at lower costs, improved operational capacity and ultimately improved quality of emergency service provision. Lampada’s income is generated both from the sale of licences and specific project work related to applications \[e8\]. Since its inception in 2017, the **revenues of Lampada increased from £511,000 \(2018\) to £1,080,000 \(2019\) and £1,528,000 \(2020\).** Lampada employs **28 staff** mostly in high\-tech jobs boosting local employment. Beyond direct income and job creation, Lampada also annually trains several Computer Science students, via internships and placements in courses that include a year in the industry. The latter contributes to the employability of students and the improvement of the regional and UK workforce \[e3\]. 

 **4.3. Related work on Digital Learning & Virtual Environments – future outlook** 

 We are very proud to have created, sustained and continually developed over decades a body of applied research and systems that improves our **public** medical and emergency **services** in the times of a **pandemic**. In relation to impact on public service, it is worth mentioning the relevant work by Neil Gordon on approaches to e\-learning which was influential in shaping the successful  [Chinese government response to the virus in their education system](https://iite.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handbook-on-Facilitating-Flexible-Learning-in-COVID-19-Outbreak-SLIBNU_V2.0_20200324.pdf) \[e12\]. The keystone to this work was a 2014 Research Report for the Higher Education Academy on  [Technology Enhanced Learning and Flexible Pedagogies](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.creode.advancehe-document-manager/documents/hea/private/resources/tel_report_0_1568036617.pdf) \[e11\]. The NHS is currently using this work in their guidance on implementing technology\-based training. Given the impact of this work, department is currently exploring synergies with VETA environments as the next step to support enhanced learning. 

 Still in the area of virtual environments, the DEIS and VARS research groups are collaborating on research on digital art and intersections with philosophy and science. Applications of this work are increasingly becoming impactful. A result of this work is  [TIMAEUS](https://yipapadopoulos.wixsite.com/yiap/timaeus) \[e13\] a digital art studio environment that enables creation of personalised 3\-dimensional virtual sculptures. These sculptures can be customised with pictures, videos and music, which are embedded and can be experienced in different ways with the capability of zooming in and out, rotating, and viewing from different angles. TIMAEUS is used in applications from art therapy to education on philosophy and literature; examples are the creation of a  [Virtual Digital Stoa](https://yipapadopoulos.wixsite.com/yiap/stoa) and an  [Alternative Virtual Odyssey](https://yipapadopoulos.wixsite.com/yiap/odyssey). Papadopoulos gave an invited talk on “ [Meeting Epictetus and Seneca in a Virtual Stoa](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338741181_Meeting_Epictetus_and_Seneca_in_an_Infinite_Virtual_Stoa_Classical_Wisdom_as_Emotional_Education_of_the_Future): Classical Wisdom as Emotional Education of the Future” in the Roman Forum during the annual Literature Festival of Rome’ \(2019\). These efforts give encouraging signs that the UoH’s work into VR, training and digital learning will continue to generate exciting and impactful results.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 For decades, relationship and sex education \(RSE\) has been deemed to be unhelpfully negative, focused on disease or pregnancy prevention, with an over\-emphasis on basic biological information. The 2013 Ofsted Report noted that inadequacies in RSE can leave young people ‘vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation’. Langlands’ pioneering research into the history of sex has informed the development of an award\-winning approach to RSE, based on a curated, dialogic discussion of historical material/objects to inspire reflection and provoke discussion about vital topics such as consent, body image and pornography. The Sex & History method has been adopted across the UK and beyond as an effective means of delivering RSE in schools, museums, pupil referral units and youth clubs. Impacts include: 

-  **Empowering thousands of young people, teachers, youth workers and charities** with innovative RSE resources. 

-  Informing the **development and delivery of curricula and new statutory requirements** for comprehensive RSE provision in the UK. 

-  Generating **new ways for museums to enhance health and wellbeing outcomes**.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Underpinning the Sex & History method is a framework for delivering sex education through discussion of values, stereotypes, cultural expectations and codes of femininity/masculinity, which also draws attention to their cultural and historical specificity. This framework is informed by Langlands' research into sexual morality \[ **3.1**\] which demonstrated how sexual identities and choices in ancient Rome were shaped by the engagement of individuals with shared cultural products such as literature, law and education, and that sexual ethics was not a separate sphere of operation but was embedded in wider structures of power and status. Her research also articulated the benefits of this detailed study of ancient Rome for modern awareness of human diversity; its description of a culture with a different way of thinking about sex and ethics, and with different preoccupations, highlighted the culturally contingent nature of some of our current dominant controversies around sex. A belief in the value of such a dialogue between past and present lies at the heart of the Sex & History method. 

 The method is also informed by a body of interdisciplinary research on the history of sexuality and sexual knowledge undertaken by Langlands in collaboration with Kate Fisher \(History\), Jen Grove \(History, Classics and Museum Studies\) and Jana Funke \(English\) as part of the *Sexual Knowledge, Sexual History* project 2008\-2015 and from 2015 within the Sexual Knowledge Unit at the University of Exeter. This research has shown that claims about the past have been crucial in articulating sexual morals, in driving political, legal and social change, in shaping individual identities, and in constructing and grounding knowledge about sex. A key and original finding is that material from past cultures has functioned perennially as a stimulus for exploration of sexual questions. The research also asks how we can channel this fascination with history with a view to promoting healthy sexual development in the modern world, and it continues to evolve in dialogue with non\-academic partners \[ **3.2**, **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.5**, **3.6**\]. 

 As a case study, Langlands and Fisher researched the impact of sexually themed material found at the archaeological sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum on understandings of sex, showing that visual material such as pictures and artefacts are a particularly effective medium, providing an immediate and arresting point of engagement with the past \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\]. Research into collecting practices, including Grove’s PhD, supervised by Fisher and Langlands, revealed how collections of classical objects were fundamental to developing ideas about sex and sexuality in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries \[ **3.2,** **3.3**, **3.5**, **3.6**\]. The research also explored the history of museums, changing display practices and the challenges museums face in engaging with their varied audiences \[ **3.2**, **3.5**\]. 

 Further collaborative research undertaken, following the establishment of the Sexual Knowledge Unit \(directed by Fisher, Langlands, Funke and Grove\), has focused on the emergence of sexology and new scientific approaches to sex in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. This demonstrated that the increasingly medicalised understandings of sexuality developed towards the end of the 19th century, which continue to shape contemporary understanding, drew on anthropological, historical and material evidence, especially from past cultures, further demonstrating their enduring value, appeal and utility in shaping sexual knowledge. At the same time, it has found that classical material can be used to challenge and nuance the sexological categories which emerged in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and which have subsequently dominated both scientific and popular understanding \[ **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.6**\]. This research has shown how and why historical material can enable critical reflection on cultural norms and assumptions, while providing distance and authority that mitigates embarrassment – findings that have been implemented within the developing Sex & History method.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *This case study is related to a 2014 one, where a teaching resource piloted in Cornwall revealed the potential of object\-based learning in sex education, and preliminary collaborations with museums in Plymouth, Truro and Exeter demonstrated the value of engaging young people with sexually themed museum collections. However, this new case study relies on a substantial corpus of new research \(in addition to that which informed the previous case study\) and reflects an entirely new body of impact. Since 2014, the Sex & History teaching resource piloted in Cornwall has been replaced by an entirely new suite of resources using new objects, and in collaboration with leading sex educationalists, a more robust method has been established and disseminated.* 

 **Empowering young people, teachers, youth workers and charities with innovative RSE resources** 

 In 2014, Langlands, Fisher and Grove, in collaboration with two professional sex educators, devised an educational method based on historical objects embedded in a series of RSE resources for Key Stages 4 and 5. Now with an additional set of dedicated LGBT resources, produced in 2017 in collaboration with national educational charity *Schools Out*, these have been available in the UK and globally online since 2014 \[ **5.1**\]. 

  

 Teachers report that the resources ‘work incredibly well’ \[ **5.2**\] and leading sex educationalists highlight their value in promoting cross\-curricular approaches and giving teachers confidence by incorporating the ways they are used to teaching into the delivery of sex education \[ **5.3**\]. They emphasise the benefits of ‘distancing the discussion’ around topics like pornography, making them easier to approach \[ **5.3**\]. This encourages students who would otherwise be too embarrassed to talk \[ **5.3**\] leading to a ‘much better and safer discussion than an open debate’ \[ **5.3**\]. They add that the resources are unusual in providing ‘interesting and challenging resources that extend learning’ for pupils in KS5, making RSE more ‘than just a pastoral intervention, but actually an intellectual and interesting part of the curriculum’ \[ **5.3**\]. This is supported by feedback from teachers and pupils: ‘It is fascinating to see historical objects used to discuss modern\-day issues with clear links for students to follow. This will allow students to develop critical thinking and analysis skills *.*’ \(Beck, secondary history teacher\) \[ **5.2**\]. ‘I overheard a boy telling his mum about it at the end of the day. He was really fired up about it. Sounds like an awesome session.’ \(teacher, Bath\) \[ **5.2**\]. ‘Really, really great. Inspired a good discussion.’ \(pupil\) \[ **5.2**\] 

 Sex & History has also proved effective in specialist educational settings. In 2016, a pupil referral unit in Exeter used the method in a week\-long drama project with three pupils who had experienced forms of sexual exploitation. Reported outcomes include increase in confidence, ‘bonding’ and ‘promoting relationships between staff and students…so vital in the units’ \[ **5.2**\] **.** In Cornwall, sexual health charity Brook used the method with a group of young fathers, reporting increased confidence in discussing sexual issues \[ **5.2**\].  In Plymouth, as part of the ‘HOLD project’, pioneering social enterprise Effervescent Arts used the method from 2016\-2020 with small groups of young people with experiences of severe childhood trauma, including domestic violence, substance abuse and sexual exploitation, resulting in six exhibitions/ installations at Radiant Gallery for periods of two to four months. The impact on the 39 children involved was substantial. Data collected six months after the end of the project showed significant increases in all attainment, wellbeing and behavioural measures \[ **5.4**\], while the resulting exhibitions also had an impact on those who work with at\-risk young people. Representatives from the NSPCC recommended that the ‘Poison’ exhibition \(2017\) be incorporated into the charity’s programme for continuing professional development, with a youth worker commenting: ‘This will help and further my understanding of hidden harm. I work with children who suffer from developmental trauma in schools. I think you could achieve a shift in educational understanding if you presented this in schools. It would beat the PowerPoint presentations I deliver on the subject *.*’  \[ **5.4**\] 

  

 Since 2014, the teaching resources have been freely accessible worldwide via the TES website, from which they have been downloaded 1,318 times \(as of December 2020\), with a 4.8/5 star rating. The LGBT resources hosted by the University of Exeter have been downloaded 2,467 times \(as of December 2020\) \[ **5.1**\]. The resource has been downloaded worldwide \(e.g., in September\-December 2020 alone, in Ireland, France, Iceland, Hong Kong and New Zealand\). In France, the resources are being used in the creation of an association for the promotion of inclusive sex education \[ **5.2**\]. 

  

 The team has worked directly with more than 50 schools \(2014\-20\) to deliver both training to teachers and RSE lessons to pupils \[ **5.2**\]. However, the Sex & History method has been more widely disseminated across the country through its enthusiastic take\-up by highly regarded external agencies. The Sex Education Forum \(SEF\) is the foremost umbrella network for RSE in the UK, dedicated to quality and equitable RSE, delivering lessons in schools as well as in\-depth training to teachers. For example, one member of staff estimated she had delivered lessons to over 400 children and trained over 200 teachers in the past two years \[ **5.3**\]. In addition, since 2015 SEF have integrated Sex & History resources into various training programmes, including: the government\-funded anti\-homophobic, \-biphobic and \-transphobic bullying programme delivered to over 800 schools through face\-to\-face training \(2015\-9\); the core training package in all 38 secondary schools in East Sussex over a two\-year period; and SEF’s national training portfolio, including approximately 20 one\-day training sessions per year \(each attended by about 30 people\), reaching roughly 600 teachers annually, and 1000s over the past five years \[ **5.3**\]. 

  

 Another key organisation, School of Sexuality Education \(formerly Sexplain\), developed its programme in consultation with Sex & History, using the resources as part of its portfolio to deliver intersectional, feminist and sex\-positive workshops since its inception in 2016. It is now a leading sex\-education provider in the UK, working with 33,000\+ young people in 200\+ schools, delivering training for 250\+ teachers, and featuring Sex & History in a PGCE short course at UCL Institute of Education \[ **5.3**\]. The organisation’s co\-founder and CEO notes that the ‘materials are cleverly crafted to allow young people to objectively discuss relevant social issues such as bodily autonomy, gender and sexual pleasure in a way that is removed from their personal lives and experiences… We have found Sex & History particularly useful in addressing anxieties around discussing porn… \[it has\] influenced our own practice in delivering sex education’ \[ **5.3**\]. These organisations also highlight the uniqueness of Sex & History in its allowing teachers to integrate it into the broader curriculum, and helping them deliver LGBTQ\-inclusive RSE, ‘a challenge for many teachers, particularly those who have not received training or who do not have support of senior leadership. The Sex and History resource filled a gap in that it looked more broadly at the social and historical context.’ 

  

 In 2020, Langlands delivered teacher training via webinars, reaching an international audience: 20 members of the National Youth Agency \(UK\), 90\+ teachers through National Education Union, 40 teachers in Hong Kong via the English Schools Foundation and 31 members of the UK Army Welfare Services \(working in Cyprus, Kenya and Belize\). **\[5.2\]** 

  

 **Informing the development and delivery of curricula and new statutory requirements for comprehensive RSE provision** 

 The impact of the Sex & History method on the delivery of RSE across the UK is widely acclaimed. In December 2017, it was commended by national charity the Family Planning Association for innovation and good practice in RSE \[ **5.5**\]. In 2018 it was endorsed by Public Health England \[ **5.6**\]. It is one of the featured resources on the PSHE Association website, and Sex & History lesson plans also feature in the Department for Education\-recommended handbook *Great Relationships and Sex Education* \(Hoyle and McGeeney 2019\) \[ **5.7**\]. 

  

 As part of the development of a new statutory RSE policy in Wales, the team were invited to provide evidence at a Welsh Assembly expert panel in June 2017. The policy document informing the development of the new Welsh curriculum, including detailed guidance for schools, includes Sex & History as a case study of innovative and inclusive RSE \[ **5.8**\]. The team also attended a UK parliament event in November 2017 that informed new guidelines on statutory RSE issued in 2019. Langlands and Fisher are regularly invited to contribute to policy and curriculum\-building events for teachers, third\-sector practitioners and government officials. These include the Healthy Sexual Development event for practitioners and teachers \(Westminster, June 2017\); Delivering Outstanding Sex and Relationships Education by Inside Government \(provider of CPD for effective policy implementation to public and third sector – December 2018\); Countdown to Statutory RSE with Sir Antony Seldon \(Kingston, March 2019\); PSHCE 200 Secondary Subject Leader Network \(Hackney, July 2019\) \[ **5.9**\]. 

  

 **Generating new ways for museums to enhance health and wellbeing outcomes** 

 In 2014, the Sex & History team curated the Intimate Worlds exhibition at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum \(RAMM\) in Exeter \(April 5\-June 29\). With over 63,000 visitors, it was an important and innovative exhibition for RAMM \[ **5.9**\] whose collections and content lead testifies that ‘Intimate Worlds provided an opportunity for RAMM to demonstrate to audiences and stakeholders the value and appeal of this type of subject matter, and its relevance… \[it\] helped to establish the status of the museum as a place for debate within Exeter *.’* \[ **5.10**\] 

  

 The exhibition and its potential to inform sex education attracted national and international media attention. It was the most\-read story in BBC Education news for a week in April 2014 and showcased with vox\-pop reactions on BBC Devon’s flagship breakfast show \[ **5.10**\]. Its success shaped subsequent activities and policies at RAMM, including the sector\-leading LGBT Rainbow Trail and the Queering the Museum project. \[ **5.10**\] Following the exhibition, Langlands and the team were contacted by people across the museum sector, nationally and internationally, for advice on the display of sexually themed material, modes of youth engagement and the relationship between museums and RSE: curators at the Wellcome Collection sought their assistance in the development of the Institute of Sexology exhibition \(London, 2014\-15, 200,000 visitors\); they were approached on an education programme regarding sexual health at the Women’s Museum of Denmark in Aarhus in 2015; and they collaborated on the ‘Sex in Six Objects’ project in Cambridge in 2016 \[ **5.11**\]. 

  

 Since 2018 the Sex & History method’s applicability to museums has featured on the Museum Studies MA programme at University of Leicester \[ **5.11**\]. Stuart Frost, of the British Museum, evaluated the Intimate Worlds exhibition in a study exploring the potential for attitudes to sex and sexuality to be explored in UK museums \[ **5.11**\]. The British Museum subsequently developed its own Let’s Talk about Sex programme, and has since collaborated with Langlands and the team in advising a group of museums in Berlin \(2015 to present\). This has resulted in a permanent activity for visiting schools at the Bode Museum; a major exhibition, The Eroticism of Things: Collections on the History of Sexuality, at the Werkbundarchiv in Berlin in 2018 and subsequently at the Erotic Art Museum \(WEAM\) in Miami Beach, Florida in 2019; and the introduction of object\-based learning about sexuality at the WEAM, including indexing, researching, curating and exhibiting many objects from the Naomi Wilzig collection that have never previously been displayed \[ **5.11**\]. The 2018 *Museums as Spaces of Wellbeing* report, produced by the UK’s Culture, Health and Wellbeing Alliance, features Sex & History as an example of best practice – further evidence of its wide\-ranging impact on the museum sector \[ **5.6**\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Romankiewicz’s research on prehistoric architectures in northwest Europe has transformed the way that builders, visitors and heritage professionals understand sustainable building practices from the distant past. Eco\-building projects in the Netherlands and Scotland have used Romankiewicz’s findings on sustainability in prehistoric architecture as the basis for moving towards zero\-carbon construction methods. In the Heritage sector, her research has formed the basis for new interpretation displays and reconstructions from Shetland to Galloway, helping to drive an increase in visitor numbers. Policy guidance produced by Romankiewicz in collaboration with Aberdeenshire and Highland Councils has made possible the curation of more effective regional and national heritage records for the future. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Romankiewicz brings to her research an unusual blend of expertise in architecture and archaeology, thanks to undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in architecture and a combined architecture/archaeology PhD. 

 Her research resulted in the first full\-scale architectural study of 2,500\-year old stone buildings in Scotland, known as brochs. Expanding on her PhD, she developed a new social model for understanding broch\-building communities, based on detailed analyses of broch design, construction processes, and material resourcing \[3.1, 3.2\]. She placed these results within their international context, by analysing in detail more than 30 sites featuring timber and turf architecture across Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Northern Germany and the Netherlands – ranging from the Bronze Age to the Roman period \[3.3,3.4,3.5\]. Where brochs were previously understood in terms of the unsustainable consumption of material and labour, Romankiewicz showed how their tall, mortar\-free stone walls were in fact well\-adjusted to environmental conditions, making use of locally available materials and supporting economically self\-sufficient households \[3.1\]. Her own reconstructions of broch designs have shown how it would have been possible to build them in treeless landscapes without recourse to the unsustainable import of timber, by using alternative construction methods and materials \[3.2\]. Romankiewicz’s research confirms that brochs belong to long\-standing traditions of drystone\-building. It also demonstrates the extent of the sustainable management of resources by communities living in resource\-poor or ‘marginal’ landscapes. 

 Romankiewicz’s research has transformed our understanding of brochs in social terms, too. Where traditional accounts emphasise their defensive character, linked to elite competition for resources, Romankiewicz has shown that in fact they were most likely homes for mutually co\-operating households. On this non\-elite reading, local groups joined a Scotland\-wide broch\-building movement as a way of signifying their social and economic success, and managed to do so without exhausting local resources \[3.1\]. 

 Romankiewicz has worked to situate brochs within wider British and Irish timber roundhouse traditions \[3.3, 3.4\]. She has shown that between 1800 BC and AD 200 similar architectural concepts were shared across large swathes of territory in northwest Europe. Made from either durable or perishable materials, these houses were malleable shells, capable of adapting in response to the changing needs of households \[3.3, 3.5, 3.6\]. Even when no longer used for human habitation, they continued to develop \[3.3, 3.4\]. First used for dwelling, some were later used for stalling animals, and then – once enriched with manure – they were transformed into nutrient\-filled walled gardens. These structures thus sustained their communities in a variety of different ways, beyond traditional and rather fixed understandings of the ‘built environment’ \[3.5\]. Romankiewicz’s research showed in particular that low\-carbon materials such as turf were well\-suited for such shape\-shifting architecture, and were more widely used than previously recognised \[3.6\]. 

 Finally, Romankiewicz has pioneered new ways of improving the identification of these structures, difficult as they are to detect archaeologically because of their use of local soils which makes them difficult to distinguish from ordinary soil and topsoil \[3.4, 3.6\]. The use of low\-carbon materials, together with the reuse of buildings for new purposes, render this ancient building practice very sustainable.

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Building links between ancient and modern sustainable construction 

 Since 2014, Romankiewicz has applied her research into prehistoric building practices to the pioneering of new construction methods, exploring how efficiency in new buildings \(including carbon footprints\) might be improved by learning from the past. Her cyclical model, in which prehistoric buildings changed from dwellings to byres and then into nutrient\-rich walled gardens, inspired a resident of Almere eco\-village, in the Netherlands to design a bio\-dynamic family home \(Fig 1\). In 2017 Romankiewicz and the householder tested a method of prehistoric wall construction, in a ‘hand\-storming workshop’ held with other locals alongside a landscape artist, Dutch eco\-builders and Syrian refugees experienced in building with earth. The householder has since grown willows on the plot for future use in wattle wall frames, and has constructed additional test walls utilising plant\-based materials readily available on site as wall\-fillers. He now plans to construct a first full\-scale structural test. \[5.1\]. 



 Fig. 1: Sketch of ‘circular build’ family home in Almere \(2019\). 

 This collaboration was facilitated by the archaeologist and eco\-builder Daniel Postma, who is now based in Scotland where he runs the eco\-building company, ‘Archaeo Build’. Romankiewicz’s experiments in the translation of archaeological research into useful modern building techniques has, he says, ‘been instrumental in developing… archaeology's contribution to sustainable building. \[It offers\] different perspectives on how we expect our buildings to perform. Accepting the shorter lifespan of certain materials but then using that characteristic to your advantage by including the building in an agricultural cycle, as you \[Romankiewicz\] have argued for, is a great example of this contribution archaeology can make on a conceptual level’ \[5.2\]. Romankiewicz’s research helped Postma to find ‘the confidence to promote these notions publicly…and to communicate the concept of this circular use \[of\] a biodegradable building in more detail to an interested audience’ \[5.2\]. Archaeo Build has since roofed a cottage for Historic Environment Scotland at Canonbie, Dumfries & Galloway, in turf. Two further turf construction projects for eco\-farms in Crieff, Perthshire, currently at the planning stage, represent forward\-looking contributions to the Scottish government’s goal for low carbon farming and building. 

###  Interpreting ancient architectures 

 Romankiewicz’s research has also informed museum displays. The digital reconstruction of a local broch for the Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum on North Uist, Western Isles, changed perceptions of this monument, which is well\-known locally but hard to imagine in its original form. 7000 visitors viewed the video reconstruction during the first year of the exhibition, followed by 4000 views the next year \[5.3a and b\]. This reconstruction helped viewers to understand an important environmental issue: the difficulty faced by residents of treeless islands in locating sufficient timber for their buildings. This difficulty existed even in the case of a reconstruction like Romankiewicz’s, which sought to be as economical as possible in its use of resources \[5.3a and b\]. 

 Across two Open Days in June 2016 for the Whithorn Trust \(Dumfries & Galloway\), Romankiewicz built two experimental double\-wattle walls with earthen fills, based on excavated evidence nearby. These informed a 1:1 roundhouse reconstruction by a local architect and engineer, now used as the Trust’s education centre. Two local craftsmen trained by Romankiewicz during the Open Days won the building contract and have since found further employment: as a trainer in ancient skills on\-site \(part of the Trust’s education programme\); and in Scandinavia, as a traditional builder. These two craftsmen together trained a third, enabling him to move from long\-term unemployment to full\-time employment in the agricultural services sector. The new visitor centre has increased the Trust’s visitor figures by 75%, since its opening in spring 2017. It has helped to attract young families in particular, widening reach and participation. The project’s success has strengthened the Trust’s ambitions to develop similar reconstructions and training opportunities for local people \[5.4\]. 

 In 2015 Romankiewicz also assisted in the creation of a new interpretation panel at Clickimin Broch \(Lerwick, Shetland\), managed by Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\) and now visited by nearly 10,000 people per year, including many local residents: an almost 100% increase since 2015 \[5.5a\]. HES’s Senior Cultural Resource Adviser confirms that ‘\[Romankiewicz’s\] advice was invaluable in enabling us to create a new and informed artist’s impression of how Clickimin Broch may once have looked, particularly in terms of reconstructing the interior of the broch and the form of the roof’ \[5.5a\]. Based on Romankiewicz’s research and expertise, this was an innovative reconstruction, using turf as a roofing material and only a few small\-diameter timbers to span the brochs’ interior. This makes for resource\-efficient and sustainable construction, described as ‘groundbreaking’ by the conservation charity Caithness Broch Project, with whom Romankiewicz has been working on plans for a physical broch reconstruction in Caithness \[5.5a\]. An HES launch event for the Clickimin project was sold out, while more than 5,000 people watched online. Some were surprised to find just how little in the way of timber was, in all likelihood, required for broch roofs and floors. Romankiewicz’s reconstruction helped Clickimin Broch to be shortlisted for DigIt’s ‘Scotland in Six Hidden Gems\!’ competition in 2017, and contributed to the updating of HES’s Statements of Significance for protected broch sites \(documents that outline a site’s history, development and significance in order to justify protection as a Scheduled Monument\) \[5.5a and b\]. 

  

###  Strengthening heritage management 

 Romankiewicz’s roundhouse research \[3.4, 3.6\] highlighted the need for refined archaeological detection methods and improved documentation of prehistoric architectural remains. To this end, Romankiewicz and the Aberdeenshire Council Archaeologist co\-produced best\-practice guidance on how to excavate prehistoric buildings to assist Local Government Archaeology Officers in day\-to\-day policy decisions on cultural heritage assets \[5.6a\]. This guidance became part of Aberdeenshire Council’s Archaeology Service Strategy \(2017\-2020\), addressing Aims 1, 2 and 5 alongside Objectives 1 \(p.7 of the document\), 7 \(p.8\) and 21 \(p.10\) \[5.6b\]. The Aberdeenshire Council Archaeologist confirms the value of this work, which has ‘rewritten our understanding of roundhouses in the NE, improved how these sites are excavated and recorded, widened our consideration of how landscape and roundhouses are tied together, and brought about a guidance document that put into writing for the first time the standards that we expect everyone to meet’ \[5.6c\]. 

  

 Local Government Archaeology Officers at Highland Council, too, now routinely recommend this guidance document, effectively turning it into a legally binding document \[5.7a and b\] in relation to the granting of planning permission on archaeologically sensitive sites. Informed by Romankiewicz’s Aberdeenshire Council document, a guidance document on Mesolithic flint scatters has now been produced, part\-funded by Aberdeenshire Council and HES \[5.6c and d\]; and HES are in the process of developing a series of nationwide guidance documents as part of the national Archaeology Strategy, with a view to incorporating and expanding Romankiewicz’s roundhouse guidance \[5.8\]. 

  

 Archaeological contractors, required by the Council’s planning conditions to produce detailed records for local and national heritage archives when mitigating development impact on heritage sites, have found the document ‘most useful for planning the work … and informing the Written Scheme of Investigation \(WSI\) \[which\] forms the basis of the archaeological planning conditions.’ \[5.7a\] *.* Romankiewicz’s document is also being used for budgeting and for communicating the importance of archaeological planning conditions to developers and planners \[5.7a and b\]. One project manager, having relocated from southern England, reports that as ‘a new\-boy to the archaeology of the Highland region it has proved an invaluable guide concerning the character and archaeology of these very common structures and, most importantly, how to approach their excavation. Your guide ensures that the level and types of information gathered during our fieldwork is not only consistent with that gathered by other archaeologists in the region but also maximised’ \[5.9\]. 

 Romankiewicz has also worked with Archaeology for Communities of the Highlands \(ARCH\) on the creation of a wider regional archaeological research framework to be used ‘as a development tool by Highland Council, referred to by archaeological contractors in their work, a valuable source for students for learning and dissertation topics, and by local community groups when they come to research and contribute to their local heritage.’ \[5.10a and b\]. The co\-ordinator of this framework confirms how her ‘perspectives have changed as a result of \[Romankiewicz’s\] published works and follow up discussions’, and anticipates that this framework ‘will prove influential in research into Highland Archaeology in the coming decade, as well as providing a firm basis of knowledge for a wide range of stakeholders.’ \[5.10a\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Supercomputer\-based analysis pipelines for nucleic acid sequencing data, developed at the University of Bristol, informed containment policy directed at controlling the Ebola outbreak \(2013\-2016\) in West Africa. It was used to track real\-time molecular evolution of the virus and inform effective deployment of control measures and therapeutic strategies by the World Health Organisation, Public Health England, the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the government of Guinea. Successful containment reduced the human and economic costs of illness and death. Retrospective comparison of interventions and virus evolution has validated the response and informed confident management of recent and future outbreaks. Follow\-up research has also informed guidance on survivor care to prevent sexual transmission. The methodology has been used in subsequent Ebola outbreaks, and the processes are currently being further developed and used for other pathogens, including COVID\-19. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Advances in genome sequencing technology have required parallel advances in computational analysis to handle, and effectively examine, the vast data sets generated. Research carried out at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) has been at the forefront of developing novel integrated high\-throughput methods, to address these issues with a particular interest and application in respiratory viruses. 

 Early methods of protein identification from sequencing data relied on comparisons with a high\-quality reference list. Research led by Matthews, established a novel computational technique, Proteomics informed by transcriptomics \(PIT\) analysis, to circumvent this. PIT collects RNA\-sequencing and proteomics data simultaneously, and then uses the transcriptomic data to refine and inform the proteomic analysis \[1\]. In a follow\-up study, PIT was used to demonstrate the potential application in a comparison of the response of bat and human cell lines to a pathogenic zoonotic virus \[2\]. Bats are a major reservoir of emerging infectious diseases while often remaining asymptomatic; the public health threat of bat zoonoses is evident with Ebola, Marburg, SARS, MERS, Hendra, Nipih, and COVID\-19. This approach enabled the comparison of molecular responses between the species which could shed light on host pathogenesis \[2\]. 

 In 2012, Public Health England \(PHE\) identified the need for rapid and reliable computational pipelines to support their work in monitoring and controlling viral infections. Matthews, in collaboration with the University of Liverpool, developed these processes for PHE. A key outcome, led by UoB, was a computational pipeline that allowed accurate assembly of viral genomes and identification of nucleotide polymorphisms, from high\-throughput short read Illumina sequence data. This enabled monitoring of viral evolution, for example, alterations in coat proteins which potentially render vaccines or passive antibody transfer treatments ineffective. The study used sequential passage of Ebola virus in guinea pigs. Initially the virus is not pathogenic to guinea pigs at all but after as little as five passages the virus becomes highly lethal to them. The computational pipeline developed by UoB, allowed identification of changes in the virus genome that could be associated with increasing virus pathogenicity \[3\]. The pipeline was then applied in real time to samples gathered during the 2013\-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa to trace the temporal and spatial genetic evolution of the virus \[4\]. 

 The next advance was to meet the demand for a tool which could provide results quickly and be deployed close to the outbreak. The MinION DNA sequencer, made by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, allowed the European Mobile Laboratories team to create a fully functioning laboratory that could collate and provide genome sequence information in rapid time. Towards the end of the outbreak in 2014/2015, MinION sequencing \[4\] was evaluated by PHE to demonstrate the technology was robust and would enable rapid contact tracing. Comparison of samples tested with the MinION, with the computational analysis method developed by Matthews gave PHE the confidence MinION could replace conventional lab sequencing. The time from sample to sequence was reduced from several weeks to about a day \[5\]. 

 This technology was subsequently used to study sporadic flare\-ups of Ebola that could have restarted the outbreak and to understand persistence of the virus in survivors. In 2016, a study of viral load in seminal fluid from a cohort of men discharged from Ebola treatment units, revealed the virus was present in the semen for nine months after they had recovered and were PCR negative for the virus in their blood \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Due to the high mortality rate, potential transmission from person\-to\-person contact and the lack of approved vaccines or anti\-viral therapies, Ebola virus is classified as a hazard group 4 pathogen. UoB research informed the international response to the 2013\-2016 outbreak in West Africa, subsequent survivor care and public health guidance, and preparedness for future epidemics. 

#  Informing the international response to Ebola and saving lives 

 In September 2014, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) estimated that without informed interventions or changes in community behaviour, there would be between 550,000 and 1.4 million Ebola cases in West Africa by January 2015. With a fatality rate of 25% to 90%, this would have led to many deaths. 

 During 2014 Matthews worked with PHE and the European Mobile Laboratory team deployed to Guinea at the epicentre of the outbreak, providing rapid yes/no diagnostic back up to medical teams on the ground. The Deputy Director of PHE’s National Infection Service confirmed the importance of the ground\-breaking use of real\-time mass sequencing; *‘Dr Matthews contributions to the sequencing work and speed of transmission mapping was pioneering – the CDC were also sequencing diagnostic viral samples of Ebola and were able to process 70 samples in 8 months. Dr Matthews evaluated 180 samples in 10 months’* \[A\]. 

 Understanding of the rate of evolutionary change and transmission routes \[4\], provided significant extra confidence to the government of Guinea and the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) that the control strategies being put in place were the right ones to use. *‘The targeted vaccination program deployed against Ebola was with the confidence that the virus was not aggressively evolving, that transmission was occurring from human\-to\-human rather than multiple cases of zoonotic origin, and for the first time the response action could be confirmed against a real\-time picture of how the virus was behaving’* \[A\]. Evidence from Guinea that the virus had not substantially mutated suggested the current vaccine and antibody\-based treatments would protect against all versions of the virus that were circulating, ‘ *Dr Matthews’ sequencing data showing no significant changes in the viral genomes as the epidemic spread gave confidence to WHO in employing the ring vaccination strategy’* \[A\]. This allowed the trial to go ahead which confirmed the efficacy and effectiveness of the candidate vaccine \[B\] and informed the expansion of the vaccination programme to Sierra Leone. 

 In total, 11,310 deaths out of 28,616 cases were reported as of June 2016 by WHO, significantly lower than had been originally estimated. 

 Ground\-breaking UoB mass sequencing established during the Ebola virus outbreak \(2013\-2015\) \[3, 4\], combined with validation of MinION, which allows real\-time and robust genomic sequencing \[5\], underpinned the WHO Phase 3 surveillance strategy guidelines for Ebola response \[C\], and set an exemplar for future epidemics \[D\]. 

#  Informing Ebola survivor care and public health guidance 

 When a new outbreak of Ebola was declared in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the MinION device \[5\] was available to rapidly confirm the pathogen and identify the strain \[E\]. Insights into the extended time survivors may carry the virus resulted in changes to the guidance given to men who had recovered from Ebola. Based on the evidence \[including 6\], a WHO international meeting proposed 7 revisions to the WHO interim advice on preventing sexual transmission of the Ebola virus \[F\]. In the UK, the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens used the evidence, which was that Ebola viral RNA had been detected in seminal fluid up to 565 days after infection, to recommend a lifetime ban on any sperm or egg donation from known Ebola virus survivors, and deferral from treatment or donation from those who are known to have been in an area of active Ebola virus transmission \[G\]. 

#  Informing future preparedness 

 The ability to confirm response actions against a real\-time picture has *‘set the standard for all future epidemic responses, most recently the COVID\-19 pandemic’* \[A\]. The role of innovative real\-time whole genome sequencing methods to generate actionable information, with specific reference to success during the Ebola outbreak \[2, 3\], was highlighted by the UK Chief Medical Officer’s 2016 report \[H\]. This report made recommendations to policy makers to improve coordination, evaluation and sharing of data to deliver the best health outcomes. With particular reference to experience gained from the Ebola epidemic \(Chapter 9 – Case Study 4\), the report suggested that *‘This will require international standardisation of approaches to data generation and sharing’* \[H\]. Recommendation 16 states: *‘I recommend that DH \[Department of Health\] works with international partners and health authorities to support systems, mechanisms and rules for rapid sharing of research and health intelligence data especially where it facilitates control of epidemic and pandemic disease threats’* \[H\]. 

 As an established low cost and rapid turnaround time technology, MinION is now widely used in genomic surveillance of pathogens including Zika \[D\], Lassa fever \[Ii\], MERS\-CoV \[Iii\], yellow fever \[Iiii\] and SARS\-CoV\-2 \[J\]. 

 Zika virus, which is present in Africa, Asia, and America, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO in 2016. Following the validation of MinION in the Ebola outbreak, it was again deployed in the Zika in Brazil Real\-Time Analysis \(ZiBRA\) project, a UK\-Brazil dating sharing consortium with the objective to increase genomic surveillance of Zika and understand the effect of the geographical spread of the different virus lineages on Zika\-associated neurological conditions \[D\]. 

 Adoption of the Chief Medical Officers recommendations \[F\] meant the UK was prepared to sequence the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus in early 2020. The COVID\-19 Genomics UK Consortium \[J\] has performed and made publicly available more mass whole genome sequencing of SARS\-CoV\-2 than any other nation. The Deputy Director of the UK’s National Infection service reported that *‘the UK has sequenced 45% of the SARS\-CoV\-2 global sequencing total – the largest real\-time viral genomic dataset since the 2013\-2016 West African Ebola outbreak’* \[A\] and that *‘This SARS\-CoV\-2 genomic surveillance is utilised by PHE and NHS Track and Trace to understand the evolution of the virus and inform the UK government’s investment in vaccines to control the spread of COVID\-19’* \[A\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study presents the first phase of a new arts–based project that gives practical support and creative inspiration to professionals and the wider public as they approach and negotiate the life changing impacts of pregnancy, maternity and paternity. Through the dissemination of publications to NHS clients via the British Infertility Counselling Association, workshops and events, it creates spaces in which to address the expectations, uncertainty and sometimes traumatic nature of child\-bearing and rearing. In so doing it seeks to support the well\-being of individuals, affirm the significance of those experiences, and challenge the divide between work and the family.

###  2. Underpinning Research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research imperatives that underpin this impact case study emerged through the feminist, art historical and practice\-based investigations of **Corby \[3.3; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\]**, **O’Donnell \[3.1\],** and **Taylor \[3.2\].** In philosophy parenthood has been cast as an impediment to intellectual work from classical antiquity to Rousseau. The Western canon of art, built on this foundation, presents a succession of heroic, isolated artists who are masters of their materials and subject matter. As a consequence, creativity has been aligned with masculinity and art that engages with motherhood is rarely accorded major cultural significance. Emboldened by the Unit’s inclusive approach to equality and diversity, however, our researchers have openly shared and interrogated the impact of miscarriage and parenthood on their work as thinkers, makers and educators, developing collaborations and new insights into the lived experience of gender. 

 Historically, the authenticity of an artist’s work and identity has been legitimated by the ability to be immersed in studio practice. Nominated for the Jerwood Drawing Prize \(2017\) and Trinity Buoy Wharf Prize \(2019\), the drawings produced during **Taylor’s** Arts Council England funded project, *Mentoring for Professional Development* \(2014\-19 **\[3.2\]**\) *,* actively challenged this convention. She investigated the impact of maternity on her practice, not via literal representations of motherhood or children, but first by rejecting materials synonymous with high art, incorporating resources and motifs that her children brought into the studio. Second, by embracing a working pattern that doesn’t assume the incompatibility of serious artistic/academic labour and motherhood/children, developing alternative strategies to sustain artistic identity by exploring the power of mentorship and professional collaboration with Professor Anita Taylor \(Dundee; Director of the Jerwood\) and Kate Brindley, chief curator of Chatsworth House. 

  

 In *Sitting with Uncertainty* \(2019 **\[3.1\]**\) **O’Donnell** pursued a course of practice\-based research in collaboration with the Museum of Motherhood \(Florida\), the Birth Rites Collection, \(Kings College London\), British Infertility Counselling Association, Reflect Pregnancy Choice & Loss and Support, UK and the Miscarriage Association. First developed at a performance for the Drawing Matters Symposium \(YSJU; 2017\) and disseminated through exhibition in the University of Newcastle Gallery, New South Wales, Australia, article in the TRACEY journal \(2021, delayed due to covid\), and an artist’s book \(2019\) this powerful body of work makes visible the grief and trauma of miscarriage revealing the shame, sorrow and sense of failure of this seldom represented experience. 

 **Corby’s** interrogation of the representation of maternal experience and motherhood within the history and criticism of art \(2007 **\[3.6\]**; 2010, **\[3.5\]**\) catalysed a dialogue with **O’Donnell** and **Taylor;** leading to essays illuminating the originality and of *Sitting with Uncertainty* \(2019 **\[3.4\]**\) and *Mentoring for Professional Development* \(2017 **\[3.3\]**\). This critical lens was instrumental to **Corby’s** critique of the gap between the maternal body as phenomenological metaphor for knowledge production through painting and the lived experience of mothers who paint \(in print April 2021\). Disseminated as an invited paper at ‘A Feminist Space at Leeds: Looking Back to Think Forward’ \(Leeds, 2017\), convened by Holberg Prize Winner Griselda Pollock, this body of work led to the public engagement workshop entitled the Republic of Parenthood at the 108<sup>th</sup> College Art Association Annual Conference Chicago \(Feb 2020\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

1.  In undergraduate and postgraduate arts courses the content and form of the Western canon has been supplemented by feminist, LGBTQ and postcolonial criticism. Within this same scholarly economy, the voice of the mother remains illegitimate, however; derided as a signifier of excessive motherly pastoral care and/or threat to academic rigour. In art at YSJU 95% of our undergraduates and postgraduates are female. Given that 82% of women born in 1971 became mothers \(ONS  [most recent dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/bulletins/childbearingforwomenbornindifferentyearsenglandandwales/2017)\), the Unit’s research poses a vital question about this cycle of exclusion and silence can be broken by changing attitudes and behaviour. 

 To test the benefits of the research **Corby** and **Taylor** presented it to over 200 students as part of the Unit’s annual Practice as Research Week \(2018; 2019\) which sits outside our standard curriculum. Through lectures and studio discussions we created opportunities for young women to consider the challenges of working parenthood and offer critical tools to affirm the benefits of that experience for professional practice. Our introduction to ‘female artists who managed the juggle of professional, creative and domestic lives to forge a professional career as an artist’ offered mature students a new lens through to ‘see myself’ **\[5.4\]**. 

 From this positive beginning, our first step towards a sustainable programme of events and community was to develop a brand that would cut through the sea of parenting information. We collaborated with graphic designer Andrew **Byrom** to create *The Republic of Parenthood* \(2019, Appendix A\) which plays on Liz Berry’s collection of poems, *The Republic of Motherhood* \(2018\). 

 This brand framed our workshop at CAA, Chicago, \(25 participant artists and curators from across the US and Canada\). Participants were ‘excited to even see it as an offering \[at CAA, Chicago\] because I feel it’s a hidden/not talked about part of this field’s experience’ **\[5.5\]**. They discussed how ‘becoming a parent has completely transformed my art practice and my relationship to the field’ **\[5.5\]**. It revealed the impact of expectations of professionalism and gender roles for men and women; as a graduate student with a 2.5 year old noted ‘I’ve wrestled with work life balance. *It seems that to be successful is not to be present as a father’* **\[5.5\].** 

 The participants felt the workshop was important because it broke down the sense of isolation felt by parents; ‘I’m not alone. The more we talk about it, the more being an artist and parent will be normalised’ **\[5.5\].** It enabled life and work to be ‘proudly put together’ **\[5.5\]** and ‘open up new directions in my work – rather than being prohibitive of studio work practice’ **\[5.5\]**. 

  

1.  *Sitting with Uncertainty* continues this process of openness and has begun to create benefits for service users in counselling **\[5.2\]** and clinical practice in the NHS by creatively articulating the experience of miscarriage. As the curator of the Museum of Motherhood notes in her contribution to O’Donnell’s book; 

 ‘frequently identified as a woman’s failure, or the failure of her body to do its job, miscarriage can be a topic that elicits sorrow and shame. This can be especially true when navigating medical, as well as social, environments unequipped to deal with the highly emotional terrain of bereavement. When the incomplete work of the pregnant body leaves women devastated, there are few outlets to share this sense of sorrow’ \(2019 **\[5.3\]**\). 

 **O’Donnell** hosted Baby Loss Awareness Week for staff and students on behalf of the charity Sands \(YSJU 2018\). Through this process miscarriage shifted from the undeclared subtext of her practice, to a conscious desire to develop strategies to support others as they navigated the grief of pregnancy without life. As Laura Seftel, \( *Grief Unseen*, Kingsley, 2006\), states in her contribution to *Sitting with Uncertainty*, O’Donnell shows ‘immeasurable courage’ by allowing her experience and practice to ‘converge and openly tackle ‘the often taboo topic of pregnancy loss’. The artist’s book which disseminates this research is now supporting clinicians in the NHS. As chair of the British Infertility Counselling Association states **\[5.1\],** for ‘bereaved women and couples, being able to see and read \[ *Sitting with Uncertainty*\] is very valuable providing them with the knowledge and the reassurance there is material that exists and they are not “alone”, that there are others who have faced a similar experience of loss which helps to name and normalise their grief as they begin to process their loss and find a way forward”.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Hansard, the quasi\-verbatim record of parliament, has been available online since 1997 but until the advent of the Hansard at Huddersfield project in 2018, its searchability was limited and the user\-friendliness of its interface low. Jeffries and her team employed corpus linguistic techniques to create an entirely new web\-based interface, known as Hansard at Huddersfield, for exploring the database. This is a user\-friendly interface with a range of search functions and visualisations. It provides Hansard users \(from students to parliamentary researchers\) with an improved method of exploring political decision\-making. Hansard at Huddersfield has changed the way in which the producers of Hansard perceive their data; influenced plans for Hansard’s electronic future being made by the Parliamentary Digital Service; improved the way in which Hansard users access the data; and informed the work of a group planning new digital versions of parliamentary data outside the UK, in the Hellenic parliament of Greece. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Hansard is a written record of what is said in the UK parliament. Parliament’s electronic version comprises a standard database of texts, with metadata detailing information such as dates, debate titles and speakers. This kind of database and metadata searches are familiar to internet users. However, users are limited in what they can search for in the data itself, as they are restricted to searching for individual occurrences of words with no opportunity to identify patterns of usage. Jeffries and colleagues at Huddersfield set out to address this problem by drawing on their track\-record of research in corpus linguistics, using a range of tools that enable the user to search across large bodies of textual data like Hansard, to see where words, phrases and topics occur in the database and identify patterns of usage. Their research combines this approach with qualitative interpretation of the results of searches. This kind of searchability, based on the patterning of words in texts, provides a new way of conceptualising the language of parliament, allowing patterns of language use and fluctuating levels of interest in topics to be discovered with relative ease and to be interpreted in context. 

 Since 2003, Jeffries, Director of the Institute of Applied Linguistics at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\), has used corpus\-based techniques to demonstrate the changing meanings of words in specific socio\-political contexts. Her findings include tracking the developing meaning of a simple word \( *water*\) in the reporting of a time of drought **\[3.1\]** and this work fed into the concept of socio\-political keywords developed by Jeffries and Walker \(2012\) **\[3.2\]**; \(2017\) **\[3.4\]** and \(2019\) **\[3.5\]** in their work on the language of the Blair years, where they proposed solutions to the methodological difficulties of bridging the gap between automated and manual analysis. Their approach combines automated search techniques such as finding the keywords in a dataset and producing concordance lines \(lists of word occurrences within their context\) for each keyword with Jeffries’ critical linguistic framework for systematising the analysis of each occurrence. Their results demonstrated the changing meaning of a small set of keywords \( *choice*; *reform*; *respect*; *terror*; *global* and *spin*\) in the reporting of the Blair years. The approach was adopted by Jeffries and Evans in 2015 **\[3.3\]**, who investigated a small but complete dataset of election manifestos. These projects produced key insights into the danger of misinterpreting automated results and the advantage of using a linguistic framework such as that developed by Jeffries to identify the textually\-constructed meanings of words and their potential for ideological impact. 

 Jeffries was invited to lead the Hansard strand of the SAMUELS project led by the University of Glasgow from 2014\-2015, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) \(£67,325.89\). In 2018, Jeffries was successful in an application for AHRC follow\-on funding \(£80,510\) to apply corpus linguistic techniques to the development of the Hansard at Huddersfield interactive web\-based tool **\[3.6\]**, with the aim of presenting a user\-friendly and efficient way to explore the data in Hansard from a textual point of view while providing guidance to users about the interpretation of findings. In addition to Jeffries, the core team comprised UoH Historian and Digital Humanities scholar Alex von Lunen, who applied his expertise in visualisation and computing to develop the project’s overall approach; UoH Research Fellow Hugo Sanjurjo\-Gonzalez \(2018\-2020\), the programmer who combined database approaches with corpus methods and visualisations to produce the website and Research Assistant Fransina Stradling \(2018\-present\) who worked with Jeffries on the public\-facing aspects of the project. The resulting interface followed detailed work by Jeffries and the team on the structure and nature of the Hansard data and experimentation with corpus linguistic tools and visualisations to provide the best combination of these whilst ensuring that the raw data was always accessible to the user. The site provides more sophisticated searchability that end\-users of Hansard can use with no training in corpus methods and, through provision of accessible online advice on the interpretation of results, without the need for extensive knowledge of linguistics. The website and supporting materials were developed in 2018, launched in 2019 **\[3.6\]** and further improved throughout 2020. The website provides unprecedented means for interested end\-users to carry out detailed studies of the language used in the UK Parliament by observing patterns in word usage, initially through graphs and other visualisations but with the flexibility of always being able to access the data itself. Users can locate the discussion of topics through key terms and/or consider any emergent meaning of vocabulary based on frequency of use. They can also use the site’s supporting materials to help them understand how to interpret the automated findings, avoiding the pitfalls of automation previously identified by Jeffries and colleagues **\[3.2\-3.5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Existing searchable interfaces for Hansard provide only a limited range of options for the user to search by speaker, debate title, date and word to find individual contributions to parliamentary debate. Some interfaces provide basic graph presentations of the results, but do not have direct clickable links to the data or allow general identification of patterns of language use. Hansard at Huddersfield addresses directly this problem of searchability. 

 **Routes to Impact** The development of the Hansard at Huddersfield interface involved extensive engagement with end\-user groups. In 2018, two meetings in Huddersfield and two meetings in London involved consultation with 41 people from local governments \(Leeds and Kirklees\), local and national historical societies, political organisations, and parliamentary organisations including History of Parliament, Hansard reporters and editors, parliamentary IT staff, Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, Education Policy Think Tank and non\-linguist academics \(historians and political scientists\). Development of the site also involved bimonthly meetings and discussions between 2018\-2020 with Hansard editors and later with the Parliamentary Digital Service \(PDS\) \(2020\). In March 2019, Jeffries launched the website at events in London and Huddersfield. The House of Lords event introduced the main features of the site and included a Q&A reception with over 40 attendees from History of Parliament, Commons Library, Institute for Government, Wikidata, Overseas Development Institute, political scientists, historians and members of both Houses of Parliament. The University of Huddersfield launch event included linguists, historians, librarians, archivists, and representatives of Leeds City Council and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Between September 2019 and March 2020, five bespoke workshops demonstrating use of the site and training were provided for the British Library; POLIS thinktank in Leeds; Greenhead Sixth Form College in Huddersfield; The People’s History Museum in Manchester, and the House of Commons Library, collectively reaching 67 participants. Throughout this period, Jeffries also engaged in several consultations with other parliaments’ record\-makers, including a round\-table discussion with members of the Hellenic OCR team of the Greek parliamentary data service and an email exchange with the editor of the Australian parliament’s Hansard. The Hansard team also maintains an active social media presence to engage a wider audience, with a Twitter following of over 660 people and organisations including MPs \(e.g. Alison McGovern, Layla Moran and Jason McCartney\); Peers \(e.g. Lord Norton of Louth\); parliamentary groups \(e.g. Lords EU Committee Legal Advisor: Alexander Horne; Procedure Committee Parliament\); research organisations \(e.g. Study of Parliament Group; Political Studies Association sub\-groups\); think tanks \(e.g. Rethink; Politaeia; Democratic Audit\) and educational groups \(e.g. Citizens Project; Westminster Skills Centre\). These diverse pathways have resulted in changing the way parliamentary producers of Hansard perceive their data; influenced the PDS’ plans for the electronic future of Hansard; improved the way in which Hansard users access data; and informed the work of a group in Greece creating digital versions of their own parliamentary data, as outlined below. 

 **Changing the way in which the producers of Hansard perceive their data** The principal impact of this project has been to change perceptions and behaviour in parliament among Hansard staff who produce the raw data, including the editors of Hansard \(Lords\) and Hansard \(Commons\). The Editor of Hansard \(Lords\) writes: “ *The main impact that Lesley’s work has had on me and my team is in relation to the way in which we perceive what we publish* \[…\] *Her website* **\[3.6\]** *has demonstrated to my satisfaction that the types of search and visualisation available there can enhance the scrutiny of parliamentary debate by allowing users to find patterns of topic and linguistic usage that would not be accessible in the other online versions of official Hansard* \[...\] *The impact on our team’s daily working has been to sharpen our awareness of the editing principles we apply in our work; any word can be important to researchers interested in parliamentary language and how we apply our terms of reference could skew their research if we edit inappropriately*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 As a result of this change of perception and conviction of the value of the work, the Hansard \(Lords\) Editor initiated planning for new digital versions of the data: “ *One of the outcomes of our collaboration with Lesley’s team has been that I initiated a series of discussions with the Parliamentary Digital Service* \[PDS\] *, which is responsible for maintaining, among much else, the electronic version of Hansard for the public. We wanted to find a way to extend the project in order to maximise the potential for it to become sustainable* \[…\] *The result of these discussions is that* \[…\] \[PDS\] *has funded an extension to the Hansard at Huddersfield project* \[November 2020\] *to the tune of £44,312.26 \(for one year in the first instance\), the ultimate purpose of which is to work towards some kind of integration of the Hansard at Huddersfield approach to searchability* **\[3.6\]** *into the official site*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Influencing plans for Hansard’s electronic future** As a result of this engagement with Hansard, Jeffries’ work has also influenced the perceptions of the staff at PDS responsible for Hansard’s digital presentation and for delivering parliament’s Open Data policy. Jeffries and von Lunen have engaged in four meetings with staff of PDS, including the Director of Data & Search Transformation and the Head of Open Data. These meetings raised awareness of the problems inherent in the PDS configuration of the data for incorporating the Huddersfield approach: “... *the work of Lesley Jeffries and her team at Huddersfield University*... \[is\] *providing additional and beneficial search capability over the Hansard Data and* \[their work is\] *mitigating some of the issues that had resulted from the status of the* \[existing\] *Data platform”*. Drawing on the Hansard research, “ *a business case was produced and approved ... to extend it* \[the collaboration between Parliament and Hansard at Huddersfield\] *to derive learnings that will be fed into the strategic data platform.”* Through the collaboration with Huddersfield, *“We expect to better understand impacts of poor data quality or poor linkage, acquire knowledge of search requirements of external users and document requirements that will improve our taxonomies to feed into the target solution as we collaborate at the same time as existing Parliamentary users continue to get benefit from the service”.* **\[5.2\]**. 

 **Improving the way in which Hansard users access the data** Mindful of the need to interpret the results of searches on their site with care, the Hansard at Huddersfield team produced materials specifically designed to develop the understanding and usage of the site by historical, political and policy researchers. Researchers in history and politics fields have been enthusiastic in taking up what the site has to offer. For example, a historian noted how the site’s innovative use of corpus linguistics helps historians and the public exploit the Hansard database better: “ *The* \[Hansard at Huddersfield\] *project is attempting to address the issue of inaccurate or inappropriate search results and thus reduce the likelihood that the end user’s research will be skewed by an inability to understand or properly exploit the data available*” **\[5.3\]**. Other historians have utilised visualisations generated from the site to communicate their research with wider, non\-academic audiences. For example, graphs generated by Hansard at Huddersfield have been used in one historian’s public presentation “Remembering Peterloo: protest, satire and reform”, hosted at the Palace of Westminster by the History of Parliament Trust, The Parliamentary Archives and the Citizens Project in July 2019 **\[5.4\]** and by another historian in a 2019 blog on the historic debtor sanctuaries of London **\[5.5\]**. Similarly, political researchers have used the site to make claims about the content of Hansard contributions, for example by using a Hansard at Huddersfield distribution graph that showed a nearly six\-fold increase in relative frequency of the words *constituency* or *constituent\(s\)* in Commons Hansard between 1950 and 2019 as a “high\-quality proxy” for determining MPs’ constituency focus **\[5.6\]**. This author comments on the possibilities of advanced analysis enabled by the site, writing: “ *Hansard At Huddersfield uses wordclouds to display the discussions of Parliament as a whole: this could be applied to MPs as individuals in order to convey information such as their ‘focus’ without the use of dubiously precise statistics”*; and they acknowledge the site’s appeal in making parliamentary data accessible: *“Thanks are also due to* \[…\] *Hansard At Huddersfield for providing easy\-to\-use access to Parliamentary data*” **\[5.6\]**. In addition, the take\-up of the site by non\-HE\-based researchers has been encouraging, with the site being listed as a resource by the Parliamentary Archives and the History of Parliament Trust **\[5.7\]**. 

 There has been a similarly positive response to the site from sixth\-form students, particularly in relation to their individual projects for the Extended Project Qualification \(EPQ\). The Head of EPQ at Greenhead College, Huddersfield, notes the value of being able to search across a dataset and not just find single moments/speakers/debates: “ *Students working on topics where the political dimension is relevant have found the website a very useful way into the data and the visualisations provided by the site have been used by at least one student in their final reports as well*” **\[5.8\]**. The site has also impacted the behaviour of teachers who introduced to their students and listed it as a resource: “ *We have made certain that the EPQ students are aware of this resource by showing students how to use it in lessons and putting a link on the EPQ moodle* \[Virtual Learning Environment\] *page direct to Hansard at Huddersfield*” **\[5.8\]**. 

 Feedback from users on social media also demonstrates users’ appreciation of the new possibilities opened up by the site: 

-  @edwardwood99: “Great presentation by @HansardHuds showing off their brilliant search tool in @UKParliament. All sorts of possibilities for linguistic analysis” 

-  @TheVictCommons: “Congratulations @HansardHuds – it was great to see how your website has developed since we first saw it & we look forward to exploring how we can use it in our @HistParl research” 

-  @generalising: “Back from the launch of @HansardHuds. Really promising site and well worth a play – some very fun ways to get into the data compared to the old Historic Hansard.” **\[5.9\]** 

 **Informing the work of a group in Greece working on parliamentary data** Whilst not all parliaments have data to match the extent of the UK Hansard, there are the beginnings of digitisation around the world. In Greece, for example, Jeffries’ approach has informed the early stages of an open data project using a crowdsourcing approach to the digitisation and processing of parliamentary data. The Hellenic Optical Character Recognition \(OCR\) Team is acknowledged as an interoperability solution by EU’s Joinup.eu, as well as an innovative practice by the Inter\-Parliamentary Union, and currently counts 40 members in 10 countries. The Leader of the Team at the Hellenic Government of Greece writes: “ *In Hansard at Huddersfield, we were able to identify a competent and reliable partner.* \[...\] *Through talks, we agreed to the exchange of knowhow, methods and code to jointly tackle common challenges that are related not only to data openness but also to increased visibility and understanding of parliamentary data sources. Our frequent exchange with Hansard at Huddersfield has certainly sparked further innovation within our team and it is not exaggerated to say that the Huddersfield approach has influenced the design and development of Xtralingua, our latest open tool for textual analysis*” **\[5.10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Centenary of WW1 2014\-19 represented an opportunity for researchers to change and broaden public perceptions of the conflict’s history. Sharp used her research into women’s anti\-war activism in Germany and Britain to counterbalance the battle\-centric and thus male\-centred approach that characterised the planned commemorations. The only researcher working on German resistance to WW1 during the period, she co\-founded a national Peace History Working Group to amplify and internationalise peace narratives and bring marginalised stories to the public’s attention. 

 Her work has: 

-  raised the public profile of the anti\-war narrative during the centenary; 

-  centred women’s anti\-war activism, raising public awareness of the range of positions taken by women; 

-  inspired local history and community groups to explore anti\-war activism; 

-  changed public understanding of and attitudes to German resistance to war; 

-  changed the practice of external partners from the peace activist and engaged arts communities.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Sharp’s research locates and amplifies marginalized and hidden voices, especially those of political women and anti\-war activists. Much of her work on WW1 and its aftermath focuses on rebalancing scholarly narratives to take account of the experience of defeated nations and to make the resistance within these nations visible. She argues that including these voices does not simply add to our historical understanding, it fundamentally changes it. 

 Based on archival research conducted between 2004 and 2019, Sharp is sole or co\-author of a substantial body of academic publications on women’s organised response to WW1 and its aftermath within and beyond Germany. Since 2005, Sharp has attracted RCUK funding to consolidate links between and coordinate the activities of an international network of feminist WW1 scholars, and this is reflected in her co\-edited and co\-authored publications **\[1**\- **4\]**. 

 Her 2007 co\-edited volume **\[1\]** was the first in a series of distinctive comparative works that make Central and Eastern European scholarship accessible to Anglophone readerships through collaboration and co\-authorship. It examines women’s war activism from 1914 to 1919, with the tight time\-frame allowing international commonalities and differences to emerge. A second volume in 2011 **\[2\]** extended the sphere of investigation to women’s hitherto under\-researched transnational activism and organisation in the immediate aftermath of WW1, while a third in 2017 **\[3\]** explored women’s war activism thematically in chapters co\-authored by international teams. 

 Sharp also co\-authored three Special Issues in 2007, 2016 and 2018, of which **\[4\]** reflects on the centenary from an international gender history perspective, finding a common pattern of neglect of women’s wartime experiences in most European nations, countered by members of Sharp’s feminist scholar network intervening in public narratives **\[1\-4\]**. 

 Based on ongoing archival research into the German revolution of 1918, **\[5\]** is one of the first scholarly articles to make women visible as revolutionary political agents and place them at the centre of the narrative. This moves us beyond the stalemate of historical interpretations based on a very narrow view of the revolution in terms of time, space and sphere of action. It places the events of October \- November 1918 within a broader revolutionary cultural context, arguing that without the participation of women in widespread industrial unrest and anti\-war protest from early 1915, the revolution could not have spread. 

 Comparing feminist anti\-war activism during WW1 with the principles and implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 \(2000\), **\[6\]** examines the legacy of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, founded during WW1 and still active as an NGO today. Together with a cultural history of peace \(1815\-1920\) published in March 2020, this work challenges the periodisation that uses war and conflict as the dominant framework for interpreting the past. Focussing instead on developments conducive to fostering sustainable peace such as campaigns for social and gender justice, food security, public health and democracy allows the underlying continuities in these areas to emerge and radically changes our perspective. Sharp’s push to include dissenting and diverse voices in the historical narratives around WW1 is essential to counter persistent claims of national enthusiasm for war in either Britain or Germany. 

 Sharp’s research into marginal voices and scholarship is ongoing, with three further publications forthcoming and a book contract on international revolutionary women with Bloomsbury for submission in 2021.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Sharp noted that dissenting voices and German perspectives, particularly women’s anti\-war activism, were being overlooked in the UK’s WW1 centenary commemorations, and sought to embed them into the public narrative. The main beneficiaries were Sharp’s external partners from the peace history and activist community, the creative and heritage industries as well as theatre, conference and exhibition audiences and MOOC learners. 

 **\(i\) Peace History and Activism:** **amplifying and internationalising anti\-war voices.** 

 Sharp worked closely with leading activists within the peace community, sharing her knowledge of German anti\-war resistance and women’s role within it and inspiring others to make their own contributions to peace history awareness. This work was informed by her study of the historical roots of contemporary peace organisations and the many continuities that help us understand and measure the effectiveness of anti\-war campaigns over time. 

 The reach and resonance of Sharp’s research is reflected in the unusually high number of national and international invitations to contribute to commemorative events beyond the academy, including some high profile international events such as the German Foreign Office \(December 2014\), the Kiel Maritime Museum \(March 2016\), the Kansas National WW1 Museum, America’s official WW1 museum and memorial \(October 2017\), the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom centenary conference in Zurich \(May 2019\), and the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education, South Africa **\[I\]**. 

 Between 2014 and 2019, Sharp’s public\-facing activities included 53 related talks, interviews, podcasts and lectures locally, nationally and internationally as well as published articles for a wider readership **\[I\]**. The scale and scope of the interventions show that Sharp’s ongoing and sustained efforts to link her historical research to present\-day anti\-war and gender activism resonated strongly with the public. In 2016, she organised two public\-facing international peace history conferences in Leeds in 2016 \(300 delegates from activist and academic communities\), that took a comparative approach across several countries to questions of gender and peace history. 

 In 2014, Sharp co\-founded the national Peace History working group, which brought activists and academics together to coordinate and amplify peace history efforts during the centenary. She worked in particular with the Convenor of the Peace History working group and Peace History Conferences at the Imperial War Museum, who is also a member of the First World War Peace Forum, and a Vice\-President of the international peace society Pax Christi. For this person Sharp’s work ‘brought an otherwise missing dimension’ to their events, and made it ‘impossible to consider planning a WW1 “peace history” event that did not examine the German experience’ **\[A\]**. She felt that Sharp’s inclusive approach ‘made a real difference, helping to bridge the gap between academics and campaigners’ and thus challenging entrenched hierarchies of knowledge. In particular, it stimulated local groups ‘to research the history of opposition to the war in their area, to create exhibitions and local events of their own to mark the centenary – and to make sure the experience of women was included’ **\[A\]**. 

 **\(ii\) **Women of Aktion:** play and exhibition** 

 **Changed Practice** 

 Sharp worked collaboratively over 18 months with partners Bent Architect Theatre Company \(BA\), on the *Women of Aktion* theatre project, focused on the Kiel Uprising **\[E\]**. BA is a socially engaged theatre company with a commitment to bringing lesser known historical stories to the contemporary stage which brings cultural value to Bradford, a culturally diverse city with a high proportion of economically deprived citizens. Sharp’s research and translations of primary sources in German allowed BA to create a historically accurate and ethically justifiable portrayal of the protagonists, which spoke powerfully to the audience’s emotions and sense of justice. BA attest that their experience of working with Sharp caused a shift from highly localised, site\-specific projects to a more ambitious national and international approach. ‘It is the first time we have toured abroad’ and ‘we reached new and wider audiences with untold history’ **\[D\]**. Sharp’s input enabled a more nuanced, layered historical understanding and gave BA access to German\-language materials. ‘It’s really brought us on professionally, I think it’s really changed the way that we will work from now on’ **\[C\]** ‘and opened up a whole new working methodology for us’ **\[D\]**. 

 **Changed Understanding** 

 The play has won critical accolades as a piece of theatre \( **\[H/i\]** ‘What’s on Stage Top Pick’ 30.10.2019\) that was ‘powerful, funny and taught me loads\!’ **\[H/iii\]** and successfully ‘sneaks research into an engaging and entertaining show.’ **\[H/iii\]** It toured in theatres in the UK and Germany, with 17 performances reaching a total audience of 1,000. Audience responses recorded on film **\[C\]** and social media show empathy with the characters’ suffering, admiration for the women and surprise, even anger, that these powerful stories had been suppressed **\[H/iii\]**. This was especially important in the German city of Kiel, where the city’s role in the revolution has historically been forgotten or considered shameful **\[F\]** and the commemoration privileged male accounts while erasing women’s history. One viewer commented: ‘The actors play their roles with such appealing energy that you can’t help sharing their outrage at being left out of the history of the revolution.’ **\[H/iii\]** 

 Sharp also worked with the Chair of the Bradford Peace Museum to produce an exhibition entitled *Women of Aktion* informed by her research insights into women’s contribution to the Kiel Uprising of November 1918. The exhibition has so far been displayed at the Bradford Peace Museum, a pop\-up shop in Bradford city centre, MShed Bristol, Manchester Central Library, Manchester Working Class Library, Leeds City Museum, Glasgow Women’s Library and Richmond Barracks, Dublin, mostly accompanied by public talks. Commenting on the Bradford iteration, the Museum Chair noted that ‘For a largely British audience, used to a male, military, patriotic and establishment analysis of that time, it was revelatory to engage with narrative and critique that were female, civilian, German and revolutionary’ and that Sharp’s input had ‘changed the historical understanding and perception of all who engaged with it’ **\[B\]**. Responses elsewhere have included emotional engagement and identification with the revolutionary women: ‘\[t\]he rallying call of revolutionary German foremothers echoes down the century’ **\[H/iv\]** \(Tweet 30/08/2019\). 

 Further plans to exhibit as part of the Newington Green Revolutionary Ideas since 1708 festival  in April\-May 2020 were interrupted by COVID\-19. The project has an accessible database **\[G\]** that offers a template for academics wanting to work effectively with creative partners, reflections on the project and teaching materials including mini\-lectures, worksheets and summaries for schools and colleges wishing to follow up on topics raised by the project. 

 **\(iii\) MOOC: **Changing Faces of Heroism 

 Sharp led the Leeds bid to work in partnership with the BBC, culminating in the BBC/Futurelearn MOOC ‘Changing Faces of Heroism’/’Heroism through Art and Culture’. This reached a global audience \(39,172 participants from all inhabited continents registered from October 2014 to December 2018\) and attracted highly positive evaluations and 22,550 unique participant comments, 2,344 specifically on Germany **\[J\]**. Sharp’s transnational anti\-war activism research was prominent in the course, challenging dominant attitudes to heroism coded as masculine and nationalist. 

 Participants’ comments and engagement reveal that they thought more comparatively and critically about a wider range of heroic figures, including women, war resisters and German nationals as the course progressed. E.g. ‘Where have I been all this time\! I have been giving the women who took part in the war very little consideration and got swept along with the attention given to the men’ **\[J\]** \(comment ID 2555400\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Older women with breast cancer have poorer outcomes than younger women, partly due to the non\-standard treatment they receive.  As there is little to guide older patients or clinicians when faced with a treatment choice, decisions are often based on personal preference, rather than being evidence\-based. Sheffield Hallam research developed a decision support intervention \(DESI\) to guide optimal, personalised treatment for older women with certain breast cancers. This led to: changes in clinical practice and treatment received, improved patient knowledge, greater shared decision\-making, enhanced quality of life and a sense of empowerment. The DESI has benefitted both clinicians and older women with breast cancer. The DESI quickly achieved global reach, having been used by clinicians on all six continents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The standard treatment for women with oestrogen sensitive breast cancer is surgery plus endocrine therapy. However, there is a group of women \- those aged 70 and older with \- for whom there is an undetermined difference in treatment outcome, whether they have surgery plus endocrine therapy, or primary endocrine therapy alone. These are likely to be women who are older, less fit or frail, and with a life expectancy of 2\-3 years.  This is largely due to the lack of women in this age group in clinical trials.  In this scenario the choice of treatment is often one of personal preference.  Women ≥70 years of age with breast cancer are consequently less likely to receive surgery \(standard treatment\), which may contribute to the inferior outcomes. Since there is little research to guide best practice or support treatment decision\-making, there is wide variation in treatment across cancer units. 

 Lack of evidence\-based guidance is a significant issue, as there are 2 million cases of breast cancer globally \(WHO 2018\) and 55,000 new cases annually in the UK, with 13,000 in women over 75 years of age \(Breast Cancer UK 2020\).  Sheffield Hallam’s Age Gap study identified and calculated the key elements which allow prediction of outcome in this group of women.  The Age Gap study particularly responded to challenges set to: i\) address this wide variation in treatment \( *Breast Cancer Clinical Outcome Measures*, 2007\) and, ii\) improve patients' treatment information and shared decision\-making \( *Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS*, Department of Health, 2010\). 

 The Age Gap study was a GBP1,900,000 NIHR\-funded programme collaboration between the universities of Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam and Cardiff. The Sheffield Hallam team comprised Professor Karen Collins and Dr Maria Burton. Professor Collins was key in the development of the proposal and a co\-applicant. She has extensive expertise in cancer research and public and patient involvement in health research \(retired May 2018\). Dr Burton is a senior researcher, with significant experience of qualitative and mixed methods research with older adults, who has remained with the study since its inception. The Sheffield Hallam team were responsible for all the underpinning qualitative elements of the DESI development, for user training and implementation in the randomised controlled trial \(RCT\), and for the planning, execution and analysis of the concurrent process evaluation. The study had two phases: 

 **Phase one** consisted of a multi\-centre cohort study that recruited 3,375 women \(≥70\) with operable breast cancer from 56 sites across the UK \( **R1**\).  The aims were to: i\) determine the patient and cancer characteristics which predict whether primary endocrine therapy is safe and effective in breast cancer treatment, and ii\) produce a DESI to support shared treatment decision making. 

 The DESI was developed to support the choice between surgery and endocrine therapy, and primary endocrine therapy. It consists of a brief decision aid \(a summary of frequently asked questions\), a booklet about treatment choices, and a clinician\-facing online treatment decision tool. 

 Online tools exist to support decision\-making in cancer \(e.g. NHS PREDICT and Adjuvant On\-Line\), but no tool existed where there was a choice of surgery and endocrine therapy, or primary endocrine therapy alone. The Age Gap DESI was rigorously developed using cancer registry data, an evidence synthesis to understand the information needs of older women, and with input from 46 patients, 14 healthy volunteers and 25 clinicians \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\). The Age Gap DESI is unique, as it is underpinned by data solely from women ≥70. 

 The online tool allows prediction of survival outcomes, stratified by age, co\-morbidity and frailty, depending on the type of treatment the woman receives \(freely available at  [https://agegap.shef.ac.uk/](https://agegap.shef.ac.uk/)\). It also produces personalised patient survival estimates for differing treatments, providing the ability to calculate individually\-tailored decisions about treatments. 

 **Phase two** was a cluster randomised controlled trial \(cRCT\) that tested the impact of the DESI on treatment decisions \( **R5**\). To understand how the intervention worked in clinical practice, a process evaluation was also undertaken. The aims of the cRCT were to test whether the DESI would improve: i\) quality of life \(QoL\) and ultimately the cancer outcomes, and ii\) the treatment decision\-making experience of older women with breast cancer, in line with the *NHS Long Term Plan*. 

 46 breast units were randomised \(21 intervention, 25 control\) and recruited 1,339 women \(670 intervention, 669 control\). Clinicians and patients reported benefits of using the DESI, specifically enhanced information and knowledge leading to altered treatment choice, and increased confidence and involvement in discussion and decision\-making \( **R5**\). 

 The Age Gap study was the first of its kind in the world and has provided evidence and tools to address the need for improved cancer outcomes and shared decision\-making, identified in the *NHS Long Term Plan*, the *NHS Constitution*, and *Achieving World\-Class Cancer Outcomes: A Strategy for England 2015\-2020*.  The scale, design and rigour of the study led to the collection of high\-quality data from over 3300 older women, something previously shown to be unachievable \( **R6**\), enabling the online tool to be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Global Usage of the Age Gap DESI 

 Since becoming available in November 2019, the clinician\-facing online tool has been used increasingly at cancer treatment sites across the world. Figures to December 2020 show 10,257 accesses \(Figure 1\), across 449 cities, in 69 countries, and all six continents. To\-date the greatest uptake is in Europe \(56.3%\), followed by North America \(28%\), Asia \(10.6%\), with Africa, Oceania and South America 3.8% collectively \(Figure 2\). Of the 10,257 accesses, it was used on 7,571 occasions to calculate outcomes for surgery and endocrine therapy, or primary endocrine therapy alone; and 2,382 to calculate outcomes for surgery and chemotherapy, or surgery and no chemotherapy; demonstrating the immediate value of the tool to clinicians. On 304 occasions the information was also printed out for patients’ use; although the tool can produce a leaflet demonstrating the outcomes for the patients, clinicians are selective about which patients this would be most appropriate for. \( **E1**, **E2**\) 



 Figure 1: Three\-monthly usage of the Age Gap DESI, from its launch to Dec 2020 

 Figure 1 illustrates an upward trajectory in use of the tool, but also how the Covid\-19 pandemic affected its use. Following submission of the final study report in July 2020, and the dissemination via virtual events, media coverage grew significantly \( **E3**\), leading to an upsurge in clinician usage in Period 6 \(Figure 1; note P7 is half the duration of the other periods\). 

 Figure 2: Global usage of the Age Gap Tool \(Nov 2019\-Dec 2020\) 

####  Change in Clinical Practice 

 Following the introduction of the DESI, clinicians \- predominantly surgeons \- reported a change in clinical decision\-making and practice \( **E4**\). Prior to the tool being available, the treatment was largely based on clinician preference, with age shown to be an independent factor in that decision, contrary to the NICE guidelines \(CG80\). 

 The tool demonstrated to the surgeons that in some patients, primary endocrine therapy could be more beneficial than surgery, and vice\-versa. The survival figures calculated by the tool, were sometimes unexpected and, when faced with this, they were forced to rethink the appropriateness of their usual management: *“When I look at the two \[treatment options\]… it says... there’s hardly a two or three percent difference, but when I look at the graphs... \[it\] sways me one way or the other... In a lot of patients that I would have thought that they must have been better off with surgery, the tool swayed me… and also the patients; so it has changed in my practice.”* \(Consultant Oncoplastic Breast Surgeon, Participant 2\) \( **E4**\) 

 “W *hereas previously \[prior to the tool\] I would have just said, I think you should have an operation. So, I think in that respect it’s probably meant that I would have the discussion with more people about endocrine therapy, \[rather\] than just surgery…. I’m certainly having a better discussion with the patients.”* \(Consultant Surgeon, Participant 5\) \( **E4**\) 

 Clinicians were pleased to have evidence\-based information, presented as numbers, as this supported their data\-led preferences: *“It has \[impacted on own clinical decision\-making\] because now I have got something that I can solidly… tell somebody.”* \(Consultant Breast Surgeon, Participant 4\) \( **E4**\) 

 The graphical representation of the outcomes was clear and provided a common platform to discuss treatment selection with the patient and/or families/carers.  This had the effect of changing the dynamic of the consultation. Clinicians thought that information from the DESI gave the patient confidence to engage in the decision\-making process and feel more content with their treatment decision. This encouraged their continued use of the DESI: *“I think that the... interventions \[have\] been really good at… empowering patients and helping them make a decision, and we've felt that patients are much more part of the decision making.”* \(Consultant Breast Surgeon, Participant 4\) \( **E4**\) 

 The DESI is not only changing practice, it is also influencing the education of clinicians \- it has been included in the *Communicating Evidence to Patients* course run by University of Cambridge’s Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication as an example of good practice.  [https://moodle.wintoncentre.uk/](https://moodle.wintoncentre.uk/) \( **E5**\) 

####  Impact on Patient Experience 

 Patients interviewed said they felt involved in the decision\-making process, stating that the combination of information formats, i.e. the written and the numeric information, helped them more fully understand the options and possible outcomes, and had given them the confidence and knowledge to engage in the consultation. \( **E4**\) 

 This sense of greater shared decision\-making from the patients’ point of view was confirmed by high scores in CollboRATE, a validated measure of this, and was further supported by a bespoke questionnaire to assess knowledge of treatment options, which similarly demonstrated improved scores \( **E6**\).  These patient experiences are entirely consistent with those of clinicians, suggesting that both were being assisted to make better informed decisions about treatments, upon which they agreed. Patients also found the written information prompted further questions, which they raised during future consultations. Some described how this helped them cope with the treatment journey, as they understood the process and what to expect: *”I thought \[the sheet\] was very good... I’ve always thought it’s good to be able to read these things and see what they think. \[It\] gives you a good idea what's happening, because sometimes people, you know, they seem to clam up, saying the big C and oh, oh. Silence\! But...I don’t believe in that.”* \(82 year\-old surgery patient\) \( **E4**\) 

 The evidence of these impacts supports the plans of the NHS *Five Year Forward View* \(2014\) and the NICE *Shared Decision\-Making Collaborative \- An Action Plan* \(2016\), which commit to empower patients by providing up\-to\-date information about the possible treatments \- to enable them to make more informed decisions. It can also be viewed as a practical step towards nurturing a culture of shared decision\-making \- by providing tailored, patient friendly information to facilitate informed patient choice, as highlighted in the Macmillan report *Cancer in the UK 2014: State of the Nation*. In short, the DESI helped to bring about long\-awaited relational improvements between clinicians and a vulnerable group of older patients, marking an important shift towards an inclusive culture of decision\-making, at a critical time in the life course of these women. 

 The capability for the Age Gap Tool<sup>©</sup> to impact on the treatment and on the experience of older women with breast cancer has been recognised by Professor Riccardo Audisio \(University of Gothenburg\) who  [tweeted](https://twitter.com/raaudisio/status/1222293350935617538) \(28/1/20\): "" *There is no doubt that the*  [*@AgeGapStudy*](https://twitter.com/AgeGapStudy) *will contribute to bringing to an end the under treatment of older women with breast cancer.""*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by the Centre on Migration, Policy and Society \(COMPAS\) at the University of Oxford led to the establishment of a knowledge\-exchange network with a core group of European cities that has now directly engaged 44 cities in an unprecedented dialogue on a highly sensitive issue: municipal service provision to irregular \(‘illegal’\) migrants. The network – the *City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status \(C\-MISE*\)  – has published comprehensive guidance and a video documentary, promoted to 47 countries by the Council of Europe and to 140 cities by the Intercultural Cities network. This work has already led to reforms by 8 cities relating to additional provision of healthcare, shelter, legal advice and other services, impacting on migrants and other residents; and to a linked, city\-led, parallel initiative in Italy. For the UK, the research directly led to an award\-winning, online diagnostic tool, used 39,616 times by local authorities, advice agencies and individuals, to assess eligibility of destitute migrant children for shelter and subsistence support. The EU Victims Strategy \(2020\) adopted a research recommendation to extend protection to victims with irregular status.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Centre on Migration, Policy and Society \(COMPAS\) is within the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography at the University of Oxford. COMPAS led a research programme on national and municipal responses to irregular \(‘undocumented’ or ‘illegal’\) migrants \(2012\-2020\) consisting of three related studies: 

1.  The first study \(2012\-2018\) by Spencer, Hughes and Delvino, investigated national and municipal policy responses to irregular migrants in continental Europe \( **R1\)**.  Irregular migrants are not authorised to be in the country and service provision to them is a sensitive issue. The aim was to investigate the apparent paradox that irregular migrants are provided with some public services while simultaneously subject to removal from the country by immigration authorities. The researchers conducted the first mapping of national legal provisions on access to healthcare and education across the then EU28, revealing a starkly uneven geography of rights and restrictions \( **R4**\), including for children \( **R3**\). More than 100 interviews with policy makers and civil society representatives in 14 countries were conducted to establish the reasons for provision of services, including access to shelter and legal advice. The study found that a range of economic and social policy imperatives, including public health, tackling homelessness, and child protection, as well as human rights obligations, can require a level of inclusion in services, a need felt most keenly at the local level \( **R2**\). Providing access to services can lead to conflict with national governments but elsewhere controversy is avoided by low visibility provision. While city networks regularly discussed policy relating to legally resident migrants, on which guidance on ‘best practices’ was available, during the research it became apparent that cities had felt unable to discuss this more sensitive issue. They had no opportunity for peer\-to\-peer learning nor access to research evidence. The research provided a safe context in which that dialogue could take place and, identifying a need for ongoing knowledge exchange, led to the establishment of the *City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status* \(C\-MISE\). 

1.  The second study \(2013\-2015\), by Spencer and Price, investigated UK local authority practices in relation to destitute migrant children and their families who had irregular immigration status \( **R6**\). It focused on a local authority duty to protect children ‘in need’, including those who, because of their immigration status, have no right to access welfare benefits \(‘No Recourse to Public Funds’\). It found that the complexity of the law, and resistance by some local authorities, meant some destitute families are turned away by staff without their eligibility for accommodation and welfare support being assessed. For those whose eligibility was assessed, ideas on the relative ‘deservingness’ of migrant parents and children with irregular status played a part in decision making and outcomes \( **R3**\). Advice and support from a voluntary organisation was found to increase the chance of a family receiving support, but availability of that expertise was limited in parts of the country; a finding that prompted the researchers’ design of an online diagnostic tool. 

1.  The third study \(2018\-2020\), by Delvino, investigated the ability of irregular migrants to report if they are a victim or witness of crime without risking arrest and deportation, in the USA and Europe \( **R5**\).  It found that there are significant barriers faced by the victims in interacting with police authorities, with negative consequences for crime prevention and detection. Certain legal and policy innovations had been introduced in the USA \(where practice is more advanced\) and in four European countries to address this. The study identified implications for reform at EU, national and local levels.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Forming the City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status \(C\-MISE\)* 

 The first study, on national and municipal policy responses \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\) led Europe’s network of major cities, Eurocities, to partner with Spencer \(and COMPAS’ knowledge exchange arm, the Global Exchange on Migration and Diversity \(GEM\) which she led\) and Barcelona City Council in the first meeting of European cities to discuss provision of services to irregular migrants \(2014\). That dialogue, and the expectation that the refugee crisis \(2015\-2016\) would lead to a rise in the number of residents with irregular status, led to GEM securing funds to establish \(2017\) the *City Initiative on Migrants with Irregular Status \(C\-MISE*\). Initially a working group of 11 cities in 10 countries, chaired by the City of Utrecht, its aim was to build a stronger body of evidence and share learning on city practices in relation to migrants with irregular immigration status; disseminate guidance on key areas of service provision; and develop a shared, city perspective on relevant reforms in EU policy agendas. 

 Spencer and Delvino have since facilitated a programme of regular two\-day workshops where cities exchange knowledge on city practices, with input from the researchers. The research \( **R1\-R6**\) is reaching a wider audience through a key output, C\-MISE’s 79\-page Guidance for Municipalities \(2019 – **S1**\) which used the research to set out the rationales for service provision \( **R2**\) and practical examples \( **R1**\) of how to address the service needs of irregular migrants, such as their need for shelter, health care and legal advice. An executive summary is translated into 7 languages. It is accompanied by a video documentary \( **S1**\) featuring Deputy Mayors and officials explaining why and how services are provided. These have been circulated to the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe by its Congress of Regional and Local Authorities \(2019\); to the global Cities of Migration network; and to the 140 cities in the Intercultural Cities Network, all of which had formerly focused only on migrants with legal residence. 

 *Changing European cities’ approach to practice & policy regarding irregular migrants* 

 The research evidence \( **R1\-R6**\) and peer\-to\-peer learning in C\-MISE meetings, now directly engaging 44 cities in 17 countries, has led to changes in the practices of the participating cities. The former Chair of Eurocities’ Migration and Integration Working Group \(from Barcelona, **S8**\) says: “ *This seminal work was a turning point’* in how cities approach the issue. The City of Utrecht says “ *The combination of research of Oxford University and the practices and policy of cities across Europe is a huge step forward...That made it possible for us as a city and other major cities in Holland to have a more practical solution oriented approach*.” \( **S2**\) 

 The changes in practice cited here focus on reforms in 8 cities: Athens, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Ghent, Milan, Oslo, Utrecht and Zurich. 

-  Utrecht reports that the research evidence and broad city membership of C\-MISE empowered its negotiators in November 2018 to secure Dutch government agreement and funding to provide a municipal ‘Bed, Bath and Bread’ service to destitute irregular migrants. Utrecht \(estimated irregular migrant population, 3\-4,000\) also introduced a scheme for irregular migrants to be engaged in voluntary work to enhance their well being: “ *The research done the last 9 years by Oxford has helped a lot to reach this point of multi level cooperation so the impact is huge*” \( **S2**\). 

-  Ghent \(estimated irregular migrant population 4,700 of whom a third are children, and over two thirds are settled residents\) has secured approval to set up a Reception and Orientation service providing access to shelter and advice. Legal advice can establish if the individual could secure a right to stay or should return to their country of origin, and the research \( **R1**\) found high success rates for this approach: *“the C\-MISE guidance, derived from COMPAS's extensive research, was invaluable for us in providing examples of good practices abroad  …relating to shelter and related services, which we arê now developing here”* \( **S3**\). Ghent has also agreed a vision statement and strategy for its service provision: *“The evidence and analysis in the research demonstrated the importance of our having clarity on our reasons for service provision and hence contextualising our work within a document of this kind” .* Reporting on C\-MISE at the national level, securing the support of national agencies, helped secure a Federal Government commitment to pilot projects providing advice to irregular migrants on asylum residence and return options \( **S3**\).  The research \( **R1**, **R4**\) and learning from C\-MISE dialogues has been used by Frankfurt  \(estimated migrant population 25,000\-40,000\): the City Council has used it at its health clinic for irregular migrants as the basis for negotiating agreement with the city’s Social Welfare Department to set up a new unit, with a first year budget of EUR10,000, to which patients can be referred for legal advice and signposting to other council services where their eligibility for support will be assessed \( **S4**\). 

-  The research \( **R6**\) had demonstrated the important role of voluntary organisations in providing services for irregular migrants, taken forward as a priority in C\-MISE. 

 Athens \( **S5**\) and Oslo \( **S6**\) established advisory groups of voluntary organisations to provide them with advice on this issue, in each case contributing to a review of the city’s approach. 

-  The research \( **R1**\) also revealed a lack of data on irregular migrants who are not included in an official census. Zurich carried out a study to establish the number and characteristics of irregular migrants in the city \(estimate now confirmed of approximately 10,000 people\). This has provided a basis for reforms including a city identity card that would be available to irregular migrants \(who may have no other form of identification\). It also facilitated provision of financial support to these vulnerable residents during the Covid\-19 crisis. \( **S7\)** 

-  Barcelona \(estimated migrant population 30,000\) credits the research with providing ‘a solid framework’ for its 2017 strategy on irregular migrants, and has since developed, among other reforms, legal counselling for domestic workers, a development “ *definitely pushed by the fact that we are in the C\-MISE project*”\) \( **S8**\). 

-  Milan, attributing the effectiveness of C\-MISE to its ability ‘ *to combine the scientific in\-depth analysis and the learning process of practical solutions*’ consequently decided to strengthen its legal counselling service by locating it within its service for homeless people, the model already effectively used by Utrecht, and decided to open its advice and orientation service to people with irregular status \( **S9**\). 

 The beneficiaries of these reforms are *all* the residents in the municipal areas, through enhancing public health and crime prevention, for instance, not only those with irregular status. 

 *Developing an online diagnostic tool for local authorities in the UK*. 

 The findings of our UK study on destitute migrants \( **R6**\) led us to develop an online diagnostic tool to enable local authorities, advice agencies and migrants to assess eligibility for local authority support, a complex area of law. It “ *enables the individual to consider what steps they must take to improve their situation in the UK, whether this is through gaining employment, through accessing legal advice to regularise their immigration status \- or by making an informed decision to return to their country of origin*” \( **S10**\). Google\-metrics \(Jan 2017 to 3 December 2020\) showed there had then been 39,616 users of the tool; 79% of whom indicated they were at imminent risk of homelessness. In 2017 this tool won a UK Community Integration Award. We have now licensed the tool to the No Recourse to Public Funds network, housed at the London Borough of Islington, to ensure its long\-term sustainability online \( **S10**\). The British Red Cross, which assisted in the development of the tool, says \( **S11**\) the research \( **R6**\): “ *was central to identifying the need to better equip practitioners working in this area, and destitute migrant families themselves…..We use the tool interactively in casework sessions to work through a service user’s situation and demonstrate their eligibility for assistance…sometimes the only route to ensuring vulnerable children’s accommodation and living needs are met*”. 

 *Increasing protection of irregular migrants at national and European level.* 

 Responding to the need to translate the research into specific national contexts, the Association of Italian municipalities, ANCI, has established a working group of Italian municipalities to facilitate implementation of the C\-MISE guidance in Italy. At its first meeting, of 13 cities in December 2020, it decided to conduct a study of the legal opportunities to provide services and local good practices, to draw up proposals to the national government for reform; and identify methods for quantifying irregular migrants at the local level. \( **S9**\) 

 At European level, the evidence on barriers faced by migrant victims of crime \( **R5**\) in accessing safe ways to report crime influenced the content of the recent European Union Strategy on Victims’ Rights 2020\-2025 \( **S12**, footnote 74, citing **R5**\). For the first time it commits the European Commission \(EC\) to explore legislative proposals by 2022 on access to support for irregular migrants who are victims of crime; and urges EU Member States ‘ *to ensure that all victims, including migrant victims have access to justice independently of their residence status*’. An earlier session with the EC’s Directorate\-General Home was instrumental in its decision to set irregular migrants as the topic of the next country report of the European Migration Network, the function of which is to support EU policy making. 

 The Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants \(PICUM\), the highly regarded umbrella body of voluntary organisations across Europe in this field, states C\-MISE is *“making an impact by strengthening the role played by cities on the policy debates on irregular migrants both on the national as well as EU levels*” \( **S13**\). 

 At UN level, our research on access to health \( **R1**, **R4**\) led the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to appoint Delvino to report on the municipal contribution to irregular migrants’ access to healthcare \(2019\), and to host a dialogue between international human rights bodies and local authorities for the first time on this issue. This led to the publication of the first UN report, prepared by Delvino, promoting and recommending local practices for the enjoyment of irregular migrants’ right to health \( **S14**\). The UN office confirmed Delvino’s contribution to this report, stating that his ‘ *desk and field research, as well as his contribution to the drafting of the report, proved very valuable. The networks that* \[he is\] *involved in further proved an asset for the early identification of promising practices by local authorities and civil society*’ \( **S15**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Understanding Agency and Resistance Strategies: Children in Situations of Domestic Abuse \(UNARS\) \(2014\-15\) was the largest qualitative study of children's experiences and coping strategies, after living in situations of domestic abuse. The project brought together partners from Greece, Italy, Spain and the UK. Key findings focused on children’s capacity for agency after domestic abuse and highlighted their direct lived experience of domestic abuse and coercive control. It recommended that children’s direct experience of domestic abuse needed to be explicitly recognised in policy and practice, to support children’s recovery more effectively. Through work with multidisciplinary practitioners and organisations, the project has demonstrably shaped policy and practice in several European countries \(e.g. Italy, Spain and England\), the USA, and New Zealand. In the USA, UNARS is extensively used in federal social work guidance for families impacted by domestic abuse, and in the UK UNARS has directly shaped the way children and young people are conceptualised in the *Domestic Abuse Bill 2021* for England and Wales.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Dr Jane **Callaghan** was Principal Investigator for UNARS, a two\-year project funded through the European Commission's Daphne III programme. With partners in Italy, Greece, Spain and England, it was the world’s largest qualitative study of children's experiences of domestic abuse, focusing specifically on how children cope with, and recover from, domestic abuse. Outputs have evidenced how children experience coercion, constriction and constraint, and explored their agency and resistance strategies **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. UNARS has challenged the focus in domestic abuse policy/practice on the adult dyad, demonstrating that children are direct victims of domestic abuse and directly impacted by coercive and controlling behaviours in families where domestic abuse occurs. 

 In each participating country, the project team developed detailed, contextually and culturally nuanced understandings of children and young people's experiences of living with domestic violence, and of the service and policy landscapes within which their experiences were located. 107 children were involved in semi\-structured and photo elicitation\-based interviews across partner countries. UNARS revealed how children manage experiences of domestic abuse and violence. It highlighted children's resilience and agency in coping in such situations and their right to representation in policy/practice **\[3.1\]**. Outputs from the project highlighted play, creativity, children’s management of disclosure and their use of space **\[3.3\]** as resources for coping and recovery, enabling children to retain a sense of relational connectedness and agency, despite violence and control **\[3.3\]**. Findings evidenced how children are impacted by violence, but are also resilient and active agents, making purposeful attempts to protect themselves and other family members, to heal and to build positive self\-identities during and post\-violence. The research identified this as a kind of *paradoxical resilience* **\[3.1, 3.4, 3.5\]**: what may appear as ‘dysfunctional’ and difficult in the eyes of clinically trained adults, is often the way that children have found to cope in highly located, creative and agentic ways. 

  

 The research concluded that children directly experience domestic abuse, and cannot be understood as either ‘witnesses’ or as ‘collateral damage’ to adult domestic violence and abuse: rather, they are typically articulate, strategic and reflexive communicators **\[3.4\]**, whose voices and practices should be centred policies, practitioner training and services. Critiquing normative policy and professional discourses that position children as ‘damaged’ or as ‘witnesses’, the UNARS identifies the need for the language of national and regional policy to reflect children's agency **\[3.2\]**. The research advocated for more dedicated services for families who experience domestic violence and abuse, including more opportunities for children to play away from the gaze of adults **\[3.3\]**, more services for children to talk about and engage their experiences **\[3.1\]**, and further training for professionals **\[3.4, 3.5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 From the outset, UNARS was designed to co\-develop research\-led impacts with policy makers locally, nationally and internationally; young people who have experienced domestic abuse; and organisations and practitioners who work with them. In England and Wales it has had a direct influence on the development of the *Domestic Abuse Bill*, which will become law in 2021. 

  

 **Shaping the **Domestic Abuse Bill** 2021** 

 Drawing directly on UNARS findings, **Callaghan** has played a key national role in lobbying for better recognition of children’s direct experiences of domestic abuse in the *Domestic Abuse Bill* 2021. UNARS findings were shared in a wide range of policy/practice fora 2015\-2020, and were instrumental in building consensus that children should not be considered ‘collateral damage’ in domestic abuse, but that their lived experiences should be acknowledged in policy, guidance and practice **\[e.g. 5.1.1\-5.1.4\]**. **Callaghan** also presented at the inaugural meeting of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Domestic Violence **\[5.2.1\]**, re. ‘priorities for the forthcoming *Domestic Violence Act*’. As meeting minutes show, **Callaghan** stressed ‘that it is critical that our legal and policy framework reflects that children experience domestic abuse and coercive control – they are not only collateral damage’ **\[5.2.1\]** and this \(based directly on output **3.2**\), became a guiding tenet of ensuing discussion. UNARS research was specifically highlighted in the Group’s resulting recommendations \( *Creating a Truly Transformative Domestic Abuse Bill \(2017\-2018\)*\), in which **Callaghan**’s contributions are prominent throughout **\[5.2.2\]**. **Callaghan** subsequently provided expert testimony on children’s experiences to the Westminster Home Affairs Select Committee **\[5.2.3\]**: in their written report, the Committee drew directly on evidence provided by **Callaghan**, noting: “We are concerned that the Government’s proposed strategy makes no explicit additional provision for children who have experienced domestic abuse…We recommend that the devastating effect of domestic abuse on children is explicitly recognised in the legislation and that the Government develops a clear strategy to ensure that children experiencing domestic abuse are protected and given the support necessary to help them recover” **\[5.2.3\]**. The Home Affairs Select Committee Report explicitly builds on UNARS research: “Professor **Callaghan** told us that ‘the problem is too little legislation and too little direct recognition of their \(children’s\) status as victims’ **\[5.2.3\]**. Professor **Callaghan** recommended that the Bill explicitly recognise that, where other members of the family are present, they are also considered as direct victims of abuse. She proposed broader guidance for public bodies and for staff, including police officers, to be trained to respond to children and young people effectively and appropriately, and statutory obligations on local authorities in relation to the protection of children experiencing domestic abuse”. **Callaghan**’s input was drawn upon in detail in the Committee’s recommendations **\[5.2.4, recommendation 17\-18\]** which directly shaped the subsequent *Domestic Violence Act*. The government response to the Home Affairs report explicitly recognises this importance of recognising children’s direct experiences as victims of domestic abuse, and of not allowing their experiences to be obscured by the emphasis on adult victims **\[5.2.5\]**. 

 Building on this evidence\-based process, **Callaghan** has continued to work closely with a large collaborative of children’s and domestic abuse charities to lobby explicitly for improved recognition of children’s experiences in domestic abuse legislation, policy and guidance **\[5.2.6\]**. This resulted in significant changes to the second and the current draft of the Domestic Abuse Bill, which now incorporates extensive reference to children’s needs and is explicitly guided by **Callaghan**’s research. In particular **Callaghan** has worked closely with the national charity Action for Children to secure a duty on local authorities to provide services that recognise children’s direct experience of domestic abuse. Giving evidence on the re\-development of the *Domestic Abuse Bill* following consultation, Eleanor Briggs, Head of Policy for Action for Children, drew extensively on **Callaghan**’s work to argue for the importance of such a duty. 

 The second reading of the *Domestic Abuse Bill* in the House of Lords \(6 January 2021\) evidenced the extent to which UNARS evidence had been central in shaping and advocated for the *Domestic Abuse Bill*. For example, Baroness Williams explicitly recognised “that children growing up in a household where one adult is abusive towards another are as much victims of domestic abuse as the person being directly abused…\[the *Bill*\] expressly recognises this and will help to ensure that such children receive the support they need”. This was supported by Lord Rosser, who noted: “To address this reality, we also need a duty on public authorities to commission specialist services in the community for victims of abuse”, and that this should include specialist services for children, a position further echoed by Baroness Jenkin who noted the importance of community\-based services for children and young people in particular **\[5.2.7\]**. As of March 2021, the *Domestic Abuse Bill* is undergoing its third and final reading in the House of Lords, prior to Royal Assent. 

 **Inclusion in US Federal Guidance on Child Protection** 

 UNARS findings have been cited extensively in national guidance provided to social workers across the USA by the US Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families **\[5.3\]**. In particular this guidance highlights the importance of recognising children’s direct experiences of domestic abuse and challenging their positioning as passive witnesses or ‘collateral damage’. For example, this new federal guidance includes a practice guide on coercive control that extensively quotes UNARS evidence, to highlight the importance of social workers taking time to hear and understand children’s perspectives on domestic abuse. For example, directly citing UNARS evidence, the guidance recommends that social workers speak directly to all child victims, recognising their capacity to reflect on and describe their experiences, and that they recognise how the dynamics of coercive control might shape children’s relational experiences **\[5.3\]**. This guidance was made available to every social worker in the USA. 

 **National and International Policy Impacts** 

 The UNARS project had implications on policy\-makers across the EU. The UNARS team provided country\-specific policy analysis to stakeholders in Greece, Italy and Spain. In Spain, UNARS findings were incorporated into the implementation of the Istanbul Convention, and in 2016 **Callaghan** was invited to Estonia, to present the UNARS project to the Department of Justice, to influence their implementation of the Istanbul Convention **\[5.4\]**. In Puglia, Italy, a chapter on children as victims of domestic violence has been included in regional policy implementation guidance, as a consequence of the knowledge gained in this project. **Callaghan**’s expertise in family violence and child wellbeing also led to an invitation to provide evidence to Scottish government in 2019, relating to the proposed removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement in child abuse cases \(colloquially known as lifting the ‘smacking ban’\). Drawing directly on UNARS findings, **Callaghan** argued that children’s accounts of domestic abuse demonstrated clear associations between parental ‘chastisement’ and their experiences of other abuse within the family, and that the blurring of boundaries around apparently acceptable parental violence made it more challenging for children to identify domestic abuse when it occurred.  This evidence was influential in the removal of the defence in 2019 **\[5.5\]**. In 2016, **Callaghan** acted as expert advisor to the Department of Work and Pensions, to secure more sustained financial support for families fleeing domestic violence under the new ‘Universal Credit’ scheme. This reflected UNARS evidence that children often reported some masking of their responses to domestic abuse in the immediate aftermath, and that the difficulties that they might experience might only begin to **manifest** sometime after the family had fled **\[5.6\]**. 

 **Impacts on training and social work re. domestic violence** 

 UNARS provided evidence\-based training to strengthen methods and strategies for working with young people who have lived in situations of domestic violence to over 700 professionals in the UK \(211 professionals in 2\-3 day workshops, and 300 professionals in half day and one day workshops\). **Callaghan** also included UNARS evidence and resources in training provided by **Callaghan** to social workers through the national ‘Making Research Count Programme’. These training opportunities provided practitioners with knowledge and skills to understand and work more effectively with children and young people who have experienced domestic violence, and particularly highlighted the importance of allowing space for children to reflect on direct experiences of domestic abuse. Trainees reported that their practice had been enhanced by the transfer of knowledge and skills facilitated by the training events. They reported positive experiences of the programme and were enthusiastic about applying the ethos and principles of the UNARS project in their own practice and that of their colleagues, organizations and service development **\[5.1.4\]**. 

 As part of the UNARS project, **Callaghan** and colleagues used research findings to develop and pilot an intervention for children and young people impacted by domestic abuse that focused on recognising and enhancing their capacity for agency and resilience. 100 children were involved in the original delivery of this intervention across the four participating countries. Their wellbeing and resilience were measured before, during and after the intervention, and these suggested an overall improvement in children and young people’s outcomes **\[5.1.4\]**. The intervention has also been used as part of the SHE project, a three\-year Big Lottery Funded project run by Eve, a frontline domestic abuse charity in Northampton to provide a family centred response to victims and perpetrators of abuse. Training was also provided to practitioners at Bedford’s ‘Space’ project, a Youth Work project that supports children impacted by domestic abuse. Space continues to offer the UNARS intervention and has to date supported 40 children and young people through the programme. The intervention developed as part of the UNARS project has therefore benefited both practitioners who developed new methods for working with young people in these situations, and approximately 180 young people who have been supported to further develop resilience and a positive sense of self, as they recover from living with domestic violence.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 McVie and Murray’s work transformed the law, policy and practice of stop\-and\-search in Scotland. They achieved this by: \(i\) increasing parliamentary, governmental, organisational and public scrutiny; \(ii\) influencing major legislative reform \(Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016\), which abolished non\-statutory search; \(iii\) co\-producing a new Code of Practice; \(iv\) improving police recording; and \(v\) influencing widespread cultural change within Police Scotland, including the delivery of stop\-and\-search retraining to all officers. As a result, police now conduct fewer searches, more fairly and effectively, with greater success: between 2014/15 and 2018/19, recorded searches fell from 426,000 to 32,300 per annum. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 McVie and Murray conducted impactful research on the policing of young people and the use of stop\-and\-search in Scotland. That work has underpinned a continuous programme of collaboration and engagement with Police Scotland, the Scottish Government, the Scottish Police Authority \(SPA\) and HM Inspector of Constabulary \(HMICS\); and influenced the work of an Independent Advisory Group on Stop\-and\-Search \(IAGSS\). 

 A highly influential research report was published by Murray in 2014 \(3.1\), which uncovered serious problems with the use of police stop\-and\-search in Scotland, including: 

-  an absence of transparency and accountability, as marked by a lack of published data, research, scrutiny or public debate on the tactic; 

-  a dramatic growth in searches in the early 2000s, reaching 428,428 in 2010, despite a sharp drop in recorded crime; and 

-  search rates in Scotland that far exceeded those of more crime\-prone jurisdictions, including London and New York City \(3.2\). 

 Murray’s analysis identified a shift from ‘reactive’ to ‘pro\-active’ policing modes in some forces \(3.3\), underpinned by a performance culture and characterised by: 

-  higher \(and increasing\) search rates, compared to reactive forces; 

-  unfettered use of non\-statutory stop\-and\-search \(i.e. not based on suspicion or legislative powers\); 

-  very low detection rates, especially for non\-statutory searches; 

-  disproportionate and unchecked targeting of children and young people \(CYP\), in contrast to known offending patterns; and 

-  fixed numerical targets in some areas to drive up search rates, resulting in even greater reliance on non\-statutory searches, particularly amongst CYP. 

 Based on these findings, Murray recommended phasing out non\-statutory searches; reviewing police practice on and establishing guidelines for searching CYP; publishing stop and search data; and scrutinising police practice for proportionality. 

 McVie’s research formed the underpinning basis for significant concern about the pattern of usage of stop\-and\-search identified through Murray’s work. In particular, findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime had demonstrated that deprived CYP were disproportionately targeted using policing tactics such as stop\-and\-search, and this had demonstrable negative effects on their later involvement in offending and their likelihood of being convicted and imprisoned \(3.4\). 

 Following initially negative reactions to Murray’s work by Police Scotland and the Scottish Government \(3.5\), the findings subsequently led to a policy U\-turn and an extensive programme of reform. McVie and Murray produced a series of briefing papers and consultation responses for the IAGSS highlighting issues of concern around stop\-and\-search practice in Scotland. McVie also produced a number of unpublished briefing papers for the IAGSS, which highlighted ongoing problems with disproportionate patterns of stop\-and\-search across groups with protected characteristics and between geographical localities.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Published in January 2014, Murray’s research \(3.1\) generated enormous political and public debate. Her findings put stop\-and\-search on the political agenda, prompted parliamentary debate and gained widespread media attention, with stop\-and\-search referenced over 130 times in press reports in the 7 months following publication. The Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader raised Murray’s research in the Scottish Parliament and recommended changes to the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Bill to improve regulation of the practice \(5.1\). However, the research prompted a backlash from both Police Scotland and the Scottish Government. The Chief Constable denied Murray’s claims about a performance\-driven policing culture, despite documentary evidence and testimonials from police officers; and both the Justice Secretary \(Kenny MacAskill\) \(5.2\) and First Minister \(Alex Salmond\) \(5.3\) defended intensive stop\-and\-search, claiming its use was proportionate and had reduced violent crime in Scotland, despite a lack of evidence. 

 Formal reviews of Police Scotland’s stop\-and\-search processes were conducted by the Scottish Police Authority \(SPA\) in 2014 and by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland \(HMICS\) in 2015. Both concluded that greater transparency and regulation were needed. In March 2015, the Justice Secretary \(Michael Matheson\) established the IAGSS to consider legislative reform and whether a Code of Practice \(CoP\) was necessary. The IAGSS was chaired by John Scott QC and included representatives from Police Scotland, SPA, HMICS, Scottish Government and third sector organisations. McVie was also appointed a member. 

 In August 2015, the IAGSS presented recommendations to the Justice Secretary \(Matheson\), including proposals to abolish non\-statutory stop\-and\-search and introduce a CoP and extensively citing Murray and McVie’s research \(5.4\). McVie ensured that the IAGSS also recommended regular publication of stop\-and\-search data to improve transparency. The recommendations were fully accepted by the Cabinet Secretary and incorporated into Section 65 of the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016. The CoP was drafted by the IAGSS and implemented in May 2017, with McVie playing a leading role in aspects of its development. John Scott QC, IAGSS Chair, stated: *“Professor McVie was an integral member of the IAGSS at all stages of its work over a 4 year period. Concerns about stop and search received media and political attention because of analysis of data by academics. It was therefore crucial for the IAGSS to understand what that data meant…We could not have done this without Professor McVie’s expertise”* \(5.5.a\). 

 The IAGSS continued monitoring the use of stop\-and\-search and McVie played a critical role in this process with responsibility for providing research reviews on the implementation of the CoP for the Cabinet Secretary after 6 and 12 months \(5.5.a\-5.5.c\). Providing detailed analysis and scrutiny of the extent, nature, geographical patterning and proportionality of stop\-and\-search, McVie reported that recorded searches had reduced to 32,300 in 2017/18 – down 92% from 2014/15 \(5.5.b, 5.5.c\). The IAGSS used McVie’s reviews to make further recommendations for legislative amendments; for example, on the use of stop\-and\-search to remove alcohol from young people \(5.6\). 

 McVie and Murray’s work also contributed to increased scrutiny by SPA and HMICS, and the development of three Improvement Plans around stop\-and\-search through working closely with Police Scotland’s National Stop and Search Unit, of which the Head of Unit stated: *“\[T\]he work carried out by Professor McVie and Dr Murray…has without doubt, directly influenced and informed the significant improvements to the practice and policy of stop and search across Scotland”* \(5.7\). They created internal assurance metrics to monitor ‘proportionality, fairness and effectiveness’ \(5.8\), and produced a Data Analysis Reference Guide to support statistical analysis of stop\-and\-search data to determine whether it is being used fairly and effectively. The SPA Policing Committee commended these methods of improving data scrutiny and the accountability of Police Scotland in the use of such an intrusive and controversial tactic \(5.9\). 

 Introduction of the CoP required a major training programme for all Police Scotland officers \(approximately 15,000\). McVie and Murray contributed to its development and their research fed into the new Police Scotland Standard Operating Procedure. This training was instrumental in changing operational approaches – away from stop\-and\-search towards ‘stop and engage’ – and contributed to both cultural and normative transformation of police practice. 

 Despite criticism that the stop\-and\-search policy change would lead to a significant increase in violent crime, ongoing research indicates that this has not occurred. Police Scotland has stated that lessons learned throughout the stop\-and\-search improvement journey have informed its wider policing approach, especially around violence reduction, and provided a collaborative, preventative and evidence\-based focus across all policing priorities \(5.10\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 With an ageing population, there is an urgent need to develop the workforce to be competent to care for older people with complex needs. Northumbria University research has identified priority areas for competency development to ensure standardised, high\-quality care for older people across all health, voluntary and social care sectors. This research has led to the widespread implementation of a workforce competency development strategy, which includes new job roles to lead competence improvements across the sectors. The research has also led to significant improvements in gerontological education, in the form of internship placements and service user involvement to provide dynamic and authentic learning environments. This has resulted in improved competency in current staff and graduating nurses, which in turn has improved quality of care and quality of life for older people.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As the population ages, health and social care services are increasingly required to care for older people with complex and unpredictable conditions, including cognitive impairment, limited mobility, multi\-morbidities, frailty, high levels of dependency and end of life care. However, the workforce does not always have the skills, knowledge and competence required to manage this increased complexity, and provide consistent high\-quality care. It is essential to understand what competencies are required to care for older people, and make sure competency is standardised across the gerontology workforce to ensure high quality, effective care. Newcastle Gateshead Clinical Commissioning Group \(NGCCG\) funded Dr Juliana Thompson and Sue Tiplady from Northumbria University to undertake three, interrelated, collaborative action research studies \(total funding GBP65,002 \[ **G1**\- **G3**\]\) to investigate and support development of the local gerontological workforce as part of their Enhanced Health in Care Homes \(EHCH\) integrated care programme. 

 **2.1. Establishing key competencies** 

 Northumbria researchers used a collaborative action research approach to evaluate the EHCH programme in Gateshead Care Homes. This model links General Practitioners \(GPs\) and Older People Nurse Specialists with specific care homes and establishes regular, patient\-centred, multidisciplinary team meetings, which include care home staff. A series of interviews \(n=38\) and two workshops \(28 participants\) demonstrated how team\-working between GPs, Older People Nurse Specialists, and care home staff – with access to specialist advice when required – leads to proactive and effective care and an increased quality of life for patients. The findings also highlighted the support and infrastructure required to do this effectively \[ **R1**\]. However, the research also identified that the sustainability of the model depended on developing and maintaining key workforce competencies, which need to be standardised across all organisations and professions, and that this could be achieved through the establishment of a Workforce Competency Framework \(WCF\) for gerontological care \[ **R1**\]. 

 **2.2. Participatory design of the Workforce Competency Framework**Northumbria researchers undertook an extensive critical analysis of the peer reviewed, organisational and policy literature on professional competency pertinent to the care of older people. This included existing competency frameworks, regulated qualification frameworks, policy directives and job descriptions for roles relevant to the care of older people. They also observed, over a six\-month period, weekly NGCCG workforce planning meetings, attended by representatives from all professions, and health, local authority, private and voluntary organisations providing gerontological care across the region. The analysis of these two data sets led to the development of a draft standardised WCF. The framework is applicable to all care professionals working at essential, specialist and advanced levels across all health and social care service organisations. 

 Competencies were classified within four domains: \(i\) Values and Attitudes \(ii\) Collaboration, Co\-operation and Support \(iii\) Leading, Organising, Managing and Improving Care, and \(iv\) Knowledge and Skills for Care. The draft WCF was refined through workshops with 65 representatives from: NHS primary and secondary care services; local authority, private and voluntary sector services; clinical educators, education and training providers; and older service users. This led to the finalised WCF, known as the Enhanced Care of Older People \(EnCOP\) framework – the first standardised competency benchmark for the provision of effective, integrated care for older people which has been formally implemented into practice across all types of service providers \[ **R2**\]. 

 **2.3. Piloting EnCOP with the current workforce**Cook, Thompson and Tiplady piloted EnCOP in two sites. Participants were staff involved in care for older people living in care homes in these sites: primary and community, medical, allied health, nursing, and care assistant staff. A competency gap analysis, involving a survey \(n=36\) and observations of practice \(n=71\), identified priority areas for workforce development. Within the four domains of EnCOP, priority areas included subdomains of: collaborative working and support; developing strong leadership for workforce development; developing the staff knowledge base in frailty, managing multi\-morbidity, recognising deterioration; and interprofessional and interagency communication. Further, an additional survey \(n=36\) and interviews \(n=29\) identified the key facilitators and barriers to addressing the competency gap and meeting the benchmark WCF \(Tiplady et al. MedRxiv  [doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.21250213](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1101%2F2021.01.21.21250213&data=04%7C01%7Ciain.sutcliffe%40northumbria.ac.uk%7Cdbaa94a1a5ac4e527b0b08d8cd2208a5%7Ce757cfdd1f354457af8f7c9c6b1437e3%7C0%7C0%7C637484893360227578%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=XTzJtX8GzaFC9OLZ6WxIocQGNQ3aZiCEg8aO%2FVrypeI%3D&reserved=0)\). Employing Strategic Workforce Development Leads for Older People – to build cross\-system infrastructure and capacity for practice\-based learning and assessment – was recommended \[ **R3**\]. 

 **2.4. Embedding research to build competency in the future workforce** 

 Finally, the team incorporated these research findings \[ **R2**\] into the pre\-registration nursing curricula at Northumbria University \(Modules: ‘Values and principles for nursing people in later life’ and ‘Enhancing the care of older people in contemporary society’\). They also established internship and initiated the involvement of older people in the delivery of the curriculum. The Service User Participation and Engagement in pre\-Registration \(SUPER\) Adult Nurse Education project invited older service users to contribute to pre\- and post\-registration education of health and social care professionals by narrating their experiences of illness and care; discussing their participation in a wellbeing initiative; and participating in standardised patient simulation where they role\-play patients, offering learners the chance to practice patient assessment skills in an authentic way and setting. A student evaluation survey \(n=322\) and interviews with both students and older people showed that this approach enhanced student understanding of older people’s integrated care needs and improved the quality of life for the older people participating in the initiative. This project is unique as previous studies of service user involvement in education have not focused specifically on older people \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. 

 In 2016 Thompson, Proud and Tiplady developed and incorporated a third\-year integrated health and social care student internship for caring for older people with complex needs into the Northumbria programme, with learning objectives aligned with the WCF. This was developed in collaboration between the university, care home and NHS primary care staff, and uniquely provides students with a cross\-organisational, cross\-sector experience. The evaluation showed an improved ability to care for older people and was a catalyst for closer working relationships between health and social care sectors and organisations \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The development of the Enhanced Care of Older People \(EnCOP\) Workforce Competency Framework \(WCF\) for caring for older people by Thompson and Tiplady has led to \(i\) improved competency of the workforce \(ii\) improved competency of the future workforce, stimulating interest in nursing careers in this sector, and \(iii\) improved outcomes for older people. 

 **4.1 Improved competency of the current workforce** 

 As a direct result of the research recommendations, two full\-time \(FTE: 2\) EnCOP Strategic Workforce Development Leads for Older People have been employed to deliver the research recommendations regarding workforce capabilities across the North East and North Cumbria. The posts, funded by the North East and North Cumbria Workforce Transformation and Strategy Board \[ **E1**, **E2**\], were recruited by NGCCG in partnership with the Academic Health Science Network \(which hosts the Ageing Well regional group, tasked with scaling the EHCH programme\). Other partners include six NHS Trusts, a home care provider, and a local authority. The posts were recruited to in April 2020, with appointments postponed to September 2020 as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. The Strategic Leads drive the implementation of the WCF and facilitate EnCOP workforce development. For example, they ensure EnCOP is delivered effectively through the development of appropriate policies and monitoring of outcomes. In addition, two Clinical Quality Care Home Lead Nurses have been employed by NGCCG to develop the care home workforce along EnCOP lines \(headcount: 2, FTE: 2\) \[ **E1**\]. 

 The identification of priority areas for workforce development has also informed and helped to shape masterclasses \(funded by Health Education England\) for health and social care staff who work with older people. To date, six have taken place, with 90 participants comprising care home managers, care home staff, and NHS staff from elderly care wards. Written feedback from participants demonstrated that these masterclasses have had a direct impact on the healthcare practice of attendees. For example, a regional manager from a care home provider company confirmed: *‘those attending \[from our company\] felt they had a much greater understanding of sepsis / delirium which would benefit clinical decisions on the front line’* \[ **E3**\]. As a result of the masterclass, key changes to communication, baseline observations, and frailty policy and practice are being implemented by this company \[ **E3**\]. 

 **4.2 Improved competency of the future workforce** 

 To date, 21 senior \(third year\) nursing students have completed the internship devised by Northumbria \[ **R4**; **E4**, p7\]. Students are based in a care home but work with the NHS at strategic and frontline levels. The internship model has since been adopted by the five NHS Trusts and four CCGs providing placements for Northumbria University students \(Northumberland, Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, and South Tyneside\), as well as East Lancashire and Leeds North CCGs \[ **E4**, p7\]. Evaluation showed students had enhanced their knowledge and understanding of multimorbidity, frailty, and dementia, and the complexity of care needed to manage people with these conditions; and developed skills and confidence in autonomous working, leading and managing care delivery, as well as enhanced understanding of the complexities of the integrated health and social care sector \[ **E5**, p3\]. It also showed improved inter\-organisational working and learning for staff, as well as students. The internship programme was awarded a Cavell Nurse Star Award in 2019 for services to older people’s care \[ **E6**\]. One Northumbria student was shortlisted for the Royal College of Nursing’s student nurse of the year award for 2019 because of her engagement with the internship \[ **E6**\], going on to join the steering committee of the Royal College of Nursing \(RCN\) Older People’s Nursing Forum. 

 As a result of this success, care home placements are now also offered to first and second year nursing students on the course. To date, 90 care homes have provided placements for 1,009 students, and 107 GP practices have provided placements for 1,125 students who would not have otherwise worked in this sector \[ **E4**\]. The Clinical Quality Lead for North Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group has confirmed that the internship and subsequent placements have helped care home nurses *‘raise standards of care and increase the number of mentors available within the care home setting’* while the internships have *‘helped with staff recruitment and retention into this area of nursing practice* \[ **E7**, p1\] *.* This led to the decision to employ a Practice Supervisor to support learners in their placements \[ **E7**, p2\]. 

 Student nursing in this sector has also been enhanced by the SUPER project, which has advanced student understanding of person\-centred integrated care for older people. To date, 2,000 students have used the SUPER model and been exposed to the health, social, and transition care needs of older people \[ **E8**, p1\] **.** A study exploring the experiences of older service\-users and students of SUPER and a testimony from Equal Arts, which supports the wellbeing initiative of SUPER, reported that it has been effective and had a lasting impact on students’ attitudes to caring for older people, leading to positive change to their practice, and impacting on career choices \[ **E8**\]. Feedback from past students regarding the wellbeing initiative aspect of the SUPER project includes *: ‘\[This is\] the reason I became interested in caring for older people and why I do the job I do now \[older people’s nurse\]’* and *‘\[Older people\] came to Northumbria Uni when I was in my second year of nursing. It’s a lecture I’ll never forget, and I’ve been a qualified nurse for four and a half years now’* \[ **E8**, p8\]. 

 **4.3 Improved outcomes for older people** 

 The study explored the experiences of service\-users as well as students participating in SUPER \[ **E8**, **E9**\]. SUPER enhanced quality of life for older service\-users as it provided them with opportunities to contribute to improved care practices, a sense of purpose, and promoted their feelings of being included and being valued by society. One SUPER service\-user participant said: *‘\[It gives\] the chance to try and influence the way that students are taught and put things right … When I was 65, I didn’t want to stop working. I had to. It’s nice that I don’t have to stop working. I can get up and come and do things. It’s the fact that you’re putting something back, you know. And you are acknowledged as doing that, and people appreciate what you do’* \[ **E9**, p4\-5\]. 

 In addition to these direct benefits, NGCCG has confirmed that research provided by Northumbria University during the evaluation of the EHCH programme *‘massively supported our approach and influenced the development of the care pathways without doubt’* \[ **E10**\]. The implementation of these new care pathways and local systems have led to improvements in key metrics regarding the care of older people living in care homes, including decreases in 999 calls, decrease in A&E attendance, fewer non\-elective admissions \(34.7% for urinary infections and 16.6% for chest infections\), and a reduction of GBP41,000 in spending on low\-dose antipsychotics \[ **E10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Almost all aerosol products utilise hydrocarbon propellants, such as blends of Liquefied Petroleum Gas \(e.g. butane\) as the primary propellant. Since they contain a high level of Volatile Organic Compounds \(VOC\) and greenhouse gas, these propellants contribute significantly to air pollution and directly impact the environment and human health \(19 billion aerosol spray cans produced and used globally each year\). Their use is increasingly being discouraged through international and national regulations \(Kyoto Protocol, 2005; UK Government’s Clean Air Strategy, 2019\). Since the inception of the first conventional aerosol valve 50 years ago, there has been no change to valve design, prompting Salford researchers to develop new environmentally friendly aerosol valves that do not rely on hydrocarbon propellants. These trademarked Eco\-Valves have now been commercialised through spin\-out company Salvalco at their production facilities in China and are available on the market to both SMEs and FTSE companies, including **\[text removed for publication\]**. Salvalco saw turnover increase to **\[text removed for publication\]** through direct sales in 2020, with revenues forecast to rise to **\[text removed for publication\]** by 2023. Without Salford’s innovative Eco\-Valve, an additional 1,437kt of harmful VOC would have been emitted into the Earth’s atmosphere by 2020.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2007 the aim of ongoing research by the University of Salford’s Spray Research Group \(SRG\) has been to design and develop low VOC valves for domestic aerosol products using inert gas propellants such as compressed gas or nitrogen. This was achieved by designing a laboratory prototype in creating the ‘bubbly flow’ structure inside the conduit of the flow passage of the valve in the upstream of the nozzle exit arrangement \(actuator\-insert\). The bubbly flow was created by carefully designing and developing the correct geometry of the relevant orifices and the mixing chamber that were located inside the valving arrangement. Such precision engineering design led to the flow becoming highly energised and turbulent which subsequently led to the formation of the required laden of bubbly flow. 

 The common thread of the underlying research was to: \(i\) produce spray that looks and feels good, \(ii\) provide constant pressure drop of the nitrogen propellant \(bar\) upon usage, \(iii\) give constant spray discharge rate \(g/s\) and \(iv\) constant particle size \(micron\) throughout the life of the can. The performance of the spray should also have minimum dropout \(rainy effect\) and provide acceptable reach \(m\) with minimum wetness \(subjective\). These low VOC valves use the standard components with no manufacturing penalties and most importantly use no harmful gas such as butane or other Liquefied Petroleum Gas \(LPG\) propellants. 

 The key research findings were: 

-  **2014** <ins> **Actuator\-insert design</ins><ins>:**</ins> The concept of the two\-fluid atomisation, also known as ‘bubbly flow’, was utilised in determining the efficacy of linking spraying quality to atomizer designs in conditions where inert compressed gas acted as the propellant in the container of the spraying \(aerosol\) device, leading to novel <ins>actuator\-insert \(nozzle exit arrangement\)</ins> designs. The interaction of the bubbly flow with the actuator\-insert causes a flow attachment and reattachment phenomenon, generating a highly energised and turbulent state **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. 

-  **2016 <ins>Eco\-</ins><ins>V</ins><ins>alve design \(continuous spray\)</ins><ins>:**</ins> The bubbly flow was also generated by injecting a small proportion of propellant directly into the passing flow of product within the <ins>low VOC aerosol valve</ins> assembly. The propellant is directly tapped off from the head space within the aerosol can. The technique therefore acts to reduce the subsequent droplet size of the product when dispensed from the valve through the actuator\-insert, generating superior spray characteristics. In addition, by controlling the ratio of liquid to gas injected within the valving arrangement \(via selecting the correct geometry of the orifice sizes in the correct ratio\), the maintenance of consistent spray performance is enabled with regard to constancy in the inert gas propellant pressure, discharge rate, dropout, wetness and the reach, throughout the life of the can **\[3.3\]**. 

-  **2015\-2019 <ins>Metering</ins> <ins>E</ins><ins>co\-</ins><ins>V</ins><ins>alve \(meter dosage spray\)</ins>:** There was also demand through the research for a special new ‘metering \- low VOC aerosol valves’ which can use inert gases rather than liquefied gas propellants. Such a valve had never been successfully developed in the past. ‘Continuous spray’ with bubby flow research has therefore enabled the team to develop a novel compressed \(inert\) gas propellant metering valve suitable for both consumer air fresheners and health applications \(i.e. nasal sprays\) **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. 

-  **2014\-2018 <ins>Low\-</ins><ins>l</ins><ins>oss</ins> <ins>v</ins><ins>alve \(viscous continuous spray\):</ins>** A different approach was required in order to spray ‘difficult liquids’ that tended to be viscous \(up to 100 centipoise\) and/or emulsions or suspensions. This was a fourth strand of the research which led to the development of new ‘low\-loss’ valve designs that permit the spraying of such liquids \(i.e. food products, oil, dry shampoo or portable fire extinguishers\) and successfully use compressed gas propellants **\[3.6\]**. 

 Publications **3.2**, **3.3** and **3.5** are examples of the patents that were initially transferred to the AWI Group by the University of Salford through a technology transfer mechanism. A spin\-out company was set up in November 2013 under the trademark name ‘Salvalco Ltd.’ \(Salford Valve Company Ltd.\). The research team continues to work with the company and has filed a further six granted patents to date prior to and during the manufacturing and assembly operations.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The current standard propellant is a hydrocarbon gas \(LPG\) whose boiling point is just below room temperature. Upon pressurisation within the can LPG turns into liquid form. As the product is sprayed, the propellant flash\-vaporises to leave a fine atomised spray. Originally chlorofluorocarbons \(CFCs\) were used as they provided the ideal characteristics. These were banned following the Montreal Protocol \(1989\). Highly flammable propane, n\-butane and iso\-butane are hydrocarbons that are now widely used, but because these gases are hazardous, numerous regulations have been enforced, including the Gothenburg Protocol \(1999\) and the Kyoto Protocol \(2005\). This was followed by the Paris Agreement in 2015 on the safe transport and storage of aerosols within the supply chain, and, once used, on their safe disposal. The low VOC aerosol valves developed by Salford’s SRG are an alternative technology utilising compressed gas as a propellant, providing excellent spray performance while being compatible with conventional aerosols using LPG propellant. The aim is to create a cleaner environment with significant benefit to consumers’ health and wellbeing. 

 The success in developing these technologies and their measurable impact is best illustrated with reference to: \(i\) the spin\-out company \(ii\) investment in new manufacturing facilities and \(iii\) the industrial outlets that have made direct use of the products \(customers\): 

 **4.1. Development of the spin\-out company** 

 The spin\-out company, AWI Group, was established in November 2013 through a University technology transfer under the trademark name ‘Salvalco Ltd.’. The company, which operates as a separate entity with its head office in York, currently employs 12 staff in the UK and has had **external investment totalling approximately \[text removed for publication\] since 2014**. Salford’s SRG has continued supporting the company through Professor Nasr \(Non\-Executive Director of Innovation and Technology\). 

 The filing of patents and securing of ‘Smart’ grants for the next generation and development of VOC\-free aerosol valves and actuators have enabled the company to take the initial laboratory prototype to **full industrial commercialisation \[5.1\]**. Impact was further increased by the **novel methods employed in moulding the components of the valves**. This entailed a new design of ‘hot runners’ injection and assembly machines together with the precision engineering of the complex geometries of the actuator\-inserts \(nozzle exit\). Salvalco had to establish **new manufacturing solutions** in creating the conditions that were needed for production of a mould tooling stacks arrangement for a 3\-parts Eco\-Valve, as opposed to the conventional 2\-parts valve. This enabled a number of running moulding cavities on each production cycle to be aligned to the number of required pieces for mass production **\[5.1\]**. The final products \(valves and actuators\) were therefore able to meet the underlying criteria for acceptable spray performance when using clean air propellant, such as nitrogen, compared to harmful LPG **\[5.1\]**. Salford’s SRG also supported the company in **devising Salvalco’s Quality Control Document for validating corresponding spray performance**, which ensured that an effective quality management system was put into place to comply with the requirements of ISO 9000 or comparable standards **\[5.2\]**. 

 The company was recognised for its achievements, winning the <ins> *T</ins><ins>imes</ins> <ins>H</ins><ins>igher</ins> <ins>E</ins><ins>ducation*</ins> <ins>\(THE\)</ins> <ins>award</ins> for ‘ *Outstanding Contribution to Innovation and Technology’* in November 2014, with the panel of judges confirming that *‘Its green credentials, safety applications and industrial promise make it a worthy winner’* **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.2. Investment in new manufacturing facilities** 

1.  The partnership between Salvalco and **\[text removed for publication\]** based in China and Taiwan\) played a key role in **establishing new facilities**, which included the moulding process and semi\-autonomous assembly lines of the valves in 2014 **\[5.1\]**. This led to the launch of products in 2015, supported by the research team in the UK **\[5.4\]**. **\[Text removed for publication\]** employs 14 staff and made **an investment of \[text removed for publication\] in mould tooling and manufacturing assembly lines**. **\[Text removed for publication\]** was also given a **licence to sell the products to the Chinese and Korean markets**, with royalties to Salvalco **\[5.1, 5.5\]**. 

1.  In April 2018, **\[text removed for publication\]** also **invested \[text removed for publication\] in the technology**, with **additional investment of \[text removed for publication\] in August 2019** **\[5.1, 5.6\]**. These contributions were key to enabling Salvalco to re\-strategise its direction and resources in pursuit of its commercialisation goals on a global scale, by appointing several sales agents, business managers and licensing experts. The investment also enabled the company to **further innovate and meet the required demand of the leading brands for ‘spray\-through caps’ for aerosol containers** **\[5.7\]** that are used in body sprays and antiperspirants in conjunction with the low VOC valves. 

 Salvalco had a **turnover of \[text removed for publication\] through direct sales in 2020** and is expected to generate **\[text removed for publication\]** by 2021 through a combination of direct sales and licensing, through know\-how or manufacturing. The Managing Director of Salvalco confirms that by 2023, the Eco\-Valve will have a **significant market share**, with over **\[text removed for publication\]** valves sold and projected revenue of **\[text removed for publication\]** **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.3. Key customers \(2016 onwards\)** 

 The normal protocol for evaluating aerosol products in all SMEs and leading\-brand companies takes a period of 3 years. This is to confirm and validate the shelf life of the filled cans \(which should be more than 2 years\) and to conduct full consumer testing prior to market. The low VOC aerosol valves are subject to the same evaluation and protocol: the <ins>UK Government’s</ins>  [<ins>Clean Air Strategy 2019</ins>](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-air-strategy-2019) requires these traditional aerosol companies to move faster towards VOC\-free aerosol usage and at the same time adapt more efficient protocol evaluation. The aerosol industry is required to ‘ *reduce emissions of VOCs, against the 2005 baseline, by 32% by 2020 and increasing to 39% by 2030’* for all their domestic and industrial products. According to the <ins>British Aerosol Manufacturers’ Association</ins>, should industry choose not to act, there is a real risk of punitive regulation. In response, Salvalco has begun to rapidly establish itself in the market and its low VOC aerosol Eco\-Valves are the only option for industry to achieve the target for emissions set by the UK Government. 

 There are currently **15 major customers around the world** using the low VOC aerosol Eco\-Valves, with **total orders ranging between \[text removed for publication\] valves over the next 12 months**. Key accounts include: 

 **\[Text removed for publication\] <ins>USA</ins>:** following the development phase from August 2019 to August 2020 the global manufacturer approved and launched an aerosol product using the Eco\-Valve in October 2020. This was in compliance with new California Air Resources Board \(CARB\) regulations for the use of safe propellant \(compressed gas\). The product is used for spraying adhesive on various products such as clothing and carpets and the company placed an order starting at **\[text removed for publication\]** **\[5.1, 5.8\]**. 

 **\[Text removed for publication\] <ins>Germany</ins>:** the multinational company manufactures and retails personal care products **\[text removed for publication\]** as well as pressure\-sensitive adhesives and has worked with Salvalco, its Chinese supplier and Salford’s SRG since 2018 to test the Eco\-Valve on various products **\[5.9\]**. In March 2020, the company entered into partnership with Salvalco **\[5.1\]** and requested a **capacity reservation for 10,000,000 pieces per annum**. The full launch of the deodorant product takes place in 2021, resulting in the entire filling plant in the EU being switched over to VOC\-free valves. This equates to **sales revenue of** **\[text removed for publication\] \[5.9\]**. 

 **\[Text removed for publication\] <ins>Italy</ins>:** the company specialises in cosmetic and medical aerosol products and, following 12 months of stability and compatibility testing during 2019 and 2020, obtained final approval for the Eco\-Valve in February 2020. The first **annual order for 500,000 pieces** was placed with Salvalco in July 2020, with a further order in October 2020 **\[5.1, 5.10\]**. The company has capacity for 80,000,000 filled cans per annum and, following the standard 3\-year aerosol protocol evaluation process, launches its first eco\-friendly deodorant and sun care product using the Eco\-Valve in early 2021 **\[5.10\]**. The company has **targeted 9,000,000 sales \[text removed for publication\]** for both products and will convert all of its aerosol products before 2023 in line with its sustainability strategy of zero emissions using ‘clear air’ propellant **\[5.10\]**. 

 Other companies committed to converting their products using VOC\-free Eco\-Valves include **\[text removed for publication\] <ins>Mauritius**</ins>, a manufacturer of personal care and home care products which launched its **\[text removed for publication\]** products using the Eco\-Valve in March 2020, initially ordering **500,000 pieces per annum \[text removed for publication\]** **\[5.1, 5.11\]** and **\[text removed for publication\]** <ins> **Germany</ins>,** a major drug store chain that launched its deo\-spray for men in November 2020 with an **annual order of 300,000 pieces \[text removed for publication\]** **\[5.12\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 We achieved significant **commercial and economic impact** by directly enabling security updates to the mobile phone apps of some of the largest banks, and financial and VPN service providers in the world, including HSBC, Bank of America, \[text removed for publication\]. We developed a new methodology and an automated tool, Spinner, which identified critical security vulnerabilities** in 28 apps \(e.g., the ability to access PIN codes and usernames\). Through our responsible disclosure of these vulnerabilities, the affected banks were able to swiftly patch their insecure software, thus **improving technology**, **mitigating against future losses** and **protecting tens of millions of users worldwide** from fraud. It also enabled the National Cyber Security Centre to push for a **coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy** within the banking sector.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) is a cryptographic protocol that underpins the security of most online traffic, from Facebook to banking and critical infrastructure. To determine which cryptographic key should be used to talk to a specific server securely, TLS relies on public key certificates. These are public statements that bind the server’s identity to its public key and are signed by a trusted party called a Certificate Authority \(CA\). Often, a chain of such certificates is used where the first one \(called root CA\) represents the ultimate trust anchor. But there are hundreds of CAs globally and, if a single one acts maliciously or is compromised \(as DigiNotar was in 2011, for example\), then the security of TLS is lost. To mitigate this, high\-security applications use a technique called “certificate pinning” through which developers can choose to only accept certificates issued by a single, pre\-arranged CA in their applications. 

 Most security\-critical applications are tested for security vulnerabilities by a penetration testing \(pentesting\) company before deployment. One drawback of using certificate pinning is that traditional testing techniques require owning a certificate from the same CA \(with accompanying ID checks and fees\). This makes it difficult for pentesting companies to test the security of the TLS connection. Certificates are not only expensive, but some CAs only issue certificates to very large organisations and/or government, not to pentesting companies, thus preventing them from conducting proper TLS testing. 

 Between September 2014 and June 2017, we \(Chothia and Garcia\) researched a solution to the problems with existing pentesting processes. We developed a new methodology \[R1\] and a zero\-cost, open\-source, automated tool called Spinner \[R2\] which enables testing of TLS connections at scale, even when certificate pinning is being used. For this, we leveraged a large database of internet servers and the TLS certificates they use. By redirecting an app’s traffic to a server using the same certificate as the one pinned by the app, we are able to conduct a thorough analysis of the encrypted traffic between the app and the server. The tool performs a series of tests and then pinpoints the exact step of the TLS handshake that fails. Based on this information, it detects a number of vulnerabilities such as the lack of proper hostname verification. This discovery that certificate pinning obscures the lack of proper hostname verification is termed **key finding 1** \[KF1\]. 

 Using Spinner, we carried out an analysis of 400 Apple iOS and Android high\-security applications including banking, stock trading, cryptocurrency and VPN apps. In this sample set, we identified 11 apps that were using certificate pinning but failed to perform hostname verification. A further 6 apps accepted self\-signed certificates and another 9 did not verify the hostname correctly. These failures enabled adversaries to decrypt communications, retrieve users’ credentials and perform operations as if they were customers. See Table 1, below, for an overview of the vulnerable apps found. The development of our new methodology that can perform pentesting without a certificate from the relevant host CA is termed **key finding 2** \[KF2\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have directly benefited global banks, stock traders, cryptocurrency and VPN service providers, and their millions of customers across four continents by developing an automated tool, Spinner, which detects cryptographic protocol failures in security applications. Spinner has significantly **mitigated against future losses by improving methods in security\-critical applications and improving existing technology**. This **commercial and economic impact** is a consequence of the responsible disclosure we made to banks, with the support of the Government Communications Headquarters \(GCHQ\) and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure \(CPNI\), of the vulnerabilities identified by the underpinning research \[KF1, KF2\]. 

####  **Mitigation against future losses: Impact on security\-critical applications** 

 As we move towards a cashless society, the security of our internet banking infrastructure is becoming more critical. The magnitude and likelihood of potential losses due to security failures is enormous. In 2019, more than 25,000 incidents of internet banking fraud amounted to losses of over £111M in the UK alone \[S1\]. Besides the economic impact on the banks, there is also a socioeconomic aspect, as banks typically refuse to refund transactions where the right credentials have been input \[S2\]. We have shown that existing flaws in the banks’ own apps enable fraud \[KF1\]. \[text removed for publication\] Our research and subsequent intervention prevented this negative impact and protected tens of millions of customers globally from falling victim to fraud. 

####  **Improved technology: Impact on existing products resulting in improved security** 

 Table 1 shows the apps that we identified as vulnerable in the underpinning research \[KF2\] together with their respective numbers of users. They all had insecure TLS connections that exposed their users’ credentials, and therefore their bank accounts, to attackers and fraudsters.

 After identifying these flaws, we initiated a process of responsible disclosure that **directly led to changes in existing technologies** \(the apps\) **and the adoption of improved security methods**. Using the knowledge and recommendations we provided to them, financial and VPN service providers were able to patch their software. 

 We first informed \[text removed for publication\] on 27 February 2015 of the vulnerabilities in their app. These vulnerabilities, identified using Spinner \[KF2\], had been missed by two pentesting companies. One week later, \[text removed for publication\] pushed a fix. Afterwards, a similar process was carried out with \[text removed for publication\]. After these disclosures, it was evident that a more scalable approach to vulnerability disclosure was needed. \[text removed for publication\] 

 The reach and significance of our work is attested by improvements across global banking and financial service providers and by the stimulation of policy debate between \[text removed for publication\] and the UK financial sector on responsible disclosure. \[text removed for publication\] 

 As a result of our disclosures, **all of the affected apps have been fixed**, to the benefit of both the respective banks and their customers. Some of the largest affected banks have made public statements acknowledging our contribution to fixing their apps, including HSBC: ‘We thank the University of Birmingham for the opportunity to work together, and we have already taken steps to address this’ \[S4\] and Bank of America: ‘The vulnerability identified in this report \[R1\] was resolved in Bank of America’s health app in January 2016’ \[S4\]. 

 To ensure the continued impact of our research, we released the Spinner tool as **open source** in December 2017 so that pentesting **companies are free to use it**. Spinner’s availability and a wide range of national media coverage in late 2017 \[S5, S6, S7, S8, S9\], led to international recognition of the importance of our research and impact. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Taken together, we have **improved the security of mobile apps across the sector**, benefiting companies, customers and the economy more broadly. A measurement study of 20 banking apps conducted by one of our students shows a sharp increase in the prevalence of certificate pinning \[S10, section 3.2.2\]. Significantly, the study quantifies the impact by showing that each of the banking apps using certificate pinning in 2019 does so correctly and securely \[S10, section 3.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Professor Roe, Dr Cooper, Dr Evenden and Dr Roxburgh** have undertaken research that demonstrates that ‘anomalous’ beliefs and experiences \(also labelled ‘paranormal’, ‘spiritual’, and ‘psychic’\) are very common among the general public, but are poorly understood, and academic psychology has provided little guidance concerning their ontology and impacts. Consequently, members of the public typically find them challenging to make sense of and are reticent to disclose them to others for fear of ridicule or even pathologisation, with documented adverse consequences for their health and wellbeing. **Roe** and colleagues have published research that maps these phenomena in accessible ways that enable the public to understand their experiences and their consequences, emphasising the importance of scientific epistemologies in making reliable judgements and differentiating normal from abnormal experience. This case study outlines the impacts for experiencers, as well as for national and international networks of practitioners. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Roe** and colleagues have conducted research into the occurrence and impacts of anomalous experiences \(AEs\). This research has confirmed that AEs are reported by a high proportion of people from a wide range of backgrounds, but may occur only rarely in any individual’s life **\[3.1\]**. The research is ontologically neutral and accepts that such experiences have a psychological reality with tangible consequences, irrespective of the ‘ultimate cause’ of the experience. 

 **Research on anomalous experiences** 

 The research has demonstrated that people who have AEs typically regard them as important, meaningful events that are existentially challenging **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. When AEs are taken seriously and valued by others, experiencers can derive psychological benefit from processing them in ways that enable personal reflection and growth **\[3.3\]**. **Cooper, Roe & Mitchell** **\[3.3\]** found that ostensible after\-death communication experiences \(ADCs\) during bereavement could facilitate the bereavement process and foster feelings of hope for the future. In the largest survey of its type **\[3.1\]**, **Roe** and colleagues asked 1,004 people with personal experience of ADCs about their circumstances, phenomenology and impacts, finding that 73% believed that the experience had brought them comfort / emotional healing and 68% found it was regarded as important for their bereavement process: 71% said that they treasured their experience, while a further 20% were glad to have had it. **Roxburgh** and **Evenden** identified that experiencers found AEs challenging to make sense of but when they attempted to disclose them during therapy they were often trivialised, being treated as inauthentic and inappropriate for therapeutic focus **\[3.2\]**. In a related study, **Roxburgh** and **Evenden** found that therapists felt uncomfortable about discussing AEs for fear of seeming to endorse delusional beliefs, a stance that they attributed to the lack of coverage of AEs in their initial training and subsequent professional development **\[3.4\]**. 

 **Research with Mediums and Healers** 

 **Roxburgh** and **Roe’s** research **\[3.5\]** with people who identify as mediums, and report regular AEs that might in other circumstances lead to a clinical diagnosis \(for example, hearing things others cannot hear, having embodied experiences that are identified as non\-self\), has demonstrated that practising mediums exhibit greater psychological wellbeing than comparable groups and population norms, illustrating that AEs need not be distressing or socially maladaptive. Follow\-up research suggested that positive wellbeing effects can be a consequence of adopting a spiritual framework to make sense of these experiences, especially in enabling access to psychological resources that make the experiences meaningful and personally controllable. This work also stresses the need for a scientific approach \(e.g., evidence based, testing counter explanations, controlling for confounding factors\) that focuses on identifying normal explanations for ostensibly paranormal experiences. 

 **Research on Alternative Medicines** 

 **Roe** and colleagues produced a meta\-analysis of randomized control trial studies that investigated noncontact healing **\[3.6\]**. These findings have been used by the healing community to argue that healing practices based on intention or energetic processes can contribute to the wider healthcare eco\-system and to lobby for a more sustained consideration of their potential benefits to public health. **Roe’s** research provided explicit guidelines regarding methodological good practice for future clinical studies to improve the quality profile of research **\[3.6\]**.

 Research has been published in international peer reviewed specialist journals to raise awareness among practitioner groups that come into contact with persons who are struggling with AEs. Support for this work comes from a broad range of national and international foundations, including from practitioner groups themselves. 

 The research has been supported from competitive national and international research grants from the Confederation of Healing Organisations, UK \(GBP20,200\), the Bial Foundation, Portugal \(EUR33,000\), the Perrott\-Warrick Fund, Trinity College, University of Cambridge \(GBP235,000\), and the Salvia Foundation, Geneva \(GBP225,000\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Increasing access to a scientific perspective to the practice and experience for spiritualists and mediums** 

 Through collaborations with the Spiritualist National Union \(SNU\), the researchers have introduced the practitioner community and members of the public interested in mediumship to the principles of the scientific method as a means to critically reflect on their own experiences and the attributions they make to them.  This provides a context within which to acknowledge the claims of mediumship made from formal peer reviewed empirical work, alongside consideration of conventional psychological explanations \(e.g., in terms of error, misperception, or fraud\) as the most appropriate account. This also introduces ways of empirically testing claims by controlling for those conventional explanations when designing in situ ‘experiments’. 

 The team’s outreach programme is built around applying scientific principles to lived experience and subjecting explanations to empirical test. As keynote speakers at a national ‘Science Day’ organised by the Spiritualists’ National Union \(SNU\)\(2013\), **Roe** and **Roxburgh** introduced the spiritualist community to their mediumship research. The presentation offered practitioners strategies for adopting a more critical, evidence\-based approach to understanding their own practice and experiences, with an emphasis on impacts for psychological wellbeing. The event was so popular that the SNU commissioned a series of workshops, beginning with a ‘Science Week’ \(2014\). This provided an opportunity for practising mediums to work with research methods that ranged from controlled experiments incorporating electroencephalography \(EEG\) measures to more qualitative approaches including questionnaires and interviews. Due to demand, eight further workshop programmes have been run under the auspices of the SNU between 2015 and 2019 \(additional planned events have been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak\). Feedback from participants reflects the impact that this had on their own mediumship ability and experiences, for example: 

-  “I attended the AFC early on in my training very much a beginner at that point; having the benefit of the science sessions as a bonus to my course really helped me to feel less fearful about hiding my abilities from some aspects of my life on my return” 

-  “You and your team helped enlighten me as to what I can do to help validate what it is I do. The Science bit, although daunting and unexpected, helped enhance my learning on the course and it was a fascinating addition to an already exciting course. I wanted more sessions with the scientists” 

-  “To say we feel validated is an understatement” 

-  “An eye\-opening and fascinating experience to have the opportunity to learn and take part in scientific studies and methods which can help to verify our abilities and normalise what are very real experiences for us” **\[5.1\]**. 

 There has traditionally been antipathy and mistrust between the scientific and mediumistic communities. The ‘Science Day’ event showcasing ongoing research at the University of Northampton was instrumental in enabling a rapprochement that led directly to a change in policy within the SNU to encourage collaboration with academics **\[5.2\]**. A significant consequence of this policy change was to allow research to be conducted under their auspices, and the SNU’s National Executive Committee donated office space to establish a permanent science laboratory at the Arthur Findlay College site in order to conduct original research, host science workshops and lectures as part of events open to the public, and development programmes designed for practising mediums. The SNU is a national body responsible for 325 churches across the United Kingdom, but also has an established international reputation \(running dedicated residential programmes for other nationalities, including Swedish, Italian, Swiss, North American, and Japanese weeks\). The SNU President, and the SNU’s Science Officer were co\-applicants on projects that resulted in joint funding \(Roe, Saunders, Evenden, & Bruton, 2016, 2017, 2018\) to refurbish the space and underwrite research costs. Matched funding has come from local Spiritualist churches, Friends of Stansted Hall, and a donations initiative, reflecting the groundswell of support among practitioners and lay members. 

 **Increasing understanding of anomalous experiences among the wider public** 

 **Roe** and colleagues’ research with mediums and on ADCs features extensively in the 6\-part Netflix documentary series ‘Surviving death’. The programme focuses on investigations of anomalous experiences that are interpreted as evidence of survival of bodily death, such as apparitional experiences and communications provided by mediums. Coverage emphasises the need to consider conventional psychological explanations \(error, fraud\) as the most appropriate account, but also explores the psychological reality of such experiences and the consequences they can have, advocating a truly sceptical response that evaluates a claim on its merits rather than on prior expectations. The format, content and approach were directly affected by interactions between the research team and the series producers **\[5.3\]**. Feedback within Netflix has been very positive, and a second series has been commissioned. **Roe** is a consultant for series 2, advising on content and approach. 

 **Increasing the acceptance and use of alternative healing in public health** 

 **Roe’s** research on the efficacy of alternative healing contributed to increased discussion regarding the role of complementary therapies in public health. The researchers presented their findings to key members of the UK complementary therapy community, including members of the Parliamentary Group for Integrated Health \(Feb, 2015\) **.** David Tredinnick MP, Member of the Commons Health Committee and Commons Science and Technology Committee introduced the event, which also featured Sue Knight, Chief Executive of The Confederation of Healing Organisations \(CHO\). The study features prominently on the CHO website:   [https://the\-cho.org.uk/research/two\-meta\-analyses\-of\-non\-contact\-healing\-studies/](https://the-cho.org.uk/research/two-meta-analyses-of-non-contact-healing-studies/) and prompted them to commission additional empirical work to inform the practice of their members, as well as leading the College of Healing to expand the coverage of controlled clinical research in their curriculum **\[5.4\]**. Additionally, the organisation has made use of the research in their public relations communications, and it has increased their standing as a ‘professional organisation’ leading to further opportunities for their practice **\[5.4\]**. It also formed part of the CHO’s submission to the Charity Commission consultation on the use and promotion of complementary and alternative medicine in 2017, which concluded that the vast majority of registered complimentary and alternative medicines \(CAM\) charities were meeting their obligation to establish the efficacy of the relevant treatment or to demonstrate that clear that benefit can be derived from the approach **\[5.4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Christopher Cook’s research on spirituality and religion in psychiatry has emphasised that psychiatry should undertake a constructive and nuanced engagement with spirituality, defined broadly, and that this should be reflected in good clinical practice. This has had impact on debate and policy on 4 continents: Africa, Australasia, Europe, and North America. Between August 2013 and December 2020, 5 national psychiatric associations have introduced or are revising their policies, following the lead of the 2011 Royal College of Psychiatrists \(RCPsych\) policy initiated and drafted by Cook. Recommendations of the World Psychiatric Association \(WPA\) position statement, introduced in 2015, draw directly upon Cook’s work. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Psychiatry in the UK no longer relies on a purely bio\-medical model. In addition to social and psychological factors, spirituality and religion are increasingly seen as important. Cook has played a large part in this change. A growing evidence base shows that spirituality/religion can influence treatment outcomes and are important for ‘whole person’ care. However, in the pluralistic and secular context of modern healthcare, ‘spirituality’ is a controversial topic. Durham University has one of the few centres in the world to have engaged in critical theological contribution to these debates. 

 Cook is both a consultant psychiatrist and an Anglican priest, with research doctorates in medicine and theology, and with extensive pastoral and clinical experience. His research focuses on the relationships between spirituality, theology and health. He became a Professorial Research Fellow at St Chad’s College, Durham University, in 2003, and since 2005 has been based in the Department of Theology and Religion. In that year he established the Durham Project \(now Centre\) for Spirituality, Theology and Health, of which he is Director. Its stated aims are: 1. To promote interdisciplinary and collaborative research and teaching in the subject areas of spirituality, theology and health. 2. To contribute to discussion and policy processes both in churches and other religious communities and also within health and social care services. Since its inception, the Centre has collaborated with local NHS trusts and with relevant professional bodies. 

 Cook’s research gave rise to an integrative and inclusive definition of ‘spirituality’ \(R1\) which has been widely cited \(e.g. van Rensburg et al 2015, E4\) and is employed in the RCPsych position statement on spirituality/religion, \(R2\). The RCPsych \(membership approximately 18,800 people\) is the professional medical body responsible for setting and raising standards of psychiatry in the UK. RCPsych position statements are concise statements of College policy, providing the benchmark for good practice. The position statement on spirituality/religion was drafted by Cook, presented by him to the RCPsych policy committee, redrafted in the light of peer review, adopted as RCPsych policy in 2011, and updated by him in 2013. It makes recommendations concerning clinical assessment, psychiatric training, respect and sensitivity towards patients and colleagues, prohibition against proselytising, need for organisational policy, and joint working with clergy/chaplains. These recommendations draw on a broad evidence base, including Cook’s work exploring the implications of spirituality for practice with UK psychiatrists \(R5\). 

 In 2006, as a member of the Executive Committee of the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group at the RCPsych \(SPSIG\), Cook drafted a position statement which was submitted to the Chair of the WPA Section on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry with a proposal that it might form the basis for WPA policy. In 2015, with a different introduction, but only slightly revised recommendations, this became the Position Statement for the WPA. 

 Further research by Cook has clarified the nature and dynamics of spirituality in different mental disorders and spirituality/religious experiences \(R3, R4\). Using Cook’s definition of spirituality as a starting point, *Spirituality and Psychiatry* \(R5\), published by RCPsych Press in 2009, was the first critical attempt by a group of British psychiatrists and mental health professionals to address spirituality/religion in clinical practice. The success of this book led to a sequel, *Spirituality and Narrative in Psychiatric Practice* \(R6\), also published by RCPsych, and more recently to an invitation from Cambridge University Press for an expanded and revised second edition \(in preparation\). These books, in all of which Cook has taken editorial leadership, demonstrate that a better understanding of the nature and place of spirituality in human wellbeing fosters a better understanding of mental disorder, and better care for patients.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Cook’s research \(particularly R2\) has had impact on debate, policy and guidance on spirituality/religion in psychiatry internationally, both within the WPA and in national psychiatric associations. The evidence presented here is in respect of psychiatrists as the direct beneficiaries; indirectly the intention is that patients should be the ultimate beneficiaries. 

####  WPA 

 The WPA is a global association representing 140 psychiatric societies in 120 countries. It brings together approximately 250,000 psychiatrists, works collaboratively with international agencies, NGOs, and research institutions around the world, and shares a joint work program with the World Health Organization’s Department of Mental Health. WPA Position Statements present the views of the WPA on public health and social matters relevant to mental health. The *WPA Position Statement on Spirituality and Religion in Psychiatry* \(E1\) was approved by the WPA Executive Committee in 2015, and published in *World Psychiatry* \(Impact Factor 40.595, ranked 1/155 for psychiatric journals\) in 2016. 

 The WPA position statement explicitly acknowledges that it “has drawn on some of the text of recommendations already published \[in R2\]” \(E1\). The WPA and RCPsych position statements share common concerns and/or common text in 6 out of 7 of their respective recommendations, all based on Cook’s work \(E2\). 

 Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese translations of the WPA position statement are available on the WPA website \(E1\). Russian and Hindi translations have been prepared and will soon also be available. 

 Presentations on the WPA Position Statement, by Cook and others, have been made at many subsequent international conferences \(e.g. 2017 WPA Conference in Berlin, 2018 American Psychiatric Association \(APA\) conference in New York, 2019 conference of the WPA Section on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry in Jerusalem\). A special issue of *Mental Health, Religion and Culture* \(No. 6, 2017\) was devoted to the WPA Position Statement. 

 Writing to Cook, the President of the WPA says: 

 The Position Statement is a landmark in the field as we discussed at the Congress \[in Jerusalem\]. Your role as a leader and co\-author in that project was critical to its success, and required much dedication to achieving consensus in a field that has been sorely neglected. Thank you for your invaluable contribution to WPA and your colleagues in the Section, and hence to world psychiatry, though your commitment to the work. \(E3\) 

####  National psychiatric associations 

 Following the example of the RCPsych Position Statement \(R2\), four other national psychiatric associations published guidelines and policies on spirituality/religion: 

-  The South African Society of Psychiatrists \(SASOP\): *Guidelines for the integration of spirituality in the approach to psychiatric practice* \(2014, E4\) 

-  The Canadian Psychiatric Association \(approximately 2,200 members\) Position Paper: *Freedom of and From Religion* \(2014\) 

-  The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik und Nervenheilkunde \(DGPPN, 9,400 members\) Position Paper: *Dealing with Religiosity and Spirituality in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy* \(2017, E5\) 

-  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists \(membership of approximately 6,700 people\) PS: *The Relevance of Religion and Spirituality to Psychiatric Practice* \(2018, E6\) 

 In all of these documents the RCPsych Position Statement \(R2\), and/or the WPA Position Statement \(E1\), is cited as context to the need for national policy/guidance. Even where the content of policy/guidance differs, there is evidence that the RCPsych/WPA position statements provided the stimulus to develop policy/guidance. For example, in the background to the SASOP guidelines, it is stated that: 

 It was important to develop South African guidelines in view of \[…\] guidelines provided by other associations \(e.g. Royal College of Psychiatrists\) \[...\]. \(E4\) 

 In the DGPPN position paper a whole paragraph is devoted to the RCPsych and its Position Statement \(E5\). The Chair of DGPPN writes: 

 The British position paper mainly written by Dr. Cook \(2013\) was our inspiration to formulate a similar statement for Germany. \(E7\) 

 Cook’s work has also had impact on the APA. The APA is the largest national psychiatric association in the world, with approximately 38,000 members practising in over 100 countries. The mission of the APA includes promotion of high\-quality care for people suffering from mental illness, advancement of psychiatric education, and research. In 1990, the Committee on Religion and Psychiatry of the APA published the first ever national guidelines on religion and psychiatry. These were last updated, as a *Resource Document on Religious/Spiritual Commitments and Psychiatric Practice*, in 2006. Cook’s work has provided the stimulus to drafting \(for the first time\) a Position Statement \(a more formal and authoritative policy\) on religion/spirituality in psychiatry and revising the Resource Document. The Position Statement is currently working its way through the relevant committees of the APA \(the next stage being early in 2021\). The Chair of the APA Caucus on Religion, Spirituality & Psychiatry writing to Cook, says: 

 Your leadership of the Royal College’s SIG has been an important inspiration to us in the APA’s Caucus on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry, and to me as its chair until this year. More specifically, your contribution to the RCPsych and WPA position statements on spirituality/religion have stimulated us to recently draft our own statement for the APA, and to consider updating its Resource Document in this area. The opportunity to discuss these issues on your visit to our 2018 meeting in the U.S., your invitation to me to participate in your meeting last November in London, and your active encouragement of international scholarship in spirituality/religion and psychiatry at global meetings such as the 2019 conference in Jerusalem have had a significant impact on my thinking and recommendations to our Caucus. \(E8\) 

 Cook is the 2021 recipient of the Oskar Pfister Award, given by the APA for outstanding contributions in the field of psychiatry and religion. **\[REDACTED\]** 

####  UK psychiatry 

 Cook continues to play an important part in the debate amongst UK psychiatrists, as evidenced by a recent editorial in the *British Journal of Psychiatry,* written jointly with two psychiatrists who hold views differing from his. \(E9\) 

 In September 2018, the RCPsych published *Person\-Centred Care: Implications for Training in Psychiatry*, which identified spirituality as one of the key elements of person\-centred care. Cook served as a member of the Scoping Group that produced the report. The report states: 

 Spirituality is concerned with human experiences of relatedness, meaning and purpose in life \(Cook, 2004\)…In clinical practice, it is important to show sensitivity and respect for the spiritual/religious beliefs and practices of people who use services as well as their families and carers. \[RCPsych position statement cited here\] \(E10\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 There is a concerning trend of loneliness, isolation and an increased risk of suicide among older gay men and lesbians. Older minority sexual groups have been overlooked within ageing research and are grossly under\-represented in mainstream policy and practice. This is particularly problematic in health and social care provision, which provides essential services as people age. 

 The work of Dr Kip Jones, Professor Lee\-Ann Fenge, Dr Rosie Read and Dr Marilyn Cash 

 sought to transform frontline services for this under\-represented group. Their work has increased awareness and encouraged inclusivity, therefore enabling better equipped service provision for older minority sexual groups. This contributes to an improved overall quality of life for LGBT individuals. The work has made a significant contribution towards an inclusive and prejudice\-free society.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **‘The Gay and Grey’ Project \(2003\-2006\)**, funded by The National Lottery Community Fund \(GBP175,000 in total, GBP17,803 awarded to Bournemouth University \(BU\)\), unveiled common themes of participants experiencing issues with personal identity, isolation and exclusion, and highlighted that accessible public services could help \[R1\]. 

 Two issues were left unresolved: a lack of participation from rural residents and limited biographic understanding of participants’ lives. 

 **‘The Gay and Pleasant Land’ project \(2008\-2012\)** funded by Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) \(GBP1,066,468 in total, GBP40,187 awarded to BU\), aimed to bridge these gaps. It was part of the national ‘New Dynamics of Ageing’ programme, funded by five UK research councils. BU’s Dr Kip Jones led the project, supported by BU’s Professor Fenge, Dr Read and Dr Cash. 

 This team set out to understand how older gay men and lesbians in rural areas interacted with their local communities. They considered socio\-economic and cultural effects and differing attitudes towards sexuality and ageing. 

 An advisory committee of older gay people and service providers informed the research direction and helped identify sample participants. 

 The methodology \[R2\], \[R3\] included participatory research methods: Biographic narrative interpretive method, a visual ethnographic method, and an overarching participatory methodology. 

 The findings showed \[R4\]: 

-  There is a lifelong impact on gay men who grew up whilst homosexuality was illegal \(up to 1967\). 

-  Gay men and lesbians face challenges feeling accepted, due to prejudice prevalent in rural communities. They exercised extreme caution about when they ‘came out’ and to whom, if at all. 

-  Participants reported difficulties negotiating with service providers. 

-  Fear and loneliness punctuate the lives of some older gay citizens. They recounted homophobia and heterosexism, which is prejudice by assumption that heterosexuality is the normal sexual orientation. 

-  The risk of suicide was prevalent among older gay men. 

 These biographic insights formed the basis for characters created by Dr Kip Jones for a professionally made and internationally acclaimed short film called RUFUS STONE \[R5, R6\]. The film, written and executively produced by Dr Jones, was Directed by Josh Appignanesi and produced by Cecilia Frugiuele at Parkville Pictures in London. This innovative arts\-based research project uses film to tell the heart\-wrenching tale of two young boys whose growing feelings for each other spark anger and rejection within their 1950s rural community. In a dual timeline narrative, we see the same boys reunited fifty years later. One character has never revealed his sexuality and tragically commits suicide when he thinks his secret is out. 

 Alongside this, Professor Fenge used participatory methods to work with a group of older LGBT people to produce a ‘Methods to Diversity’ card deck \(funded by Big Lottery GBP7,777\) for care agencies and service providers. The colourful playing cards have exercises and activities which prompt staff towards inclusive practice and to consider the diversity of the ageing population. 

 R7 describes how the film and Method Deck were shared with service providers, enabling opportunities to learn and critically reflect upon an informed practice.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  Changing attitudes 

 As screenings of the film took place around the world in community cinemas, universities and festivals, the film’s popularity snowballed. It attracted attention both for its brilliance as a film and the tragic lesson it teaches. It featured in a *New York Times* article from 2011, which continued to drive new audiences to the film throughout the impact period. 

 International accolades include the Youth Jury Award for best LGBT film at Rhode Island International Film Festival 2013 \[E1\] and the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) 2015 Research in Film Anniversary Prize shortlist \[E2\]. 

 RUFUS STONE delivered on its aim of prompting discussion around sexuality and marginalisation, whilst ultimately changing attitudes, as demonstrated by its effects in teaching.  In June 2019 student\-teachers from post\-Soviet Kazakhstan were shocked, then transfixed by the struggles the characters faced. A student at Nazarbayev University said: “I \(will\) show this film in my own class. Youth should understand and realise that some existing values are remnants of the older generation and upholding these values will not bring harmony because the world is changing.” \[E3\]. 

 The film was shared online in 2016 and by December 2020 had been viewed over 17,800 times across 73 countries \[E4\]. 

####  Educating future generations 

 RUFUS STONE is used in teaching at several universities throughout the world. A 2019 screening and question and answer session at the University of Manchester led to its inclusion in an undergraduate sociology module, equipping future generations to tackle this societal concern head on \[E5a\]. A lecturer at Brighton University describes the film as “inspirational and impactful for students” and a “landmark/foundation stone” in the field of arts\-based research. \[E5b\] 

 In 2016 it was added to the syllabus at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University and School of Communication and Media Studies in Lisbon, Portugal, where an Assistant Professor found it an excellent example for inspiring personal creativity \[E6\]. 

####  Transforming frontline care 

 The film undoubtedly changed attitudes across a wide audience. Combined with the Method Deck, the two resources targeted a specific group of users who provide care for older people from minority sexual groups. 

-  **Hampshire County Council** have used the film and Method Deck since 2014 in training sessions with Adult Services staff: Police, fire service, residential care staff, operational managers and more \[E7a\]. The Equality and Inclusion Manager in Adults’ Health and Care at the time says: “The film and method deck are powerful tools which have effected changes in attitudes and awareness amongst council staff”. Some colleagues identified with the film from black and ethnic perspectives, showing its universal message of inclusivity. In 2018 the council conducted a staff inclusion and diversity survey and had over 5,000 employees respond. The results indicated that “the County Council has a supportive and inclusive culture” \[E7b\]. The Equality and Inclusion Manager believes that the training using the film and method deck “paved the way to an improvement in attitudes towards inclusion and diversity more generally amongst council staff.” The Hampshire team also say RUFUS STONE and the Method Deck indirectly inspired the county’s first Gay Pride. 

-  For many years, charity **Help and Care UK** provided ‘wayfinder’ staff for the Partnerships for Older People Programme \(POPP\). Wayfinders signposted older people to information and services. They watched RUFUS STONE in 2014 and it challenged attitudes and perceptions. There were some difficult conversations with members of the POPP board who said they held ‘traditional values’ around homosexuality. The Method Deck was used in individual meetings and a greater awareness was reached \[E8\]. In fact, a 2016 wayfinders briefing document includes ‘freedom from discrimination’ on grounds of sexuality as an area wayfinders support \[E9\]. POPP has since been replaced with an updated programme. 

 **The Alzheimer’s Society** has used the film since August 2013 to improve local and regional teams’ understanding of LGBT issues. This led to a more accessible and empathic service, confirmed by the Organisational Development Manager at the time: “There is no question that RUFUS STONE was a catalyst for change. It was a very different approach to the issues, raw and real so made us think outside the box” \[E10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Classics in UK state schools was in decline. Dr Liveley’s research into the ancient science of storytelling and into ancient science\-themed myths produced new activities, materials, resources, and approaches to teacher\-training that resulted in the ongoing and sustained uptake of Classical subjects since 2017 at both primary and secondary level for over 10,000 state pupils: 75\+ schools in the South West and Wales introducing Classics into the timetabled school curriculum; 20\+ schools locally and nationally \(from Aberdeen to Penzance\) introducing curricular or extra\-curricular Classics\-themed storytelling activities; 3 universities incorporating Classics into PGCE teacher training; 2 museums using Classics to train facilitators and to enhance visitor experience; and a national charity changing practice to champion Classics through storytelling. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the impact of this project was undertaken by Dr Genevieve Liveley \(Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader in Classics at the University of Bristol 2005\-present\) and has two complementary strands. 

#  The science of stories: New investigations into the history of narratology 

 Liveley’s research in this area demonstrated that this field of study has – from its earliest origins in the writings of Plato and Aristotle through to the latest twenty\-first century cyber\-narratologies – represented itself as a scientific enterprise. Narratology is concerned with the technology of storytelling and the ways in which stories *programme* human audiences in similar ways to the AI programming through which machines develop artificial intelligence. In light of this research, we can now better understand the ways in which narrative shapes our knowledge and understanding of our past, present, and future worlds **\[3.1\-3.3\]**. 

#  New investigations into the roles of artificial intelligence \(AI\), robots and cyborgs in myth 

 AI, robots, and cyborgs unexpectedly play a role in classical myths and narratives that are almost 3,000 years old. Ancient storytellers such as Homer, Hesiod, and Ovid describe cyborg slave girls made of gold, and female living statues \(anticipating modern mythmaking around sex and companion robots\); a humanoid bronze giant Talos \(a precursor to the 20<sup>th</sup> century Terminator character\); and ships that ‘navigate by thought’ \(anticipating the driverless cars of the 21<sup>st</sup> century\). Dr Liveley’s research into these ancient myths and their reception by subsequent generations of storytellers – particularly the Roman poet Ovid – showed that public attitudes to the future of AI, robots, and cyborgs in society were being shaped \(effectively ‘programmed’\) by their experience of AI, robots, and cyborgs in fiction. This research discovered that 21<sup>st</sup> century stories about this supposedly new science were repeating very ancient patterns. **\[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\].** 

 The underpinning research for this project has been developed and showcased in a range of published outputs and an open\-access\-article on ‘Why Sex Robots are Ancient History’ \( [<ins>http://theconversation.com/why\-sex\-robots\-are\-ancient\-history\-58112</ins>](http://theconversation.com/why-sex-robots-are-ancient-history-58112): 32,081 readers; 10\+ republications worldwide\). Further research insights were developed and shared through wider public engagement and knowledge exchange at high\-profile public lectures, science conferences, and public events. For example, an invited lecture on Ovid’s artificial creatures at a New York public think tank event celebrating the legacy of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* in April 2016, and a keynote lecture on Ovid’s Pygmalion at the Second International Conference on Love and Sex with Robots \(December 2016\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Dr Liveley’s innovative research has underpinned and informed her engagement with schools, teacher training bodies, and charities across the UK, leading to the following impacts during this REF period: reversing the decline of Classics studies through improved resources and interventions; enhanced resources developed for and adopted by teacher training programmes in Wales and the South West; new award schemes developed through national campaigns with charities; enhanced science communication and visitor experience at two major museums in Bristol and Bath. 

#  Chapter 1: Reversing the decline of Classics studies across the UK through improved resources and interventions 

 Since the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1988, the teaching of Classics \(comprising four related subjects: Latin, Ancient Greek, Classical Civilisation, and Ancient History\) has seen a steep decline – especially in state schools. Across all schools, the number of students taking Latin at GCSE dropped from 16,023 in 1988 to 10,908 in 1998. Following major curriculum reforms in 2015, national exam boards withdrew 10 awards in Classical subjects, and the subject saw a further decline – with the biggest fall in the state sector. In 2016, the total number of students taking any classical subject at GCSE was 15,152 and only 6,581 took a Classical subject at A level; GCSE numbers dipped to a historic low of 14,480 in 2017, and A Level numbers continue to decline – decreasing by 27.4% in the period 2016\-2020 \(source: FFT Education Data Lab Analysis\). This decline represents a significant threat to the skills pipeline for the discipline and its future research base. Dr Liveley’s goal was, therefore, to use the two related strands of her research into storytelling **\[3.1\-3.3\]** and into ancient myths about AI, robots, and cyborgs **\[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\]** to drive forward the sustainable uptake of Classical subjects at primary and secondary levels, with particular focus on the state sector. 

 As a result of Dr Liveley’s research\-informed engagement with schools over 2016 to 2020, as detailed below, entries in Classical subjects at GCSE have increased across the UK since 2017, with a \+6.6% increase from 2016\-2020 \(over the same period, the 16\-year\-old population has changed by \+0.8%\). 

 From March 2016, Dr Liveley began giving a series of popular public lectures on her research into ancient stories about AI, robots, and cyborgs **\[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\]** to teachers and students across the South West region. As a result, in the summer of 2016, she received a project grant from national charity Classics for All \( [<ins>https://classicsforall.org.uk/</ins>](https://classicsforall.org.uk/)\) to set up a regional Hub to work towards widening access to Classics:  [<ins>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/</ins>](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/). Between September 2016 and April 2020, the Hub worked with 105 state schools across the South West and Wales \(24 primaries and 81 secondaries\), delivering workshops, conferences, and competitions; training and mentoring non\-specialist teachers; both designing and providing physical and digital teaching resources; and facilitating access to national grant schemes **\[5.1\]**. Indeed, between September 2016 and April 2020, the Hub helped a total of 67 schools \(24 primaries and 43 secondaries\) from its wider schools network to secure funding from Classics for All grant schemes **\[5.2, 5.7\]**. This enabled over 800 state school pupils in the South West to regularly study some kind of Classics throughout the 2016/17 school year; a further 1,700 state school pupils to study Classics on the curriculum on a regular basis \(mainly through English lessons\) in 2017/18; another 2,300 to study Classics regularly in 2018/19; and over 5,700 state pupils across the region to study classical subjects in the 2019/20 academic year – resulting in more than 10,500 students overall being involved in regular Classics for All funded classroom activities in the South West and Wales between 2016 and 2020 **\[5.2, 5.7\]**. 

 Drawing together both strands of her research **\[3.1\-3.6\]** and aiming to translate this into a school\-friendly format, in December 2017, Dr Liveley engaged 6 schools as her community partners in the co\-creation of a new set of classroom resources on the ‘Science of Stories’: \( [<ins>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/resources/</ins>](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/resources/)\) – hereafter, SoS. She worked closely with the schools to translate her underpinning research into an interactive flipbook \( *The Science of Stories* – available in digital and physical format\) plus supplementary materials \(including videos, experiments, lesson plans, and quizzes\) for use in school science lessons, cross\-curricular lunchtime and breakfast clubs, gifted and talented groups, debate groups, storytelling societies, and extra\-curricular Classics clubs. From the autumn of 2018, multiple copies were distributed to over 600 schools nationwide **\[5.9\]**. The impact has been deep and wide\-ranging. One teacher reports that the ‘cross\-curricular thinking’ that SoS inspires has ‘changed teaching practice’; another that the school has ‘used the science of stories resources as a way to enrich the teaching practice of the science department, using it as a form of extension and differentiation’; and another that ‘Science of Stories \[is\] used by teachers in running a classics\-themed transition day for incoming Year 7 pupils’ **\[5.1\]**. Schools nationwide – from Aberdeen to Penzance – report using these resources for extra\-curricular or curriculum\-extension activities, including to promote Classics to their feeder primary schools, and to complete the Olympus Challenge Award **\[5.1, 5.6\]**. 

 The impact for the beneficiaries of the Hub’s combined interventions has been transformative. Each year, 4,000\+ pupils across 75 state schools \(59 secondaries and 16 primaries\) in the South West and Wales who previously were not offered any Classics now experience some form of Classics on the curriculum; another 9 schools now offer extra\-curricular Classics – and 15 schools have introduced a new Classics subject at GCSE or AS Level, including GCSE Greek **\[5.1\]**. The Programme Director for Classics for All states ‘the geographical coverage of the Bristol Classics Hub \(including many hard\-to\-reach rural school districts\) is such that we have recently taken steps to establish two additional Hubs to pick up its work in the coastal South West and in Wales’ **\[5.2\]**. One teacher reports that the impact ‘has led to the school actually offering Latin/Classics as a subject, where previously it wasn’t’; another that ‘simply put, Classics wouldn't be where it is now in our school without \[your\] support, and hundreds of children would never have encountered the ancient world in a classroom setting’ **\[5.1\]**. 

#  Chapter 2: Improving Classics resources for teacher training programmes across the South West and Wales 

 Through the Hub, Dr Liveley facilitated training for 300\+teachers in the South West and Wales between 2016 and 2020 **\[5.1, 5.2\].** In July 2017, she was invited by PGCE Directors at two South West universities to draw on her research \(and, later, her SoS resources\) to help provide training and resources for local state schools to introduce myths from the Roman poet Ovid into a new storytelling initiative in English teaching \( [<ins>https://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/for\-schools/ovidcompetition/</ins>](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/for-schools/ovidcompetition/)\). At the same time, she became Chair of the local branch of the Bristol Classical Association and relaunched a regional Latin drama festival to support English teachers in secondary and primary schools in encouraging students to perform Latin stories \( [<ins>https://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/events/2019/june/festival\-of\-latin\-drama.html</ins>](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/events/2019/june/festival-of-latin-drama.html)\). Both events are now embedded annual programmes and have seen the introduction of Classics\-based storytelling into English classrooms and curricula in 17 state secondary schools \(involving 200\+ Year 7 & 8 pupils each year\) and 2 state primaries **\[5.1, 5.3\]**. Dr Liveley further developed and delivered cross\-curricular training and resources for English, Science, and Foreign Language teachers and PGCE trainees in the South West. Between 2016 and 2020, she directly trained 100\+ teachers and 180\+ trainees from 49 state secondary schools, using the SoS resources to help non\-specialist teachers and trainees introduce Classics into their teaching – and to qualify for the ‘Classics in the Classroom’ certificate awarded by national charity Classics for All **\[5.1\-5.3, 5.6, 5.8\]**. One science teacher and year 12 tutor reports using these resources to ‘spark interest’ in etymology and mythology with his students **\[5.1\]**; and in March 2020 \(at the start of Covid\-19 school closures\), the PGCE Director of English at UWE contacted all PGCE English Partnership Schools recommending the ‘excellent resources from University of Bristol’ among a pack of online resources for the community to use during the crisis **\[5.8\]**; a Liverpool schools direct \(SCITT\) trainer working with Primary Education lecturers at Liverpool College and Liverpool Hope University is also using the SoS resources to help train new teachers \(‘2 last year, 1 this year, 4 next year’\) **\[5.1\]**. 

#  Chapter 3: New national award schemes recognising Classics engagement by pupils and PGCE students 

 The substance and reach of the impact achieved in schools both regionally and nationally was greatly facilitated by new partnerships with national charity Classics for All \( [<ins>https://classicsforall.org.uk/</ins>](https://classicsforall.org.uk/)\) \(from July 2016\); and national advocacy campaign *Advocating Classics Education* \(ACE\) \( [<ins>http://aceclassics.org.uk/</ins>](http://aceclassics.org.uk/)\) \(from May 2017\). Both helped to promote and distribute SoS resources nationwide and describe a mutually beneficial relationship which has transformed the way they work to support Classics in state schools across the UK, commending the ‘scale of the Classics outreach that has been achieved’ **\[5.2\]** and ‘the greater number of schools that are now teaching Classics in the Southwest ... as a result of Dr Liveley’s leadership’ **\[5.10\]**. In March 2019, in collaboration with Dr Liveley, Classics for All developed a new award scheme \(endorsed by a number of universities and further education partners\) to recognise the work of students who are studying Classics on an extra\-curricular basis or as a non\-examined curriculum subject \( [<ins>https://classicsforall.org.uk/get\-involved/schools/grants\-and\-support\-for\-schools/events\-news/</ins>](https://classicsforall.org.uk/get-involved/schools/grants-and-support-for-schools/events-news/)\). An independent learning version of the ‘Olympus Challenge’ for children studying at home during the Covid\-19 crisis, and a ‘Classics in the Classroom’ award for PGCE students in the South West and Wales were launched in April 2020. For the independent study award, Dr Liveley’s SoS resources are referenced as key materials for the ‘Story Explorer’ and ‘Artist in Residence’ badges. And for the ‘Classics in the Classroom’ award, the SoS resources are suggested as key materials for the ‘Cross\-curricular’ module, and the ‘Ovid in the Westcountry Competition’ suggested as an activity to fulfil the conditions of the ‘Myth’ module **\[5.6\]**. One teacher from Wales, who piloted the ‘Olympus Challenge’ through the Hub reports that: ‘In a year where regular examination has been disrupted, the Olympus Challenge stands out as the single great, tangible achievement since the summer’ and downloads of SoS resources show a pandemic\-related home\-schooling peak in April 2020 **\[5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 5.9\]**. 

#  Chapter 4: Enhancing curatorial practice and visitor experience at two major regional museums 

 Dr Liveley also formed partnerships with two local museums to help her translate her research into a more accessible and attractive format for schools and children – and to promote regional interest in Classics outside of the classroom. She worked closely with the science centre We the Curious from 2016 to co\-create new story\-focused activities for the museum’s events programme. The impact of Dr Liveley’s collaboration with We the Curious involved new ways to enhance visitor experience and a step\-change involving a new narrative approach to science communication. The education team report that this ongoing partnership has not only ‘enhanced their understanding of the scientific concepts that can be explored through classical myths’ but ‘has allowed the museum to see how the arts and sciences can be bridged through narratology’ and to use this new knowledge to position itself as a hub for the exchange of cultural \(rather than purely scientific\) knowledge, bringing them a ‘new type of engagement with the public’, enhancing their public appeal and future sustainability **\[5.4\]**. Dr Liveley has worked with them to: co\-create new story\-focused activities for their live\-science team; enhance staff training; co\-curate a public event \(‘Telling Stories About Robots’\) in July 2018; develop the museum’s ‘Curiosity Club’ \(a disability peer support group with charity WECIL  [<ins>http://www.wecil.co.uk/</ins>](http://www.wecil.co.uk/), discussing science\-linked topics inspired by disabled visitors – e.g., ‘Could a robot socialise with me at quiz night?’\) ; and the prototyping and piloting phase of the museum’s public programmes in their ‘Theatre of Curiosity’ \(ongoing\). The impacts of this partnership for the beneficiaries have been both educational \(using the underpinning research to enhance understanding of fictional stories shaping the realities of robot science\); and transformative \(changing the ways in which science educators and the public think and talk about robot\-themed material, and inspiring new programmes, training, and ways of working\) **\[5.4\]**. 

 In 2018 Dr Liveley also advised the Roman Baths Museum on their ‘Minerva’s Owls’ project, helping them to secure external seed\-funding and rewrite their family trails with a new focus on science and story:  [<ins>https://minervasowls.org/schools\-and\-minervas\-owls/</ins>](https://minervasowls.org/schools-and-minervas-owls/) <ins>.</ins>Their description of the impact of her input and research as ‘provid\[ing\] bidirectional inspiration – inspiring and being inspired’ **\[5.5\]** summarises perfectly the collaborative nature of *The Science of Stories* case study *.*

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Rupert Bourne of Anglia Ruskin University \(ARU\) leads the research for the Vision Loss Expert Group \(VLEG\) as part of the Global Burden of Disease study. The research underpins the ‘Vision Atlas’ hosted by the International Agency for Prevention of Blindness. It has become the authoritative source of global data on vision impairment and blindness. Accessed by 243,000 unique visitors and with 314,000 page views, the Atlas has raised awareness of the prevalence of eye diseases globally. The WHO, UN and the governments of Australia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the UK, and international charities have made eye\-health policies and/or investment decisions based on the research findings. The Australian National Eye Health Survey used the data to plan their national eye survey. In all, the research has positively impacted millions of individuals at risk of preventable eye diseases. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The World Health Organization \(WHO\) has estimated that globally at least 2.2 billion people have vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Sight loss is associated with a drop in quality of life and the WHO has identified it as a major issue to be tackled. Historically, a lack of comprehensive data made it impossible to make comparisons between countries, impeding effective planning and resource allocation, and resulting in unnecessary suffering. The data prepared by the Vision Loss Expert Group \(VLEG\) are considered as the most comprehensive on global blindness and vision impairment by the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness and the WHO, having been published in over 28 papers including 18 papers in *The Lancet* since 2013. 

 The Vision Loss Expert Group, led by Professor Rupert Bourne, is a global network of over 102 ophthalmic epidemiologists including ophthalmologists, optometrists and the WHO. The group, which was set up in 2007, delivers on strategic objectives Professor Bourne initiates and co\-develops. This advises and supports the Global Burden of Disease Study with the goal of providing global technical leadership in the development and improvement of epidemiological estimates for blindness and vision impairment. In the UK, VLEG’s members, aside from Prof. Bourne are: Drs Tasanee Braithwaite \(University College London\), Seth Flaxman \(Imperial College London\), Aditi Das \(St James’s University Hospital, Leeds\), Alexander Silvester \(Royal Liverpool University Hospital\) and Professors Usha Chakravathy \(Queen’s University, Belfast\), Tunde Peto \(Queen’s University Belfast\) and Richard Wormald \(University College London\). 

 The VLEG research provided, for the first time, a temporal analysis of change in the burden of blindness and vision impairment by cause \[R1–6\]. The study also captured important risk factors such as gender inequality in vision impairment. 

 Initially, the VLEG prepared global estimates for 2010 and 2015 \[R1, 3, 4\] by performing a meta\-analysis of 288 studies, covering 4 million participants from 98 countries. The systematic review was extended to 2019 with multiple sources of microdata added into the open\-source Global Vision Database. The new research included a wider range of causes, severities and conditions such as impairments to near and distance vision, and milder grades of vision impairment that affect quality of life and employment potential. Region\-specific data showed temporal trends of decreased prevalence of age\-standardised blindness \[R4, 5, 6\]. Analysis of the data produced comparable metrics for eye diseases that incorporated disability weights to provide years lived with disability \(YLDs\) and disability\-adjusted life years \(DALYs\) \[R2\]. 

 The key research finding was that the age\-standardised prevalence of vision loss had fallen over the 25 years covered by the study. However, due to the global rise in ageing populations, the actual number of people living with blindness and vision impairment had increased, with future projections for the next 30 years indicating a dramatic rise in the number of people affected by vision loss. New data for near vision impairment \(presbyopia\) showed that a billion people are affected worldwide \[R3\]. The majority of vision loss was found to be in females. The researchers identified the causal distribution: vision loss is principally due to cataract \[R2\] but there is also significant impact from other eye conditions such as glaucoma, age\-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Over 80% of the burden of vision impairment was found to be avoidable or treatable. The research highlighted the magnitude, temporal trends and future projections for vision loss in different parts of the world, including Europe \[R4\], Asia \[R5\] and Africa \[R6\].

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of the research findings has been global in reach and has shaped the strategies and practices of international organisations, as well as practices at country level and of large charities. The WHO, UN and the governments of Australia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the UK have made eye\-health policies and/or investment decisions based on the research findings. Charities in the UK, US and Australia, working in over 25 countries, have used the data to underpin their lobbying activities and to inform their strategies and investment decisions. 

 Professor Bourne disseminated key findings from his research through meetings, keynote invited speeches and research collaborations with various government and non\-government agencies, charities and other international policymakers. This approach was taken specifically to inform policy and decision making such as the development of pathways for improved eyecare informed by the research findings. 

 The impacts can be summarised under three headings: 

###  Influencing eye\-health policy at the global level 

1.  VLEG data was used to create the ‘Vision Atlas’ in 2016, an open\-access, online tool developed by Professor Bourne with the **International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness \(IAPB\)**, which is the principal global lobby group for eye health. The Vision Atlas reports 243,000 unique visitors and 314,000 page views since 2016 \(30/12/2020\). IAPB has representatives of governments and NGOs on its boards, and the consolidated information on global eye diseases held in the Atlas has underpinned its efforts to influence policymakers. The CEO of IAPB stated: “ *The VLEG data have been critical to IAPB and our members to define advocacy strategies and plans, and to achieve advocacy successes at the global level. These have included gaining a commitment to ‘eye health for all’ in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting communique, getting governments engaged in shaping the work of the UN Friends in Vision, and gaining attention to eye health within the Global Strategy for Human Resources for Health”* \[E1\]. 

  

1.  Aside from the Vision Atlas, the IAPB have used VLEG data \[R2\] to develop advice and strategies on managing and eradicating reversible causes of global vision impairment such as myopia and cataract. This includes IAPB’s and WHO’s strategy to quantify the need for cataract operations worldwide and per country \(2017\), mapping this need onto actual operations carried out in identified countries where there is an unmet need \[E2\]. 

1.  In collaboration with the **World Health Organization**, the IAPB used the VLEG data to gauge how effectively the WHO’s Global Action Plan \(2014–19\) for Universal Eye Health has met its target. The WHO stated: *“The results of the VLEG provided much of the evidence base for … ‘Global magnitude: eye conditions and vision impairment’* *of the first WHO World report on vision that was launched globally ... in 2019.”* It continued: *“The data were also extensively cited in the ‘Report by the Director\-General’ \[of the WHO\] and the proposed resolution on ‘integrated people centred eye care’ that was subsequently approved by the WHO Executive Board in February 2020”.* \[E3\] 

1.  The **Fred Hollows Foundation** \(a non\-profit aid organisation for the prevention of blindness and other vision problems, operating across 25 countries\) is a stakeholder in setting global eye\-health policy at the UN. Their Director of Global Partnerships stated that they had “ *utilised VLEG data in advocating for the inclusion of eye health… within the global policy at the United Nations, such as \[the\] UN Third High Level Meeting on Non\-Communicable Diseases \(2017\) and during negotiations for the UN First High Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage”.* They added: *“This is a testament to the utmost importance of credible and consistent evidence in shaping political agendas and sound policy responses.*” \[E4\] 

1.  The **Pan American Health Organization** in collaboration with WHO used the VLEG data at their meeting of the 72nd session of the Regional Committee of WHO for the Americas \(September 2020\) to generate the plan for ‘Action for the prevention of blindness and visual impairment’ that offers concrete actions to address priorities for the prevention of blindness and improved eye care for different countries of America \[E5\].

| --- |

###  Shaping strategies and practice at country level 

1.  VLEG data have been used to plan large population\-based studies. The **Australian** government recognised the need to update its population\-based data and then committed to funding a second countrywide survey. The Chief Investigator said “ *the VLEG data… meant that we had the estimates of vision loss we needed to help plan a sample size for the Australian National Eye Health Survey \(NEHS*\)… *The study has had very significant impact in Australia, with the follow\-up survey to commence in 2020,* and this has *gained the support of the Australian Governmen*t” \[E6\]. The implementation of this has been delayed due to COVID\-19. 

1.  VLEG research identified a need to have up\-to\-date comprehensive data of eye health in the **UK**, leading to the development of the protocol for the UK National Eye and Hearing Survey \(UKNEHS; Prof Bourne is Chief Investigator\). The Survey will examine 25,000 participants drawn from across the UK. The programme has been finalised and was costed and importance noted by the Four Nations Committee for Public Health committee at its January 2020 meeting \[E7\]. The protocol has received support of multiple public sector stakeholders in the UK, evidenced by events held at the House of Lords \(February 2019\) chaired by Lord Low and Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, at the Conservative Party Conference \(October 2019\) and the Houses of Parliament \(October 2019\). 

 **Shaping the strategies and practice of charities and NGOs** 

1.  **Vision Aid Overseas \(VAO\)**, a UK charity operating in Africa, has used VLEG data to advocate the need for universal eye care. At an event at the House of Commons \(2018\) designed to mobilise political will towards improved access to affordable eye care in developing countries, Bourne was an invited keynote speaker. The CEO of Vision Aid Overseas stated: *“Since \[..\] the House of Commons, VAO has been developing its \[..\] School Based Eye Health and Primary Eye Care*” and “ *When producing programme proposals and presentations to donors and partners \(including for UNICEF in Sierra Leone and Ethiopia and in our successful applications to USAID\), IAPB, VLEG and the Atlas have been the go\-to organisations for such data and analysis*” \[E8\]. 

1.  VLEG data and the Vision Atlas have been used by other major charities to further their agenda for improving eye health globally. For instance, the CEO of **Sightsavers**, referring to the VLEG research stated: “ *For the first time, the eye health community has a clear and objective evidence”* and confirmed that the data had informed government policies in : \(i\) “ *in **Sierra Leone**, the Vision Atlas was the prime source of data in the development of the National Health policy in 2018”*’ \(ii\) “ *In **Nigeria**, the Vision Atlas was used to convince the Minister of Health… and the first National Eye health policy was approved by government in 2019”*. Further, VLEG data has informed Sightsavers’ own organisational policies for improvements, especially with regards to gender inequality in eye care. The CEO stated: *“Sightsavers has ensured that all our data is now gender disaggregated...to make sure more women are reached with eye health services than men”*’ \[E9\]. 

1.  The **SEVA Foundation** \(an international NGO working in more than 20 countries\), referred to VLEG’s data \[R3\], when they stated in their strategy document \(2018\) that there were *“clear and specific actions needed to redress this unmet need for cataract operations”*. As a result, it has planned *“to add another million sight\-saving surgeries in developing countries per year”*, through its Global Sight Initiative \(GSI\) \[E10\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Multidisciplinary research led to the development of modelling tools for use in planning, installation and construction of offshore wind farms. Used in major UK offshore wind farm projects from 2014 by Scottish and Southern Energy, Iberdrola and its subsidiary Scottish Power Renewables, the modelling tools reduced a wide range of costs. Research also led to a change in strategy by National Grid ESO to enable renewable energy suppliers to provide reactive power to the grid, opening a new revenue stream for all windfarms from 2019. Electricity generation from offshore wind has become more economic, leading to further investment by SSE and SPR, and a boost to local economies. Offshore wind generation is increasingly adding to the energy mix available to consumers, assisting the renewables industry to meet UK Government low carbon targets.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Through the Climate Change Act \(2008\), the UK government has committed to reduce carbon emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels \(net zero\) by 2050. In line with these policy drivers, there has been a huge expansion in both onshore and offshore wind developments in the UK. There is also ongoing governmental pressure to reduce the cost of electricity generation from renewables and reduce government subsidy levels. This is a particular problem for offshore wind projects which have huge additional logistical challenges and associated costs in comparison with any onshore project. Against this background, in 2012\-2013, a series of workshops were held at the University of Strathclyde with future industrial partners including Scottish and Southern Electricity \(SSE\) and Scottish Power Renewables \(SPR\). This led to a programme of projects to tackle key renewables industry challenges such as the high cost of offshore installation and maintenance, and the need for renewable energy suppliers to be more competitive in the electricity market. 

 **Key findings**: Researchers in the fields of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Naval and Marine Engineering, Management Science and Civil Engineering used advanced engineering and mathematical models to develop software tools to support quick and reliable decision\-making in the planning, installation and operation of offshore wind farms, with the aim of driving down costs and improving efficiency. Methodology was developed for complex data analysis of many factors, crucially weather, built into an **Operational Expenditure \(OpEx\) tool** to analyse the technical and economic implications of any given installation strategy. This cost control tool balanced technical requirements with optimal cost of installation \[ **R1**\] and could be used many years ahead of actual construction. The core weather model was then adapted to examine installation risks, **to model the logistics of the offshore installation process** and identify vessels and operations most sensitive to weather delays. These operations were explored to identify the impact of technological or operational advances with respect to weather delays and the resulting installation duration under different levels of weather severity. The result was another decision support tool specifically **to** **optimise contractual strategies for the installation phase** of wind turbine foundations, cables and turbines. This ‘installation support tool’ was further refined in a project to develop a simulation and optimisation tool to facilitate the **minimum cost scenario** of installations at offshore wind farms \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. A further project advanced this modelling to deal with a 24\-hour planning horizon, for dynamic decision support actively updated as foundations are piled, turbines planted, and cables installed \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. This allowed **modelling of installation costs in real time**, on a day\-to\-day basis during the installation phase of major OWF projects. 

 Ancillary services are the ‘responsive’ transmission services, delivered intermittently or at times of peak demand for electricity. This ensures power is delivered reliably, securely and efficiently to support the continuous flow of electricity, so that supply continually meets demand \(known as balancing\). In collaboration with SSE and SPR, the Wind\-03 project \[ **R6**\] identified **commercial opportunities for wind farms to provide ancillary services** to the UK National Grid and looked at associated technical and financial aspects. The ancillary services considered in the analysis included frequency response \(the ability to regulate rotor speed of turbines to generate additional energy for the Grid\), reactive power services, inter\-trip and the potential for added value of distributed storage. This project provided an analysis of existing and future commercial opportunities for wind farms to generate revenue from the provision of ancillary services, which can provide new revenue streams for wind farms beyond selling of active power.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Development of decision\-making tools and an analysis of commercial opportunities for renewable energy operators were conducted by researchers at Strathclyde in collaboration with industrial partners Scottish & Southern Energy \(SSE\) and Scottish Power Renewables \(SPR\) from 2013\-18. Collaborative projects were aimed at solving industry problems, and the organisations became the immediate users of any data analysis or software tools developed for planning and construction of Offshore Wind Farm projects. These research projects have enabled the UK energy industry to respond to the challenge of low carbon targets; examples are provided below, with benefits to: 

-  SPR, part of the Iberdrola Group, one of the world’s largest integrated utilities, and SSE Energy, a major UK renewable energy company, which have both achieved cost reductions in planning and installation stages of major OWF projects. These efficiencies were a factor in the success of these companies in gaining an increased share of the UK low carbon electricity market. This success led to increased focus on generation of energy from Offshore Wind as part of SPR and SSE business strategies. Cost reductions have also enabled these renewables providers to make considerable progress towards meeting UK Government low carbon targets. 

-  National Grid \(NG ESO\) the electricity system operator for Great Britain, who used research findings to ensure that, from 2019 onwards, wind farms can play an increasing role in supplying electricity to the UK Frequency Response market, delivering energy to the grid intermittently or at times of peak demand, and giving NG ESO greater security and flexibility of supply. 

-  Supply chains and local economies, which have gained from investment and employment as a direct result of major offshore wind farm construction and ongoing maintenance. UK consumers have also been able to purchase low carbon energy at a more economic cost. 

###  Efficiency savings in planning and installation of major offshore wind farm projects: The World Forum Offshore Wind places the UK as number one for offshore wind capacity, with an actual grid connected capacity of 9.9GW at the end of 2019 \[S1\]. This represents 45% of all grid connected capacity in Europe. Installation and associated contingency have been estimated at 20% of total capital expenditure in any OWF project \[S1\], with this aspect dominated by transport vessel costs. Installation involves a complex sequence of tasks, with a range of shipping vessels required to install cabling, offshore electrical systems, masts and turbine foundations. For each activity there is a choice of available vessels with different capabilities and costs. Data to inform decisions on when and where to employ these vessels in ‘windows’ of favourable weather is a major benefit of the Strathclyde modelling, together with accurate estimation of time and cost of various installation scenarios. 

 Modelling tools were implemented by SSE and SPR across some of the largest and most expensive offshore wind projects in the UK, summarised in the table below: 

| OWF project | Operator | Construction from | Operational from | Capacity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
||||| **MW** | **Homes** |
| Beatrice | SSE | April 2017 | June 2019 | 588 | 450,000 |
| East Anglia One | Iberdrola/SPR | May 2017 | July 2020 | 714 | 630,000 |
| Seagreen | SSE | Autumn 2020, planning consent 2017 | 2022/2023 \(expected\) | 1500 | 1,200,000 |
| Dogger Bank | SSE/Equinor | Jan 2020, planning consent 2015 | 2023 \(expected\) | 3600 | 4,500,000 |

 The operational expenditure and installation modelling tools were used to reduce costs through: 

-  **Improved logistics, planning and strategy:** The Director of Engineering and Innovation at SSE \[ **S2**\] confirms that the Strathclyde data modelling ‘has helped to optimise the logistics strategy for Seagreen, given the site conditions, layout and available vessel options. ... It enabled rapid logistics optioneering studies to be carried out and demonstrated the impact of failure rate uncertainty on project performance. The impact will undoubtedly be an uplift in wind farm energy\-based availability in the region of 1.0%.’ \[Text removed for publication\] SSE confirm that the OpEx modelling tool has successfully reduced operational costs and ‘This model is now used as part of our business as usual processes \[Text removed for publication\] As our offshore wind capacity continues to increase, we expect these benefits to also continue to grow. *’* \[ **S2**\] 

 The Head of Innovation, Sustainability and Quality \(SPR\) also confirms that ‘The operations and maintenance teams on the East Anglia One project used Strathclyde data modelling \(OpEx\) to estimate time and costings of various installation scenarios, and this was an asset in planning and contract negotiations before and during construction’. Highlighting the benefits of this, they stated: ‘accurate modelling was part of an overall effort to bring down costs across a range of offshore wind projects and was of particular value in planning the timing of vessel use in construction and maintenance *’* \[ **S3**\]. 

-  **More effective negotiations with suppliers:** The OpEx model was used to make decisions on personnel and vessel numbers, and data from installation scenarios was used to challenge quotes from suppliers. \[Text removed for publication\] SSE were able to negotiate with suppliers from a stronger position, backed up by data. They confirm that ‘The benefits depend on the operating environment; however, significant value was delivered by supporting offshore package and project control managers with proofing offshore installation contractor schedules’ \[Text removed for publication\] \[ **S2**\]. \[Text removed for publication\] SPR also confirm that the modelling data ‘benchmarked our collaborative approach against commercial offerings... demonstrating significant benefits’ \[ **S3**\]. 

###  Increased share for wind energy in the UK low carbon electricity market: Cost reductions achieved by renewables generators, together with increased flexibility and levels of supply to the grid are factors which have contributed to more low carbon electricity from wind farms becoming available to the consumer. This process includes: 

-  **Success in Contracts for Difference \(CfD\) scheme:** Eligible UK renewable generators bid every 2 years for a share of the UK low carbon electricity market under the CfD scheme; the Government decides how many long term \(15 year\) contracts to award and can limit the level of spend in a given year. ‘Sealed bids’ are submitted, offering a cost price per Megawatt/hour \(MWh\) of electricity. The strike price agreed is the cost the government will pay the provider per MWh of energy. Where the strike price agreed is higher than the wholesale price of energy the government is in effect providing a subsidy. OWFs which applied Strathclyde modelling to reduce costs have been successful in CfD auctions. In February 2015 East Anglia One/SPR were successful bidders, gaining a contract with a strike price of £119.89/MWh \[ **S4**\]. In the May 2019 CfD auction, SSE successfully secured strike prices of £39.65/MWh and £41.61/MWh for Dogger Bank and Seagreen, \[ **S4**\] stating in their announcement ‘The strike prices … show that offshore wind in particular is now one of the cheapest forms of electricity generation in the UK *’* \[ **S5**\]. In 2019 strike prices for Offshore Wind generation fell below the wholesale price for the first time, and it became competitively priced in comparison with coal and nuclear energy in the UK \(e.g., a strike price of £92.50/MWh was awarded in October 2013 to Hinkley Point C\). 

-  **Change in NG ESO strategy allowing wind farms to provide reactive power to the grid**: The provision of reactive or ‘ancillary’ services in response to fluctuations in electricity demand is known as the Frequency Response market and is worth GBP100,000,000 per annum. Collaborative research on reactive power services \[ **R6**\] led to an invitation in 2019 to Strathclyde researchers to join the Power Available \(PA\) Working Group, chaired by National Grid ESO. Strathclyde researchers lobbied for wind farms to contribute to ancillary services and were commissioned by NG ESO to review the reliability of the PA signal across UK. 

 In February 2019 NG ESO began trialling a weekly auction to procure a proportion of their frequency response requirements from renewables. NG ESO confirm that the ‘analysis undertaken by Strathclyde University has supported the ESO’s development of a Quality Standard methodology for determining the acceptable error tolerance for Power Available data and the implications for submitting inaccurate PA’ published in March 2020 \[ **S7** p15\]. This allows wind farm operators to react to fluctuations in demand and reduces the chance of either overloading parts of the network or creating situations where frequency response requirements are not met. SSE note that the collaborative study \[ **R6**\] ‘provided a fact based argument for the future need for ancillary services and enabled wider industry conversations with National Grid. This ultimately stimulated the creation of a new frequency response category.’ \[ **S2**\] 

 SPR has now moved its focus towards providing ancillary services from all its windfarms, stating that ‘Windfarms are displacing coal in the Mandatory Frequency Response and SPR has accessed a new revenue stream … during 2019. SPR’s current pricing methodology has been designed on the basis of the work with Strathclyde *’* \[ **S6**\]. In May 2020, NG ESO integrated the PA signal from over 90 renewable generators, stating: ‘Through innovations like the PA project our electricity system is becoming smarter, more flexible and – since wind power is often a cost\-effective option when it comes to real time frequency response – delivers increased value to consumers’. \[ **S8**\] 

###  Investment in offshore wind; with economic benefits for supply chains and local economies: Large OWFs require significant planning and financing over the lifetime of the project; East Anglia One/SPR had a total GBP2,500,000,000 investment, and Seagreen/SSE a total GBP3,000,000,000. SSE and SPR have both gained experience in use of data modelling to lower costs and drive efficiency in these complex multimillion pound offshore projects. They have both changed their business strategy to include a higher proportion of energy from offshore wind. SSE Renewables \[S2\] note that the Strathclyde modelling allowed them ‘to seize opportunities for efficiency and innovation’ and to meet ‘challenges which go beyond industry's ability to solve ... the collaboration with Strathclyde has given SSE Renewables access to knowledge and expertise to complement our own and come to more effective solutions.’ 

 Scottish Power has confirmed that as part of its GBP6,000,000,000 investment plan it is actively pursuing future offshore wind projects in England and Scotland. In March 2019, the Chief Executive, Scottish Power stated: ‘we’ve worked tirelessly to bring down costs and, having transitioned to 100% renewable energy, will be building more windfarms to help the UK shift to a cleaner electric economy. Two of our offshore windfarms in East Anglia will replace all of the old thermal generation we’ve sold’ \[ **S9**\]. 

 Industry confidence in OWF developments translates to employment in the supply chain, in construction and installation of components, infrastructure and skilled maintenance jobs once operational. SPR co\-invested GBP5,000,000 in Great Yarmouth and GBP25,000,000 in a new operations and maintenance base at Lowestoft Port, opened in 2019, and brought in nearly 3500 jobs during the East Anglia ONE construction phase 2017 \- 2020 \[ **S9**\]. SSE invested GBP20,000,000 in Wick and will employ 90 staff through the 25\-year lifetime of the Beatrice project \[ **S9**\]. The Seagreen project will create around 400 skilled construction jobs in Montrose Port \[ **S9**\]. 

###  Cost reductions enable renewables industry to meet the challenge of low carbon targets: The Director of Engineering and Innovation at SSE Renewables notes that ‘renewable energy and offshore wind is critical to delivering the UK’s net zero targets ... Notable value has been derived from the work carried out with Strathclyde University which has supported a reduction in the cost of offshore wind’ \[S2\]. SSE claim, with respect to Dogger Bank and Seagreen OWFs: ‘Once completed these projects will generate over 20TWh of green energy annually, equivalent to nearly 7% of the UK’s current energy demand, making a significant contribution to the UK’s net zero climate change targets’ \[S5\]. SPR also confirm the collaboration with Strathclyde researchers led to ‘immediate, and commercially significant benefits to the levelised cost of energy from our sites, and hence the UK electricity consumer’, and that ‘exploring the potential for cost reductions in offshore wind can assist us in in supporting the UK Government’s 2050 Net Zero ambitions and therefore is very much of interest.’ \[S3\]. 

 The Grid and Regulation Analyst at Scottish Power also confirms that ‘the expertise provided by Strathclyde University has built the industry’s confidence for tackling the challenges we are facing, managing to put us in the forefront of creating alternatives to run a resilient and secure system. It’s clear that without Strathclyde University, Scotland and therefore, GB, wouldn’t be the Renewables Hub that currently is.’ \[ **S6**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 High\-resolution imagery from Earth Observation \(EO\) satellites is essential for applications such as rapid disaster response, agriculture and urban planning. Micro\-vibrations arising from mechanical disturbances on board spacecraft adversely affect image quality. Research from Surrey Space Centre characterising and modelling micro\-vibrations and innovative active micro\-vibration control techniques were applied in commercial EO satellites TripleSat/DMC3 Constellation and SSTL\-S1. Further impact has been realised through the commercial application of high\-resolution imagery, facilitation of international disaster responses, and informing standards for engineering practice for spacecraft development.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Surrey Space Centre \(University of Surrey\) – led by Professor Aglietti \(2014\-2019\) \- has been at the forefront of small satellite technology since its inception in 1979. 

 Micro\-vibrations – low\-level mechanical disturbances on board spacecraft \- are an issue of growing importance as some modern payloads, and in particular, the new generations of optical instruments, require extreme platform stability. Micro\-vibrations are generally produced by internal mechanisms on board spacecraft, including reaction wheel assemblies \(RWAs\), momentum wheel assemblies, cryo\-coolers, and solar and antenna pointing mechanisms, with RWAs considered the most significant source.  The low\-level of these micro\-vibrations coupled with their wide frequency range \(from sub hertz to hundred hertz\) makes their modelling and analysis a significant challenge. There was, therefore a need for a model which \(i\) gives accurate estimates covering a wide frequency range, \(ii\) reduces the personnel and time costs associated with conducting an extensive experimental test campaign, and \(iii\) reduces the computational effort without affecting the quality of the result. 

###  Modelling micro\-vibrations 

###  Various approaches have been considered to address the issues related to micro\-vibration predictions. The industry\-standard approach is the Stochastic Finite Element Method \(SFEM\) of which the Monte Carlo Simulation \(MCS\) \- the simplest method for treating the response variability calculation in the framework of SFEM \- is the most well\-known. However, it is well documented that at frequencies beyond the first few modes of a system, SFEM is unsuitable for obtaining efficient predictions for micro\-vibrations. 

 In response, Aglietti and his team proposed merging the efficiency of the Craig\-Bampton reduction technique \(CB\) with the simplicity and reliability of MCS to produce an overall analysis methodology to evaluate the dynamic response of large structural assemblies in the mid\-frequency range, extending it to the case when multiple sources of micro\-vibrations act simultaneously on the same structure. The method succeeds in producing results very similar to those from a full MCS while reducing drastically the computational effort involved. This is particularly valuable in the space industry, as different parts of the satellite usually have different levels of maturity, characterised by different levels of uncertainty in their parameters **\[R1, R2\].** 

 The resulting computational procedure was applied to the new high\-resolution SSTL\-300\-S1 satellite \(launched 2018\), and the predictions compared with the experimental results retrieved during the physical micro\-vibration testing of the satellite **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. 

###  Measurement of disturbances induced by the reaction wheel assembly 

 The primary challenge in satellite micro\-vibration analysis is the characterisation of the potential disturbance sources. For this, accurate measurement is essential. Current practice in the space industry is to use the outcomes from the hard\-mounted RWA configuration measurements as direct inputs for micro\-vibration analysis. However, Aglietti argues that this method is fundamentally flawed as it does not represent real\-world operating conditions where the RWA is mounted on a flexible structure. In **\[R3\]**, Aglietti and his team consider a cantilever configured RWA \[developed by Aglietti\] and present a mathematical model to describe its dynamics. The model was implemented to predict the dynamic mass of the RWA in both static and operative conditions. The team demonstrated that predictions derived from the traditional approach ignored significant characteristics of the system response. Application of correcting factors \(i.e. supporting structure dynamic masses\) considerably improved the agreement between analytical estimates and test results. The inclusion of the gyroscopic effect in the RWA internal dynamics characterisation further improved predictions. 

###  Micro\-vibration control techniques 

 Active \(as opposed to passive\) control techniques are often required to mitigate sources of micro\-vibrations on board spacecraft. However, reliability issues and additional electrical power use are major drawbacks of active control techniques, such as active isolation systems, limiting their usefulness. 

 Aglietti’s team proposed an electromagnetic shunt damper \(EMSD\) connected to a negative\-resistance circuit. The negative resistance produces an overall reduction of the circuit resistance resulting in an increase of the induced current in the closed circuit. This damper can be classified as semi\-active since it does not require any control algorithm to operate and has low power requirements, simplified electronics and small device mass. The damper was shown \(analytically and experimentally\) to be capable of effectively isolating typical satellite micro\-vibration sources **\[R4, R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Aglietti’s research on satellite micro\-vibrations **\[R1\-R5\]** has directly impacted the ability of Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. \(SSTL\) to produce satellites that achieve the platform stability required for high\-resolution imagery \(<1m\). Data and high\-resolution images from these satellites offer significant benefits to both distributors and end\-users. 

###  Adoption of technology in commercial satellites and setting the industry standard 

 The TripleSat/DMC3 \(launched in 2015\) is a Disaster Monitoring Constellation \(DMC\) made up of three SSTL\-300S1 satellites. As a direct result of Aglietti’s micro\-vibration research **\[R1\-R5\]**, SSTL were able to mitigate micro\-vibrations in the TripleSat/DMC3 satellites by redesigning the RWA isolation system located at the base of the SSTL\-300S1 platform, which had been the dominant source of micro\-vibration **\[S1\]**. This mitigation resulted in significant improvements in platform stability. The Chief Technology Officer \(CTO\) of SSTL stated, “Professor Aglietti’s research work <…> directly contributed to SSTL development strategy for higher resolution imagery and more cost effective EO \[Earth Observation\] spacecraft and future missions.” **\[S2\]** 

 TripleSat/DMC3 is owned by SSTL and managed under licence on behalf of Twenty First Century Aerospace Technology \(21AT\). 21AT paid SSTL £110M for their services, leasing 100% of the image capacity of the three satellites for the first 7 years **\[S3\]**. 

 In 2018, SSTL launched another EO satellite \(SSTL\-S1\) utilising the same SSTL\-300 platform technology as TripleSat/DMC3. The high\-resolution imagery data from this satellite is leased to 21AT and Airbus for a contract value of £25M **\[S4\]**. SSTL continue to apply the outcomes of Aglietti’s research team in subsequent high\-resolution EO satellites. 

 Aglietti’s micro\-vibration expertise also contributed to the ECSS\-E\-HB\-32\-26 standard, “Spacecraft mechanical loads analysis handbook” \(European Cooperation for Space Standardisation\), drawing on techniques detailed under a European Space Agency contract **\[S5\]**. This standard has been the recommended engineering practice for European developers of space systems throughout the REF period and remains the current standard today. 

###  Enabling Access to High\-Resolution Imagery 

 There is a need from multiple market sectors for high\-resolution images for applications such as urban planning, crop yield calculation, pollution monitoring and biodiversity assessment **\[S6\]**. Indeed, sales of EO space systems by the European space manufacturing industry reached €1.9billion in 2017, representing \~21% of all European space systems manufacturing revenues \[Source: Copernicus Market report, 2019\]. 

 The TripleSat/DMC3 Constellation consists of three identical ultra\-high\-resolution optical satellites that can survey any point of the globe on a daily basis delivering 0.8m \(panchromatic\) and 4m ground sampling distance \(GSD\) multispectral high\-resolution imagery with a 23.4K swath. The high\-resolution imagery from TripleSat/DMC3 Constellation data is being distributed by organisations including Satellite Imaging Corporation \(SIC\) **\[S7\] and** Earth\-i **\[S8\].** On 10 April 2018, Airbus entered into an agreement with satellite operator 21AT to distribute the images acquired by their TripleSat constellation. 

 Earth\-i is a Geo\-Spatial Information provider.  Earth\-i partnered with suppliers SSTL and 21AT to provide EO data and services from the TripleSat/DMC3 constellation to business, government, traders, investors, and NGOs since its launch as a start\-up in 2015. In 2019/20, Earth\-i employed a staff of 31 with a turnover of £1.9M \(Companies House\) and is ranked in the top ten most important and influential companies in the global space industry according to the 2018/19 Global Ranking Report **\[S8\].** 

###  Image use case example from Earth\-i: Advanced Coffee Crop Optimisation for Rural Development \(ACCORD\) 

 **Coffee is one of the world’s premium quality crops, but farmers lack access to timely and accurate weather data to help them improve their yield and farming practices. ACCORD provides proactive, targeted crop management information to improve the livelihoods and incomes of smallholder coffee farmers in Rwanda and Kenya. The crop management advice delivered via a mobile app is derived from satellite Earth observation \(including TripleSat/DMC3\) and advanced micro\-climate information.  The information helps to make significant improvements to coffee crop quality and yield, allowing farmers to achieve higher incomes for their work and improve the quality of life for their families \[S9\]. **

###  Aiding Disaster Relief 

 The TripleSat/DMC3 contributes images and data to the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disaster’ \(disastercharter.org\) \- a worldwide collaboration under which satellite data are made freely available for humanitarian use in the event of major international disasters. The primary users of this data under this charter are disaster relief organisations, for whom accurate and locationally precise information on the damage caused is vital for prioritised, coordinated and safe rescue and relief operations. Satellite imagery data enable large areas to be reviewed at speed and rescue activities to be accelerated. 

 The following are examples of how the high\-resolution images from the disaster monitoring constellation TripleSat/DMC3 have been used to support disaster responses: 

-  Images provided to the agencies in charge of the disaster response for the Fort McMurray wildfires in Alberta, Canada \(May 2016\) **\[S10\].** 

-  Mapping of an earthquake and tsunami on New Zealand \(Kaikoura\) \(November 2016\). A Linked Open Data for Global Disaster \(LODGD\) Task Group report following the tsunami states, “During the Kaikoura earthquake, Integrated Research on Disaster Risk \(IRDR’s\) Disaster Loss DATA project and CODATA Task Group Linked Open Data for Global Disaster Risk Research \(LODGD\) worked together with Tonkin \+ Taylor International \(T\+TI\) to provide TripleSat satellite images of the affected Hurunui District. Geo\-spatial information was developed for the New Zealand Earthquake Commission \(EQC\) on the damage caused, and was made available through a web\-based viewer to all government agencies, response and recovery agencies, engineers and researchers, thereby informing first response and mitigation measure.” **\[S11\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ramirez’s research has integrated Scenario Planning \(SP\) with other scholarly fields such as Social Ecology, Sensemaking, and Design to develop the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\). The OSPA is a distinctive SP methodology that has been influential worldwide across organisations and industry sectors by enabling a shift in the mind\-set of strategic management from closed to more open and flexible. Approximately 1,000 individuals from several hundred organisations have benefitted from instruction on the methodology to date via the Oxford Scenarios Programme \(OSP\) at the Saïd Business School. The OSPA has served as the catalyst for changes in strategic planning at companies such as Rolls Royce, and influenced policy and funding decisions within public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the World Economic Forum \(WEF\), the International Atomic Energy Authority \(IAEA\), and the National Health Service \(NHS\), charities such as Diabetes UK and Mercy Corps, and even scientific fields such as gastroenterology and the chemical sciences.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Action research conducted by Ramirez and colleagues since 2005 with participants at the Oxford Futures Forum \(OFF\) – a triennial meeting of scholars and practitioners exploring new research collaborations focused on Scenario Planning \(SP\) – has informed the concepts of the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\). The OSPA is a distinctive SP methodology that contributes to strategic management through an iterative process of framing, reframing, and reperception. This enables an important shift in mind\-set, whose effectiveness lies not in terms of old to new, or wrong to right, but from closed to open and flexible. This is the central value proposition of the OSPA **\[R1\]**. Ramirez developed the methodology with Wilkinson \(Associate Fellow, Saïd Business School \(SBS\); CEO & Secretary General, World Energy Council\), and Van der Heijden \(formerly Associate Fellow, Templeton College; Emeritus Professor, University of Strathclyde\). Ramirez and Wilkinson contributed jointly to the ideas in **R1**, with Ramirez providing 3 of the 6 case studies in which the methodology is grounded, working together with Wilkinson on a fourth. 

 Research with OFF participants has enabled 2 common divides to be addressed in the OSPA’s pedagogy – that between theory and practice, and between SP and other scholarly fields. In **R2** for example, Ramirez collaborated with Churchhouse \(then Director of Digital, Rolls\-Royce plc\), Palermo \(Manager of External Relations, Royal Society of Chemistry\), and Hoffman \(Associate Professor, Skema Business School\) to show how his co\-authors’ organisations had deployed the OSPA in their strategic management. The research has also integrated SP with other scholarly fields such as Social Ecology, Sensemaking, and Design to inform the ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations of the OSPA, making it distinctive from other plausibility\-based SP approaches in 3 ways: 

 *1\) The OSPA is learner\-centric in terms of its methodological choices.* This reflects its core theoretical roots in social ecology. In **R3**, Ramirez and co\-author Selsky \(Consulting Fellow, Institute for Washington’s Future\) contrast conventional strategic approaches derived from neoclassical economics with a socio\-ecological approach to strategy. They propose that the latter approach better helps strategic planners to engage the unpredictable uncertainty that characterises turbulent environments. Consequently, the OSPA articulates a phenomenological approach to strategy and not a predict\-and\-control mode. Focusing on usefulness makes determining purpose and user a primary condition to establishing success – which differs from considering success on whether the scenarios unfold as imagined. This is taken to be impossible in the turbulent, uncertain, novel, and ambiguous \(TUNA\) conditions in which SP is used. Ramirez and Selsky worked jointly on the manuscript for **R3**, bringing specialist knowledge on SP and Social Ecology to the collaboration, respectively. 

 *2\) The OSPA is designed to produce iterative learning through cycles of reframing and re\-perception.* Reframing occurs at a higher logical order through a process of ‘upframing’, which invites the scenario learners to view their situation from a ‘macro’ viewpoint, situated in the future that encompasses the wider context. A complementary ‘downframing’ process then helps the scenario learners to immerse themselves in the new contexts they learn. In downframing, the learners experience the ‘micro’ specific ‘what if’ implications for practice **\[R1, R2\]**. In **R4**, Ramirez presents the theory and provides empirical support using 2 case studies developed with Mukherjee \(Associate Fellow, Oxford Institute of Retail Management \(OxIRM\), SBS; Lecturer, James Cook University\) and Cuthbertson \(Senior Research Fellow and Director of OxIRM, SBS\). Ramirez was the lead author and provided the overall argument and theoretical lens, with Mukherjee and Cuthbertson providing data and leading on the analysis. 

 Ramirez’s research with Selin \(Associate Fellow, SBS; Associate Professor, School of Sustainability, College of Global Futures, Arizona State University\) underlines the central role of plausibility as it guides and helps assess development of a limited number of contrasting, relevant, and challenging scenarios as part of the above process of upframing. Their joint research found plausibility plays a more significant role than probability in many cognitive processes of deliberation and decision\-making. Plausibility is preferable to probability in TUNA conditions, where probability is either irrelevant or a logical impossibility **\[R5\]**. Ramirez was the lead author on **R5**, with Selin contributing insights on plausibility. 

 Ramirez and Eidinow \(Chair in Ancient History, University of Bristol\) are the only authors in the field who have proposed the aesthetics of storytelling as a technology to create and share plausibility to analyse scenario stories in SP **\[R6\]**. The role of aesthetics in articulating plausibility is one of the distinguishing features of the OSPA. Both authors contributed equally to **R6**, with Ramirez providing insights on SP and Eidinow the classical view on aesthetics. 

 *3\) The OSPA is designed to help strategists and policymakers find more and better options for coping and succeeding in TUNA conditions.* In TUNA conditions, applicability of existing factual evidence to forecast is limited. SP complements and challenges existing strategy development, but it is not the same as strategy. The research underpinning the OSPA examines the wider context that strategy inhabits, independent of the will or control of the strategist, recognising the need for a balance of competitive and collaborative strategic action in TUNA conditions **\[R1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\) has raised the quality of strategic conversations and led to invention and testing of new options and actions in multiple industries and sectors worldwide, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, energy, security law enforcement, and charities. Approximately 1,000 individuals from several hundred organisations have been through the Oxford Scenarios Programme \(OSP\) to date. The OSP is Saïd Business School’s executive development programme founded on the methodology. Alumnae have deployed the OSPA to the benefit of firms such as Rolls\-Royce, Anglo\-American, and Wärtsilä; intergovernmental organisations such as the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the European Patent Office \(EPO\), and the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\); NGOs and charities such as the World Economic Forum \(WEF\), Diabetes UK, and Mercy Corps; and scientific and professional fields such as Royal Society of Chemistry \(RSC\), BMJ, and United European Gastroenterology. As illustrative examples, participants on the OSP have collaborated with Ramirez on joint scholarly publications that explore the ways in which the OSPA has been employed in their institutions. One such example is Rolls\-Royce **\[R2\]**. 

###  Changes in strategic planning at Rolls\-Royce 

 After issuing 4 profit warnings and witnessing a share price fall of over 50%, in 2016 the OSPA helped Rolls\-Royce develop a new strategic planning process that re\-orientated the company’s investment process. Several dozen top managers had participated in an OSPA\-centred programme the previous summer. This led to an appetite for a company\-wide scenario planning process. 25 mid\-and\-senior level executives selected from different business units, functions, and locations, attended a 3\-day OSP workshop, during which they developed a set of scenarios addressing core strategic questions. According to Rolls\-Royce’s VP Strategy: *‘These are now used…as a stress test of the resilience of the group and business strategic plans carried out at least annually, and also as one of the decision criteria for each strategic investment option being considered. It is acknowledged within the company that the use of scenario planning contributed to the acceleration of some key strategic investments for the company which otherwise may have been delayed until a future time.’* **\[E1\]** 

 According to the VP Strategy, the introduction of the OSPA as a tool to stress\-test the group and business unit strategic plans also yielded several ‘soft’ benefits, including: *‘an “unfreezing” of the senior executives’ thought patterns to become more aware and creative; a mechanism to “make sense” of contextual complexities and uncertainties; a structured thinking approach for considering alternative plausible futures \(even if not probable\);* \[and\] *an ability to collaborate in the wider industrial strategic arenas where scenario planning is more mature/developing.’* **\[E1\]** 

###  Incorporating longer\-term risks and uncertainties into the International Monetary Fund’s \(IMF’s\) analysis 

 The OSPA has supported the IMF’s mission across its 3 major business lines of economic surveillance, lending, and capacity development. According to the IMF’s Director of Strategy, the IMF consulted Ramirez on *‘how to incorporate longer\-term risks and uncertainties into* \[its\] *traditionally shorter\-term analysis.’* **\[E2\]** This led to 2 rounds of scenario planning: the first in 2012, the second in 2016. ‘Prof Ramirez’s research, including his book* **\[R1\]** *…served as important references for guiding scenario planning at the IMF. We have used recent research articles to motivate users* **\[R2\]** *, inform scenario design questions, and tailor scenario planning to users more accustomed to working with probability\-related concepts* **\[R5\]** *.’* **\[E2\]** 

 An ongoing review of the IMF’s economic surveillance activities uses custom\-built OSPA scenarios to identify work priorities that are robust in an uncertain future and will influence how the IMF allocates resources across its 189 member countries. The Director of Strategy confirms: *‘Our Fall 2018 Regional Economic Outlook for sub\-Saharan Africa* **\[E3\]** *used scenario planning – rooted in Prof Ramirez’s research – to call for an adaption of development strategies to demographic, climatic, and technological change.’* **\[E2\]** 

 In response to the 2013\-16 Ebola outbreak, the IMF established the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to provide grants for debt relief for the poorest and most vulnerable countries hit by catastrophic natural disasters or public health disasters. *‘Scenario planning helped IMF management to respond quickly with this new Trust by sensitizing them to how the Fund can help stop a non\-economic trigger from causing snowball effects on economic growth and stability,’* says the Director of Strategy **\[E2\]**. *‘I can attest that the OSPA has had a considerable impact on the mindsets of IMF staff... It helps us anticipate and cope with ongoing changes… we feel that we have collectively improved our ability to stay ahead of developments and respond with policy options when the need arises.’* **\[E2\]** 

###  Improving reception of the World Economic Forum’s \(WEF’s\) strategic foresight work with key stakeholders 

 The experience of WEF staff at the OSP, combined with WEF’s collaboration with Ramirez between 2012 and 2014, changed the way WEF approached scenarios and improved the reception of the Forum’s strategic foresight work with key stakeholders and communities as a result. According to WEF’s Head of Society and Innovation, WEF’s new strategic foresight project on future availability of natural resources **\[E4\]** ‘ *differed markedly from previous scenario projects because it focused specifically on a critical insight from Oxford research around the power and importance of surfacing assumptions in scenario practice* **\[R2, 5\]** *.’* **\[E5\]** 

 Application of the OSPA meant that participants perceived and experienced the new scenario method as a form of ‘interesting research’ that revealed competing assumptions, new dynamics, and complex contexts for the management of natural resources. Resulting project publications by WEF experienced a significant increase in media mentions and positive feedback from among Forum communities. *‘The project engaged in workshops and dialogue more than twice the number of participants \(300\) as the average project of its type and duration. The main project was also used to “reframe” strategic conversations around resources with stakeholders – for example, with the members of the Minerals Council of Australia, community groups and Australian policy makers in a series of very challenging but productive workshops,’* confirms WEF’s Head of Society and Innovation. **\[E5\]** 

###  Increasing revenues and prioritising the digital agenda at management consultants Kearney and Atkins 

 Between 2011 and 2018, 128 of Kearney’s international clients participated in the OSP, representing 29 countries; 50 of Kearney’s partners attended \(over 15% of partners\), and 16 VPs and Principals from the company \(194 participants in total\). In the words of Managing Director of Kearney’s internal think\-tank, the Global Business Policy Council: *‘The program with Oxford has led to a wider application of scenario planning across the various practices \(both industry and service sector\) of our organization. This impact cannot be overstated. By involving so many of our partners…we have affected a sea change in the firm’s conceptual point of departure, frame of reference, preferred methodology, and intra\-firm “communities” that champion the Oxford approach to serving the scenario needs of clients. The number of Kearney projects involving scenario planning has risen significantly since the onset of our program with Oxford. So too have the revenues associated with scenario\-related client work.’* **\[E6\]** 

 The OSPA led to prioritisation of the digital agenda at design, engineering, and project management consultancy, Atkins. *‘Impacts have mainly been in the justification for, and adoption of, technology\-led strategy, which has steered the priorities of the whole business,’* says the Director of Strategic Planning \(DSP\). Group Information Services were reorganised at the company in early 2016. Referring to **R1**, the DSP confirms that the OSPA *‘informed the strategy workshops undertaken in 2015 and subsequent years – and was instrumental in the prioritisation of the digital agenda within Atkins over the last few years. In particular, the 2014 and 2015 engagements catalysed the introduction of further external thinking into senior level workshops in the early part of 2015 – including the invitation to representatives from a technology provider and data analytics firm. This brought this area of the business to the fore and progressively changed the way it was articulated externally to the market.’* **\[E7\]** 

###  Tackling technological weakness within the Danish National Police 

 In the context of a comprehensive review of its internal strategic governance structure in autumn 2017 and full review of its corporate strategy, an OSP live case forced the Danish National Police to tackle their severe technological weakness and introduced the OSPA as an internal tool for management. *‘The impact of our participation in the OSP can be documented from the amendments that were made to the corporate strategy to the decision to alter the internal governance structure to accommodate semi\-annual reviews of the strategy in the senior management board. The decision to tackle the ICT assumptions head on resulted in a decision to launch a comprehensive review of the ICT organization of the Danish Police in late 2019, early 2020,’* says the Deputy Director, Strategy and Analysis. **\[E8\]** 

  

###  Diversifying income at Diabetes UK 

 66 staff \(16% of Diabetes UK’s workforce\) have been trained in the OSPA following the Director of Operations’ attendance at the OSP in April 2017. *‘* **\[R1\]** *was used as a guide by the scenarios core team we set up in the charity…it was read by our Chief Exec and Head of Strategy amongst others,’* confirms the Director of Operations. **\[E9\]** 

 The OSPA scenarios led to an assessment of the charity’s portfolio of income generating activities. According to the Director of Operations: *‘The scenarios had highlighted for us the need to engage more in digital healthcare and we have seen an opportunity both to bring in funds through our knowledge assets on diabetes in this area, and also to help shape the digital healthcare agenda for diabetes. We have agreed a staged investment process for several £00k in a programme of work to develop this.’* **\[E9\]** 

 In addition, the OSPA led to a new programme of work on inequalities arising from future scenarios: *‘One of the most striking conclusions we came to from the scenarios thinking was the extent of the new inequalities for some groups and individuals with diabetes that each of our scenarios led to. We have therefore set up a whole programme of work around this area…we are investing in this and have agreed that all our work needs to look through the various different lenses of inequalities that the scenarios highlighted. We are seeing this play out with Covid\-19 as it has highlighted the heightened mortality risks to people with diabetes in the lowest income decile,’* says the Director of Operations. **\[E9\]** 

 The above examples illustrate how the greatest value from the OSPA has come from organisations’ embedding the re\-perception that the OSPA has helped bring about as an input to other processes. In this way, the OSPA has contributed to organisations’ agility and adaptability by maintaining a more open sense of future and delivering new and different thriving and coping options, all of which are key elements of organisational resilience.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Our research has established new assessment methods and physical profiling tests for clubhead velocity in golf and have been adopted by both the Professional Golfers' Association \(PGA\) European Tour Performance Institute \(ETPI\) and England Golf to profile their elite golfers. These tests now form the basis for the way in which elite and recreational golfers’ training programmes are designed, delivered and evaluated. In order to carry out these tests, new coaches have been employed, new equipment has been purchased and provision of our assessment and physical profiling is now implemented by the ETPI in new facilities at 37 European Tour events across the world per year, in addition to the recent 2018 & 2019 Open Championships and the 2018 Ryder Cup. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2015, the Sport Performance & Biomechanics Research Group \(SPBRG\) within the Institute for Sport and Physical Activity Research \(ISPAR\) at the University of Bedfordshire, began examining the testing, profiling and training modalities being used within elite golf to enhance driving distance. Driving distance \(how far the ball travels from the tee\) is negatively correlated with playing handicap \(better golfers hit the ball further\) and research suggests if a golfer can drive the ball 20 yards further, they are likely to gain 0.75 strokes per round, or 3 strokes over a four\-day tournament. To put that into context, looking at the current scoring averages for the PGA, the top ranked golfer has a scoring average of 69.4 strokes per round. If we add 3 strokes to that, it falls to the golfer ranked 197<sup>th</sup> out of only 215 golfers on this tour. 

 Data from 2018 shows that PGA golfers averaging between 310\-320 yards in driving distance won an average of $1,890,032 more than their counterparts that average between 300\-310 yards. Whilst driving distance is a key performance parameter, it is affected by environmental conditions, limiting its ability to be reliably used to determine drive performance. Therefore, the most useful indicator of driving distance is clubhead velocity \(CHV\) at impact \(how fast the club is moving when it strikes the ball\). 

 The SPBRG’s initial research focussed on examining the relationships between CHV and vertical ground reaction force \(vGRF\) during bilateral strength and jumping based exercises in highly skilled \(handicap ≤5\) golfers \[3.1\]. Previous literature had shown significant relationships between CHV and vertical jump height, however, these modalities do not measure vGRF, which is considered to be a critical aspect for increasing driving distance. Traditional approaches had focussed on using training modalities to develop rate of force development, which we found to be a less reliable method, compared to measuring impulse. 

 Our research indicated that exercises, similar in duration to the golf downswing, which aim to increase impulse and maximal force production have the greatest relationships with CHV \[3.1\]. Squat jump and countermovement jump positive impulse \(CMJ PI\) had the strongest correlations with CHV, whilst peak force was shown to significantly relate to peak CHV \[3.1\]. This was the first study to show that maximal explosive strength has an important relationship with golfers’ drive distances. 

 As a result of this world leading research \[3.1\], the SPBRG collaborated with the European Tour in order to examine if CHV could be predicted by CMJ PI and isometric mid\-thigh pull \(IMTP\) peak force in 31 European Challenge Tour \(professional\) golfers. This world\-leading study was the first to examine the relationship between CHV and force generating capacity in elite golfers performing on the European Challenge Tour circuit \[3.2\]. The results showed that CMJ PI was a large significant positive predictor of Challenge Tour golfers’ CHV. These findings offer significant practical insight, in that increasing CMJ PI by 46.85 N<sup>.</sup>s, should yield an increase in CHV of 1.69 m<sup>.</sup>s<sup>\-1</sup>. This provides clear guidance for strength and conditioning \(S&C\) coaches working with golfers to prescribe exercises and set goals to achieve this objective and increase CHV. 

 The SPBRG extended the evidence base further by compiling an asymmetry profile for highly skilled golfers across a range of bilateral strength and jumping based exercises in order to examine if there was a relationship between vGRF asymmetry and CHV \[3.3\]. Whilst golf is an inherently asymmetrical sport, there is conflicting evidence within the literature as to the association between asymmetry and increased risk of injury and reduced performance. The standardised assessment and physical profiling used within this \[3.3\] and previous studies \[3.1, 3.2\] can be used to reliably identify asymmetries in countermovement jump, squat jumps, drop jumps and IMTP in highly skilled golfers. Whilst asymmetries were found to have no significant relationship with CHV in this study, it lays important groundwork, to enable the group to prospectively examine the relationship between vGRF asymmetry and injury within highly skilled golfers. In the meantime, S&C coaches should focus on prescribing exercises to maximise force production rather than matching symmetry.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Changes to assessment methods used by the PGA European Tour & England Golf** 

 Our research findings were presented by Dr Jack Wells to the Chief Medical Officer of the European Tour \[5.1\]. These findings showed a strong relationship between vGRF variables and CHV \[3.1\] and showed the importance of IMTP peak force and CMJ PI for CHV and in turn golf driving distance. This highlights that the more force generated during a vertical jump, the faster the swing of the golf club and the further the ball will travel. At the time, this was the first study to examine these vGRF variables in highly skilled golfers. Based on this research \[3.1\] and the presentation to the Chief Medical Officer, the ETPI moved away from their traditional method of evaluating explosive strength in their golfers \[5.1\]. They changed their approach to assessment in professional golf, from using vertical jump height, to looking at IMTP peak force and CMJ impulse saying *“As a consequence of our discussions with you and your research team and on the basis of the evidence in your work, we began to investigate the use of peak force and impulse measures of strength and explosive strength”* \[5.1\]. 

 The ETPI, subsequently contacted all 650 PGA European Tour, Challenge Tour and Senior Tour players, offering them the new standardised assessment and physical profiling we identified \[3.1 & 3.2\] and confirmed the impact of this new approach, stating: *“For the first time at the ETPI, we implemented a standardised approach to physical profiling; previously we had no such assessment players could use”* \[5.1\]. England Golf also adopted the standardised assessments and profiling we identified to improve performance \[3.1 & 3.2\] and these are now carried out with England Golf’s male and female national and regional squads, totalling 208 golfers \[5.2\]. 

 **Collaboration with the PGA European Tour & England Golf to gain insight and enhance provision for their golfers** 

 Working in collaboration with the ETPI, recommendations from our research \[3.1\] were tested in a cohort of 31 elite golfers on the PGA European Tour, which resulted in a world\-leading study on elite golfers \[3.2\]. Subsequently, the ETPI implemented our recommended approach to physically profiling its golfers \[5.3\] based on our assessment methods \[3.1 & 3.2\]. This revolutionised and standardised their current practices, where previously there had been no consistent and reliable approach \[5.1\]. In order to do this, the ETPI purchased two PASCO Scientific Force Plates, so they could replicate our recommended assessment methods \[5.1\]. All 650 PGA European Tour, Challenge Tour and Senior Tour players were contacted and offered S&C training support based on the results of the assessment \[5.1\]. Following the lead of the ETPI, England Golf \[5.2\] purchased two PASCO Scientific Force Plates, so their S&C coaches at the National Performance Centre could replicate the standardised profiling assessments we recommended based on findings from our research \[3.1 & 3.2\], with their elite squads. England Golf highlighted the impact of using our research in practice, stating: *“This research has been of great value to England Golf, as it allows us to objectively track the progress of our players as well as informing the strength and conditioning delivery, which sets us apart from other NGB programmes”* \[5.2\]. 

 The standardised Physical Profile Report & Physical Profiling Decision Tree used by the ETPI \[5.3\] has been developed from our research findings \[3.1 & 3.2\]. Used in conjunction, they enable a series of standardised tests to be carried out, providing an evidence\-based assessment leading to specific training modalities that can then be prescribed based on the results of the tests.  Tailored assessments can facilitate optimal performance of the golfer, taking key factors related to performance into account. For example, if IMTP peak force is low, strength training at 80\-100%1RM would be prescribed, however, if it is high and CMJ PI is low, prescription would focus on exercises that elicit increases in impulse, such as weighted jumps \[5.3\]. Using these novel assessment methods not only offers ways to improve performance, but also enables audit, feedback and monitoring of the players’ progress. This in turn highlights the positive impact the S&C training is having on their physical profile and in turn their CHV. Based on the results of the Challenge Tour research \[3.2\] the ETPI now use a scoring system from 1\-10, which provides benchmarking for players undertaking our profiling \[5.3\]. Our research \[3.3\] has also laid the foundation for a prospective asymmetry epidemiology study in this cohort of highly skilled golfers. 

 **Employment of additional strength & conditioning coaches by the PGA European Tour** 

 Our research has created additional roles for S&C coaches within the golf arena. In order to deliver the standardised assessment and physical profiling across its tournaments worldwide, the ETPI employed four additional S&C staff to carry out the testing, interpret the data and design bespoke S&C programmes for golfers based on the results of their profiling assessment \[5.1\]. Our group were responsible for training the newly appointed staff \[5.1\]. As of February 2020, just prior to the global COVID\-19 pandemic, 25% of the 650 European Tour golfers had taken up the profiling and subsequent training programmes, with the majority reporting meaningful improvements in driving distance and 12 players winning tournaments attributed to the tailored programming and subsequent S&C coaching, delivered based on our research \[5.1\]. 

 **Provision of coaches and facilities at global golf tournaments by the PGA European Tour and R&A** 

 Our research \[3.1 & 3.2\] has led to significant changes in provision of support and facilities at PGA European Tour golf tournaments across the world. The ETPI are now funding the delivery of the standardised profiling assessment, at 37 golf tournaments per year across Europe and in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, South Africa and Kenya, with approximately 25% of participants in each tournament benefiting from the assessment \[5.1\]. In addition, the research has influenced the provision of enhanced facilities by the ETPI, at events such as the 2018 & 2019 Open Championships, and 2018 Ryder Cup and both the PGA European Tour and The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews \(R&A\) who have confirmed their intention to continue to provide this support in the future \[5.1\]. These enhanced facilities include the two PASCO Scientific Force Plates \(to measure IMTP peak force and CMJ impulse\) that were purchased in order to carry out our assessments and profiling, in addition to specialist strength training equipment that is housed in the European Tour Performance Unit, which travels across the world to each tournament. 

 **Re\-defining the way strength & conditioning coaches design programmes for elite golfers** 

 Our new guidelines for physical profiling \[5.3\] \[3.1 & 3.2\] is widely cited by S&C coaches supporting professional golfers. “ *At the ETPI, we typically measure explosive strength using CMJ net positive impulse and strength using IMTP peak force*” and “ *Explosive strength is of great importance in golf. Players are required to generate large forces through the ground, then through the body and into the clubhead to generate speed*” \[5.4a\]. “ *We built a programme which targeted the development of muscle groups which are primarily responsible for ground reaction force generation in the golf swing*” \[3.2\] and “ *He did make reasonable improvements in explosive strength \(as indicated by the countermovement jump impulse\), likely attributable to the squat jumps*” \[5.4b\]. In addition, we see our research referred to when the ETPI discuss how the best golfers in the world are using S&C to elevate their performance, saying “ *There is substantial evidence showing positive relationships between various strength and power measures and clubhead speed*” \[3.2\] and “ *Due to his increases in body mass, Bryson DeChambeau’s vertical jump height may well be lower \(or similar\) than when he first began his training programme, but his momentum at take\-off will almost certainly be higher \(he is more powerful, but not relative to body mass\) and it is this which relates more strongly to CHV*” \[5.5\]. Practitioners providing physiotherapy and S&C support to European Tour and US PGA Tour golfers have confirmed that implementing our training guidelines has increased the CHV of a number of their clients \[5.6 & 5.7\]. Coaches confirmed they are “now able to objectively monitor fatigue levels of the athletes closer and enhance robustness of the player, thus reducing the risk of injury” and see “how an individual’s strength and conditioning programme is influencing their peak force and their ability to express 

 higher forces within the swing \[5.7\]. 

 **Re\-defining the way strength & conditioning coaches design programmes for amateur golfers** 

 The Titleist Performance Institute cited our work \[5.8\] saying *“The two primary tests linked in the research to elite golf performance are the IMTP and CMJ. Enhanced performance in these tests have been correlated to an increase in clubhead speed, which is likely to improve driving distances. Consequently, these 2 tests have been used to benchmark players.”* In addition Golf & Health \[5.9\] state “ *As with most striking, hitting or throwing sports, the lower body is the engine \(force generation\) for the motion of the golf swing. This is why leg strength is a priority. This is now supported by research indicating significant relationships between lower body strength, explosive strength and CHV*” \[3.1 & 3.2\]. Coaches working with recreational golfers have also confirmed that they have changed their approach to S&C programme prescription as a result of our research. Orbiss Fitness confirm “ *The research has been beneficial to us and has enhanced the way we train our golfers. After reviewing your research, we changed our approach around preparing golfers, by improving their overall strength followed by improving their ability to produce club head velocity*” \[5.10\]. Golf coaches have also confirmed that our research is changing their practice: “ *Utilising some of the research by your team, we as golf coaches can make more informed decisions for changes in technique, or development of S&C programmes for golfers*” \[5.11\]. 

 Finally, we were pleased to get feedback on our research from the ETPI saying, *“Your work resulted in organisational level change and practitioner level change in practice regarding profiling and training for players”* \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Paisey’s research seeks to understand what it means to be an accounting professional at a time of increased public scrutiny and higher ethical expectations. Evidence based upon her research has \(i\) informed revisions to an International Educational Standard and a resultant policy shift to ensure that the Continuing Professional Development of almost 3 million accountants worldwide legitimises the profession’s claim to serve the public interest. Through engagement with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland \(ICAS\), Paisey’s research has \(ii\) underpinned changes to ICAS policy and practice via bold new ethics guidance for its 23,000 members, which supports speaking up and whistleblowing. In turn, this has \(iii\) influenced the wider business community \(e.g. by informing ethics policy within PwC, the UK’s largest professional services firm\). These constitute significant impacts on ethical culture and maintaining public trust. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Context** 

 Historically, professional accountancy bodies have stressed competence, ethical practices and serving the public interest as constituents of their professional status. However, the financial scandals of the early twenty\-first century resulted in widespread mistrust of the profession. Paisey’s research has investigated the responses of professional accountancy bodies to serving the public interest through enhanced Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) and processes to ensure that they remain appropriately skilled and grounded in an ethical culture in which member integrity is seen to transcend all other business objectives. 

 **2.2. Education research** 

 Paisey’s research into the development of the accounting professional **\[3.1, 3.2\]** has a key focus on education at all stages from school, through university, to initial professional development and CPD. Having identified a gap in the CPD literature, she has published in this area since 1996, most recently publishing two outputs with N. Paisey \(Emeritus Professor, Heriot\-Watt University\) **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. Based upon an analysis of the CPD policies of twelve professional accountancy bodies, a key finding is the need for accounting CPD to relate to all accountants who are members of professional bodies. While medicine and law have clear definitions of a professional practitioner and the scope of professional work, the accountancy profession lacks such a precise definition. Thus professional accountancy bodies retain many members whose current work is diverse and not necessarily related to accountancy, even if defined broadly. 

 A key concern identified is that some influential professional bodies only require CPD to relate to their members’ current roles, rather than to accountancy itself. This results in professionally qualified members satisfying their requirement by undertaking CPD that develops competence in roles that may be devoid of accounting content. This is not the intention behind mandatory CPD, nor is it sufficient to assure the public interest claims on which the accountancy profession is based. On the other hand, making every member undertake narrowly defined CPD would result in many members undertaking CPD that is relevant to their profession but not to their role, which may not be acceptable to them. The research **\[3.3, 3.4\]** concludes that more effective CPD is therefore needed, including accounting rather than solely role\-related material, since if a professional accountant does not act competently in whatever capacity, that could reflect negatively on the profession and themselves, with consequences for wider society and the public. 

 **2.3. Ethics research** 

 Paisey’s research \(with N. Paisey and I. Tsalavoutas\) has focused on the ethical dilemmas faced by chartered accountants, including how they handle them and the support they receive. The first stage of the research **\[3.5\]** consisted of a review of academic literature on speaking up, listening up, and whistleblowing, ethics and organisational culture, followed by a questionnaire survey of Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland \(ICAS\) members building on the literature review. For the second stage **\[3.6\]**, 48 interviews were conducted, primarily with ICAS members, to gain a deeper understanding of interviewees’ real\-life ethical dilemmas and actions, and in particular their speak up, listen up and whistleblowing responses to those dilemmas. 

 The principal findings and insights from this research have been that while whistleblowing policies are commonplace in the larger firms, they are rare in smaller firms, pointing to a need for more widespread usage. The first monograph **\[3.5\]** also shows that younger members are less likely to claim to have encountered ethical dilemmas or to have spoken up. The second monograph **\[3.6\]** confirms the need for a more listening\-focused approach and shows that chartered accountants encounter very significant ethical dilemmas much more frequently than previous research had indicated. The report concludes that there is a need for more widespread use of speak up/whistleblowing policies and support for chartered accountants who face ethical dilemmas, including enhanced networking and ethical mentoring arrangements.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 **4.1. Pathways to impact** 

 Paisey’s research into the accountancy profession has enhanced our understanding of the role of the profession at the beginning of the twenty\-first century. Through direct engagement with international organisations and standard\-setting boards, it has contributed directly to the worldwide restoration of public trust in the profession by shaping international education and ethics policies and practice, as outlined below: 

 **4.2. Impact on international education** 

 The International Federation of Accountants \(IFAC\) comprises more than 170 accountancy bodies in over 130 countries, representing almost 3 million accountants worldwide. Its purpose is to serve the public interest by enhancing the relevance, reputation, and value of the global accountancy profession. Paisey’s work has informed the work of two IFAC standard\-setting boards, the International Accounting Education Standards Board \(IAESB\) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants \(IESBA\). The IAESB established a range of International Accounting Standards in professional accounting education, including the mandating of CPD for all members of accountancy bodies that are members of IFAC since International Education Standard 7 \(IES7\) *Continuing Professional Development* became effective in 2006. All IFAC member bodies are obliged to adopt and implement these standards. 

 Paisey’s research underpinned a significant shift in policy in IES7 to ensure that CPD continues to legitimise the profession’s claim to serve the public interest. In August 2017, evidence from the research was submitted to the IAESB **\[5A\]**. It proposed changes to two aspects of the IES7 exposure draft: First, Paisey’s submission argued that accountants whose role was no longer within accounting should nevertheless be required, on the basis of the research findings, to undertake CPD related to the field of accounting. Second, Paisey questioned the focus on planned CPD, proposing that unplanned but relevant activities should also be included. 

 Paisey’s formal comments were discussed at IAESB meetings in November 2017 and April 2018. The minutes of the April meeting **\[5B\]** record a debate on the exposure draft wording to accord with Paisey’s first point. In July 2018, an Issues Paper recorded that: *“Based on respondent feedback \[…\] it is critical that IES7 \[revised\] make clear that IFAC member body responsibilities for CPD relate to the role of the professional accountant”*, rather than to non\-accounting roles \(p.7\-9\). This point was only made in the Paisey submission, thus the now finalised revised IES7 has been amended on the basis of Paisey’s evidence **\[5C\]**. Moreover, guidance to support the implementation of IES7 includes a discussion of the importance of unplanned as well as planned activities, a revision that aligns with Paisey’s second proposal **\[5D\]**. 

 These changes are significant in both geographical reach and regulatory depth as they ensure that the mandatory CPD of almost 3 million accountants worldwide will be undertaken in a manner that is acceptable to both individual members and to the wider profession. The IAESB Director of Skills and Assessment confirmed that: *“the new standard talks of the professional accountant, rather than the role in the accounting profession \[…\] It’s very clear now—and the explanatory material really sets out—that CPD is relevant to you as a professional accountant, regardless of the sector in which you work, regardless of the size of the organisation.”* She added: *“Individuals within professional accounting bodies will be able to better see why they need to do CPD, and take better ownership and responsibility, and therefore, the relevance because it’s there, will lead to enhanced quality of CPD being chosen”* **\[5E\]**. 

 **4.3. Impact on ICAS ethics policy and practice** 

 Paisey is a member of the Council and Ethics Board of ICAS, and through this engagement seeks to keep her research relevant to current concerns within the profession. ICAS is a professional body of more than 23,000 members and 3,000 students who work in over 100 countries around the world. The reports of Paisey’s research on the ethical experiences of chartered accountants, the dilemmas they face, and the support they would like to receive, were launched at events held by ICAS in London and Edinburgh in October 2019. The research findings were further disseminated to all ICAS members via an article in the monthly magazine *CA Today* **\[5F\]**, thus increasing member awareness of ethics dilemmas. 

 Paisey’s research is now underpinning the creation of new ICAS practitioner\-focused documents for its members under the *Power of One* motif. ICAS is currently drafting plans to implement one of the research report’s key recommendations relating to the need for a system of ethics mentoring to support members with ethical dilemmas. The ICAS CEO confirmed, *“the research has been extremely informative, insightful and useful to ICAS. It highlights the need for organisations to have appropriate mechanisms in place to encourage speak up and listen up procedures and the benefits that they can bring to organisational culture \[…\] the research has assisted ICAS to identify areas where greater attention and focus is required in order to better meet the needs of members and also to serve its public interest mandate.”* **\[5G\]**. As a direct result of the research and in order to assist its members, *“ICAS decided to further the offering by facilitating access for its members to advice provided by Protect”*. Other initiatives in progress in Autumn 2020, which directly stem from the research, include a focus on bullying via a webinar and associated guidance, and the establishment of an ethics mentoring facility to support members with ethical dilemmas **\[5G\]**. 

 The research has also supported ICAS submissions to two reviews. First, ICAS included Paisey’s research findings in its submission to the UK Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on revisions to the Corporate Governance Code. Second, in its comments on the Exposure Draft on the Role and Mindset Expected of Professional Accountants, issued by IESBA \(the international standard\-setting ethics board\), ICAS proposed that: *“to ensure a successful organisational culture, employees need to feel they can speak up about concerns without retribution, that their concerns are listened to, and, most importantly, are followed up”*. ICAS evidenced this by means of appending links to Paisey’s two monographs at the end of its submission **\[5H\]**. The need for this additional inclusion in the exposure draft was discussed at the December 2019 meeting **\[5I\]** and included in the marked\-up copy of the proposed exposure draft **\[5J\]**, which includes reference to protection for whistleblowers as part of the promotion of an ethical culture. The ICAS CEO confirmed: *“This assisted in ensuring that the IESBA Task Force in charge of this project considered the need for inclusion of a specific reference to whistleblowing in relation to possible new content on organisational culture”* **\[5G\]**. 

 **4.4. Impact on the wider international business community** 

 The findings and recommendations from Paisey’s research are also relevant to the wider business community. ICAS has sent the reports to various international bodies; for example, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants has uploaded links to the two reports on its  [website](https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/building-trust-ethics/discussion/when-do-you-speak-listen-whistleblow). The Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment \(CISI\) also believe that the results contain important messages for their members, and hence participated in the research monograph launch events with ICAS. In addition, the Head of Professional Standards at CISI invited Paisey to deliver a presentation in Cyprus in November 2019, writing that: *“while your research focused primarily on Chartered Accountants, I strongly feel that your findings \[…\] are relevant for all professionals – including those CISI members working within securities, investment, wealth and financial planning”* **\[5K\]**. 

 Other international organisations have found the research useful in clarifying or supporting their thinking, informing policy evaluation \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5L\]**\). For instance, PwC is the largest professional services firm in the UK with revenues of GBP4.2bn in 2019 and approximately 25,000 employees. PwC’s Ethics Partner commented that: *“the information \[in the research monographs\] about the experience of the wider accounting profession was helpful in contextualising the reports we receive on our Speak Up facility”*. He confirmed that PwC had been reviewing its own in\-house Speak Up facility and wrote that the research findings were, *“helpful in considering the specifications of the new arrangements”* and added, *‘I particularly found the focus in the Report on “Listen Up” of interest and supportive of views emerging within PwC as to how best to handle whistleblowing in its widest sense’* **\[5L\]**. 

 **4.5. Beneficiaries** 

 Taken together, Paisey’s education and ethics research has highlighted issues that need to be addressed by the accountancy profession, professional firms and other organisations \(these practitioners are the primary beneficiaries of the research\). This has led to changes to professional services in order to provide a culture in which accountants \(and professionals in other sectors\) effectively maintain professional competence and feel able to speak up where they have concerns, both of which are necessary conditions for public trust and the protection of the public interest \(therefore, the public are secondary beneficiaries of this research\).

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Myatt’s ground\-breaking research on state\-of\-the\-art 3D sound projection methods and production techniques has resulted in a large body of unique and award\-winning works of sound art. Works have been exhibited in some of the world’s most prestigious art galleries and at major international cultural events. Myatt’s work has achieved global cultural impact and impacted artistic and curatorial practices. Furthermore, immersive spatial audio projections of wildlife and natural phenomena have promoted international awareness of the conservation of species, of threatened habitats, and the awareness of sound pollution in the oceans.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Myatt‘s practice\-based research in spatial audio production integrates both technical and aesthetic research questions. It moves beyond the notion of spatial sound reproduction as a primarily technical research problem to consider the content, recording methods, the technical and artistic composition of works and their means of reproduction as an integrated whole; to establish production methods which can appeal to human spatial audio perception \(HSAP\). 

 Myatt’s research introduces spatial considerations at all stages of the artistic production process: from the conception of a work, its pre\-production, field recording and studio production, to post\-production, sound reproduction and loudspeaker installation in art galleries and exhibition/performance venues **\[S1, S2, S3\]**. 

 The research underpinning this case was preceded by a period of theoretical research relating to the psychoacoustics of human spatial\-audio apprehension \(Myatt/Lennox, 1999\-2011\). This previous body of work established the practice\-research questions whose solutions are articulated in the body of sound installations and performances described **\[R1\-R5, S1\-S6\]**, and in the resulting spatial audio production methods. 

 “Prof. Myatt’s research stands out in merging science, engineering and art and contributes significantly to the understanding, creation and presentation of highest\-level spatial audio works.” **\[S5\]** 

###  Novel air\-based recording methods to preserve spatial audio information 

 Research insights relating to the nature and preservation of spatial audio information have spurned collaborative field recording projects, such as  capturing the audio soundfields and infrasound generated by elephants in Amboseli National Park, Kenya 2016 **\[R6, S3\];** and the use of Myatt’s native\-B\-format Ambisonic hydrophone array \[A and *Hy Brasil* \(2014\)\] for underwater spatial audio capture, to provide access to otherwise unperceivable underwater sound environments \(e.g., those of Humpback Whales, dolphins, coral reef fish—variously recorded   in the seas off the Dominican Republic, Cocos Islands, Miami and Belize\). **\[R1, R2, R4, R5\]** 

###  The derivation of bespoke audio signal processing software 

 A number of multiparametric spatial audio attributes have been implemented in the works described, including methods to support the delivery of perceptually significant audio attributes, e.g., to achieve “audio looming” **\[R1, R2\]**. The artists’ former use of mono or stereo recordings, amplitude\-panned to discrete loudspeakers, has been replaced by complex, spatially encoded methods which combine, scaled and layered soundfields to generate spatially\-rich environments to promote a “powerful sense of place” **\[R1\]**, e.g., to reorient listener \(mic\) positions and the perceived perspective of soundfields within Ambisonic recordings \[ **R4** and *Rising tides*\]. The production of such works has also been supported by bespoke audio software created by Myatt for use in their personal production studios **\[S1, S2\]**. 

###  The design, implementation and integration of appropriate loudspeaker reproduction technologies. 

 Research insights have established methodologies to create multifacited spatial environments, consisting of carefully selected proximate, foreground, midground and background elements to support HSAP, including methods to time\-align and compensate loudspeaker reproduction systems for venue acoustics, architectures and outdoor sites \[e.g., **R2, R5**\]. 

 In 2019 Myatt realised a world\-first live\-performance system that integrated full\-spectrum fifth\-order High\-order Ambisonic \(HOA\) sound reproduction of 64 independent audio channels, with a 496\-audio\-channel Wavefield Synthesis \(WFS\) system and infrasound generation at EMPAC, US **\[R1, S1, S5\]**. The system implemented a high\-precision surrounding and multi\-faceted sphere of sound as a mid/far\-field component, used WFS to project proximate audio materials to within \~5cm of the audiences’ ears, and infrasound to provide access to animal communication behaviours of whales and elephants using purpose\-built infrasound reproduction units **\[S3\]**. Spatial audio materials and control systems were produced for each of these reproduction elements, to support the presentation of a holistic, spatially\-rich audio environment. 

 “The resulting experience \[of R1\] was for everyone – audience, artists, the EMPAC production team and myself – aesthetically and technologically stunning.” **\[S5\]**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Myatt’s practice\-based research has encouraged curators to see spatial audio artworks as feasible, impactful in their emotive and experiential reception by audiences, and as a significant new form of artwork that allows artists to present wildlife and natural sound recordings in contexts that are believable, and not obviously mediated by loudspeakers. 

###  1. Cultural Impact 

 Myatt’s research has facilitated a large body of immersive and architectural spatial audio artworks, exhibited throughout the world **\[S8\]**. The cultural significance of these works has been recognised by their inclusion in two nation\-state national art collections \(see above\) **\[S4\]**. The international demand from art curators to exhibit and commission new spatial audio sound art, and for key cultural events, is also indicative of the cultural impact of this work **\[R2, R3, R4, R5, S8\]**. 

 “\[Myatt’s\] research and the outcome of his research are extremely relevant in the contemporary art discourse today, as the interest in sound is growing in art practices, in art theory and for major art institutions. The physicality of the sound experience … resonates vividly with the notion of embodied spectatorship in the phenomenological approach in art theory.” **\[S7\]** 

 “Prof. Myatt’s research stands out in merging science, engineering and art and contributes significantly to the understanding, creation and presentation of highest\-level spatial audio works.” **\[S5\]** 

 Spatial audio works have been disseminated to millions of people worldwide: ZKM visitor numbers, 1.3m since 2014 \(at 2019\); Summer Streets, Dive, Park Ave Road Tunnel exhibited on three mornings August 2013, 17,300 people \(data: Summer Streets Festival\), along with exhibits at very high visitor\-attraction venues such as Tate Modern \(2018\) and Museum of Modern Art \(2013\), New York \(20,000/day\) **\[S8\]**. 

###  2. Impact on artistic and curatorial practice 

 Myatt has conducted and applied his research findings in more than 22 collaborations with artists Chris Watson \(UK\) and Jana Winderen \(Norway\). 

 “Tony’s research findings have enabled me to pursue a new strand of sound installation practice, quite distinct from other approaches…It has also given me the confidence to take on very large\-scale projects and installations. This has made not only the issues at stake—the awareness of underwater sound environments and its importance to the biodiversity—but also the quality of the listening experience, in itself in the installations and concerts, of a noticeable quality internationally. …Installations of this type are now a major component of my artistic output and future commissions for galleries and exhibitions around the world.” **\[S2\]** 

 “As a means of expression, I am particularly interested in spatial audio sound installations to put the listener into the environment of the original recording. Tony’s work in creating multiple loudspeaker arrays and designing the software to deliver these works is crucial to the powerful sense of place conveyed to the audience.” **\[S1\]** 

 The practices of the above artists have been enhanced and expanded by Myatt’s research outcomes **\[S1, S2\]** to now include complex, spatially\-encoded methods which combine scaled and layered soundfields to support spatially\-rich sound environments, projected via large, spatially\-encoded loudspeaker arrays **\[S10\]**. 

 Widespread programming by leading international curators acknowledges the potency of the sound works resulting from this research **\[S8\]**. Myatt’s research has also facilitated works of a consistently high\-quality of sound reproduction and technical reliability that has provided curators with the confidence to present works of spatial sound art in extended and major exhibitions **\[R2, R3, R5, S8\]**. 

###  3. Conservation awareness and reach 

 The exhibition of each work **\[S8\]** has spurned critical discourse relating to the aesthetics of sound art and to conservation in the press and media **\[S7, S8\]**. The spatial dimension of works underpinned by Myatt’s research allow audiences to be enveloped in rich, high\-quality sound environments and to very quickly engage with the subject matter of the work. International curators have been quick to acknowledge the potency of spatially\-rich and immersive sound installations which fully occupy architectural space. 

 “\[The Art of Listening: Underwater \(Miami\)\] makes the sea’s natural wonders and man\-made stresses surprisingly visceral for locals and visitors alike.” Schneider, Artnet Magazine, US, \(2019\). 

 As Pernet described above, the awareness of conservation themes and listener engagement is enabled by Myatt’s spatial audio production methods **\[S7\]**: 

 “The Art of listening: Underwater provides visitors with a unique opportunity to listen closely to the ocean’s inhabitants and to reflect upon the ways in which human activity interferes with underwater life…to bring awareness to the ocean’s increasingly fragile ecosystem and to how environmental concerns are localised within this seaside community.” **\[S9\]** 

 “\[Winderen and Myatt\] highlight soundscapes that are otherwise hidden from us and makes them accessible. With this, they promote a new form of awareness around the soundscapes, but also what effect man\-made noise pollution can have for them.” **\[S10\]** 

 The efficacy of the works’ phemomenological experience is evident in subsequent discourse in the international press around the themes of the installations, e.g., The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Miami Herald, Artnews, The Guardian, and numerous online publications such as signemagazine, Subjekt \(No\) and Artnet. 

 “Sound is for me a visceral medium and I judge the success of Tony’s work by the enthusiasm of an audience to fully engage in a journey wherever my microphones and Tony’s spatialisation takes them.” **\[S1\]** 

 “This is vital work, especially as pandemic economies continue to grow more dependent on e\-commerce and water\-borne shipping traffic amplifies noise pollution. In a quarantined world, spatial sound is crucial to reconsidering our actions on land, to think outside ourselves, where a one\-click order on Amazon could have grave consequences.” **\[S11\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In 2018\-2019, 27,820 people were killed or seriously injured \(KSI\) on British roads. NTU researchers found that identifying hazardous precursors is a vital safety\-related skill that likely underpins many such KSIs. This led to the development and implementation of award\-winning hazard tests for fire\-service drivers, a hazard test for a national bus operator, VR hazard training for 25,000 London bus drivers, and a free\-to\-download VR app for learner drivers. NTU advised the Dutch and Irish Governments on the development of national hazard tests and has licensed tests to a leading health & safety e\-learning provider \(Human Focus International\). 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 NTU researchers have concluded that *predicting* imminent hazards based on hazardous precursors \(i.e. clues in the driving scene\) is the vital skill that makes drivers safe, rather than simply reacting quickly to hazards. This finding underpinned development of more robust tests of driver safety \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\] that are preferred by drivers, viewed as fairer tests \[ **R4**, **R5**\] and are better suited to professional and international driving contexts \[ **R2**, **R3**, **R6**\]. 

 NTU’s new tests are based on *hazard prediction:* Drivers watch clips of driving which occlude just as the hazard begins. When asked “What happens next?”, they choose an answer from on\-screen options. This test mitigates flaws in the official UK driving test, including scoring subjectivity and criterion bias. Based on the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique, this new test has fared better than more traditional hazard perception tests in differentiating safe and less\-safe drivers in many circumstances \[ **R2**, **R3**, **R5**\]. 

 These insights arose from research, including externally\-funded projects, that created and validated tests to differentiate safe from less\-safe drivers, refining protocols for test development and expanding understanding of the underlying skill. 

 Two grants from the Fire Service Research and Training Trust \(2015\-18; £72k; Crundall, Brunsden, Hill\) funded development of video\-based tests for fire drivers, with clips filmed from fire engines and cars on blue\-light runs. This was the first study to directly compare *prediction* and *perception* test\-formats, with the former found to be more successful. The resultant tests are now use in fire service driver training and are freely available on testmydriving.com. This research won the Fire Magazine research award \(2017\) and led to three publications \[ **R2**, **R6**\]. 

 The Department for Transport \(2017\-2018; £90k; Crundall, Groeger\) funded research to identify which scenarios best suit the prediction or perception test\-format using a novel hazard test constructed from Computer Generated Imagery. This test had several innovations, such as driving theory questions embedded in the clips. The tests were well received, successfully differentiated between safe and less\-safe driver groups, resulting in a publication \[ **R5**\]. 

 Several other grants have allowed NTU to validate and iterate the test\-development process for specialist populations. Funders include Stagecoach, to develop a hazard test for bus drivers \(£60k, Crundall, Ventsislavova\), the Road Safety Trust \(RST\), to develop a hazard training for mobility scooter users \(£88k, Guest, Crundall, Young, Mackenzie\), and a French company \(IMRA\), to develop hazard tests for autonomous vehicle algorithms \(£66k, Crundall\). The findings from these projects have refined NTU protocols for hazard assessment and training. 

 PhD research \(Ventsislavova, Crundall\), supported by small grants from Santander and the Anglo\-Israeli Association \(£4k\), has confirmed the appropriateness of the hazard prediction approach for international audiences \[ **R3**\] while also further refining the methodology \[ **R4**\]. 

 The most recent grant \(RST/RAC Foundation/DVSA; 2018\-2021; £135k; Crundall, Ventsislavova, Sumich **,** Heym\) has allowed NTU to develop 360\-degree hazard tests for virtual reality \(VR\) headsets. In comparisons with traditional tests, VR is more effective for assessment and training purposes. The project also led to the launch of ‘Hazard Perception VR’ in the Oculus Store \(Nov., 2020\), and the subsequent incorporation of a University spinout company \(Esitu Solutions Ltd.\) with £166k funding from Innovate UK \(March, 2020\) and £100k investment from NTU.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Road traffic collisions are the 8th leading cause of global death and are predicted to rise to the 5th leading cause by 2030. Though Great Britain is considered one of the safest countries for driving, there were still 1,752 fatalities in 2018\-19 and nearly 26,000 serious injuries. Two driver groups are of particular concern: young drivers who are over\-represented in collisions \(3x more likely to have a crash than older drivers\), and commercial drivers \(involved in approximately 30% of fatal collisions\). These data contextualise the need for better training and assessment of hazard avoidance skills, acknowledged to be a leading cause of such collisions. 

 NTU’s impact has been to change the paradigms and resources used to train and assess the hazard avoidance skills of various categories of road user, developing and promulgating evidence\-based techniques with the aim of a longer\-term impact on collision statistics. 

 In regard to impact on learner driver hazard assessment and training, TSO \(formally The Stationary Office\) asked Crundall to contribute to the Learner Driver DVD \[ **S1**; see Section 5\], which is sold nationwide as a resource for drivers preparing to take their test.  Based on their work in hazard perception, Crundall and Groeger were then funded by the Department for Transport to develop a novel abs innovative hazard perception test \[ **S2**, **R5**\].The report recommended \(1\) longer and more complex hazard clips; and \(2\) combining theory knowledge and hazard awareness in a single test, \(3\) introducing hazard prediction clips into a future test.  Based on these results \[and **R2\-6**\], Crundall was called to advise the DVSA \(UK\), and their counterparts in Ireland \(The Road Safety Authority\) and the Netherlands \(the Centraal Bureau Rijvaardigheidsbewijzen\).  The RSA is pushing forwards with a hazard test, based primarily on Crundall’s data \[ **S3**, **R2\-6**\]. The CBR were already planning a national hazard perception test, but they have changed this to a hazard prediction test based on evidence presented by Crundall \[ **S4**, **R2\-5**\]. Meanwhile, in the UK, the importance of our research to UK national test development is acknowledged in the Government’s 2019 Road Safety Statement \[ **S5**, section 2.32\]. Most recently, externally\-funded research has allowed the release of an Oculus app designed for learner drivers entitled ‘Hazard Perception VR’. Launched in November 2020 it has been well received by users and has received media coverage from road safety outlets \[ **S6**\]. 

 The second target impact group was professional drivers. Crundall and Brunsden were funded to develop a hazard perception test for fire\-appliance drivers by the Fire Service Research and Training Trust, leading to three publications \(R2/R6/Kroll and Crundall, 2019\).  The award\-winning resources \(FIRE Magazine 2017\) are now being used by Nottingham Fire and Rescue Service \(NFRS\) to train new and existing fire drivers \[ **S7**\] and have been made available nationally via  [testmydriving.com](file:///C:/Users/PSY3WOODCP/Downloads/www.testmydriving.com). A recent NFRS update includes positive feedback from their trainers including, “The “What happens next” section is good for drivers at all stages in their development and encourages them to re\-examine their perceptions of everyday driving hazards” \[ **S7**\]. On the strength of the products produced by these research projects, East Midlands Ambulance Service have recently asked us to create a series of bespoke tests to support their ambulance drivers. 

 In the field of commercial van drivers, Human Focus International has licensed our driver hazard perception tests for use with van driver fleets. They have spent 12 months developing the software platform to deliver the test \(based completely on NTU assets\), with an October 2020 launch. Though the pandemic has delayed roll\-out of this tool to commercial clients, Human Focus have recently attracted their first major client for this tool \(a large aggregates company with over 3000 vehicles\). They report that “ *the research work that you and your team have undertaken to validate this hazard prediction test format, and the provision of your video clips, has enabled us to develop an evidence\-based test for our clients which has been a game changer – both for our company and the market more generally*” \[ **S8**\]. 

 Finally, Crundall was asked to help develop a VR hazard prediction training tool for 25,000 London bus drivers on behalf of Transport for London. Working with STEPS Drama \(a London\-based training company\), Crundall designed the VR assessment and training package, building on NTU published outputs \[ **R1\-6**\] and new insights from recently funded VR research \(see Section 2\). Entitled Destination Zero, the training package was commissioned as part of the Mayor of London’s drive towards ‘Vision zero’ with the aim of zero bus\-related fatalities by 2030. Though the pandemic paused training \(with only 7000 out of 25,000 drivers trained so far\), the feedback from trainers and trainees was very positive \[ **S9**\]. The Operator Staff Development Manager at TfL noted *,* 

 “*The work of Professor Crundall and colleagues has been instrumental in guiding the development of our training…*” and, 

 “*The course has proved very impactful for drivers and trainers and we hope it will contribute to a reduction in accidents and injuries.*” 

 Despite a COVID\-related delay in an independent assessment of training effectiveness \(by TRL\), TfL are engaged in continuous evaluation to identify training benefit \[ **S10**\]. 

 The success of the impact to date resulted in the creation of a spinout company in July 2020, funded by £166k from Innovate UK \(won in March 2020 through their ICURE competition\) and a further £100k investment from NTU. With one full\-time employee and two part\-time employees, the company aims to commercialise the research assets and knowhow developed by the group \[ **S11**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The resilience of buildings to fire and blast is an important engineering objective, particularly for buildings in high profile locations and for national infrastructure. Imperial research in this area has led to new engineering methods for protection against these threats. The methodologies have been used in dozens of iconic projects and are now codified in UK and international standards by ISO, CPNI and BS. The engineering firm Arup, who co\-sponsored most of this research, were first to apply the new methodologies, later followed by other firms. Some examples of buildings where Imperial’s fire and blast research has been used since 2014 are the Qatar 2022 World Cup Venues, the refurbishment of Battersea Power Station, One and Two New Ludgate, and 52 Lime Street. Impact on outreach includes explaining Fire Science at five exhibitions/festivals attended by over 100,000 visitors, over 20 media engagements on TV, on radio or in popular press, explaining and promoting the relevance of science to millions of viewers, listeners and readers.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The resilience of a building refers to its capacity to recover quickly from extreme loads and spring back into operation. Resilience to fire and blast is an important engineering objective, particularly for large structures in high profile locations like iconic high\-rise buildings, and national infrastructure like government buildings. By regulation, engineers must design their structures to sustain fire and blast loads as well as loads due to gravity, wind and earthquake. 

 Two groups at Imperial’s Department of Mechanical Engineering work on building resilience: **Professor Rein** on fire engineering, and **Professor Dear** on blast protection.  Both groups have much in common and their work relies on combining high\-fidelity computational models with real\-scale experiments to produce design methodologies along with validated tools that then have been used in real buildings and codified in international standard. 

 Professor Rein’s group studied the structural fire engineering of buildings and advanced the design methodology of travelling fires, a name that he coined. Until this work, worldwide 

structural design for fire was based solely on the untested assumption that the worst case for structural collapse is a flashover fire. Flashover is where the whole of the room is burning. However, this contradicted careful observations of how fires moved inside the World Trade Centre towers in September 11, 2001. Later on, experiments conducted by Prof Rein showed that in large, enclosed spaces like open plan offices, flashover does not happen. Instead fires travel across the space, producing additional stresses and deformations in columns and beams that can lead to collapse \[Figure 1\]. Prof Rein’s team advanced the design methodology and showed that travelling fires can produce more onerous thermal conditions for the structure than traditional design fires \[1\] and \[2\]. Paper \[1\] puts forward an analytical formulation of travelling fires for design. Paper \[2\] provides a computational framework of design based on high\-fidelity transient simulations, the results of which show that travelling fires trigger previously overlooked structural mechanisms. Paper \[3\] validates and benchmarks the thermomechanical model at the core of the computational framework. 

 
As large, glazed frontages become increasingly popular, concern regarding the danger posed by large panels shattering in terrorist or other blasts \(for example 99 Bishopsgate in 1993 \[ *Figure 2*\]; South Quay Plaza Docklands in 1996\). This is likely to be largest cause of death and injury. Arup has therefore supported Professor Dear’s group working on blast mitigation for laminated glass facades. Imperial research has shown that the key factors that dominate blast resistant design are good retention of the laminated glass within the frame, avoidance of tearing of the polymer interlayer and transfer of loads from the frame to the building structure. 

 Prof. Dear’s group was the first to validate the models developed by Arup, in full scale blast trials \(up to 500kg of C\-4 explosive\), using the novel and key experimental methodology of full field deformation profiling of the glass façade, with a combination of 3D speckle and high\-speed photography, combined with strain gauging on the support frame \(example papers below: \[4\-6\]\). Dear’s experiments provided independent validation of the displacements from the Arup predictions for full scale explosive charges.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Arup is the first to take up Imperial’s work on travelling fires and apply it to the engineering design of multiple high\-rise buildings. Their engineers use a performance\-based design approach that combines the new travelling fires methodology with traditional fire design. Their computational simulations demonstrated to the authorities that travelling fires were more onerous to the structure and so often defined the worst case scenario \[Source A\]. 

 
The knowledge transfer accelerated when competitors like BuroHappold, Trenton Fire and OFR Consultants were asked by the approving authorities to consider travelling fires in their designs \[sources B\]. Travelling fires have now been applied in the design of more than 42 iconic buildings in London, Birmingham, and Manchester, including One and Two New Ludgate \(City of London building of the year, 2016\), 52 Lime Street \(the Scalpel\), S2 King’s Cross, 4 Pancras Square, Kings House, Nova Victoria, UCL Bartlett, and the refurbishment of Battersea Power Station. \[source B\]. Other buildings in Canada and the Middle East are under design as well \[source A\].  The success of our research in the application of travelling fire methodology to the structural designs of buildings is clearly demonstrated in Arup and Imperial winning the “ **Collaborate to Innovate Award**” in the Built Environment category in 2017 for the structural design of the Scalpel, 52 Lime Street \[ *Figure 3*\] \[Source C\]. 

 The research \(specifically that contained in paper \[1\]\) is now being codified in the following standards to be applied worldwide: revised BSI PD7974\-1 \[source D\], revised BSI PD7974\-3 \[source E\], and ISO WD 16733\-2:2018\(E\) \[source F\]. Also, Travelling Fires Methodology is in advanced panel discussions for adoption in Eurocode EC 1\-1\-2, and in the Society of Fire Protection Engineering ‘Standard on Calculating Fire Exposures to Structures’ \(international\). 

 The blast resilient design research has been key in validating Home Office and related International guidelines for designing glass façades for high profile landmark buildings, around the world, to resist blast and other threats \[source G\]. The Imperial research has validated design parameters, e.g. 30 mm adhesive bite depth, providing retention of laminated glass in these Home Office CPNI guidelines \[source H\]. 

 
The findings and the CPNI guidelines have been adopted and are now employed in Arup’s design procedures for façades and applied to iconic building 52 Lime Street The Scalpel \(see *Figure 3*\), 100 Bishopsgate, City of London \(see *Figure 4*\); Canary Wharf Crossrail, London; Qatar 2022 World Cup Venues \( *Figure 4\)*; Victoria Circle, London and 22 Bishopsgate, London. 

 
The techniques of speckle strain mapping \(paper \[4\]\) have now been adopted by industry as well as other academics for evaluating full\-scale composites structures subject to explosive blast loading. Prof. Dear’s group, at Imperial College has been invaluable in providing detailed experimental results on the behaviour of composite structures subject to full\-scale explosive blast loading. The data obtained through this research has proven important in designing specialized composite structures for marine applications e.g. composite radar masts, lightweight superstructure with radar absorbent material, bow sonar domes for submarines \[ *Figure 5*\] and composite structures around the submarine’s sail \(fin/tower on dorsal surface\). This work has been used by ONR, General Dynamics Electric Boat, Northrop Grumman and Naval Undersea Warfare Centre, Division Newport \[Source I\]. 

 Finally Prof Rein’s research provided impact through outreach to the general public through exhibitions and media engagements.  He and his team organised the “Fire Science” booth at Imperial Festivals in 2017 and 2018 \(20,000 visitors each\), the Great Exhibition Road Festival in 2019 \(60,000 visitors\), and took part in New Scientist Live London 2018 and 2019 \(40,000 visitors\). His work has also featured prominently in a wide range of media \(including BBC Two Newsnight \(2017\), Channel 5 \(2017\), Channel 4 \(2017\), Sky News \(2015\), The Economist \(2019\), New York Times \(2019 x2\), Evening Standard \(2017\), New York Times \(2017\), Scientific American \(2016\), Daily Mail \(2015\), Financial Times \(2014\), Daily Telegraph \(2014\), Daily Mail \(2014\), Wired \(2013\), Engineering\-News Record \(2013\), BBC 4 Inside Science \(2019\), BBC Wales \(2019\), BBC Wales \(2016\), BBC World Service Click \(2016\), BBC 4 Inside Science \(2014\), BBC 4 Material World \(2013\)\) \[Source J\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Sander van der Linden’s leading research at the University of Cambridge has produced novel psychological interventions on how to inoculate the public against the spread of fake news and misinformation. In collaboration with industry and government partners, his team developed the interactive online social impact game “ *Bad News*”, which has been translated into over 15 different languages and reached over one million people worldwide. His research has led to a shift in national and international policy implementation from traditional ‘debunking’ to the new approach of *prebunking*. His research\-based approach to combatting misinformation has been has been recognised as an innovative way forward by the European Commission, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the UK Parliamentary Investigation on Fake News, and the US State Department, and has contributed to public discourse on the issue of fake news. This has led to the subsequent development and release of government\-backed anti\-misinformation interventions such as *GoViral\!* \(targeting misinformation during the Covid\-19 pandemic, and disseminated in English, French and German\), *Radicalise* \(countering radicalisation in Jordan\) and *Harmony Square* \(countering US election misinformation\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **A societal problem: fake news and the spread of misinformation** 

 The growing spread of misinformation and “digital wildfires” is considered one of the most important global threats \(‘Digital Wildfires’, World Economic Forum, 2018\). About 83% of Europeans now think fake news is threatening democracy \(‘Eurobarometer’ survey, European Commission, 2018\) and in some countries the viral spread of misinformation has led to injury and even death \( *How WhatsApp helped turn an Indian village into a lynch mob*, BBC News, 18 Jul 2018\). Dr van der Linden at the University of Cambridge Social Decision\-Making Lab has conducted research to understand and address this problem at a psychological level. 

 **The vaccine metaphor: psychological inoculation** 

 Drawing from ‘inoculation theory’, Dr van der Linden’s research group hypothesized that it may be possible to shield public opinion from the spread of false information. Just as administering a severely weakened strain of a virus triggers antibodies in the immune system \(to help confer resistance against future infection\), exposing the public to a severely weakened version of a falsehood and pre\-emptively forewarning and debunking that falsehood with scientific facts \(the ‘vaccine’\), can help cultivate cognitive resistance \(‘mental antibodies’\) against fake news over time \[1,3\]. In 2014, a study of 2,167 participants \(compared across six experimental conditions\) \[2,3\] showed that independent of political affiliation, those who are pre\-emptively warned and exposed to a weakened dose of misinformation are subsequently more resistant, and less likely, to be duped by the full ‘fake news’ dose later on in the experiment compared to both ‘false balance’ \(scientific facts followed by the fake news\) and pure control groups. Overall, the inoculation preserved up to two\-thirds of the positive effect of the factual message \[2\]. 

 **Bad News**: an online interactive impact game embedded in the social media experience** 

 In order to scale the vaccine into a real\-world intervention, Dr van der Linden then explored more experiential ways of engaging audiences to learn about common online misinformation techniques that underlie the production of most fake news. Through a novel external partnership with the Dutch media collective DROG, they created the fake news game, *Bad News \(* [*www.getbadnews.com*](https://www.getbadnews.com/)\). Launched in 2018, in the online version of the game, players assume the role of a fake news producer and advance through six levels, each of which showcases weakened doses of six common misinformation techniques \(polarization, use of emotion, conspiracy theories/echo chambers, deflection, online trolling and impersonation\) that players are exposed to in a simulated social media environment. 

 In a randomised pilot study conducted with 95 high\-school students in the Netherlands, initial evidence was found that *Bad News* helped inoculate students against fictional misinformation about immigration \[3\]. Through subsequently analysing 15,000 responses from participants exposed to a battery of fake and real news items before and after playing the online version of the game, consistent evidence was found that people: a\) improved in their ability to detect fake news after playing; b\) became more confident in their judgments about what is real and fake and; c\) did not downgrade real news headlines \[4,5,6,7\]. 

 The intervention \(a single\-play of the game\) boosted immunity by about 20% compared to the pre\-game average. The Bad News intervention continues to show significant and direct positive effects for players in the form of attitudinal protection against fake news, lasting up to two months with regular booster shots \[3\]. 

 **Later iterations of the vaccine tool** 

 Since its initial launch, Dr van der Linden has adapted the key principles of *Bad News* to create new games to inoculate against fake news in specific forms and environments. These include: *Join This Group*, a game developed with WhatsApp to inoculate against misinformation frequently encountered within the context of direct messaging apps which was created in 2018 \[7\]; *Radicalize*, an anti\-radicalisation game which was launched in 2019 \[7\]; *Harmony Square \(* [*harmonysquare.game*](https://harmonysquare.game/books/default/) *\)*, a game to guard against political misinformation during elections, which was launched in 2020 \[8\]; and *Go Viral\!\(*  [*www.goviralgame.com*](https://www.goviralgame.com/en) *\)*, a game developed in collaboration with the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) and the UK Government to protect against COVID\-19 conspiracies during the 2020 ‘infodemic’ \(WHO\). Results have shown that these games confer immunity upon players, who self\-reported increased distrust of misinformation, greater confidence in their own judgements and fewer instances of self\-reported sharing of misinformation \[7,8\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The online dissemination of misinformation and fake news is a global problem with profound implications for society, affecting public trust in institutions that govern health, democracy and security. Rather than attempting to control the spread of fake news, Dr van der Linden’s research at the University of Cambridge has shown that it is possible to increase awareness of the manipulation tactics used by fake news actors, a technique that has been recognised and adopted by governments and organisations in the UK, Europe, USA, Lebanon and Jordan. 

 **Global reach and reception of **Bad News** 

 *Bad News* proved a timely intervention which has contributed to global discourse around misinformation and fake news. The game was covered by over 300 media outlets across the globe, including high\-profile television and radio \(e.g. BBC and CNN\) and web and print media \(e.g. The Financial Times, The Guardian, The New York Times\) \[A\]. Dr van der Linden actively shared his expertise via global popular media \(e.g. *National Public Radio \(NPR\)* in the USA, *Quirks and Quarks* in Canada, and Ed Miliband’s *Reasons to be Cheerful* in the UK\) \[A\]. Thanks to active media engagement, the *Bad News* game received about 20,000 players a day during its initial launch event between 19\-23 February 2018 and 163,000 unique players during a second launch between 26\-30 June 2019 \[A\]. The BBC interviewed the Social Decision\-Making lab and documented the journey of transitioning from a theoretical idea to a translational tool in a major investigative article for BBC Future, *“Could this be the cure for fake news?”<sup>*</sup> \[B\]. 

 The game was awarded the *Frank* Prize for research in the Public Interest from the University of Florida in 2020. The game was also nominated for the Beazley Design of the Year Awards \(2018\) and featured as part of the four\-month exhibit in the London Design Museum, which gathers an average of 50,000 visitors per month \[C\]. 

 **Impact on public understanding and behaviour** 

 Based on his research findings, Dr van der Linden estimated that a single play boosts people’s ability to spot fake news by about 20% \[5\]. As of December 2020, approximately one million people worldwide have played *Bad News* online \[A\] and at least 1,000 students in classroom settings through workshops with DROG \[A\]. 

 A novel partnership with WhatsApp Inc. led to the development of a special version of the game using the WhatsApp platform called *Join this Group”* in 2018 \[7\].The WhatsApp Lead Research Team has described “ *The consequences of misinformation are real and we know this is a long\-term challenge that requires action from civil society, government, and technology companies* \[…\] *The independent research conducted by*  [*The Cambridge Social Decision\-Making Lab*](http://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/) *, University of Cambridge, will make a meaningful contribution to how we build WhatsApp for the years to come”* \[D\]. 

 **International impact through a new strategy to tackle radicalisation** 

 Created in development with Nudge Lebanon, a non\-governmental organisation working to apply behavioural insights to policy challenges in the Middle East, *Radicalize* has offered innovative ways to target radicalisation. Secretary General Office Director of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy in Qatar commented: *“This new, innovative approach represents a powerful tool to address very important issues such as radicalisation and behavioural biases in a rigorous way, by providing evidence of what works, and, therefore, strengthening the evidence base of Preventing Violent Extremism \(PVE\) programmes”* \[E\]. UNESCO, and the Jordanian government piloted an offline version of *Radicalize* with 1,000 students in summer camps throughout Jordan in summer of 2019. Receiving positive feedback, UNESCO commissioned a second module \[F\]. 

###  Impact on national and international policy\-making 

 Dr van der Linden and colleagues have been instrumental in shaping policy discussions around fake news both nationally and internationally. The research group were invited to submit written evidence to the UK House of Commons’ Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\) Committee’s Parliamentary Inquiry on Fake News in 2018 \[G\], and consult with DCMS staff in person on the results of the research. Their testimony was deemed *“incredibly useful for the inquiry”* by a Senior Committee Specialist in the House of Commons, and cited in the Select Committee’s final report on disinformation and fake news \[G\]. The research was cited as a solution to the misinformation problem in an official policy document from the UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \( *Online Information and Fake News*\) \[G\], and as a basis for evidencing the risk of disinformation in reports from the European Commission’s Directorate\-General for Education and Culture \[H\]. 

 In 2018, a collaboration was fostered with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\). As a testament to the importance of the research, the FCO has translated *‘Bad News’* into more than 15 languages, and commissioned a new version of the game suitable for junior audiences “ *Bad News Junior*“. A Senior Advisor at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated in April 2019: *“The adult version of the UK Vaccine App* \[Bad News\] *has now had 400,000 ‘hits’ and it is now being rolled out across the UK to young adults while the overseas variants are being distributed through a range of locally run media literacy NGOs in the* countries \[Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Poland, Romania, Czechia, Slovenia, Bosnia\-Hercegovina, Serbia, Sweden, Ukraine\] *for which translations have been provided. From an FCO point of view a further benefit of this project was the robust measurements of the number of ‘hits’ and their geographical locations* \[which was being undertaken by Cambridge’s academic team\]. *This it is hoped will support further work in the media literacy area”* \[I\]. 

 The team were also invited to consult with the Office of the Vice\-President of the European Commission, Andrus Ansip, on the problem of disinformation and how to tackle it. The EU report \(H\) that followed from this investigation recognized the term “prebunking” and psychological inoculation as a new approach and quoted the research as “ *the most sustainable path to information robustness and combating the spread of misinformation and fake news”* \[H\]. This was put into practice with Jon Roozenbeek and Bad News providing an inoculation training event in 2019 with 22 mayors of the European Union Committee of Regions \(COR\) as part of their COR Action Plan against disinformation. Members included mayors of municipalities across Europe \[H\]. 

 **Impact on global politics** 

 Dr van der Linden’s research has been recognised in the United States and was cited in a report from the US Department of State \[J\] on how to effectively tackle fake news and misinformation. The report concludes that “ *preemptively warning about and* *debunking disinformation themes are all potential approaches for reducing vulnerabilities to disinformation*”. Following this report, Dr van der Linden were invited to collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \(DHS\-CISA\), to help secure the integrity of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. The election game “Harmony Square” was released nationwide by the US government on 6<sup>th</sup> November 2020. By December it had been played 55,000 times. From the DHS\-CISA: “ *We believe this game has broad applicability with our stakeholders and presents an effective tool in a whole\-of*\- *society approach to countering information manipulation… DHS\-CISA is very satisfied with the game’s initial impact and anticipates further application.”*\[J\]. 

 **Impact on COVID\-19 conspiracies** 

 In 2020, as part of a campaign to encourage Covid vaccine take\-up and counter the anticipated spread of misinformation around vaccine rollout, the UK cabinet office commissioned van der Linden and colleagues to develop an anti\-fake news tool focused on countering vaccine myths. Launched in October 2020, it was promoted on Twitter by government bodies including Public Health England, the Department of Health and Social Care, DCMS, and the United Nations \(as part of their ‘Verified’ campaign \[K\]. The game also forms part of the World Health Organisation “Stop the Spread” campaign \(in collaboration with the UK government\) which aims to raise awareness globally the risks of misinformation around COVID\-19, and encourages people to double check information with trusted sources such as WHO and national health authorities \[K\]. From the UK Cabinet Office, *“… the support and research provided by your team has enabled the UK to combat trends that could undermine adherence to official guidance about Covid\-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. Your contributions have been invaluable to evidence communication policy and have formed an important part of our international response. Without the expertise of you and your team there would be fewer people able to access important and potentially life\-saving advice about how to protect themselves from harmful misinformation”.* By December 2020, the game had been played by 282,893 people, and been translated into French and German \[K\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Led by Dr Carpenter, the **Nuclear Culture Research Project** has influenced the discourse of nuclear art and culture within the arts and nuclear sectors, highlighting the tangible artefacts, infrastructures and lived experiences of radioactive materials and contamination. 

 Radioactive waste is one of the most urgent issues within contemporary art and society, as anthropogenic radioisotopes will be harmful to humans for millions of years, heightening our present responsibility for the future. By commissioning new artwork, curating exhibitions and hosting roundtable discussions in partnership with nuclear contexts across Europe including the Nuclear Energy Agency and the European Union \(EU\) Dr Carpenter has informed the strategy of the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency \(NEA\) Records, Preservation of Knowledge & Memory Across Generations \(RK&M Initiative\) and fostered new spaces for trust\-building and dialogue about radioactive waste management; which in turn has improved understanding, and challenged mis\-conceptions about the relationship between art and nuclear science. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Nuclear Culture research project began in 2011 when the Submarine Dismantling Project Advisory Group to the Ministry of Defence invited Dr Carpenter to commission contemporary art in response to the dismantling of British nuclear submarines. The research for these commissions led to an exhibition and roundtable at KARST Gallery in Plymouth, near to the laid\-up nuclear powered submarines at Devonport **\(R1\)**. This led to a wider research engagement with the contemporary lived experience of the nuclear economy, including mining, energy, accidents and waste management and the establishment of the Nuclear Culture Project. Working in partnership with arts’ agencies, museums, and nuclear organisations, the Nuclear Culture Project brings together visual artists and those working in the nuclear humanities with specific nuclear sites and professionals in the nuclear industry through exhibitions, roundtable events, collaborative research and conferences **\(R2\)**. 

 To identify key nuclear cultural concepts in contemporary art, moving beyond cold war politics, Carpenter edited *The Nuclear Culture Source Book* \( **R3\).** The book includes 12 key essays and over 60 artworks, charting the ways in which art and philosophy contribute to a cultural understanding of the nuclear. In doing so the book brings together contemporary art and ideas investigating the nuclear Anthropocene, nuclear sites and materiality, along with important questions of radiological inheritance, nuclear modernity and the philosophical concept of radiation as a ‘hyperobject’. 

 Large group exhibitions, curated by Dr Carpeneter, operate as research to investigate specific nuclear contexts. For example, the major international exhibition ‘Perpetual Uncertainty’ commissioned by Bildmuseet, Umeå University, Sweden provided the opportunity for artist Susan Schuppli to film ‘Trace Evidence’ near Forsmark, the first nuclear power station to identify fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster **\(R4\)**. Carpenter invited the Director of MKG, Sweden’s NGO advising on geologic storage of spent fuel, to give a keynote lecture at the Nuclear Culture Roundtable at Bildmuseet. The exhibition toured to Z33 House of Contemporary Art, in Hasselt \(2017\) just a few miles from the Belgian nuclear waste sites and the SCK\-CEN nuclear research centre, and to Belgium where it operated as a hub for engaging local nuclear stakeholder groups and invited them to present their work at the roundtable. The exhibition then toured to the Malmö Konstmuseum \(2018\) where Sofie Tunbrant from the Swedish nuclear waste agency SKB gave a presentation at the roundtable and participated in a performance by Hector Dyer about deep geologic storage and memory. This is just a small example of cross\-sector engagement facilitated through the roundtable **s.** 

 Many of the 22 artworks in the *Perpetual Uncertainty* exhibition were developed through interdisciplinary field research to nuclear sites around the world. For example, visiting the Horonobe Underground Research Centre for radioactive waste burial in Japan \(in partnership with S\-Air\), and the Low Level Waste Ltd site at Drigg in Cumbria, led to Alison Craighead and Jon Thomson’s ‘Temporary Index’ artwork, which involves a series of counters for different waste sites. A new counter has recently been commissioned by the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority \(NDA\) for their Nucleus Archive at Wick, Scotland. 

 In 2020 Carpenter co\-curated Splitting the Atom at CAC/SMK Centre for Contemporary Art and the Energy & Technology Museum in Vilnius, Lithuania. The exhibition was organised in partnership with the AHRC networking project ‘Nuclear Cultural Heritage: From Knowledge to Practice’ led by Dr Eglė Rindzevičiūtė, University of Kingston **\(R6\).**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *“The Nuclear Culture research project \[…\] makes connections between actors and functions that otherwise rarely meet \[…\] This is slowly enabling the nuclear research community to envisage the wider role visual artists can play in long term radioactive waste management, for instance related to marking nuclear sites but also to more fundamental thinking about ‘deep time’, \(in\)visibility, uncertainty, the Anthropocene. It has also allowed artists access to nuclear institutes, research and actors which may otherwise seem inaccessible, and to test the preconceptions one may have of such spaces, research and actors”* 

 Jantine Schröder of the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, SCK CEN, Mol, Belgium, 2018 **\(S1\)**. 

 **1.Contribution to strategy development informs intergovernmental process of commemoration of nuclear sites:** 

 The Nuclear Energy Agency \(NEA\) is an intergovernmental agency that facilitates co\-operation among countries with advanced nuclear technology infrastructures. It operates within the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) *,* an intergovernmental organisation of industrialised countries, based in Paris, France. The Records Knowledge and Memory \(RK&M\) Group is an NEA research unit that investigates how to preserve ‘Records, Knowledge and Memory’ of high\-level radioactive waste for future generations: 

 In terms of public policy, the RK&M, Modern2020 and the Nuclear Culture project each address Article 24 of the European Union Euratom Directive 2011 which states that: 

 “It should be an ethical obligation of each Member State to avoid any undue burden on future generations in respect of spent fuel and radioactive waste including any radioactive waste expected from decommissioning  of existing nuclear installations. Through the implementation of this Directive Member States will have demonstrated that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that that objective is met.” 

 Dr Carpenter first got to know members of the RK&M committee when she was invited to present a poster at their conference in Verdun in 2014, alongside artworks by artist Professor Robert Williams, to 168 global experts and nuclear agencies from 17 countries. Forwarding her report on the conference to the RK&M committee and publishing it on her website **\(R5\)**, Dr Carpenter argued that although the conference consolidated the role of culture within the nuclear waste management discourse, there was little understanding of contemporary art and curatorial practices in the presentation and contextualisation of the artworks at the conference. 

 The report was well received by Andra \(L'Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs / English translation: The French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency\) and Dr Carpenter was subsequently invited to participate in the OECD/NEA Radioactive Waste Management Committee RK&M Initiative’s 13th Meeting at Nucleus in Wick, Scotland, 13\-15 June 2017 to advise on the role of art in RK&M. Testament to 5 years of partnership building and working closely with members of the RK&M group from Belgium, Sweden, France and the UK, many of whom had participated in the Nuclear Culture Roundtable discussions \(e.g., Sofie Tunbrant, SKB in Sweden; Jean\-Noel Dumont, Andra, France\), Dr Carpenter was the only contemporary art curator invited to participate in the meeting. Schröder confirms the impact of her presentation on the groups in terms of helping 

 “to establish a critical space for rethinking how artists can engage with the nuclear sector in Europe and how the nuclear sector can engage with artists” and helping “the group to understand how art can contribute to widening the discourse and potential of preserving RK&M of radioactive waste disposal projects across generations” **\(S1\)**. 

 Dr Carpenter also contributed to the RK&M’s editorial meeting at Wick, enabling her to review the 'Art' element of the 'Arts, Culture and Education' strategy that informs the RK&M Key Information File, a strategy document that advises government institutions and their Radioactive Waste Management agencies on how to embed knowledge of radioactive storage sites within society for millions of years. The *Final Report of the RK&M Initiative \(*2020\), directly addresses the role of culture in the process of commemoration; 

 “Art with the dedicated goal of RK&M preservation should be specifically commissioned in partnership with art museums and agencies” and gives examples of artworks, from the landscape of thorns proposed for the WIPP in New Mexico, USA; ANDRA’s art programme; and the Nuclear Culture Project including works by Thomson & Craighead and Cecile Massart, from the Nuclear Culture Research Group” **\(S2\)**. 

 **2. Enabling collaboration and discussion between artists, curators, nuclear scientists, professionals from the nuclear industry, sociologists and activists.** 

 As stated by Schröder, Dr Carpenter’s contribution to debates about nuclear culture highlights *“*the way in which artists can create artworks which are distributed across public sites, museum collections, archives and online platforms to increase and preserve awareness, knowledge and memory about disposal projects” **\(S1\)**. 

 The Nuclear Culture Research Project’s artistic outcomes have influenced the nuclear sector through the Nuclear Culture Roundtable discussions convened within each exhibition. These regular cross\-disciplinary dialogues have brought together researchers, sociologists, philosophers, scientists and engineers working in the nuclear industry with artists, curators, activists and NGOs \(for instance, Arts Catalyst, London, UK, 2013, 2014; S\-Air, Sapporo Japan, 2014; KARST, Plymouth, 2016; Bildmuseet, Umeå , Sweden 2016; DCA, Dundee, 2017; Z33, Belgium, 2017; Malmö Konstmuseum, 2018\) **\(S3\)**. 

 The partnerships that Dr Carpenter’s research facilitate investigate questions of nuclear technology, radiation and the transmission of knowledge over deep time futures. Writing about the exhibition *Perpetual Uncertainty* **\(R2\)**, Cecilia Widenheim, Director of Malmo Konstmuseum, Sweden describes how the Nuclear Culture Project has enabled a dialogue to take place between different professional fields: 

 “The project has allowed us to develop several interdisciplinary collaborations. For the first time we have worked with nuclear researchers and the nuclear power industry in Sweden. The museum ran guided tours for groups from the Medical Radiation Physics Department at Lund University, and the Design Department at Linnaeus University, as well as public and schools groups. In turn a group of Museum staff were invited to visit the Barseback nuclear power plant in the region” **\(S4\)**. 

 Ongoing conversations at the Roundtables and across disciplinary fields has enabled people from different disciplines to find a space to think differently, to take care over language, to share knowledge, to understand how misunderstandings about nuclear knowledge occur, and to imagine the role of visual information in the nuclear industry. For example, the seventh  [Nuclear Culture Roundtable](http://z33research.be/2018/02/undergroundoverground-roundtable-on-art-and-radioactive-waste-storage-in-belgium/) on the *Underground/Overground* \(17 November, 2017 at Z33, Belgium\) brought together fifty people from across the arts, nuclear industry, scientific nuclear research and the humanities to discuss how society conceptualises hiding waste underground in relation to daily life on the earth’s surface. Taking place on alongside the Belgian edition of the  [*Perpetual Uncertainty*](http://z33research.be/2017/10/exhibition-perpetual-uncertainty/) exhibition and working closely with NIRAS/ONDRAF Belgian National Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Material, the event focused on art and radioactive waste storage in Belgium, including the problems of: geological storage, the difficulty of communicating or marking contaminated sites for future generations, and the question of designing infrastructures for a deep time future **\(S5\)**. 

 The issues of nuclear culture and art have been discussed by several hundred nuclear industry experts attending Dr Carpenter’s lectures at conferences such as: the Radiation Protection Society Annual Conference, Scarborough 2019 **\(S6\)**; and the Modern2020 conference on Nuclear Culture & Citizen Participation, Paris 2019, where Carpenter gave a conference presentation, a research poster, and chaired a roundtable discussion, in partnership with the University of Antwerp as part of the EU Horizon 2020 MODERN Research project **\(S7\)**. 

 Press coverage about the project, including BBC Radio 4’s programme on Radioactive Art has engaged wider publics in the debate **\(S8\)**. Meanwhile the exhibitions engage audiences in how nuclear technology has affected our perception of memory, knowledge and time through shifting nuclear aesthetics **\(S9\)**. Total audience numbers for all three *Perpetual Uncertainty* exhibitions for example were 95,995 persons, with 3,302 participating in public programmes.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Viral hepatitis is a major and growing contributor to global mortality \(\~1.5 million deaths in 2013\). Research at Imperial generated estimates of its global burden and devised strategies to reduce incidence of new cases and deaths. These underpin the WHO hepatitis B and C strategy, targets and monitoring framework for elimination; were used by Gavi to support the global introduction of hepatitis B birth\-dose vaccination; supported the inclusion of tenofovir\-based treatment in China’s national insurance programs leading to a reduction in cost to patients from CNY49.0 to CNY16.6 per day; and supported a WHO recommendation for general population screening of hepatitis B in low\-income settings. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2014 the World Health Assembly urged progress on combatting viral hepatitis. In response, Imperial researchers sought to understand the global burden of hepatitis \(1\), finding that mortality from viral hepatitis ranked seventh amongst all diseases globally. They also found that over the preceding twenty\-five years the number of deaths due to viral hepatitis had increased in contrast with the reductions in deaths attributed to other major infectious diseases. The key determinant of this trend was the lack of scale\-up of effective treatments, and population growth and ageing in countries with high burdens of Hepatitis C. 

 To understand how this challenge could be responded to, information about the global epidemics of Hepatitis B \(2\) and C \(3\) and possible interventions were synthesised to create model\-based projections for the impact of a package of interventions. This revealed five priority areas: \(i\) three\-dose hepatitis B vaccine for infants, \(ii\) the timely birth dose for the prevention of mother\-to\-child transmission of hepatitis B, \(iii\) blood and injection safety, \(iv\) harm reduction services for persons who inject drugs, and \(v\) diagnosis and treatment. The analyses indicated that with service coverage in each program area exceeding particular levels, substantial reductions in the incidence of new cases \(90% on 2010 levels\) and deaths \(65% on 2010 levels\) could be achieved by 2030. The team also estimated a ‘global price tag’ for this strategy and showed how these costs were dependent on drug prices and the cost of screening strategies for those at risk. In further work the impact of Gavi contributing to the funding of the birth dose scale\-up in selected countries was estimated. 

 The researchers worked with authorities in China to assess the cost and impact of incorporating the policy changes into the national program. This implied affording much greater access to tenofovir\-based treatment for those living with Chronic Hepatitis B. It was found that adopting the full package of interventions in China would incur a large upfront cost and that if cost for treatment were to fall on patients themselves it may be unaffordable \(4\). If instead those costs were absorbed in the health sector it was shown that within a decade, they would have been more than offset by the reduced costs associated with treating patients with end\-stage liver disease \(4\). It was concluded that from a societal perspective, there was a favourable long\-term ‘return\-on\-investment’ of adopting the proposed strategy for combating hepatitis, and that expanding treatment would require the cost of drugs to be covered by the national insurance program \(4\). 

 The Imperial\-led research showed that screening for infection was key to achieving the targets in the case of both Hepatitis B and C \(2, 3\). The PROLIFICA trial was established to test the feasibility of general population screening in West Africa \(5\) and found to be acceptable and feasible. The researchers examined the cost of implementing the program and likely benefits to patients and established that such an approach was also likely to be ‘cost\-effective’ in many low\-income settings \(6\).

 <ins>Burden and Global Strategies</ins> 

 Estimates of the burden of viral hepatitis \(1\) were used by WHO to make the case for their new advocacy strategy \[ **A**\]. Model\-based strategies for eliminating hepatitis as a public health threat and the associated programmatic and epidemiological targets were provided to WHO as an unpublished report \(reference 2 in document \[ **A**\]\) and subsequently published \(2, 3 above\). The resulting WHO strategy to achieve elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030 \[ **A**\] directly cites the outputs from this work \- specifically the targets and their associated estimated impact. The construction of the five pillars of the strategy \(“ *Reaching five prevention and treatment service coverage targets would eliminate hepatitis B and C as public health threats”,* page 6 *\)* directly refers to the modelling research. The economic analyses presented as part of the strategy \(\[ **A**\], Section F\) directly reproduces analyses undertaken by the researchers. The strategy was presented to the WHO Executive Board in 2015 and subsequently adopted by WHO as the Global Health Sector strategy on viral hepatitis 2016\-2021 \[ **B**\]. These programmatic areas and targets are the benchmarks by which WHO monitors progress of countries in respect of its aim to combat hepatitis, as confirmed in a WHO\-authored article \[ **C**\]. Today 87% of persons living with hepatitis reside in a country with a national plan for hepatitis \[ **D**\] that is based on, or draws reference from, the WHO health sector strategy \[ **B**\] that the Imperial research directly contributed to. The WHO authors of \[ **C**\] confirm that the targets have led to the initiation of action plans in many countries: “ *As a result, many countries have initiated work to formulate national action plans, starting with initial assessments*”.

 As one of three independent modelling teams, the Imperial researchers adapted their model developed in academic references \(2,3\) and worked with GAVI to provide projections of the impact of the timely birth dose to inform their hepatitis B birth dose vaccine investment case \[ **E**\]. In this it was shown that GAVI support for birth dose introduction could avert between 300,000 and 1,200,000 perinatal infection\-related deaths between 2021 and 2035 and that this would be highly cost\-effective \(USD72\-USD403 per death averted\). The GAVI investment strategy relied on five primary criteria when ranking proposed new vaccine introductions \- two of which \(health impact and value for money\) directly used the impact and cost\-effectiveness estimates that the Imperial team provided \[ **F**\]. Birth\-dose hepatitis B vaccine was recommended to the Gavi board for introduction from 2021 and adopted at its November 2018 meeting subject to successful replenishment that has now been confirmed.

 Imperial modelling of the need to invest in hepatitis B control in China formed one of the case studies in the WHO advocacy strategy \[ **A**, Box 4 page 10\]. This work was expanded to explore the impact and cost\-effectiveness of introducing tenofovir into the Chinese national insurance program. A preprint of this work \(subsequently published academic reference 4\) was shared with the WHO China office and formed part of a WHO \(China\) policy brief to government \[ **G**\]. This was the major piece of research motivating a policy change \[ **H**\] whereby tenofovir became included within the Chinese national insurance program \[ **I**\] leading to the reduction in cost of tenofovir for patients from ¥ 49.0 to ¥ 16.6 per day, or less \[ **I**\]. In a study of patients at selected hospitals, the proportion of patients being treated with first\-line recommended drugs increased from 41.9% \(2010\) to 92.8% \(2019\). 

 <ins>Population\-wide screening for HBV in West Africa</ins> 

 The Imperial\-led PROLIFICA trial is cited as a case study in the WHO advocacy strategy \[ **A**, Box 5 page 11\]. The evidence that this trial generated on the efficacy and cost\-effectiveness of population wide screening for HBV in West Africa is cited in the WHO Guidelines for screening of hepatitis B and C \[ **J**\]. The WHO is required to consider the cost and feasibility of a strategy it may recommend, and the research at Imperial was the only such information available for low\-income countries \[ **J**, pages 40 and 50\]. This research is also reproduced as supporting evidence on cost\-effectiveness in the Annex \[ **J**\]. As a consequence of the research, these guidelines gave, for the first time, a ‘conditional recommendation’ that testing should be made available to the general population in low\-income settings with high prevalence of hepatitis B.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex NLIP research resulted in the development of an online platform for secure real\-time civilian\-led reporting of human rights violations in conflict zones providing more accurate monitoring in areas inaccessible to traditional human rights monitoring missions. International human rights organisation, Minority Rights Group International \(MRG\) and the Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights, deployed the platform between 2017 and 2019 in Iraq, Iran, Syria, the Middle East and North Africa. In Iraq more than 3,700 cases of human rights violations were documented using the platform since 2017. The platform has enabled MRG to grow its activities and was essential for the establishment and operation of Ceasefire, furthering the practice of civilian\-based monitoring of violations. This secure and easy to use platform has empowered and enabled ordinary civilians to document violations, mitigating the risks associated with reporting of human rights abuses in conflict situations. The evidence of human rights violations obtained from the platform has enabled documentation of claims for reparations, to compensate the victims of human rights abuses \(cases documented on the platform can form the basis for reparations claims under the Iraqi national Law 20 reparations system, which has paid out over USD 355 million in compensation\) and for international oversight, generating reports which have been used by the United Nations \(UN\), ultimately improving human rights outcomes for civilians.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Essex Natural Language Information Processing \(NLIP\) researchers collaborated with MRG and the Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights \(Ceasefire hereafter\) from 2014 to design and implement a new platform to support civilian\-led monitoring of human rights violations \[G1\]. Their challenge was to develop a reporting platform which would enable civilian\-led reporting in inaccessible areas which would be secure, easy to use and be able to assess the accuracy of reports, supporting both English and Arabic languages. Developing a platform for this purpose was particularly challenging as Arabic is an under\-resourced language in NLP and requires a unique set of skills. The research of the NLIP team, on information extraction from social media, Arabic natural language processing and crowdsourcing addressed these challenges. 

 The Essex research provided insights into crowdsourcing which focused on determining a ""gold standard"" based on a large number of individual statements with varying degree of reliability e.g., \[R1\]. The reporting platform was a development of Ushadhidi, an open\-source crowdsourcing platform used to map reports of violence, but its security model was insufficient for Ceasefire's needs. The Essex researchers developed a new security model and user access control, providing additional structural support for collaborating organisations with additional structural and security modifications \[R2\]. Essex’s Arabic natural language processing toolkit \(AraNLP\) \[R3\] together with  methodology to identify named entities \(e.g., names of people and places\) which describes how names, places and dates can be extracted \[R4\], provides the basis of the Arabic text processing pipeline that automatically processes social media texts to identify potential human rights violations. AI\-powered approaches for classifying massive amounts of data into pre\-defined categories need enough reliable training data and machine learning algorithms of sufficiently high classification quality. This was addressed by Essex research on extracting and managing content from social media, using crowdsourcing techniques to label and evaluate the collected data and the framework for using crowdsourcing to create language resources for under\-resourced languages such as Arabic \[R5\] \[R6\]. The Essex language resource of Arabic texts representing different types of violence including human\-rights violations \[R7\] was the first such resource. This addressed the lack of previous work on detecting human rights violation in English and Arabic, the modest accuracy of existing methods and the paucity in robust and scalable resources to process Arabic natural language. One reason for this is the difficulty in applying methods developed for languages such as English to Arabic, a highly derivational and inflectional language that is characterised by a complex set of morphological features including gender, number, person, case, state, mood, and voice. In addition, Arabic has a set of clitics, which attach to the stem after affixes such as conjunctions, prepositions, future marks, definite articles, and pronouns. \[R2\] reports Essex’s insights into mining and classifying Arabic Twitter in order to identify potential human rights abuse incidents in a continuous stream of social media data within a specified geographical region. Essex’s analysis showed deep learning approaches such as Long Short\-Term Memory \(LSTM\) classification precision was 84% with an F1\-score of 75%. The practical usefulness of the Twitter mining tool for the analysts’ work was also demonstrated and was deemed of high enough quality to be used in the practical setting \[R2\]. 

 This Essex research resulted in a new platform for Ceasefire \(Fig.1\), described in \[R2\], which monitors human rights violations within a specified geographic area via \(i\) a structured reporting system which experts and individual witnesses submit to, enabling civilian\-led monitoring, combined with \(ii\) AI mining of social media yielding a continuous stream of data which have been classified as signals of potential violations within the same region. Essex's system constituted the portal first portal of its kind which combines \(i\) and \(ii\). The platform’s sources include reports submitted by users directly to the website, email and SMS, Twitter, and mainstream news reports, in both Arabic and English \[R2\]. Reports submitted through the form are stripped of personally identifying information and plotted onto a live, interactive map visible on the tool’s landing page, which shows the distribution of violations by location and type. Sensitive personal data is stored securely on a secondary server in case it is needed for future follow\-up or court proceedings. The reports obtained are made available to partner organisations and the public at the same portal web interface where reports are submitted.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Developing and implementing a secure reporting platform enabling civilians to document human rights violations**</ins> 

 The ability of traditional human rights monitoring via investigative missions to work effectively and achieve their aims is challenged by restricted access to insecure territories, as well as cost, time, questions over politicisation, oversight, legitimacy and representation. With advances in communications technology, civilian\-led monitoring in conflict zones has become a complementary, and sometimes the principal, source of information on human rights violations \[S1\]. Although new technologies provided hardware for civilians to report violations in theory, obtaining reliable human rights data and information that can be documented required a new system. Essex NLIP researchers collaborated with MRG \(a leading international human rights organisation, with over 150 partners across 60 countries\) \[S2\] and Ceasefire \(founded in 2014 as an in\-house centre of specialist expertise on civilian\-led monitoring within MRG\) on the 2014\-2017 Ceasefire Programme to develop and implement such a system of civilian\-led monitoring of human rights abuses \[S3\]. 

 The Executive Director \(ED\) of Ceasefire \(and former ED of MRG until 2018\) confirms that ‘ **Essex’s NLIP research was applied to develop the essential technological infrastructure to support civilian\-led monitoring**, including dual Arabic/English language reporting, as well as techniques for social media data mining*. *Specifically, they **developed an integrated online platform** to receive and process information from sources, including reports submitted by users directly to the website, email and SMS, information posted on Twitter, and mainstream news reports, in both Arabic and English which was critical to the Ceasefire programme’s success*’ \[R2\] \[S3\]. They add: ‘ **Essex's specialist insights in Arabic NLP, working in areas such as text summarisation and named entity extraction, provided the essential foundations for developing the platform**’ \[e.g. R3\] and ‘ *through further research in a project funded by MRG and Innovate UK, the NLIP researchers constructed the online Ceasefire platform \[…\]* *Essex’s NLIP research was the essential basis for that project’s results*’ \[R1\-7\] \[S3\]. The Ceasefire platform comprised two technological developments: A violations reporting form, allowing users to submit reports of violations directly to the website and the addition of social media data mining tools to the website, allowing information on human rights violations to be automatically harvested from Arabic language Twitter feeds \[R2\] \[S3\]. Importantly ‘ **Essex’s NLIP research provided the capability to adapt and enhance the systems for new environments**, and in line with changing modes of communication*’ so that the reporting platform is ‘ *applicable to different contexts, and conflict situations*’ \[S3\]. The development of **this new platform was** ‘ **essential for the success of the Ceasefire programme which has empowered civilians subject to violations in highly insecure environments**’** \[S3\]. 

  

 This reporting platform was piloted by MRG and Ceasefire in Iraq in 2016 with MRG’s partner organisations, including Asuda \- Combating Violence against Women, then  publicly rolled out in Iraq in 2017, Iran in 2018, part of Syria in 2019 and more widely across the Middle East and North Africa in 2019 \[S3\]. Accessible to anyone with an internet connection, **the platform empowers and enables ordinary civilians to document violations of their rights in a way that conforms to international legal standards and increases the future usability of the data** \[S3, S4 p.57\]. The creation of a safe, secure and easy to use platform \[R2\] has helped to **mitigate the risks to those reporting human rights abuses in conflict situations**, including civilians, journalists and humanitarian agencies \[S4\]. ‘ *In the current situation in Iraq, the major risk facing human rights activists and defenders is reporting violations \[...\] The online tool helps them prevent these risks as they easily use the tool and it is anonymous.*’ Director of an Iraqi NGO \[S4 p 58\]. For civilians, the platform enables them to report incidents at any time and in a more conﬁdential way than talking with a representative of an NGO, which could be under surveillance \[S4\]. In Iraq more than **3,700** cases of human rights violations were documented using the platform since 2017 \[S3, S4 p. 58\], several hundred in Syria since 2019 – ‘ **a considerable body of documentary evidence of violations**’** \[S3\]. In addition to the violations reported via the platform, **information harvested from social media alerts the relevant authorities to violations, providing a means of early warning** \[S3\]. ‘ *The Twitter crawler also provides real\-time information on the popular reaction to reports of violations, giving us a perspective on people’s attitudes to human rights abuses, including at local level*’ \[S3\]. 

 <ins> **Contributing to the work of UN bodies, increasing the availability of reparations and improving human rights outcomes**</ins> 

 Data obtained from the reporting platform contributes evidence for influential reports \[e.g. S5a, b\] submitted by MRG/Ceasefire to UN bodies for international oversight of human rights issues. Ceasefire’s ED states ‘ **Different UN mechanisms use the information provided as a result of the tool** and some have referred to our reports which the platform provided essential evidence for*’ \[S3\]. For example, *‘our work on Iran, based partly on one of the tools, was quoted by the UN Secretary\-General in his report on Iran for the UN General Assembly in 2019* \[see S6 p15\] *. This is the most significant and authoritative annual report on human rights in the country’* \[S3\]. When protests erupted in Iraq in 2018, reports of excessive use of force by security forces against peaceful protesters began to appear on platform. These cases were incorporated into a wider report on repression of civilian activists in Iraq \[S5a\] which was then used as a basis for urgent appeals and advocacy pushes at the UN Human Rights Council and other forums \[S4\].  Ceasefire have a strong record of having their recommendations on human rights adopted: *‘we made a total of 63 separate recommendations on Iraq to the UN Universal Periodic Review, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; of these, 28 were fully adopted and 16 partially adopted by the relevant UN body’* Ceasefire ED \[S3\]. 

 The evidence of human rights violations obtained from the platform has also **enabled documentation of claims for reparations, to compensate the victims of human rights abuses** \[S3\]. ‘ **Cases documented on the platform can form the basis for reparations claims** **under the Iraqi national Law 20 reparations system**, which has paid out over USD 355 million in compensation. This aided our cooperation with the UN assistance mission in Iraq and with the Iraqi Parliament: we subsequently formed an agreement with the Iraqi Human Rights Committee to provide technical assistance on the drafting of new human rights legislation. We also have a developing relationship with IOM \(International Organization for Migration\) because they have taken a particular interest in reparations.’* Ceasefire ED \[S3\]. By enabling the development of the platform, the Essex NLIP research has ultimately ‘ **empowered civilians subject to violations in highly insecure environments and boosted the availability of reparations. This had a major effect on human rights outcomes**’** Ceasefire ED \[S3\]. 

 <ins> **Supporting</ins> <ins>MRG</ins><ins>’s</ins> <ins>human rights operations</ins> <ins></ins><ins>and the establishment of Ceasefire</ins> <ins>furthering the practice of civil society based monitoring of violations**</ins>  <ins> </ins> 

 Through the development of the new platform, Essex research enabled MRG **‘ **to develop a major new area of expertise**’* \[S7\] and *‘provided the technology for the system to enable civilian\-led reporting of human rights abuses which Ceasefire’s work depends upon and was thereby **an essential factor in establishing and maintaining Ceasefire, furthering the practice of civil society based monitoring of violations**. This in turn helped Ceasefire and MRG to secure significant new external funds for related projects, including the award of a new EUR1,000,000 project by the EU’* \[S3\], \[S7, p4\]. MRG is financed by donations and grants from foreign governments, trusts and foundations, and from individual donations \[S7, p2\]. The increase in its income from a year before the project began to 2017 was almost entirely attributed to the platform \(S7, p5\-6, items 9 and 10, pages 5\-6\). MRG’s staff acquired new skills in the management of online reporting platforms, improved understanding of user needs and behaviour in the reporting of human rights violations on the ground, better appreciation of the adaptation of international standards on human rights monitoring and reporting, as well as a wider awareness of digital advances to support the human rights movement generally \[S7 p5\]. Furthermore, ‘ *training in the use of the reporting platform has been undertaken on two occasions for civil society organisations in Iraq*’ \[S7 p5\]. MRG also employed a new Programme coordinator to implement the results of the project \[S7 p8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research carried out at Anglia Ruskin University \(ARU\) has improved awareness of the challenges affecting HE staff and students with caring responsibilities and of how they are compounded by university policies. Universities including University College Cork \(Ireland\), University of Newcastle \(Australia\), University of Plymouth \(UK\) and ARU, and UK national bodies including the UCU and UCAS, have used Moreau’s research to review and change their policies and practices to take into account the needs of carers. Internationally, the EU PLOTINA project has drawn on the research to consider a broad range of caring responsibilities in their assessment and promotion of gender balance in research organisations. A UK\-based film director and a US\-based visual artist have created a film and a series of drawings based on the research, which have led to greater awareness and better understanding of the issues faced by carers.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Students and staff with main or shared caring responsibilities for children and/or elderly, disabled or ill adults constitute a growing presence in HE. There is a dearth of data available on the number of carers within HE. However, Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) data \(2019\) indicate that one in five adults aged between 50 and 69 is a carer; and Universities and Colleges Admissions Service \(UCAS\) data \(2020\) show that there are 375,000 young adults in HE who are carers. UCAS data do not include students whose sole caring responsibility is parenting, with estimates suggesting that respectively 5%–7% and 35%–38% of full\-time and part\-time students are parents \(NUS, 2011\). In academic settings, carers experience problems with finance, health and wellbeing, work\-life balance, retention and career progression. Some of these challenges have become more significant in the context of the Covid\-19 pandemic. However, their lives are under\-researched, with the exception of literature concentrating on the mothering of healthy, ‘abled’ children. 

 Research started by Professor Marie\-Pierre Moreau in 2010 \(initially at the University of Bedfordshire, then at Roehampton University, and continued since she joined ARU in September 2018\), has investigated caregivers in a number of academic settings. Her work has generated an improved understanding of the lives of carers in HE and of how societal and university cultures create care\-based inequalities. Moreau was Principal Investigator on one internally and six externally funded projects \(three of these since joining ARU\), collaborating with two Research Assistants, a Film Director and a Visual Artist. 

 Moreau’s seven projects included the analysis of national and institutional HE policies and 120 in\-depth interviews conducted in England with student carers, academics and managers with caring responsibilities, and HE professional staff based in student services, human resources departments and equality and diversity \(EDI\) units. 

 The findings can be summarised as follows: 

1.  Students and academic staff who are carers face a range of issues related to finance, mental and physical health and well\-being, retention, and – for staff – career progression. \[R1, 2, 3, 4\] 

1.  Some support staff and academic staff draw on deficit discourses of care \(disempowering patterns of thought, language, or practice\) and hold prejudiced views of carers. \[R2\] 

1.  Moreau’s research highlights significant inequalities *among* carers in addition to inequalities between those with and without caring responsibilities. These are based on factors such as the nature of their caring responsibilities, their family circumstances, gender, position, institution, department and line manager’s perspective. Those who do not fit the narrow category of parenting healthy, ‘abled’ children are more likely to struggle in reconciling their carer and academic identities. In particular, this concerns those who do not fit the archetype of the academic, i.e. academics who identify as LGBT, BME, working\-class, and/or women; as well as the parents of children with a disability or special needs and those caring for someone ill or elderly. These groups are less likely to receive institutional support. \[R2, 4\] 

1.  Institutional policies and practices compound the issues faced by carers in ways which are more complex and less ‘top\-down’ than previously assumed. Due to the levels of misrecognition faced by some carers, sympathetic ‘localised’ policymaking and informal arrangements at the micro\-level are favoured by them over formal support, particularly if they have complex caring responsibilities. This in turn raises equality issues in relation to the support that carers receive. \[R4\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has led HE institutions in the UK, Ireland and Australia to change their policies on staff and students who are carers. This led to an improved quality of life for both carers and the individuals for whom they care and has raised awareness of carers across the sector. 

 Specifically, the three main types of impacts achieved are as follows: 

###  1\) Changing sector\-wide and institutional policies on carers 

 1.1 **At HEI level**: since September 2018, Moreau has advised HR, Equality Diversity and Inclusion, and Student Services staff in the UK \(including at Anglia Ruskin University \[C1\], Bedfordshire, East London, Cambridge, Oxford and Warwick universities\), in Australia \(Newcastle\) and in Ireland \(University College Cork \[C2\]\) on the development of carer\-friendly policies and practices. 

 Eighty\-three per cent of survey respondents across Ireland and the UK \(including pre\- and post\-1992 institutions\) report that since September 2018 they have changed or have plans to change policies and practices in their institution, as a result of the intervention \[C3\], based on post\-workshops surveys \(September 2018 onward\). The Inclusivity Network coordinator and Faculty student adviser at ARU noted that the research led to “ *changes to \[ARU\] HR policy documents making it clearer that compassionate leave could cover relatives as well as children and to encourage staff and managers to be more aware of options around leave where a terminal illness had been diagnosed*”. She also added: “ *we now record the type of compassionate leave and have also now included care as a category in our staff survey*” \[C1\]. 

 A University of Cambridge academic staff member explained that as a result of Moreau’s work, “ *We have scheduled seminars at lunchtime \- a small but meaningful change for us*.”, and a deputy HoD, also at the University of Cambridge, mentioned that she would *“encourage \[the\] greater representation of carers”* and *“recognize their greater emotional load”* \[C3\]. The University of Plymouth used the research findings to inform their Athena Swan submission \(November 2018\) and to design a survey that influenced their action plan for gender equality \[C4\]. 

 **Internationally**, at University College Cork \(UCC\) the research had “ *significant impact on the 21,000 students and 2,800 members of staff*” \[C2\]. It raised awareness and led to a better understanding that existing policies are focused towards those who are care\-free and created “ *significant impetus*” for policy change. This led directly to the set\-up of a carers’ network following a suggestion at a workshop \(March 2019\) led by Moreau. In a post\-workshop survey 100% of respondents stated that Moreau’s work had raised their awareness of the impact of university policy and practices on carers and 80% had plans to share what they had learned. Participants said they planned to “ *engage more with advocacy etc. regarding this area*”, “ *ask line manager to implement Athena Swan commitments re timing of meetings and decision”*’ and “ *\[to use\] the information provided to raise awareness*” \[C2\]. Moreau’s research informed the widening participation agenda of the University of Newcastle \(Australia\) as they undertook a review of their policies for carers \(2019, ongoing\), with a representative noting that “ *Moreau’s research and briefing sheet on student carers has been drawn on in discussions about what steps to take to further support students from this group at the University of Newcastle. This research will feed into the development of policy and practice on student carers at the University of Newcastle, NSW*” \[C5\]. 

 1.2. **At the sector\-wide level**: Moreau gave evidence and provided guidance to the University and College Union \(UCU\) equality sub\-committee of the National Executive Committee in September 2018, informing their national campaign on carers \[C6\]. Her work also informed the inclusion of a new series of questions capturing students’ caring responsibilities in UCAS’ Undergraduate Application Management Service 2019, leading to greater visibility for student carers. 

 1.3 **At transnational level**: Moreau’s research, including her input as an EU expert\-monitor for the PLOTINA project \(which promotes gender balance and inclusion in research\), has *“enabled discussion around care among the Plotina* \[sic\] *consortium and led to wider considerations around caring responsibilities”* in the Gender Equality Plans \(GEPs\) developed by members of the consortium to measure and tackle gender inequalities \[C7\]. The GEPs have been implemented in six institutions across six countries, 48 research organisations across six countries, seven research funding organisations across two countries, and were made available to other institutions as an open\-access resource, including a ‘library of actions’ comprising various initiatives related to care that are available for all organisations to use \[C7\]. 

###  2\) Improving the lives of carers who work and study in academia 

 The development of specific policies and practices at the institutional level has contributed to improving the lives of carers in the institutions where they have been implemented. 

 Carers have gained confidence in requesting support, with a staff network coordinator noting that the research has “ *raised awareness amongst staff and managers that caring can be defined in a variety of ways which will have a positive impact of staff who are experiencing a period of caring in their lives”* \[C1\]. In a blog post, an academic \(University of the Arts\) commented, “ *It has been personally empowering to discover the work of Prof Moreau, to accept that I’m not a super\-human robotic like ‘care\-free’ academic, and to network with her and others as they seek to raise awareness of ‘care\-full’ academia and to change practices and policies in High Education to improve the lives of staff with caring responsibilities*” \[C8\]. 

###  3\) Raising awareness among HE policymakers and practitioners 

 Awareness has been increased through the development and roll\-out of non\-academic engagement tools, including 1\) the production of the film *Carers and Careers in Academia* \[R1\]; 2\) a range of articles and blog posts including since 2018, for high\-profile policymaking organisations and national media \[C9\]; 3\) the production of drawings inspired by Moreau’s research. 

 On 31/12/2020, the film had attracted just under 1,500 views on YouTube and Vimeo. It has also been shown at various events in the UK and Australia and is hosted on institutional and policymakers’ websites. A viewer from Keele University Medical School tweeted “ *Caring is at the heart of medicine, but do we provide the support needed to help those carers within KeeleMedSchool? The EDI team is looking to talk to our carers in 2019 – so get in touch”.* The Wellcome Trust tweeted about the film to their 155k followers. Feedback included an Australian university administrator who argued that the film “ *Should be compulsory viewing for University policymakers and managers”* and another claiming that *“All \#HigherEducation managers should watch this video about carers in academia”* \(Twitter\). 

 Moreau’s work has also inspired the US\-based cartoonist and academic Prof. Sally Campbell Galman to produce a series of illustrated ‘vignettes’. Shared online and to be exhibited at ARU and at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst \(US\) in 2021 \(see Covid\-19 note\), they raise awareness of the challenges faced by many HE carers. Campbell Galman commented: “ *As a single mother in academia who is also a working artist, the experience of working closely with the findings from Professor Moreau's research has been deeply illuminating. Not only did I gain greater insight into my own experience, but also into the experiences of my colleagues who are carers and my own possible negative or positive impacts upon their work life experiences*” \[C10\]. After attending a seminar where the material was shared, the Director of WIASN \(Women in Academia Support Network, an international online community of over 10,000 women working in academia\) mentioned that it had changed her understanding of care and commented: *“\[I will\] bring caring into the workshops I deliver as part of staff training and development*” and that she would share what she had learned through the WIASN network and her University Researcher Development committee, for discussion and awareness raising \[C3\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *Histories of the Unexpected* is a collaboration between Professor James Daybell and TV presenter and historian Dr Sam Willis that has achieved impact in three main ways: 1\) stimulating learning from and engagement with history globally, and teaching people how to be historians; 2\) stimulating technological and practice innovation in the creative industries through Histories of the Unexpected Ltd; and 3\) changing modes of engagement with history in professional practice. The project began in 2016 as a weekly history podcast \(featuring on Dan Snow’s History Hit Network\) that transformed the communication of history into an accessible, fun and creative format \(for new and global audiences\) with the mission to democratise both historical knowledge and historical practice. The podcast \( *over* 200 episodes\) has received over 2.5 million downloads in 193 countries and formed the basis for a 496\-page book, a four\-volume book series, two live touring stage shows, a homeschooling history series responding to the COVID\-19 crisis \(250,000 downloads\), and an online magazine. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Daybell’s published historical research and findings over the past two decades \(supported by British Academy, Leverhulme and AHRC\-funded research projects\) has underpinned and served as the foundation on which *Histories of the Unexpected* \(hereafter, *Unexpected*\) has achieved global reach with non\-academic audiences. It is the detailed insights of Daybell’s archival research published across his outputs that bring *Unexpected* to life, were instrumental to developing the concept at the outset, and without which the brand simply would not have worked nor achieved its significant impact. In addition to providing direct content and themes, the methodological approach Daybell has established in his research underpins the entire project. 

 While all of Daybell’s research ultimately contributes to the *Unexpected* content, most notable is his published work in four main areas around which the brand has essentially been built: 

 **a\) early modern letter\-writing and archives** \[3.1\-3.3\], where his ground\-breaking and exhaustive research explored epistolary cultures throughout the early modern period, concentrating on gendered, material and socio\-cultural approaches to correspondence, as well as on the ways in which the construction of early modern archives was inflected by issues of gender; 

 **b\) gender and political culture** \[3.4\] which has looked at how political structures throughout early modern Europe were shaped by gender; 

 **c\) material culture** \[3.5\], which has been explored through the manuscripts practices associated with the culture and practice of early modern letters and letter\-writing; and 

 **d\) gendered interpretations of museums** \[3.6\] where Daybell’s research as PI on an AHRC\-funded project ‘Gendered Interpretations of The Vasa and V&A Museums’ has explored gender as an important interpretative category within the museum environment, exploring objects and their gendered narratives across their lifecycle, and the impact of issues of gender on curatorial practice, as well as educational and public programming. 

 These published outputs provide raw materials for the *Unexpected* outputs, with dedicated episodes, chapters or stage\-play elements on letters, ink, paper, handwriting \(in conjunction with British Library exhibition ‘Writing: Making Your Mark’\), love, the family, spies, and gloves. Daybell’s specific findings, such as John Donne’s grovelling letters to his father\-in\-law and the Jesuit priest John Gerard’s use of orange juice for secret letters \(output 5\) bring these to life. There have also been special podcast episodes on the Vasa and V&A collection as part of the AHRC project. 

 Theoretically and methodologically *Unexpected* is underpinned by the rigorous historical approach Daybell uses in his research, that combines cultural history, object biography, comparative and global history. Daybell’s own research has worked at the level of micro\-studies meeting a macro\-world and this is something that infuses *Unexpected*, which is interested in the ways in which the everyday and mundane can be recovered, and their stories told and interpreted, as well as how they relate to broader historical forces and shifts, and how they connect to well\-known events in the past.

 **1. Stimulating Learning From and Engagement with History** 

 The achieved mission of *Unexpected* has from the start been to democratise historical knowledge by not only educating people of all ages, but also giving them the tools to become historians themselves, thus promoting history at a time when STEM subjects dominate our schools, and the UK Government’s Education minister decries the ‘low value’ of studying the Humanities \(May 2019\) \[IE9\]. In a world of information overload and misinformation, an interest in history and the skills of the historian are of fundamental importance in any modern democratic society. *Unexpected* capitalises on the easily accessible concept that everything has a history and that these histories link together in unexpected ways \(from objects to emotions, topics to themes\). 

 Daybell’s research translated through the *Unexpected* brand has reached new diverse and global audiences through the podcast \(over 200 episodes\), book \( *Histories of the Unexpected: How Everything Has a History,* 2018\), the 30,000\-40,000\-word series of four books \( *The Romans; The Vikings; WWII; and The Tudors*, 2019\), two live stage shows \( *Histories of the Unexpected Live and Histories of the Unexpected: The Tudors*\), a schools outreach programme and a special 30\-episode series of homeschooling history podcasts \(aimed at KS2\-4 while schools were closed during lockdown in 2020\), and an *Unexpected Magazine* \( [http://historiesoftheunexpected.com\)](http://historiesoftheunexpected.com/). The podcast has been downloaded over 2,500,000 times since it launched in 2016, with more than 250,000 downloads of the homeschooling series alone during lockdown in 2020. Over 1.4m downloads are outside of the UK, with listeners in 193 countries around the world \(including the Middle and Far East, Africa, Asia and South America\) \[5.8\]. The podcast has featured on iTunes new and innovative podcasts in the UK and US, was the only history podcast to feature at the 2017 London Podcast Festival, was listed as one of the Top 5 History podcasts by *The Evening Standard \(2018\) and Independent* \(2019\), and one of 7 podcasts listed by BBC Scotland for homeschooling during lockdown \[5.8\]. In collaboration with the playwright Daniel Jamieson, two of the books were turned into live stage shows performed by Daybell and Willis. These are taking history in popular form via a national tour \(produced by Makin Productions\) into theatres, churches, community venues, literary and music festivals and heritage sites, as well as schools. Filmed interviews of audience reactions describe it as *‘fascinating’, ‘absolutely brilliant’, ‘magical’, ‘imaginiative’, ‘creative, thought\-provoking’, ‘inspirational’, ‘broad appeal across the ages, bringing history to the masses’*, with one respondent stating that ‘ *every child in Britain should learn history… and this show helps us realise how important encouraging history is’*; another felt it was ‘ *tremendous in bringing people together and sharing and beginning a love of history’* \[5.4\]. 

 Methodologically it is the experience of working as a practising professional historian that informs all aspects of *Unexpected*. It is the excitement of archival research, the methods of working, the discoveries and fundamentally how to be a historian that is one of the most infectious by\-products of the brand. People love the sense of wonder of archival discovery in the podcasts \(including a mini\-series on ‘How to be a Historian’\), one audience member saying *‘they bring \[history\] to life \[and\] make you feel a part of it’* \[5.4\]. Dramatising history on stage embeds Daybell’s research directly into live shows, as in the case of describing the discovery of a lock of the Duke of Wellington’s hair in a family memory box on a research trip to the Bodleian; or John Donne’s deferential placement of his signature in the bottom right\-hand corner in grovelling letters to his father\-in\-law. In this manner, the complexities of Daybell’s archival research are translated in the form of an accessible new genre of performed history in a way that significantly extends its reach and significance to non\-traditional audiences. In reaching new groups as well as teachers and school children, heritage and museum professionals, and history enthusiasts, *Unexpected* has broken down the barriers to those consuming history, helping them approach history in an entirely new way that is fun, dynamic and creative. Paul Ross \(Talk Radio\) describes it as ‘genius’, Dan Snow ‘History as you’ve never seen it before’, Kerry White \(BBC Radio Devon\) ‘The new Horrible Histories’. The show was performed nationally over 75 times \(2017\-2020\) to more than 10,000 people, plus performances for schools with a cumulative audience of 5000 school children aged 8\-18. 

 The innovative and creative approach to the past pioneered by *Unexpected* has led to curriculum enrichment in schools as well as social inclusion with increased knowledge. Teachers in the UK, Europe and the US \(both at primary and secondary level\) have benefitted from *Unexpected* through incorporating content and ideas into their practice, enriching the curriculum, facilitating social inclusion among pupils, and engaging and increasing the knowledge, understanding and self\-awareness of children normally uninterested in history. Take\-up of *Unexpected’s* approach to history has both been ad hoc \(with teachers, parents and children finding the podcasts, books and shows themselves\) as well as planned; *Unexpected* has worked with around 50 schools around the country, through performing shows, leading workshops, and creating schools’ events for literary festivals e.g. Beaminster and Wantage. The workshops Daybell has developed and run for primary and secondary schools are based on the *Unexpected* methodology and concept \(involving pupils making their own podcasts and animations, and contributing to the *Unexpected Magazine*\); the schools programme has facilitated four internships for sixth\-formers; and Daybell has also provided several CPD workshops for schoolteachers about embedding the concept of *Unexpected* as a form of curriculum enrichment to engage pupils who struggle with an understanding of history. One outcome of this was a Plymouth school building a curriculum challenge day around the concept \[5.5\]. 

 Feedback from Headteachers, Heads of History and History teachers attests to the engagement of their pupils, and the social value of their enhanced understanding of the past and their relationship to it. The Headteacher of a Devon school described the podcast\-making workshop for KS2 pupils as an invaluable way of engaging pupils with history, building self\-confidence and making them think about the world around them in new ways: *‘I have never seen a history event more suited for engaging a school audience…’* \[5.5\]. A Buckinghamshire head wrote *‘by challenging misconceptions about the past, making links across time and showing unceasing joy about the subject, Sam and James bring the past alive. I was so impressed at their use of props, humour and poignant details’ \[5.5\]; another head in the South West remarked ‘Their witty and clever linking of concepts and themes across time is a creative and original way of helping children both to understand History but also life…and their place in it.  Superb stuff\!’* \[5.5\]. 

 From the perspective of classroom practitioners, the methodology of *Unexpected* has been transformative for curriculum enrichment and engaging with challenging pupils. History is not simply made fun, but rather *Unexpected* delivers a fundamentally new perspective on what history is, and teachers have found ways of translating this into their practice and into the curriculum with an appreciation of the significance of the links between different periods. One teacher comments ‘ *it’s…made us reflect more on the nature of physical evidence and the power of ‘narrative’ history’*. A Dorset\-based secondary teacher wrote it ‘ *enriched my teaching, allowing me to use those magic little pockets of history to engage all my students. It’s a most wonderful feeling seeing pupils lean in slightly as you discuss how perfumes from the 1800s has been recreated today’* \[5.5\]. The Lead Practitioner in Humanities and Head of History at Boulder Academy, an inner city London comprehensive school, has found using *Unexpected* invaluable in light of the fact that ‘ *engagement can be a difficulty in history teaching’* from lesson planning, keeping up to date with current historiography to sparking the interests of unmotivated kids who see little direct relevance in history for them. During lockdown the home schooling podcasts were used at the academy as part of homework tasks: ‘ *the kids love them and the questions at the end make them so easy to use as teachers. Thanks so much\!*’. The invaluable nature of the homeschooling episodes as a resource for teachers during lockdown is remarked upon more widely in the teacher questionnaires \[5.5\]. International teachers have also been inspired by *Unexpected’s* approach to history. A Middle\-School teacher based in the American Mid\-West uses the concept of finding a history in everything to engage 9\-year\-olds in her class to excite them about history and understand the world around them. Finally, parents have enthused about their children’s reactions to *Unexpected*, with one parent describing it as ‘ *an inspiration to budding historians’*; another that ‘ *the homeschooling episodes were invaluable for my kids during lockdown when schools were closed…accessible, and aligned to the national curriculum’*; while the impact on the imaginations, knowledge and understanding of children of all ages is palpable, with one child describing it as ‘ *loads of fun’, another ‘they turn learning into fun’* \[5.3 & 5.4\]. 

 Through *Unexpected*, Daybell’s research has reached a genuinely global audience touching the lives of thousands of people. Listening to the series has for many become part of daily routines, a listener in Kuwait writing it had ‘ *become an important part*’ of the morning school run, another from Auckland, New Zealand described it as ‘ *informative and entertaining’*, while listeners in the USA described it as ‘ *fun and interesting’*, and ‘ *a fantastic way to teach history’*, experiences reflecting hundreds of interactions with end users on social media \[5.7\]. The brand has impacted on people in deeply personal ways, and in its most pronounced form encourages social inclusion, well\-being, mental activity and positive sense of purpose. One re\-enactor and museum guide described her own personal journey of self\-discovery after listening to the podcast: ‘ *I often found that \- while hand\-sewing costumes for events \- I was inspired to research the history of the fabric or tools I was using, or the article of clothing I was making. In doing so I finally gained the confidence to get fully involved at the events. In turn this led to me having the confidence to volunteer as a guide at the museum where I now lead a team of fellow volunteers, who I have inspired to do their own research into some of the more random artefacts’* \[5.7\]. 

 **2. Technological Innovation and Stimulating Practice in the Creative Industries** 

 **i. Dan Snow’s History Hit Network and Democratising History.** As a founding collaborator of the History Hit network established by TV historian Dan Snow, Daybell \(with TV presenter and historian Sam Willis\) developed the Histories of the *Unexpected* podcast brand as a way of using digital technologies to provide an alternative media platform outside of traditional broadcasters to popularise and democratise history for new audiences traditionally uninterested in history. Working with the financial support and institutional backing of History Hit, Daybell recorded over 200 podcasts, which are widely available across all providers, supported by ACAST, the largest global podcast company \( [<ins>https://play.acast.com/s/historiesoftheunexpected</ins>](https://play.acast.com/s/historiesoftheunexpected)\). 

 Daybell’s research translated through the medium of podcasts helped to establish the History Hit network, as part of Dan Snow’s mission to develop a ground\-breaking way of communicating history. In working with *Unexpected* to break down the barriers of broadcasting and publishing and ‘ *reach an audience, unimaginable a few years ago*’, Dan Snow writes, ‘ *with listens…in the* *millions*’, *Unexpected* has ‘ *introduced listeners all over the world to rich and complex histories’*, describing it as ‘ *a case study in how intellectuals can seize upon the giant changes in how we are living, interacting, learning and listening to share their work more widely than ever before’* \[5.1\]. The ability of *Unexpected* to reach new audiences through its innovation is noted by the Content Director of BBC History Magazine and BBC History Festivals, who considered that *Unexpected* is ‘ *innovative and engaging, reaching out to both the traditional historical audience, who appreciate the fresh direction, and the non\-traditional audience, who find something surprising and original in the Unexpected series’* \[5.2\]. It is the combination of podcasting technology and an unexpected approach of translation that brought the practice of historians to new audiences. 

 **ii. Enhancing Creative Practice within SMEs and practitioners**. From 2016 to 2020, the translation of Daybell’s research on letters, gender and archives using digital, print, visual and stage technologies has involved collaboration with over 200 SMEs and practitioners working in the creative industries. These include presenters, playwrights, producers, editors, festival and event organisers, agents, publishers, translators, tour bookers, theatre directors, technicians, web designers, animators, sound engineers, film\-makers and PR companies who benefitted creatively and financially from the collaboration with *Unexpected* to develop innovative historical genres and formats. Through these coproductions, *Unexpected* has produced over 200 podcasts; a trade press book *Histories of the* *Unexpected* \(2018; audio book 2019; currently translated into Italian, Dutch, Chinese, Brazilian and German\); and book series based on the concept. 

 The award\-winning playwright Daniel Jamieson was commissioned to collaborate with Daybell to transfer the *Unexpected* books to the stage. He described that the creative process of working with Daybell made him rethink how he approached his craft of writing and engagement with history to make complex manuscript practices employed in early modern correspondence visually compelling for theatre audiences of non\-specialists. ‘ *What we have achieved in developing the stage show is nothing less than a new genre for the stage – effectively an interactive historical show that brings history to life on stage. This is something that has never been attempted before with history’* \[5.3\]. A former BBC producer who has established his own independent filmmaking company found that working with *Unexpected* helped him develop his craft. The work allowed him to gain experience filming live audiences, which has benefited him financially, by giving him ‘ *the opportunity to broaden my subject matter and add to both my skills and experience…. It has helped me gain additional work locally, enabling me to build my business’* \[5.3\]. 

 **3. Changing Modes of Engagement with History in Professional Practice.** 

 A third aspect of impact is the transformation of working practices of museum and heritage professionals, whose curation practice now draws on the *Unexpected* method of ‘linking’ histories as a way of engaging visitors with their collections, attracting new audiences. This was achieved through working with five museums and heritage sites \(the V&A, Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Powderham Castle, the British Library, and Beaminster Museum\). Each has collaborated with *Unexpected* as a media channel for engaging people with their sites and collections. As collaborators in an AHRC\-funded research project ‘Gendered Interpretations of Museums’, Sweden’s flagship Vasa Museum \(with 1.5 million visitors annually\) worked with Daybell and *Unexpected* to produce a podcast on the project’s research findings that gender is an important interpretative category at the Vasa and in museum environments more generally. Through the podcast that resulted, the gendered narratives of the seventeenth\-century Vasa ship and its objects were communicated in English to a global audience of 15,000 people. The Vasa’s Director of Research writes that this ‘enabled the museum to facilitate new knowledge and understanding of its collections and gendered heritage to international audiences outside of Sweden’ in a way that was unimaginable through their own limited use of podcasts \[O6, 5.6\]. 

 *Unexpected* achieved further global reach to transform the working practices of museum and heritage professionals in an organic manner, since curators worldwide listen to the podcast and are influenced by its methodologies. One museum curator wrote that ‘ *working in a sector that is always challenged to diversify its audiences and in a military museum especially I have been inspired \[by Unexpected\] to look beyond the traditional fixed narratives and to find an exciting and fresher interpretation of our history that a wider public can…relate to in today’s world...’; another wrote ‘it constantly has me thinking about my own role in the sector working front of house and from a curating perspective about connections that can be made*.’ \[5.6\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Cambridge Bilingualism Network \(CBN\) draws on state\-of\-the\-art research to champion the evidence\-based understanding of benefits of multilingual upbringing. Through partnerships with schoolteachers, speech and language therapists, antenatal course teachers and health visitors, CBN has communicated key messages to over 1,000 professionals, changing teaching practice and school policy, increasing school performance and developing inclusive environments for potentially marginalised children. CBN’s work has also led to knowledge gains and changes in delivery of services and national\-level professional guidelines, towards inclusive models benefitting multilingual children and parents. Three of CBN’s partners in national leadership and training roles have felt empowered to become multilingualism champions in their fields. Family\-oriented messages have also reached directly over 8,500 parents and children, raising confidence and enabling informed decisions on home language use and education.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The UK is increasingly multilingual. Nevertheless, multilingual families often receive outdated advice to stop using their home languages because children may be ‘confused’ or disadvantaged in their educational attainment. It was this realisation that motivated the formation of the CBN in 2010. Since then, a fundamental principle of the network is that it is a partnership between researchers and the public, and that it engages in public\-involved research. For example, the CBN kick\-off meeting in 2010, which included researchers, parents and teachers working together to suggest emerging themes in research in multilingualism, highlighted two issues: a gap of research evidence on the role of multilingualism in communication skills \(‘pragmatics’\) and an almost complete lack of studies on whether children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism can become multilingual. More recently, three ESRC\-funded impact workshops held in Cambridge in June\-October 2017 generated collaborations with parents and over 30 Early Years professionals. These revealed another two priorities for research. First, a dearth of studies on the role of multilingualism for family and individual wellbeing and mental health; second, what is the best time for families to receive advice about multilingualism. As regards the latter, it emerged through the workshops that the period ‘ *from blue to two*’ \(from pregnancy to two years of a child’s age\) is a unique ‘teachable period’, during which providing evidenced\-based advice might be most effective in helping parents take decisions about their home language environment. This finding guided a substantial amount of CBN’s impact\-oriented activities with antenatal course teachers and expecting families. 

 Inspired by the above ‘real\-life’ questions, CBN’s research has revealed three more novel findings that inform its impact. First, CBN’s research articles and comprehensive reviews suggest that multilingualism has no adverse effect on any aspect of an individual’s development, even in children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism \(<ins> **R5</ins>, <ins>R6**</ins>\). Second, they show that multilingual people have strong communication skills, including the ability to infer non\-literal meanings \(<ins> **R3</ins>, <ins>R6**</ins>, and other articles\) *;* this ‘pragmatic’ skill is a distinct type of skill, complementary to the much\-debated cognitive benefits that may be associated with multilingualism. As regards the latter, CBN’s research was the first to reveal that even speaking two closely related variations of a language, i.e. two dialects, can lead to cognitive advantages \(<ins> **R4**</ins>\). Third, in what is a largely under\-studied area, CBN gathers and synthesizes evidence that maintaining the use of home languages is beneficial for mental health and specifically for family wellbeing \(<ins> **R1**</ins>, <ins> **R2**</ins>, and other articles\). 

 Methodologically, a distinctive feature of CBN’s body of work is that it uses quantitative evidence \(surveys, linguistic and psycholinguistic lab\-based testing\) as well as qualitative interview data, which lend its messages the gravitas of the lived experience of the individual person combined with the statistically reliable patterns that arise from well\-designed group studies.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **1\) Changing teaching practice and developing inclusive policies in schools.** 

 CBN has established long\-term collaborations with schools and engages teachers with the communicative, cognitive and mental health benefits of multilingualism. Updating and adapting teachers’ beliefs, educational service guidelines and delivery towards more inclusive models for students with ‘English as an Additional Language’ \(EAL\) is a core outcome. 

 In 2014, CBN members worked with the Assistant Head and Lead for English as an Additional Language \(EAL\) at Arbury Primary School, a large primary school in Cambridge with one third of its students on Pupil Premium and one third classed as EAL. The collaboration created a set of recommendations for teachers and advice for parents of EAL children which the school credits in great part for their success with inclusion and for raising teachers’ confidence to teach EAL children **\[E1\]**. Since 2014, the Assistant Head has also delivered teacher training for the University of Cambridge’s Faculty of Education. By her estimate, over 900 prospective primary school teachers/PGCE students have gained knowledge about multilingualism **\[E1\]**. She notes that “\[t\]he slides I use are based on the information I have gained thanks to CBN, and they emphasize the importance of supporting students not only in their English but also on maintaining their home language, because of its important role in family well\-being as well as being the springboard for further language learning.” Importantly, “many prospective teachers tell me that these sessions have completely changed the way they see EAL pupils, especially as regards the role of their home language in educational settings.” **\[E1\]** 

 In another case, in April 2015, the founding team of parents and teachers of St Jérôme CoE Bilingual Primary School \(Harrow\) sought advice from CBN on setting up a bilingual language curriculum in English and French. The collaboration was cited as key evidence in the application submitted to Ofsted for permission to set up this Free School. The Lead Teacher for French and Bilingualism at St Jérôme writes: “Thanks to the collaboration with CBN the school’s founding team presented DfE with a very strong range of evidence about the benefits of learning a second language from a very young age, which was critical in the DfE’s positive decision. \[…\] Thanks to our collaboration, the design of our curriculum and the delivery in the classroom has been at all times informed by research.” **\[E2\]** For example, after consultation with CBN the school introduced literacy in French in Year 1, one year later than literacy in English is introduced \(in Reception\) **\[E2\]**. 

 CBN also collaborates with a large inner\-city secondary school in Peterborough with above average rates of Pupil Premium, where 95% of students speak EAL, including a large proportion of students from the Roma community. The Deputy Principal attended a CBN workshop in June 2017. Following this, six workshops on multilingualism and identity were delivered at the school and CBN \(including PhD student member Kate Howard\) worked with staff on developing EAL guidelines and curricular and extra\-curricular enrichment activities and projects, helping improve the social welfare and inclusion of marginalised students. CBN’s partner notes that “the link with \[CBN\] has been very beneficial in helping to drive forward school improvement, and inspire and support the very diverse and vulnerable school community …, the Network has supported the school in a wide range of areas including: research and CPD, developing curricular and extra‐curricular enrichment and projects and engaging and motivating our EAL and Roma communities” **\[E3\]** \(p.3\). 

 Since 2018, in collaboration with COMPAS \(a Peterborough charity supporting the Roma community\), CBN hosts annual visits to Cambridge by Roma students and has organised a training day for the ‘Roma of Great Ability’ scheme, involving over 60 students. These activities help increase learning in students who then become ambassadors for their language and culture among their peers and champion the participation of Roma students in school and social activities. COMPAS’s CEO has “been able to observe very positive changes in the students’ and also their parents’ attitudes, with a new pride about our Roma language and culture and their abilities.” **\[E4\]** The students noted the benefits of inclusion and raising aspirations: “This was a great plan to do because Roma people never get into projects, but this one is just for them” and “I felt so calm to know everything about the university and I’m looking forward to going there.” **\[E3\]** \(p.2\) 

 **2\) Increasing understanding and improving practice for Early Years health professionals and education providers.** 

 CBN works closely with Early Years professionals who have a critical role in advising parents about the multilingual upbringing of their children and in delivering specialist services to children. As a result of the collaborations, CBN’s partners have adapted their practice, professional guidelines and key messages, and have often assumed ‘multilingualism ambassador’ roles in their field. 

 For example, informed by one of the impact\-workshops CBN held in Cambridge in 2017, and following interviews and surveys with antenatal teachers, it became apparent that \(i\) the best period to impact change in family beliefs and practices is the period ‘from blue to two’, and \(ii\) that the majority and certainly the most popular antenatal courses available in the UK do not offer any information on raising a multilingual child. Moreover, antenatal teacher confidence about multilingualism is low. In CBN’s first targeted activity \(winter 2018/spring 2019\), after providing an information toolkit about multilingualism to 13 antenatal teachers, CBN engaged them in one\-to\-one interviews and pre\- and post\-interview surveys **\[E5\]**. These revealed positive changes in learning and understanding about multilingualism, in confidence about the topic, and in actual practice thanks to the informational toolkit. Indicatively, 90% of participating teachers said that they had been introduced to new concepts about multilingualism \(p.1, Q8\). As one teacher –who previously discussed language development only from a monolingual perspective– noted, as a result of the intervention ‘\[I\] will incorporate languages into my activity on communicating with your baby’ \(p.3\), while another stated that they would now ‘feel more confident in offering support and information’ on multilingualism \(p.3\).  Participants had used the toolkit in an average of 75.5% of the classes they delivered \(p.4\) and parents reported that the information was “very useful” \(p.4\). 

 Informed by the feedback from these activities, in autumn 2019 CBN members \(including PhD student member Mélanie Gréaux\) partnered with a senior antenatal teacher at Birmingham Women’s NHS Hospital, to create and deliver one\-hour ‘WeSpeakMulti’ webinars to antenatal teachers. A total of 65 participants subscribed to view two webinars \(held in January and February 2020\), and 32 of them did so live; 18 participating antenatal teachers completed pre\- and post\-webinar questionnaires. Overall, they reported substantial gains in knowledge and in confidence to apply it in practice \(e.g. only 29% were confident or very confident ‘to answer parents’ questions on multilingual upbringing’ before the webinar while 88% were so post\-webinar\) **\[E6\]** \(p.7\); moreover, 100% rated the seminar’s relevance to their antenatal practice, user\-friendly materials and quality of the information as ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ **\[E6\]** \(p.7\-8\). 

 CBN’s partner for the webinars is not only Lead Antenatal Teacher at a maternity unit with over 8,500 births per year, but also a trainer of antenatal teachers and a senior consultant for NCT, the largest national charity for childbirth. As she notes in her testimonial, ‘\[t\]his collaboration with CBN has changed my professional practice. I incorporate the wellbeing element of multilingualism in my classes and encourage parents to have more of a dialogue about it antenatally. It has also given me the knowledge and the confidence to become an ambassador among my profession’ **\[E7\]** \(p.3\). She also acknowledges that ‘\[m\]ost importantly a set of activities and resources has been created that can be used by every antenatal teacher training program’ \(p.4\). These impact\-bearing webinars, action plans and activities are available on a dedicated website \( [www.wespeakmulti.com](http://www.wespeakmulti.com/)\). 

 CBN also works closely with professionals who support potentially marginalised EAL children with speech, language and communication needs \(SLCN\), such as children with autism. Their collaboration has revealed that parents of children with autism regularly receive advice that multilingualism is ‘too much’ for their children, but CBN’s research also shows this is not the case. Instead, multilingual children with autism will function just as well as their monolingual peers. Moreover, the families who maintain their home languages will enjoy advantages in family wellbeing compared to those who do not. In one example of such collaboration, CBN works together with ICAN, the leading national charity supporting language and communication skills in the early years. CBN helped plug a gap in the advice they offer to their staff as well to multilingual families, and produced a set of five key messages that have reached 1,400 families as of March 2020 **\[E8\]**. 

 In a related activity, CBN members were invited to peer\-review the national guidelines of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in the UK \(RCSLT\) for multilingual clients. According to the Lead Author, the feedback provided gave the guidelines “a new framework..., emphasising that bilingualism is ... a fundamental human right enshrined in the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child...This is a completely novel method of viewing bilingualism.” **\[E9\]**. As a Specialist Adviser to the RCSLT and an award\-winning Senior Clinical Lecturer with national recognition, CBN’s partner teaches and trains over 150 qualifying SLTs annually. He acknowledges benefits and changes to the teaching and training that he offers \(e.g. incorporating the topics of mental health and human rights and findings on language development from CBN member’s research\), which help spread CBN’s impact further among the profession. **\[E9\]** CBN members also wrote an article about multilingualism in the RCSLT’s professional Bulletin \(March 2018, issue 791, pp. 26\-29\) and hosted two events in Cambridge and one at Reading where they discussed with SLTs the challenges of multilingual clients and the advice that is best offered to parents. A participating SLT, who is also Chair of the Cambridge chapter of the Association of SLTs in Independent Practice, notes the change in her practice “Rather than shying away from the issue, I now address multilingualism head\-on by considering the impact of the linguistic environment and language\-medium for assessment and therapy”; as well as changes in confidence and learning **\[E10\]**. This partner champions the impacts gained from the collaboration “...not only locally with parents, but nationally with colleagues and \[using the knowledge gained\] to inform discussions with other professionals working directly with parents from diverse backgrounds”. **\[E10\]** 

 **3\) Informing decisions and raising confidence in parents, children and young people** 

 CBN regularly holds events with parents, children and young people directly, through the school partnerships named above but elsewhere too \(49 such meetings in total from August 2013\-to date, mainly in the East of England and Greater London areas\). A major aim is to enable parents and young people to take informed decisions about the language used at home and about academic decisions, as well as raising confidence to persevere with their choices. For example, at Arbury Primary School CBN have increased learning and understanding about EAL by delivering one or more talks per year, generating knowledge change in over 150 parents since 2014. Indicatively, parental impact survey from events on 29.01.2020 **\[E11\]** show that for a common misconception that hinders the maintenance of the home language, ‘The educational achievement of bilingual students is lower than that of monolingual students at A\-level’, pre\- and post\-event comparison reveals a change in knowledge in 18 out of 24 respondents \(75%\). Of these 18 parents, 100% changed in the right direction, selecting ‘I \[strongly\] disagree’, mostly having selected ‘I \(strongly\) agree’ or ‘I don’t know’ pre\-event. CBN also use online media to reach geographically diverse audiences, such as the online campaign ‘Your Languages, Your Future’ which informs secondary school EAL students about language learning and encourages them to gain formal qualifications in their home languages at GCSE \(7,100 viewers; 39 re\-tweets; 371 shares\) **\[E12\]**. 

 Overall, CBN has communicated key messages to over 1,000 professionals \(Section 4.1\) and to over 8,500 parents and children \(1,400 through ICAN, Section 4.1 and 7,100 through the online campaign above\). CBN also write articles for non\-specialist audiences such as in *The Conversation* \(with 75,301 unique readers\) **\[E12\]** and the team’s research has been reported in national and international media ranging from *Scientific American* to BBC Radio and S4C TV **.**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia to explore the determinants of refugees’ welfare outcomes led to a radical reframing of assumptions held by aid agencies about the economic lives of refugees. The research finding that refugees can make a positive contribution to the host state economy led directly to a new model for refugee resettlement not only within Africa but also of Syrian refugees in Jordan, funded by the World Bank and European Commission. As a result of the Jordan Compact, work permits have been provided to over 180,000 Syrian refugees, and both major international companies such as IKEA and Walmart, as well as Syrian companies, have invested in the 18 special economic zones \(SEZs\) in which refugees are now employed. The World Bank subsequently established a USD2,000,000,000 fund for similar initiatives in refugee haven countries, initially 12 in Africa and two in Asia.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Refugee Economies Programme at the Refugee Studies Centre \(a research group at the Oxford Department of International Development\) led by Alexander Betts undertook participatory, mixed methods research in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia to explore the determinants of refugees’ welfare outcomes; social cohesion with host communities; and mobility and residency choice \( **R1,** with RSC research associate Josiah Kaplan\). 

 The research began with a pilot study in Uganda, the first study to systematically examine the economic contributions of refugees to a developing country \( **R2**\). The researchers focused on Uganda because, unlike most developing host countries, it allows refugees the right to work and freedom of movement. The qualitative and quantitative research, which was carried out in 2013\-14, included a survey of over 1,500 refugees in both camps and urban areas. The approach was pioneering in recruiting and training refugees and host communities themselves as peer researchers and enumerators, enabling the project to have a positive benefit to the community. 

 The research in Uganda challenged many assumptions widely held by aid agencies as to the essentially dependent economic lives of refugees. In contrast, it was found that \( **R1**\): 

-  Refugees often make a positive contribution to the host state economy. For example, there is a significant volume of exchange between refugees and Ugandan nationals, and refugees also create employment opportunities for Ugandan nationals. 

-  Refugees are networked within settlements, nationally, and transnationally. Both refugee traders and Ugandan traders connect refugee settlements to wider economic systems. 

-  Refugees are economically diverse and there is significant inequality among them. They have a range of different livelihood activities, with some being successful entrepreneurs. 

-  Refugees are users of, and sometimes creators of, technology. They have higher levels of internet use than the general population, use mobile phones extensively, and frequently adapt their own appropriate technologies. 

-  Although many refugees receive humanitarian assistance, most are more dependent on other social relationships, aspire to receive other forms of support, and in many cases create sustainable livelihood opportunities for themselves. 

 This pilot study was later extended to include Kenya \( **R3**, **R4**\) and Ethiopia. Since 2017, with funding from the IKEA Foundation, the researchers have constructed the first ever panel data set on the economic lives of refugees, following 16,000 refugees and host community members across camps and cities in the three countries \( **R3**\). The additional countries were chosen to permit comparison of economic outcomes for refugees and host communities across cases with more and less inclusive policies. This enabled the team to quantify, for example, the difference that the right to work and freedom of movement makes to the welfare outcomes of Somali and Congolese refugees. 

 In 2017, the researchers also worked with Deloitte on a small\-scale project looking at the economic lives of Syrian refugees in Europe, based on primary data collection in the UK, the Netherlands, and Austria, drawing upon methods developed through this initial research on refugee economies. The research identified the barriers to employment for refugees, which included lack of language skills and access to training, the desire to work using existing skills, and business uncertainty around legal requirements. It also noted that existing social networks and access to technology offered potential advantages \( **R5,** produced with support of wider RSC team\).

 The results of the Uganda research \( **R1**, **R2**\) had enormous impact within the region and eventually across the world. Influencing policymakers by changing their perception of refugees as potentially contributing to the local economy \(rather than being a burden on taxpayers and aid agencies\) had been the explicit objective of the research project, but the outcome far exceeded expectations. First, Betts built on the Uganda experience to influence policymakers in other countries through the United Nations as a forum, particularly in collaboration with the UN High Commission for Refugees \(UNHCR\). Second, the King of Jordan became aware of the research and called on Betts to explain his results, and with the UK government initiated the ‘Jordan Compact’ to integrate Syrian refugees into his country. Third, this initiative in turn had significant international influence, leading to major World Bank funding for the implementation of the model, and Betts’ involvement in similar initiatives in Ethiopia, Colombia and Kenya. 

 *Building on the Uganda experience to transform policymaking and capacity building in the region* 

 Betts presented the Uganda findings \( **R1, R2**\) at the UN General Assembly in September 2016 on a panel that included the Ugandan Minister for Refugees and the UN Secretary\-General \[ **C1**\]. The Ugandan government also presented this research at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016. In response to the research, the Ugandan government worked with the UN High Commission for Refugees and the World Bank to develop a new multi\-year livelihood strategy for refugees, including a focus on the market\-based opportunities highlighted by the research, which will benefit over 100,000 refugees. This led to the UNHCR and the World Bank jointly publishing a 2016 report, titled *An Assessment of Uganda's Progressive Approach to Refugee Management*, in which one of the conclusions is that “\[a\] shift in the philosophy of refugee assistance is also crucial: refugees should be viewed as economic actors in charge of their destiny” \[ **C2**, pxii\] and the ten\-page literature survey cites Betts and Omata 43 times. 

 The value of the research has been recognised by the Office of the Prime Minister \(OPM\) of Uganda, noting that it has elevated their policymaking by providing a previously unavailable evidence base: “The research conducted by Oxford \[on\] the refugees’ economic activities has made a significant contribution to the development of the OPM and joint self\-reliance programme \[the multi\-year livelihood strategy for refugees\] in Uganda…The analysis and data provided by Oxford have become a significant underpinning of our policy making in the area of refugees’ self\-reliance and have also enabled us to conduct evidence\-based policy\-making” \[ **C3**\]. 

 In a statement from 2016, the effect of the research was also recognised and valued by the UNHCR, with the then\-Deputy High Commissioner stating that the work has been transformative for the way in which policymakers understand the contribution refugees can make: “The Refugee Studies Centre’s work \[on refugee economies in Uganda\] has fundamentally altered the debate on the impact of refugees in countries of asylum, demonstrating the capacity of refugees for self\-reliance and their ability to contribute to hosting societies” \[ **C4**\]. 

 In July 2018, Betts co\-organised a visit of World Economic Forum \(WEF\) Young Global Leaders \(YGLs\) to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. The group included government ministers, company CEOs, and journalists. The visit culminated in the creation of a new WEF initiative to support public\-private partnership for refugees, launched in Davos at the WEF Annual Meeting, at which Betts presented his work. In July 2019, this in turn led to Betts co\-organising the first ever Executive Leadership course in a refugee camp, in Kakuma, in collaboration with the WEF and UNHCR for 30 refugee entrepreneurs, who subsequently embarked on a virtual mentorship programme pairing them with YGLs from around the world \[ **C5**\]. 

 *The “Jordan Compact”* 

 Aware of the Uganda research, the Jordanian royal family invited Betts and Professor Paul Collier \(Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford; and at that time adviser to the Cabinet Office on fragile states\) to explore ways to include Syrian refugees in Jordanian labour markets. Based on the Uganda research, Betts and Collier proposed allowing Syrians to work in Jordan’s existing Special Economic Zones \(SEZs\); previously they had not been permitted to take any employment. They presented the model to the Jordanian royal family, senior cabinet ministers, and relevant UN agencies in Amman in April 2015 and subsequently drafted a white paper for the Jordanian government \(later published as an article in *Foreign Affairs*\) \[ **C6**\]. 

 In September 2015, King Abdullah presented the ideas in the white paper to then\-UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and the model was adopted and developed by DFID, forming the basis of the so\-called “Jordan Compact”, an agreement between the Jordanian government, the World Bank, and the European Union, reached in February 2016. The compact states that it “allow\[s\] Syrian refugees to apply for work permits both inside and outside of the zones…Syrian refugees will be allowed by the summer to formalise their existing businesses and to set up new, tax\-generating businesses, including access to investor residencies, in accordance with the existing laws and regulations” \[ **C7**\]. 

 The proposal by Betts and Collier, based on Bett’s original research \[ **R1** and **R2**\] **,** is widely recognised in the NGO community as being a key “trigger” \[ **C8.1** p.2\] for the compact, and also in the specialist media: an article from The New Humanitarian in July 2016 states that: “The use of \[the  [King Hussein Bin Talal](https://6days-jo.com/hay2a/en/module.php?type=cont&id=28) Development Area, one of the key zones under the compact\], and SEZs more broadly, follows on from  [an influential proposal made last October](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2016-04-28/jordans-refugee-experiment) by two Oxford University professors, Paul Collier and Alexander Betts. In it they pointed out that 60 percent of the world’s displaced were concentrated in just 10 haven countries, including Jordan. While granting citizenship to such large numbers was not currently feasible, the targeted use of SEZs might offer the right to work and transform them from a burden to an asset” \[ **C8.2**\]. In 2016, the European Commission agreed to grant Jordan market access to encourage firms to produce there, as recommended in the white paper \[ **C6**\] – its first ever refugee\-related trade concession. 

 The Jordan Compact led to work permits being provided to over 180,000 Syrian refugees. IKEA and Walmart as well as Syrian companies have invested in the 18 special economic zones in which refugees are now employed. In just one example, in the Sahab Economic Zone, the Al Fayhaa Plastics Company employs 82 refugees among its 313 staff, with 40% of its sales being exports to the EU under the Jordan Compact. 

 *Expanding international policy support for refugee economies* 

 Jordan was the first case ever of the World Bank funding a middle\-income country to host refugees. Soon afterwards, in 2016 the “Jordan model” was adopted by Ethiopia \[ **C9**\]. In fact, British backing for the “Ethiopian Jobs Compact” was Theresa May’s first foreign policy announcement as UK prime minister \[ **C10**\]. 

 Betts’ research \( **R1, R2,** and work\-in\-progress research in Kenya later published as **R3, R4**\) was presented to the World Bank by Collier, as he had formerly been the Bank’s Director of Research. The Bank subsequently created a new USD2,000,000,000 fund to support other refugee haven countries, initially 12 in Africa and two in Asia. Priority areas for the funding included to ""promote refugee's welfare and inclusion in the host country's socio\-economic structures"" and support ""formal labor force participation"" \[ **C11**\]. The original RSC research in Uganda and the Jordan Compact formed the basis of a book for a general readership, *Refuge,* by Betts and Collier \[ **C12**\], which led to further invitations to work directly with governments around the world, including Denmark, Austria, Norway, and Colombia. The book sold over 10,000 copies; was named by the *Economist* as among the best books of 2017; was widely reviewed, including by the *Times Literary Supplement*, the *Wall Street Journal*, the *Sunday Times* and the *Financial Times*; and was shortlisted for the Estoril Global Issues Distinguished Book Prize 2019. 

 Given Betts’ expertise on migration in Africa and the Middle East and his pioneering work on refugee integration, he was invited to Colombia by the presidency in 2019 for advice on what lessons could be drawn from elsewhere in the world to help the country cope with the presence of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who had fled their own country. Betts gave presentations relating the Uganda, Syria and East Africa research to the Venezuelan/Colombian context \[drawing on **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4** and **R5**\] at the Presidential Palace to UN and donor agencies, as well as interviews and opinion pieces for the press. In particular Betts’ suggestion that the country convene a multi\-stakeholder “solidarity summit” was taken up \[ **C13**\]. 

 In October 2019, the European Commission convened an International Solidarity Summit on the Venezuelan Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Brussels, in collaboration with UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration \(IOM\). The event was attended by 120 delegations, including EU institutions and member states, the most affected Latin American and Caribbean countries, donor countries, UN agencies, the private sector, NGOs, civil society organisations and development actors. It focused on principles of solidarity such as access to asylum, combatting xenophobia, and the need for responsibility\-sharing. Explicitly not a pledging conference, it nevertheless led to EUR120,000,000 of additional contributions from EU member states, plus EUR50,000,000 of additional EU funding \[ **C14**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Durham University research on how diffuse pollution is connected across river catchments has been used by a wide range of regulatory bodies, NGOs, and user groups in England, Wales, and overseas to improve catchment management. The research developed a model called SCIMAP which is now employed regularly to identify ‘hotspots’ that can supply pollutants, such as nitrate or fine sediment, into the river system; this knowledge is then used to support management and remediation decisions. Users of SCIMAP include the Environment Agency, which offers the model as part of its central modelling platform; all of the 46 Rivers Trusts that bring together stakeholders in every major catchment in England and Wales; partners in the Catchment\-Based Approach \(CaBA\) that provides a framework for modelling and managing all 100\+ catchments in England and eastern Wales under the Water Framework Directive; and a diverse group of NGOs and companies with an interest in assessing and managing diffuse pollution.

 A new approach to modelling catchment processes based on the analysis of water flow pathways was developed at Durham University in a 2005\-2009 NERC knowledge exchange grant to Durham and Lancaster Universities, led by PI Professor Stuart Lane \(Durham\), and with co\-funding from Defra, the Environment Agency, and the Eden Rivers Trust. Subsequent development of the approach by Durham has involved the active participation of regulatory agencies and other stakeholders in the customisation and application of models within a number of projects from 2008 to present, funded by the Environment Agency, the Ribble Rivers Trust, the EU, and other sources. 

  

 The NERC knowledge exchange grant developed a software package called SCIMAP, which is short for Sensitive Catchment Integrated Modelling And Prediction. The approach utilises digital elevation models, land cover maps, hydrological theory, and GIS analysis to map the relative risk of generating a ‘problem’ \(e.g., rapid runoff, fine sediment, nutrients, or coarse sediment\) at each cell within a raster\-based representation of a landscape, and the likelihood of that ‘problem’ connecting to a particular river or lake. These ‘problems’ are then routed along their individual flow paths into and along the stream network, taking into account disconnections and dilution effects, to predict which parts of the network are most at risk. This is scientifically novel in three ways: 

-  It treats both source risk levels and rapid\-flow connectivity as spatially variable over short distances \(down to as little as 0.4m\), whereas most previous work operated at resolutions of order 1km and either ignored connectivity or treated it in a very simplified way; 

-  It aims to identify critical source locations of pollution, rather than precisely predicting a particular water quality parameter at a vulnerable downstream location; and 

-  It can predict the effects of interventions at key source areas or transmission points. 

 SCIMAP is distinct from other ways of modelling connectivity and pollution by emphasising relative risk, based on sources and network structure, rather than absolute measures of pollutant concentration. This makes the software computationally efficient and maximises its flexibility, so that the outputs can be combined with many other catchment\-scale data sets. The re\-conceptualisation of the problem \(reference **R1**\) draws strongly on a sophisticated minimum\-information requirement framework for describing hydrological connectivity \( **R2**\). The approach allows identification of key transmission routes or pollutant source areas, and enables spatial targeting of mitigation actions in the landscape to derive maximum benefit from limited funds. The approach is also not limited to a single pollutant type, and SCIMAP\-based tools have been developed and used to track coarse sediment \( **R3**\), fine sediment \( **R4**\), nutrients and elements of in\-stream ecology \( **R2**, **R5**\), and microbial pollution \( **R6**\). 

 A second major innovation in the research is the close involvement of stakeholders during all stages of the model development and application process. Stakeholders were initially involved in determining questions and specifying outputs in SCIMAP, but subsequently also suggested and evaluated alternative action plans. In the EU\-funded Adaptive Land Use for Flood Alleviation project \(PI Lane, then Reaney\), the project team worked closely with the Eden Rivers Trust to reduce flood risk with minimal impact on agricultural productivity, thus obtaining acceptance by farmers. This engagement formed the pathway to much of the impact described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The use of SCIMAP is transforming practice by a wide range of stakeholders at the interface between catchment science and management. This impact stems directly from the emphasis in the underpinning research on rapid estimation of relative risk at scales that are directly relevant to stakeholders. Rather than generating a single ‘solution’ or trying to account for all aspects of catchment management, SCIMAP instead provides a flexible, accessible way of visualising the problem. Thus, the usefulness of SCIMAP has been primarily in providing evidence and fostering engagement and conversation between regulators \(such as the Environment Agency\), landowners \(including both individuals and institutions like the National Trust\), knowledge intermediaries \(such as the Rivers Trusts\), and tenants and land users. 

 Impacts arising from the use of SCIMAP for catchment management were submitted by Durham University as an impact case study for REF2014. Here, we claim only those impacts from the use of SCIMAP that go beyond those original impacts, and that have arisen since 1 August 2013. These impacts can be divided into three main thematic uses of the software, which we describe in turn below. 

####  Theme 1: Providing evidence of existing issues 

 SCIMAP has been widely used to provide evidence of diffuse pollution issues that can build consensus among stakeholders and to target specific interventions. This impact has primarily been realised through Rivers Trusts \(RTs\), which are charitable organisations that make practical, evidence\-based catchment improvements and serve as key knowledge intermediaries between landowners, regulators, and river users across the UK \(evidence source **E1**, 12:15 to 12:42\). The initial impact of SCIMAP during the REF2014 period was on ten of the larger and more technically able RTs, primarily the Eden, Yorkshire Dales, and Westcountry RTs. Within the REF2021 period, however, SCIMAP has become a standard tool for catchment management across all 46 RTs in England and Wales \( **E1**, 00:16 to 01:41\). This expansion has coincided with growth in both the importance and capacity of the RTs and an increasing emphasis on their use of scientific evidence for decision making. As summarised by a senior specialist in GIS and data management at the Rivers Trust parent organisation, 

 *‘…SCIMAP has been integral to the growth of the use of data and evidence in catchment planning… We also increasingly take a whole catchment view and plan where we’re going to work based on priorities. So it’s about prioritising fieldwork… But it \[SCIMAP\] helps you decide where you go and do that fieldwork and where you put the measures.’* \( **E1**, 00:48 to 00:56 and 03:21 to 03:40\) 

 Similarly, a senior manager of the Ribble RT argued that 

 *‘from early days it’s been helping us to focus where we want to work and then expanding that to then saying … “this catchment has a significant risk score so we want to focus our work in this catchment” and then drilling down and then actually sharing that information with the farmer. And that evidence. And demonstrating to all that we are evidence\-led… And I think other Rivers Trusts need and are moving towards more that way.’* \( **E2**, 04:13 to 05:00\) 

 SCIMAP has also become a key modelling tool within the Catchment Partnerships in all 100\+ catchments across England and cross\-border with Wales as part of Defra’s Catchment\-Based Approach \(CaBA\) programme, which began in May 2013. CaBA is an innovative framework for collaborative catchment management and improvement that directly supports delivery of the Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan and includes more than 1,500 organisations. The CaBA programme advocates the use of SCIMAP as a risk modelling tool in preparing a catchment management plan \( **E3**\) and provides case studies of how SCIMAP can be used, for example to support and inform farm advice visits \( **E4**\). 

####  Theme 2: Risk assessment 

 A second major area of impact has been via the use of SCIMAP to assess erosion and diffuse pollution risks at both the whole\-catchment and farm\-specific scales. For example, the National Trust is using SCIMAP to identify erosion risk and fine sediment connectivity across all 41 catchments in its northern region, and to produce catchment management plans for circa 10 catchments nationwide as part of the Riverlands project. The National Trust is the largest private landowner in the UK, with holdings of 250,000 hectares \(ha\). SCIMAP provides detailed evidence of erosion potential, enabling immediate mitigation actions such as tree planting or closing areas to the public – for example, across 30 National Trust properties in the Lake District after Storm Desmond in 2015 \( **E5**, 05:55 to 07:28 and 11:49 to 13:46\). It is also used to facilitate discussions with tenants, in order to achieve the Trust’s goals of linking land and water management and ensuring that water leaving Trust land is better quality than when it enters. As stated by a senior land manager at the National Trust, 

 *‘SCIMAP is proving quite useful to those property teams. It’s picking up erosion risk, it’s picking up surface connectivity and it’s also picking up fine sediment… As a practical tool, SCIMAP has been absolutely brilliant in terms of the fact that it’s so easy for property staff, the operational staff… at our properties to \(a\) get hold of and \(b\) then… evaluate their own properties against it with their own knowledge.’* \( **E5**, 06:49 to 07:04 and 19:21 to 19:51\) 

 Similarly, SCIMAP is available on the Environment Agency central modelling platform for use by land\-use modelling specialists across all 26 administrative areas in England and Wales. SCIMAP is the only software tool on the platform for tracking both sources and connectivity of diffuse pollution and fine sediment in river networks. A senior specialist in agricultural risk and evaluation at the Environment Agency argues that 

 *‘…a lot of the tools I was familiar with much more standard, you know, water quality models which I didn’t think were appropriate for an agricultural programme like CSF \[Catchment Sensitive Farming\]… Once you know there is a problem ... then it’s very much about what you then do about it. And it’s a very good tool for testing those things out.’* \( **E6**, 01:10 to 04:04\) 

 Natural England has used SCIMAP to improve the management of freshwater Natura 2000 sites within England. The Natura 2000 network covers valuable and threatened habitats across Europe, and England has 338 Natura 2000 sites that cover more than 2,000,000 ha. Before the REF2021 period, Natural England carried out the first national strategic prioritisation exercise of the whole Natura 2000 network, published in May 2013, and importantly identified the need for evidence of improvements that could result from various interventions. During the REF2021 period, SCIMAP was used between October 2014 and May 2015 to create a Diffuse Water Pollution Plan and Action Plan for every freshwater site \(see, for example, **E7**\), and is the only model that provides risk maps that cover both pollution sources and connectivity. The Westcountry RT was commissioned by Natural England to model fine sediment erosion risk in the 31 catchments that cover all the Natura 2000 sites. That study found that 

 *‘erosion risk and in\-channel concentration risk maps generated \[by SCIMAP\] … provide an invaluable component of evidence to support the on\-going development of the Diffuse Water Pollution Action Plans.’* \( **E8**\) 

 As an example of SCIMAP impact on a commercial firm and across different national contexts, Environment Systems Ltd. is using SCIMAP to map environmental pressures and provide evidence to decision\-makers at the national scale in Wales, St Helena, and the Caribbean British Overseas Territories \( **E5**, 25:27 to 33:09, 33:10 to 38:19, and 38:20 to 50:11\). In Wales, Environment Systems Ltd. has used SCIMAP to produce reports for the Welsh Government on risks and opportunities around the sustainable management of natural resources. These reports, known as Area Statements, are mandated by the Environment \(Wales\) Act 2016 and underpin the National Development Framework, the national\-scale strategic development plan for Wales for 2020\-2040. SCIMAP outputs provide evidence of flood and erosion risk in three of the six priority areas \(natural flood management, water quality, and food\). In St Helena, SCIMAP estimates of the spatial pattern of erosion risk have been provided to the Government of St Helena, along with opportunities for erosion risk management by replanting native vegetation. In the Caribbean, Environment Systems Ltd. has used SCIMAP to assess erosion risk before and after recent hurricanes, to identify the sources of damaging inland flooding, and to recommend mitigation measures for key infrastructure to the governments of Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands. As stated by a senior director of Environment Systems Ltd., 

 *‘SCIMAP is great because it’s one of those things that you can put a map of the erosion risk and people get it. The policy\-makers understand it, and they can see immediately that that’s giving them evidence that they can go and take to developers and other people to help with their land use policies.’* \( **E5**, 21:44 to 22:04\) 

####  Theme 3: Enabling communication and engagement 

 The final way in which SCIMAP has had impact is by enabling communication and engagement in land use and water quality issues across a wide range of different stakeholder groups. This has developed in diverse ways across the RTs: for example, visits by the Wye and Usk RT farm advisors to discuss issues and specific advice plans with farmers \( **E1**, 15:37 to 17:46\), conversations between the Trent RT and a major landowner around river management \( **E1**, 25:22 to 26:26\), discussion between the Ribble RT and Hyndburn Borough Council to identify sites for woodland planting to maximise the benefit of investment \( **E5**, 53:11 to 54:05\), and collaboration between the Westcountry RT and South West Water to identify sites for flood management \( **E5**, 1:12:30 to 1:14:00\). The senior specialist at the Environment Agency argues that 

 *‘SCIMAP is a really good way of breaking down barriers. It’s a fantastic way to start a dialogue… You’re taking what… can be quite complex hydrological processes and presenting it in a very graphical and easy to understand way.’* \( **E6**, 06:12 to 07:01\) 

 Similarly, the senior manager at the Ribble RT found that 15\-20% of farmers engaged by the RT had asked for SCIMAP products: 

 *‘The \[SCIMAP\] outputs could be shown to farmers to show them that we have evidence that there are high risk areas of pollution and then we could ground truth that alongside them… And we were able to work with some of them constructively to implement change.’* \( **E2**, 00:46 to 01:25\) 

 Critically, SCIMAP provides a platform for integrating that engagement, so that RTs can engage with farmers once through dedicated farm advisors, rather than through multiple visits by different project officers and specialists who are concerned with separate aspects of the catchment \( **E2**, 07:14 to 09:50\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof. Kirk’s research on western flower thrips and glasshouse whiteflies has provided commercial growers of vegetable, fruit and flower crops with an effective non\-insecticide solution to the control of these major worldwide pests. Prof. Kirk’s group discovered that addition of pheromones and changes in trap appearance can increase trap catches of thrips and whiteflies. Bioline AgroSciences, Biobest Group and Russell IPM have used these significant findings to develop and sell innovative traps that reduce crop loss worldwide. These traps reduce the need for insecticides, thus reducing the risk of pesticide residues and the associated harms to the environment.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the past 25 years, the world\-leading Centre for Applied Entomology and Parasitology \(CAEP\) at Keele University has conducted research into the biology of agriculturally important insect pests that threaten food security and sustainability. CAEP has particularly focused on thrips and whiteflies, which are major pests of a wide range of crops worldwide, causing an estimated £20 billion of damage per year. The resistance of these pests to current insecticides and the growing consumer demand for chemical\-free fruit and vegetables, mean that new control methods are needed urgently to protect the world’s crops and fulfil market demand. Within CAEP, the Thrips Research Group at Keele \(Prof. William Kirk, Prof. Gordon Hamilton and Dr Clare Sampson\) has discovered new ways to increase trap catches, thus reducing pest numbers in a sustainable way and reducing the need for insecticide treatments. 

 The western flower thrips \( *Frankliniella occidentalis*\) is the most damaging species of thrips worldwide, causing feeding damage and transmitting plant diseases. In 2001, Prof. Kirk and Prof. Hamilton studied this species to discover the first aggregation pheromone in thrips \( **3.1, 3.2**\). Following this breakthrough, they identified the pheromone compounds by headspace analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. They then synthesised the pheromone and tested it in field trials in commercial greenhouses in Spain in 2004 \( **3.3**\). These trials showed that the pheromone doubled the trap catch of both males and females when added to blue or yellow sticky traps, which are already highly attractive and used commercially to monitor thrips \( **3.3**\). Further research from 2006\-2014 identified the aggregation pheromone of the melon thrips \( *Thrips palmi*\), which is an invasive pest of many crops \( **3.5**\), and research from 2014\-2019 identified the aggregation pheromone of the bean flower thrips \( *Megalurothrips sjostedti*\), which is a major pest of legume crops in sub\-Saharan Africa. 

 Field trials with the aggregation pheromone of the western flower thrips in UK strawberry crops by Dr Sampson and Prof. Kirk from 2011\-2014 developed the traps and showed that mass trapping with pheromone traps reduced pest numbers by 73%, damage by 68% and was cost\-effective for growers when used as part of an integrated pest management programme \( **3.4**\). This result was a breakthrough because mass trapping in this way was considered by many to be ineffective against abundant pests such as thrips. This research allowed Russell IPM Ltd to incorporate the pheromone in traps as a product for growers. In addition to attracting flying thrips and thus increasing trap catch, the research group showed that exposure to aggregation pheromone makes thrips more active, bringing them out of hiding places on plants, which can increase the efficacy of insecticides or biological agents. 

 From 2014\-2016, Dr Sampson, Prof. Kirk and Prof. Hamilton carried out research with Russell IPM Ltd. They developed the use of geometrical patterns on traps \(white on blue for thrips and black on yellow for whiteflies\) to double trap catches \( **3.6**\) and then went on to show that subtle changes in the shade of yellow traps, according to the relative proportions of wavelengths above and below 500 nm, rather than the absolute amounts, could also double the trap catch of whiteflies \( **3.6**\), leading to a range of new products. Trap technology for whiteflies has been unchanged for decades, so these advances in colour and pattern are major breakthroughs.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The work on thrips pheromones, trap patterns and trap colours by CAEP’s Thrips Research Group has been applied to a range of products used to control thrips and whiteflies in crops around the world. The impact of this research has reached across a range of geographical scales, from local to global, by enabling a UK\-based manufacturer to grow its business, as well as being part of the solution to securing food crops in developing countries and reducing pesticide use. 

 **Product Innovation and Business Growth** 

 The western flower thrips pheromone that Keele discovered in 2001 \( **3.1**, **3.2**\) is currently used in at least 10 different commercial products sold by Bioline AgroSciences \(formerly Syngenta Bioline\), Biobest Group and Russell IPM \( **5.1**\). In particular, the application of this research has enabled Russell IPM, an SME based in the UK, to expand their products and increase their turnover by more than £6 million from 2013 to 2018, doubling profit in that period \( **5.2**, **5.3**\). A significant proportion of the increase in turnover was due to the success of insect traps developed from CAEP research, with over 200,000 of the traps sold in 2017, most of which were exported to Europe, America, Asia, Africa and Australasia \( **5.3**\). For example, as a result of Keele’s research for a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\), sales of board traps alone increased from £0.5 million to £1 million between 2014 and 2016. The company has been able to increase market share and expand by employing 16 new staff in 2018 \( **5.2**\). 

 The most successful new product, *Optiroll Super Plus*, a sticky trap for thrips, incorporated Keele’s thrips pheromone and was developed further through Keele’s KTP. The Russell IPM team with Keele scientists carried out multiple field trials to identify the most attractive pattern \( **5.1**, **5.4**\). Following this, testing in various crops across the globe, in South America, Africa and the UK, proved the effectiveness of the trap against thrips \( **5.4**\). 

 The *Optiroll Super Plus* trap has been found to offer effective protection against thrips in UK strawberry crops, resulting in 73% less fruit damage and a reduction of thrips on the crop by 53\-87%, when used as part of an integrated pest management programme \( **5.5**\) and was also effective in strawberry crops in Mexico, reducing infestation levels by 50% \( **5.6**\). When using *Optiroll*, strawberry growers’ returns in the UK increased by an estimated £2,000 per hectare, as a result of reduced fruit damage \( **5.5**\). These pheromone traps are being used increasingly by commercial flower growers in Kenya. At an integrated thrips management workshop near Nairobi in 2019, 31% of participants had used thrips pheromones and 65% were considering using them \(66 participants in total\) \( **5.7**\). In 2016, the *Optiroll Super Plus* trap won an Innovation Award at an agricultural expo \(expoDirekt and expoSE\) in Karlsruhe, Germany, which is an international annual event with up to 500 exhibitors and over 6000 visitors \( **5.8**\). In 2018, Russell IPM was awarded the Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation for the *Optiroll Super Plus* trap for western flower thrips, developed with Keele University \( **5.9**\) **.** 

 **Sustainable farming: reducing pesticide use** 

 Growers faced with damaging western flower thrips have had little choice but to turn to chemical pesticides to save the crop, however, populations of western flower thrips throughout the world have become resistant to commonly used pesticides, such as spinosad. The *Optiroll Super Plus* trap and other traps with patterns and improved colours developed by Keele offer an effective alternative to pesticides when used as part of a sustainable integrated pest management programme. For example, in Ecuador a field trial of the *Optiroll Super Plus* trap showed that the capture rate of the trap was high enough to significantly suppress thrips populations when compared to conventional chemical applications \( **5.4**\). The commercial availability of these traps has allowed farmers from across the globe to use less pesticide. In the UK, strawberry farmers using the traps have changed from routine applications of pesticide to just one or two applications in a six\-month season \( **5.5**\); and in Nairobi, Kenya, Evergreen Crops Limited, which grows herbs for export to Europe, now use two initial sprays instead of five, reducing their insecticide use by 15\-20% \( **5.10**\). Strawberry growers in Mexico reported that the traps gave adequate control of western flower thrips without the need for insecticides \( **5.6**\). Collectively, this reduces pesticide residues in fruit and the environment, to the benefit of wildlife and consumers.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The private sector provides approximately 40% of health services in low\- and middle\-income countries \(LMICs\) and is central to international strategies for advancing universal health coverage. Hellowell’s research highlights the key governance challenges related to the private health sector and has supported efforts by leading global health agencies to enhance capacity for effective reforms. This has been achieved by: 

1.  Stimulating policy change in the World Bank by increasing awareness of structural problems of public\-private partnerships in African LMICs, in collaboration with Oxfam. 

1.  Collaborating with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the World Bank, and the Global Finance Facility to ensure that efforts to strengthen governance in LMICs are ‘fit\-for\-context’, and to build local state capacity via tailored training programmes and technical assistance. 

1.  Shaping the development of the World Health Organization’s strategy for engaging the private health sector in LMIC health system responses to the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

  
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The private sector provides approximately 40% of health services in low\- and middle\-income countries \(LMICs\), yet governance of the sector is inadequate in most countries. The result is that health services are less accessible, less safe and less effective than they could be. There is increasing recognition that these failings have undermined progress towards critical global health goals \- such as achieving universal health coverage \(UHC\), tackling anti\-microbial resistance, and building emergency preparedness and response capacities in LMICs. Hellowell’s research has focused on how governance of the private health sector can be enhanced to address these barriers to progress. 

1.  Hellowell’s research on the private health sector initially focused on public/ private sector engagement mechanisms in high\-income countries, demonstrating the financial pressures created by certain forms of public\-private partnership \(PPP\), and the consequences for health systems and population health outcomes \(3.1\). Subsequently, Hellowell adapted this approach when, as a consultant to the World Bank, he evaluated a high\-profile PPP in Maseru, capital of Lesotho. Under this PPP, a multinational corporation had been contracted by the Government of Lesotho to finance and build a new tertiary hospital and a network of primary care clinics, and to manage all clinical services within these facilities for a period of 15 years \(3.2\). This research found that the limited capacity of the government to plan, manage and pay for the contract had exposed it to significant fiscal costs and systemic risks, undermining its ability to plan for and address key population health objectives, including tackling the country’s high HIV/AIDS burden. 

1.  Building on this \- and related evaluations of similarly problematic attempts to establish new public\-private engagement mechanisms \- Hellowell’s work has focused on achieving better understanding of how LMICs and donors can support more ‘fit\-for\-context’ reforms. This has included both *empirical research* \(e.g. comprehensive mapping of the activities and approaches taken by development partners with regard to public\-private engagement\) \(3.3\), and *co\-produced action research* \(e.g. establishing critical principles of effective approaches to public\-private sector engagement, in collaboration with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \(FCDO\), World Bank and the Global Financing Facility \(GFF\)\). This latter form of research \- incorporating interviews with LMIC government officials, industry executives and representative bodies, NGO and INGO staff, and development partners and experts within the World Health Organization \(WHO\) \- has been undertaken on market systems approaches in health \(3.4\). 

1.  During the COVID\-19 pandemic, questions concerning the governance of commercial health sector actors have become even more pressing. Hellowell has undertaken research, again in collaboration with the WHO, based on document analyses and interviews with LMIC state officials, donors, and UN officials, alongside an \(ongoing\) Delphi consultation process. This has shown how inadequate governance is undermining responses to the pandemic, compromising access to essential health services, and is thereby highlighting the need for enhanced arrangements for effective coordination and oversight across health systems, public and private \(3.5\). Hellowell’s research across these areas has been foundational for the development of new joint WHO/ World Bank guidance on contracting with the private sector during the COVID\-19 pandemic, on which he is the lead author, alongside WHO and World Bank colleagues \(see 5.9 below\).

 4. Details of the impact 

 Promoting more effective private sector governance is central to international strategies to advance UHC in LMICs. Hellowell’s research has highlighted key governance challenges related to the private health sector and has supported efforts by leading global health agencies to enhance state capacity for effective reforms, stimulating policy change within the World Bank; enhancing state capacity for effective governance; and shaping the WHO strategy for engaging with private health sector to respond to the COVID\-19 crisis in LMICs. 

 Collaborating with Oxfam to stimulate policy change within the World Bank 

 Hellowell’s research into a highly significant PPP in Lesotho \(3.2\) was commissioned by the World Bank and was shared with Oxfam by Bank officials. This research provided a cost\-benefit analysis of the PPP, focusing on the damage to financial and clinical outcomes from it, and how these reflected limitations in the state’s capacities to procure, monitor and pay for the contract. Oxfam used the analytical framework outlined in this research, and key elements of the data generated by it, as the foundation for its own report, *A Dangerous Diversion* \(5.1\). The Oxfam report emphasised findings concerning the high costs to government generated by the PPP, and the impacts of these on the government’s ability to address population health care need. The Oxfam report led to significant global coverage of the issue \(5.2\) generating a response from the World Bank’s then President Jim Kim. Jim Kim acknowledged the importance of the research, stating in a televised interview that he was “ *looking into the \[Lesotho PPP\] project very carefully*” and acknowledging that this case exposed “ *a much, much bigger problem*” with regard to public\-private sector relations in health systems, especially with regard to LMICs \(5.3\). 

 According to the Health Policy Advisor, Oxfam GB, *“The framework and data from Hellowell’s research enabled Oxfam to demonstrate to the World Bank how its ‘flagship’ PPP was swallowing over half the country’s health budget and diverting urgently needed resources from the rest of the health system. The strength of the case was such that former President of the World Bank Jim Kim had little choice but to respond with a recognition that action was needed to mitigate the effects of the PPP in Lesotho. This led to a high level World Bank delegation to review the PPP with a resulting report that recommended several actions taken to try to reduce the risks of the PPP to the Lesotho government. We are also aware that this intervention helped to ‘change the dialogue’ with regard to the use of PPPs in general, both within the Bank and among its LMIC clients.”* \(5.1\). 

 Building state capacity for effective governance: Training and technical support 

 Despite the critical nature of this part of Hellowell’s research, it provided the basis of a sustained collaboration with the World Bank – one of the key ‘agenda\-setting’ agencies in global health. The extent of collaboration has been particularly substantive with the Global Financing Facility \(GFF\), an initiative established and staffed by the World Bank, and focused on supporting integrated approaches to health systems strengthening in the areas of reproductive, maternal, child and adolescent health and nutrition. The World Bank/ GFF has twice commissioned a team led by Hellowell to develop and deliver training in, and technical assistance relating to, governance of the private health sector for LMIC government clients in Africa and Asia. Initially, in 2015, this course was taught on a face\-to\-face basis to cohorts of senior officials \- from the World Bank Group, the then Department for International Development, and country\-level government staff from South Asia and East Africa. This was followed by a course held in Dakar, Senegal in April 2018 for 26 policymakers from eight prioritised LMIC country teams invited by the GFF \(5.4, pp. 5\-6\). 

 To maximize the impact of this programme, Hellowell worked with World Bank/GFF colleagues in 2019\-20 to co\-produce a ‘massive open online course’ \(financed by the FCDO\). In 2018 the course was delivered to a cohort of 461 learners from over 40 countries, mostly from Africa and South East Asia; participants were largely officials drawn from donors and partner organisations, from civil society organisations, and developing country policymakers \(5.4, pp. 8\-9\). Course evaluation indicated striking increases in perceived capacity for effective health governance. The proportion of participants who agreed or strongly agreed that they had the skills to identify promising health markets in which to intervene to improve health outcomes, rose from 29% at baseline to 88% at the end of the course. Those expressing confidence in their ability to design a package of policy tools to address issues in market actors’ behaviour similarly rose from 21% to 80% \(5.4, pp.13, 29\-30\). 

 Hellowell subsequently worked with the GFF team to provide coaching to a group of eight country teams, seven based in sub\-Saharan Africa \(Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoir, Indonesia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia\), and one in south Asia \(Myanmar\) – a total of 70 learners. The coaching programme was delivered by a team led by Hellowell, who also led the development of the course handbook \(5.5\). Following the most recent iteration of the course, three of the participating governments made requests for further technical assistance in developing their approach to regulating the private sector. According to a Senior Economist at the GFF, *“Hellowell’s research … has encouraged the global health policy community to reconceptualise what effective public\-private engagement ‘looks like’ in health systems striving to reach UHC. This has had a significant impact on our approaches to investment and technical assistance in countries – shifting the focus from specific tools and transactions to the development of state capacity to extend its reach across health systems, public and private”* \(5.6\). 

 Engaging with WHO to support the governance of pandemic responses in LMICs 

 The longstanding challenges addressed by Hellowell’s research assumed new significance in the COVID\-19 era. In 2020, Hellowell has worked with colleagues in WHO’s Health Systems Financing and Governance division to examine the challenges in private health sector governance highlighted by the pandemic, and how they might be addressed. This has included key contributions to the work of the Advisory Group on the Governance of the Private Sector for UHC, a WHO advisory body formed to develop recommendations on the regulation of and engagement with the private sector in the context of advancing UHC. This collaborative work has included rapidly identifying and evaluating key challenges for LMICs in achieving effective oversight of the private health sector during the pandemic \(5.7\), and evaluating interventions available to governments, donors and the WHO for addressing identified challenges \(3.3\). This work has been critical to the development of new WHO guidance to governments on contracting the private sector to address COVID\-19\-related healthcare demand while sustaining access to other essential health services, co\-authored by Hellowell \(5.8\). For the first time, this is providing a cohesive basis on which the WHO will be able to advise countries on establishing effective strategies towards the private health sector – both during the current crisis and thereafter. 

 According to the private sector lead for the WHO’s Health Systems Financing and Governance division, “ *In the context of the pandemic, Hellowell’s research and expertise have been drawn on to define key challenges for LMICs in achieving effective oversight of the private sector, and to evaluate the set of interventions available to governments, development partners and the WHO for addressing these challenges. The research has also provided a conceptual foundation for the development of new WHO/World Bank guidance on contracting the private sector during the COVID\-19 crisis. This guidance … will provide invaluable support to governments that are aiming to mitigate the health effects of the pandemic while sustaining access to essential health services.*” \(5.9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Childhood is changing: 300 years ago, 5% of children grew up in cities, compared to 50% today. UEL’s BabyDev Group has pioneered new methods to uncover how changing modern living environments affect early cognitive and emotional development. The research has had wide\-ranging impact across the public and commercial sectors – including: i\) direct impact on local councils’ Early Years provision within the UK, ii\) contribution to governmental campaigns from Public Health England and the Department of Education, iii\) involvement in high\-impact television and other media work and iv\) projects with commercial organisations, including shopping centre and hotel design.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The BabyDev group at UEL is located in the London Borough of Newham, in one of the most demographically mixed and socioeconomically challenged areas of the UK. Children growing up in the catchment area experience an exceptionally wide range of different types of early life environment.  The research investigates how these diverse home environments affect early development. 

  

 The BabyDev group, led by Wass, has been awarded a number of large\-scale grants over the past 6 years, including from the Nuffield Foundation, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, a Marie Curie Fellowship and a €1.5 million European Research Council Starter Grant. These projects have been developed in consultation with local council authorities and Children’s Centres in Newham. The group also has funded collaborations with other researchers in the UK \(London \(Institute of Psychiatry, Birkbeck\), Cambridge, Belfast\) and internationally \(Belgium, Germany, Austria, Finland, Israel, US, Canada, Chile\). Through these, they have pioneered new methodologies for understanding how the early home environment affects children’s development. These include, for example, wireless miniaturised wearable microphones, cameras and physiological stress monitors that can be worn by babies and parents at home, and dual neuroimaging to observe early parent\-child interactions. Using these, they can examine for the first time how changing levels of noise and chaos in the home environment can immediately impact on children’s physiological stress, concentration, and social engagement. 

  

 In two recent papers \( **R1**, **R2**\) they showed that, even by 12 months of age, children growing up in physically noisier home environments have higher physiological stress, affecting both their cognitive performance and their emotional responsiveness. Importantly, these differences were not all indicative of poor development: While they were more highly stressed, urban children showed lower sustained attention and greater emotional instability, they showed faster learning speeds in some contexts. This research offers the first mechanistic evidence for how the early living environment can affect multiple different types of problem – e.g. impaired academic performance and adverse mental health outcomes. But it also offers new insights for clinicians, educationalists and parents into maximising learning potential for more highly stressed ‘city kids’. The research examines differential susceptibility: how, and why, some children may be particularly vulnerable to the effect of noisy, cramped environments, and what can be done to protect these children. 

  

 Other papers \( **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\) have pioneered new techniques such as dual parent\-child neuroimaging to examine ‘stress contagion’: how stress and anxiety is shared between adults and children both at home and at school. As well as typical development, atypical parent\-child dyads, where the adult has clinical anxiety or depression, were investigated. This research has widespread relevance both for identifying high\-risk parent\-child dyads, and developing new intervention techniques to minimise long\-term harm.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Informing government policy** 

 Wass has been involved in multiple recent government public initiatives targeting early development – such as two recent Department of Education campaigns to raise parent awareness about the importance of getting children back to school post COVID\-19, for which he acted as official spokesperson. He also contributed to a recent Start4Life campaign on behalf of Public Health England \( **S1**\). 

 **Changing practice in the early years educational sector** 

 Wass has presented his research findings to over 50,000 Early Years practitioners, including the head teachers of over 2,000 primary schools and nurseries, through interactive keynote presentations and workshops that Wass has given at early years conferences such as: The National Day Nurseries Association; National Childminder Conference; Barnardo’s children’s charity; Together for Children; International Association of Prep Schools; and Early Excellence Annual National Meeting \( **S2**\). He has also presented at over 40 local Councils or Academy Trusts around the UK.  His research was published in articles in the Times Educational Supplement \( **S3**\), Early Years Educator, Nursery World, the Chartered College of Teaching and many others. 

 These presentations have led to fundamental change in practitioners’ understanding of how noisy and chaotic environments influence children’s learning \( **S4**\). In particular, practitioners are learning to reduce auditory and visual noise in teaching environments wherever possible – so that the types of ‘stress reduction’ techniques that have been introduced into Special Needs schools over the past 10\-20 years are, increasingly being introduced in mainstream settings, too. As a result of this research, a number of councils have also introduced steps to identify children who are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of noisy environments, and to alter their teaching practice to reflect this. 

 **Raising awareness and creating debate among public audiences** 

 Regularly, including during the recent Covid\-19 pandemic, Wass has appeared as expert commentator on national TV networks \(e.g., BBC Breakfast, ITV This Morning, Sky Sunrise, the Victoria Derbyshire show\), radio stations \(BBC Radio 2/3/4/5 Live, Heart, Capital Radio, Kiss FM\) and newspapers \( **S5**\). These appearances have raised awareness for parents about how their children are affected by stress and anxiety. The research also featured in a recent 2019 TEDx talk which amassed 62,000 views \( **S6**\). 

 From 2013 to 2018 Wass was involved in the Channel 4 series The Secret Life of 4 and 5\-Years Olds \( **S7**\). Wass contributed heavily to the development of the show, which involved him and other scientists observing and commenting live on children’s interactions. The UK show reached over 5 million people and the format has been remade in over 10 countries, including the United States and China. The show received backing from the Wellcome Trust and widespread praise for its innovative approach to making scientific findings about child development accessible to parents at home. It received a Broadcast award and was twice nominated for a BAFTA. 

 **Providing information resources for commercial campaigns** 

 The child directed commercial sector has engaged extensively with Wass’ research. For example, he was heavily involved in a project with Thomas Cook, contributing to the design of the leisure facilities at their holiday resorts. He also worked with New River, who own 35 shopping centres around the UK, to raise awareness of how shopping centres can be stressful and over\-stimulating environments for children, and to introduce steps to make the shopping centres more accommodating to children and adults vulnerable to over\-stimulation \( **S8**\). 

 He contributed to work with Center Parcs based on his research into the importance of shared parent\-child engagement during leisure time and acted as a child development expert in consultancy work with other organisations including: Lego, Fisher Price, Tesco, Dulux, Ikea, Argos, Nickelodeon, the Cartoon Network and Aardman Animations. 

 **NGOs and other organisation influenced by the research** 

 Wass further raised public awareness and engagement with the findings of his research through their informing campaigns for charities such as the 2016 National Trust campaign ’50 things to do before you’re 11 ¾’, a Save the Children campaign on childhood literacy, and work for Barnados charity \( **S9**\). Dr Wass is also official scientific consultant for the new Early Years gallery in development at The Science Museum \( **S10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Wilson’s research on opera’s hidden history as popular entertainment is changing perceptions of the art form both nationally and internationally, overturning negative stereotypes that serve as a barrier to accessibility. Opera receives a largely negative press today, routinely being characterised as elitist, irrelevant and even un\-British. Wilson’s findings, disseminated to a wide general public via talks, study days, journalism, programme essays, a BBC Radio 3 documentary, and an ac\-trade book, have challenged these norms, enhancing the experience of existing audiences and making the art form more accessible to new ones. Wilson’s work has also been instrumental in bringing about change within the opera industry. Company managers, journalists, and singers have used it to respond to pressing challenges the industry faces today, from the Covid crisis to Brexit, as well as to find new and relevant ways of presenting opera to audiences in the twenty\-first century.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Wilson is internationally recognised as one of the world’s leading authorities in the field of opera reception studies. Her publications over the last two decades \(all sole\-authored\) have enhanced public understanding of the connections between operas and the pressing social, political, and aesthetic debates of their time. More recently her research has begun to focus on the question of why opera is perceived as elitist today, by scrutinising the trope’s roots. She uses historical evidence to show that the chasm between opera and popular culture is not as deep as some like to contend and has revealed a rich history of opera as popular entertainment. This has challenged established modes of thought, calling into question long\-standing and deeply ingrained assumptions about how we categorise different forms of culture. She is generating new ways of thinking that are expanding the audience reach for opera. This work has fallen into three developmental phases: 

 **Phase 1**. A body of publications on the reception of Puccini’s operas during his lifetime. This culminated in *The Puccini Problem: Opera, Nationalism, and Modernity* \(output 4\), which is now the definitive text in its field. This book demonstrated how Puccini reception became bound up with debates about Italianness, race, gender, and aesthetic identity at a vital moment of national self\-definition. Wilson is regularly consulted by arts organisations to write or comment on the relevance of Puccini’s operas to present\-day socio\-cultural challenges. 

 **Phase 2**. A body of publications on opera in 1920s Britain \(outputs 1, 2, 3\). Central to this work is Wilson’s monograph *Opera in the Jazz Age: Cultural Politics in 1920s Britain*, which examines opera’s place in the 1920s ‘battle of the brows’ and provides a vital resource for anyone interested in British identities and taste formation. The book is the first to consider this important debate about cultural categorisation \(which still has ramifications for how we talk about the arts today\) from a musical perspective. Wilson concludes that opera sat closer to the middlebrow than the highbrow, thanks to its mixed audience, close relationship with celebrity, and connections with new technologies and the mass media. 

 **Phase 3**. An emerging body of publications on opera and the elitism stereotype. Wilson first started to explore this issue in output 5, continuing in output 1. Further work is in progress: her next book, supported by a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship, will trace the development of the opera/elitism stereotype from 1920 to 2020.

-  Research\-related engagement with opera enthusiasts on Twitter \(@amwilson\_opera 4,760 followers at the time of writing\) 

-  An ac\-trade book, *Opera in the Jazz Age*, which has reached non\-specialist readers. Daniel Snowman wrote in *Opera* magazine ‘Wilson is one of those rare musicologists capable of seeing opera in its widest historical context…\[An\] impressively researched and highly entertaining book’ \(Source K\). 

 John Snelson, former Head of Interpretation and Publishing at the ROH, argues that Wilson’s work has been ‘prescient in demonstrating that the ideals of the academy can work in partnership with the public in appreciating art’ \(Source A\). Numerous opera companies in the UK and Europe have commissioned Wilson to write essays and give talks that contextualise operas in fresh and accessible ways. The reach of these has been extensive. For example, the ROH alone sold 145,000 programmes containing Wilson’s work \(equating–at GBP8 per programme–to sales for the company worth GBP1,160,000\), many of which will have reached multiple readers. The programmes have been dubbed ‘the best and most interesting of any opera house or company’, ‘essential reading’, and ‘a model of readable scholarship’, thanks to the contributions of esteemed experts such as Wilson \(Source A\). Opera North has used Wilson’s work \(18,300 programmes sold\) to make operas more relevant to modern audiences: her essays have ‘encouraged fresh ways of thinking’ about familiar operas and cut through ‘traditional assumptions’ and ‘popular prejudices’ \(Source B\). 

 The music industry and academia often exhibit distaste for ‘crowd\-pleasing’ operas, a factor that new and potential audience members find off\-putting. Wilson’s work has dispelled longstanding snobbery surrounding Puccini’s works. For the ROH, Wilson’s authoritative essays have enriched audiences’ understanding of the significance of these often\-maligned operas, their cultural contexts and their ongoing influence. Snelson calls Wilson ‘a rare leading voice in tackling the fault line of popularity and perceived cultural value’ and says her work has challenged long\-standing received wisdom about high and low culture that has ‘disproportionately dictated aesthetic values for much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in opera’ \(Source A\). It has, in effect, given audiences a licence to enjoy these works ‘guilt\-free’. 

 Although a current backlash against canonical operas by ‘dead white men’ is making life harder for opera companies, who must programme operas by popular composers such as Puccini in order to survive financially, Wilson has shown them to be works of ‘urgent contemporary relevance’ \(Source B\), by drawing parallels with present\-day debates about nationalism, corruption, race, and sexual violence. Wilson’s work has deepened and enriched audiences’ appreciation of specific works and of operatic culture in general: as audience member Chris Brown notes, it ‘changes our understanding of both past and present’ and ‘challenges us to change our understanding of the genre and not to give up the attempt to widen its appeal’ \(Source C\). 

 The ubiquitous opera/elitism trope not only deters new audiences from exploring opera but also hampers the efforts of everyone involved in performing and promoting the art form. Wilson uses historical evidence to challenge damaging stereotypes, demonstrating that in the fairly recent past people of all social backgrounds used to enjoy opera as part of a broad entertainment culture. Michael Volpe, Founder and former General Director of Opera Holland Park, now Executive Director at Iford Arts, says that Wilson has overturned established modes of thought about opera and its audience: ‘The idea that the average Joe can enjoy opera in a day\-to\-day way–that opera can be a populist art form–is often dismissed as a fantasy. But Alexandra’s book and radio programme show that it isn’t’. He adds, ‘In future when I’m asked “can opera be a more popular art form?” I shall direct the enquirer to her work’ \(Source D\). 

 Audience member Kerry Bunkhall \(Source E\) was told in her formative years by her community, including teachers, that opera was elitist. Wilson’s Radio 3 documentary and NotesOnNotes podcast enabled her to dismiss negative stereotypes that were hampering her own enjoyment and provided a user\-friendly tool with which to share her passion with others. Both Bunkhall and Brown \(Source C\) see Wilson’s work on 1920s operatic culture and the middlebrow as providing a model for how opera might be presented in less ‘luxurious’ ways in the future. A talk Wilson gave for the educational charity ‘Opera Prelude’ at the Cadogan Hall \(25/09/18\) not only enhanced attendees’ understanding of Puccini’s operas but led to their perceiving the composer as ‘more human’ \(Source F\). This event also provided a young singer with a fairly paid performance opportunity. 

 Wilson’s research has also helped opera singers to navigate a now often\-hostile cultural environment in the UK. Adriana Festeu \(Senior Lecturer at Leeds College of Music and Programme Tutor, Royal Academy of Music\), notes that Wilson’s work in changing ‘the way in which opera is perceived as an art form’ is ‘crucial in the development of the next generation of performers’. It has inspired young singers from deprived backgrounds to work actively towards bringing operatic experiences to their hometowns and fight the elitism stereotype that is still propagated in the media. Wilson’s work also encourages them to explore new repertories and has shown them how to ‘“sell” their art form’ to audiences in a fresh, informed way. Festeu writes that Wilson’s work on historical singers has even changed her own identity as a singer: ‘Being aware of opera’s historical legacy makes me feel that what I do is meaningful and part of a tradition’ \(all Source F\). 

 The elitism stereotype is largely a media construct, but Wilson’s work is changing the way journalists write about opera. Her ‘lively Twitter account’ has become a point of reference for music critics \(Sources G, H, I\). Alexandra Coghlan, who writes for *The Telegraph*, *The Independent*, *New Statesman*, *The Spectator*, *Gramophone* and *Opera*, says: ‘Wilson’s contributions on social media have definitely changed how I have approached opera as a music journalist. Her particular research focus on high/low culture and our changing attitude toward opera in the UK has shaped how I approach questions of elitism or snobbery surrounding opera. I hadn't previously realised how modern a phenomenon such divisions were, and thanks to her work on the 1920s and opera's social context then, I have a much more lively sense of comparison and context for today's environment’ \(Source H\). Critic Richard Bratby states that opera’s non\-elite history ‘is not yet widely grasped by colleagues in my field; and your work has helped bring it into the centre of the discussion’ \(Source I\). Wilson’s research has ‘successfully shifted perceptions on taste and popularity in the wider classical music world’, and broadened the range of repertories about which editors are willing to commission articles and books \(Source I\). Wilson’s work on opera’s connections with film and celebrity have altered the way in which industry figures \(Sources B and H\) and audience members \(Source C\) view opera’s cultural status. 

 The OBERTO events, which attract critics, singers, opera managers, directors and dramaturgs from around the world, as well as members of the public, have become an essential forum for addressing ‘topical issues that are highly pertinent to the operatic profession’ \(Source F\). So significant was the 2014 conference on elitism deemed to be that it was discussed in a book aimed at opera professionals, *The Business of Opera* \(ed. Belina\-Johnson and Scott, Ashgate, 2015\). The OBERTO events also influence programming: Opera Holland Park has called them ‘really useful in introducing opera professionals to unusual repertory’ \(Source D\). Furthermore, the events have not only fostered networks between industry figures but put them directly in contact with their audience, which has helped to counter pockets of snobbery within the opera industry itself. The former Head of Interpretation at the ROH states that the ‘OBERTO interactions have challenged directors and critics working within the echo chamber of the opera business to question their relationship to the wider audience upon whom they rely’ \(Source A\). Wilson’s historical work has shown companies how to market their product more effectively, by showing ‘where the art form’s enduring appeal lies and how that appeal can be rediscovered and reasserted’ \(A\). 

 John Allison, editor of *Opera* magazine, argues that the 2017 event on musical migration helped the industry to address one of the biggest challenges of the present moment, Brexit, whose impact on opera he calls ‘significant and potentially catastrophic’ \(Source G\). Because many opera professionals and journalists attended, papers presented at this event ‘have been widely cited in ongoing conversations within the operatic community’ \(G\). The study day was deemed so important that it was discussed in an *Opera* editorial and the magazine commissioned Wilson to write an extended article on the topic. The parallels Wilson has revealed between debates about cultural protectionism in the 1920s and those taking place today have helped artists, administrators and critics to navigate the challenges they face as Britain leaves the EU \(G\). Stuart Leeks of Opera North also notes the value Wilson’s public engagement work on opera and nationalism brings to bear on contemporary debates about Brexit \(Source B\), while Festeu, originally from Romania, says Wilson’s research has helped her as a singer to broach a cultural divide between different national traditions \(Source F\). 

 Both the ROH and Opera Holland Park \(Sources A and D\) note that Wilson’s work has revealed that opera companies of the 1920s were dealing with challenges concerning audience engagement and a British antipathy towards opera that still seem very familiar today. The innovative solutions that were found in the 1920s are particularly valuable in 2021 and beyond, when the opera industry finds itself at a moment of unprecedented upheaval. In 2020 Covid\-19 halted operatic activity and sent the global opera industry into a phase of deep self\-reflection. Volpe \(Source D\) argues that the economic challenges resulting from the pandemic have made it clear that the current British model of presenting opera, which revolves around an expensive ‘star system’, is no longer viable and needs to be replaced by a sustainable model of ‘popular opera’. He says that Wilson’s work on opera in 1920s Britain has suddenly come into its own, because it demonstrates that ‘a lean, economical, self\-supporting sort of opera…thrived in this country in the past and could do so again’. He proposes that Wilson’s work ‘provides a blueprint that today’s opera companies can use as they move forward into the post\-Covid era’ and urges anyone currently involved in the programming or promotion of opera to read Wilson’s work. At times of crisis, the operatic landscape in the UK always transforms itself in order to survive: Wilson’s findings have given the industry a toolkit with which to do so again. They form, Volpe argues, ‘a crucial reference point for the entire business of British opera’. 

 In sum, Wilson’s research has made multifaceted impacts upon opera goers and the opera industry, enriching audience experiences, breaking down barriers to accessibility, changing received thought, and giving opera professionals the tools with which to address a variety of challenges that the industry faces at a particularly difficult moment in its history. Its impact is ‘felt beyond its immediate focus’ \(Source C\) and as John Allison of *Opera* writes, on behalf of the opera industry as a whole: ‘\[Wilson’s\] work matters very much to us all’ \(Source G\).

Research led explorations of novel audio techniques and their applications include the use of soundscapes for curatorial purposes in art and exhibition spaces including the launch of the first UK museum dedicated to sound technologies as well as the use of sound-creation for video games and the development of online music-learning and composing tools. Music research also supported the curation and staging of several important music festivals from a variety of genres across the UK. Finally research made important contributions to music education and the use of music for therapeutic purposes.",24.11,48.54,44.24,41.23,58.18,46.1,40,18,121,45,76,10,652,240,51,3,0.0554040404040404,0.1270775941230486,0.1532634032634032,0.1517981673066419,0.031060606060606,0.1396380520663308,89

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Operational Earthquake Forecasting \(OEF\) has been mandated and implemented at a multi\-national scale to quantify, communicate and manage risk to society from natural and induced seismicity. Beneficiaries include local populations at risk; Government Agencies responsible for risk assessment, licensing and regulation; Local Authorities; Civil Protection Agencies and Emergency Responders; and Operators of hydrocarbon fields.  The New Zealand government instituted a one\-year mandatory retrofit programme for reinforced masonry in central New Zealand in the aftermath of the 2016 magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake, heavily guided by OEF information. The Dutch Government approved gas production plans at Groningen from 2016\-2018 with significant operational changes and economic impact, based on operational earthquake forecasts from the field operators. Main’s research on quantifying earthquake predictability and forecasting power under uncertainty informed the development of the protocols of OEF and its application. 

  
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Before 2000, research on earthquake predictability had centred mainly on the issue of whether reliable precursors existed, and on the possibility of deterministic prediction of the ‘time, location and magnitude of future events, within narrow limits, above chance’. Research led by Main since 2000 explored multiple aspects of earthquake predictability and forecasting in a probabilistic framework that accounts for uncertainty. The approach was developed from multiple standpoints, including stochastic modelling, statistical seismology, statistical physics, and rock physics perspectives, and informed the framing of time\-dependent operational earthquake forecasting protocols for natural and induced seismicity by direct citation in the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting \(ICEF\) report to the Department of Civil Protection in Italy published in 2011 \(see route to impact at the start of section 3\). 

 Research led by Main provided a clear theoretical framework to explain the practical difficulty of accurately predicting individual earthquakes in a near\-critical system such as Earth’s brittle lithosphere, while allowing a finite degree of low\-probability forecasts of likelihoods for a population of events **\[**e.g. **3.1\]**. This accounted for the practical difficulty of predicting individual earthquakes deterministically, while simultaneously allowing a degree of lower probability forecasting power \- above the background rate \- that is the basis for OEF. To help quantify the forecasting power in space and time, Huc & Main provided the first estimate of the evolution of the likelihood of triggered events at different epicentral distances and times between events in global earthquake data, notably the discovery of ‘anomalous’ \(non\-Gaussian\) diffusion of epicentres of triggered events in space and time **\[3.2\]**. 

 The research has also established theories and methodologies for the evaluation of earthquake hazard from both background \(considered independent\) and triggered, \(considered dependent\) seismicity \- in particular allowing for the uncertainty associated with selecting the optimal model for the frequency\-magnitude distribution **\[3.3\]**, and in separating background from triggered seismicity in epidemic\-type aftershock sequence models **\[3.4\]**. The frequency\-magnitude distribution is crucial because it controls the likelihood of rare, high\-impact, extreme events. The separation of background from triggered events is critical because the background hazard is used to develop building design codes \- the front line of defence against earthquakes in urban settings. 

 The ratio of triggered to background event rate can be used to quantify the improvement in forecasting power during seismic sequences, expressed as a probability gain over the background rate. Both rates are subject to uncertainty caused by the finite and relatively short time window for recorded earthquakes compared to the average recurrence time between large events. Greenhough & Main addressed this issue by quantifying the systematic error in applying different methods to invert for model parameters, while fully accounting for larger uncertainties in the frequency of larger and extreme events **\[3.5\]**. 

 Main & Bell also contributed to the design of laboratory experiments and interpretation of their results **\[**e.g. **3.6\]** to quantify the evolution of seismic energy release as a function of differences in strain rate in rocks undergoing brittle creep deformation, cited by the operators of the Groningen gas field in developing their operational earthquake forecasting model due to time\-dependent creep compaction in the reservoir **\[5.8\]**.

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Routes to Impact: The main route to impact was the ICEF report by Jordan et al. \(2011, doi: 10.4401/ag\-5350\), where Main was one of three principal members of the writing team, and which cites 5 of Main’s papers since 2000, including **\[3.2\]** and **\[3.3\]**. The ICEF report summarised the state of the art in OEF, and developed protocols for its application in risk assessment and communication. It prompted multi\-national developments in public policy and service provision related to earthquake risk reduction that continue to this day. Impact from the research also arises from Main’s role as external reviewer to the operators of the Groningen gas field \(NAM\) in developing their OEF model and to the Dutch Bureau of Mines \(SODM\) in regulating hydrocarbon production at Groningen, Netherlands. 

##  Impact on Practitioners and Stakeholders: 

 Italy: The Italian National Geophysical and Volcanological Institute \(INGV\) operates a live OEF system based on the principles established in the ICEF report. This provided “ *statistically reliable and skilful space\-time\-magnitude forecasts of the largest earthquakes during the complex 2016–2017 Amatrice\-Norcia sequence*” in central Italy **\[5.1\]**. The UK Government assisted the Italian Government in responding to the Norcia\-Amatrice sequence via enhanced deployment of UK seismometers one week after the sequence started, led by Margarita Segou of the BGS, with Naylor, McCloskey and Main. The UK Cabinet Office commended our “ *contribution to the UK’s positive reputation in this area*” and confirmed our “ *proactivity was very well received by both the INGV and the Italian Government”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 New Zealand: The New Zealand Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences \(GNS\) has continued to issue operational forecasts of earthquake likelihood using the protocols established by the ICEF report. This includes 5 earthquakes since 2014, notably during the magnitude \(M\) 7.8 Kaikoura sequence in 2016, which affected the Town of Kaikoura itself, and multiple towns in central New Zealand, including on the capital city of Wellington. The OEF lead of the GNS writes “ *the New Zealand government instituted a one\-year mandatory retrofit programme for reinforced masonry in central New Zealand. The details of the programme were heavily guided by OEF information and the government contributed up to 50% of the retrofit cost.*” **\[5.3\]**. OEF has been used in New Zealand for: \(i\) Health and safety assessments for Urban Search and Rescue staff involved in the short\-term emergency response; \(ii\) Assessing the timing and suitability of resettlement or relocation by the Civil Protection agency; \(iii\) Assessing and managing the financial impact including adjustment of insurance premiums based on anticipated losses \(independently estimated at USD705,000,000 \- USD3,500,000,000 in the case of the Kaikoura sequence\); \(iv\) Recovery planning, through mandatory retrofitting of vulnerable buildings, and changes in land use planning and building design codes by Local and National Authorities; \(v\) Public information throughout the sequence. OEF has also been used to guide timeline decisions for large infrastructure projects, and private companies have used OEF for decisions about planning repair of earthquake damage and for cost\-benefit analysis for on\-going decision making during recovery time. **\[5.3\].** 

 United States **:** The US Geological Survey \(USGS\) developed a system that forecasts the probabilities and numbers of aftershocks of different sizes following domestic earthquakes, and applied it during the aftershock sequence of the 2018 Anchorage M7.1 earthquake, the 2019 M6.4\-M7.1 Ridgecrest sequence and the 2019\-2020 Puerto Rico sequence. There has been wide recognition of OEF by the public, government, media, FEMA \(the US Department of Homeland Security \- Federal Emergency Management Agency\), and others, especially during the Puerto Rico sequence in December 2019. Responding to widespread demands for forecast information, the USGS created a plain\-language document that placed the forecast in terms of ‘scenarios’, plus an analysis to estimate the likely duration of the sequence, published on 30 January 2020 and released in English and Spanish, along with an infographic summary. **\[5.4\]**. As part of this programme, the USGS received three years of support from USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to develop a product that has been provided to seismic network operators in several countries \(Mexico, Nepal, Myanmar\) allowing them to calculate and disseminate aftershock likelihoods. **\[5.5\]**. 

 Japan: The ICEF report, and its subsequent approval by the International Association of Seismology and Physics of Earth’s Interior influenced the Japanese Cabinet Office decision to suspend deterministic prediction of the Tokai earthquake by the Japanese Meteorological Authority \(JMA\) in 2018 in favour of an OEF \(continuously\-updated ‘Extra Earthquake Information’\) service for the Nankai trough. If a period of elevated hazard is detected ‘JMA convenes the Nankai Trough Earthquake Assessment Committee for discussions on the expected potential for earthquake occurrence, and issues Earthquake Extra Information to the public via the JMA website and channels such as TV and radio’. **\[5.6\]**. 

 Extension to Induced Seismicity **:** Main’s research has underpinned protocols to quantify hazards and manage risks associated with natural gas extraction in the Netherlands, in turn informing decisions by the Dutch Bureau of Mines \(SodM\), the Netherlands Government, and the field operators NAM **\[5.7\]**. NAM developed and published a model which “ *provides operational forecasts consistent with the observed space–time–magnitude distribution of earthquakes induced by gas production from the Groningen field in the Netherlands…This forecast capability allows reliable assessment of alternative control options to better inform future induced seismic risk management decisions*” \[ **\[5.8\]**, citing **\[3.6\]**\]. This has resulted in approval of production, subject to significant managed changes in field operations and a reduction in the associated risk to the public **\[5.7\]**. In January 2014, the Netherlands Government announced a planned cut in total annual production of natural gas from 53.8 billion cubic metres \(bcm\) to 40 bcm by 2016, at an estimated cost to Government revenue of EUR1,000,000,000 “ *as part of the effort to reduce the danger caused by small but damaging earthquakes*” **\[5.9\]**. Subsequent cuts, reduced actual production to 24 bcm in October 2016, as confirmed by the Council of State ruling of November 18, 2015.  In 2018 production was reduced further to 21.6 bcm of natural gas. **\[5.9\]**. 

 Impact on raising public awareness and preparedness: The ICEF report highlighted the critical importance of risk communication during a crisis, and the effective communication of the relevant issues in times of repose, so that practitioners and the general public can act in an informed way during a crisis. Accordingly, the group has also contributed significantly to the public understanding and discussion of earthquake risks through interaction with a range of media outlets in articles or interviews in international media outlets including the Guardian, Scotsman, commentary in *Nature*, and via Terra Mater’s multiple\-award\-winning documentary *Chasing Quakes* on our work in supporting INGV during the Norcia\-Amatrice sequence in 2016\-17, featuring Main and Naylor, in December 2017 **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Centre for Movement, Occupation and Rehabilitation \(MOReS\) researches the support and delivery of exercise and physical activity for people with long\-term neurological conditions \(LTNCs\). Approximately 16,500,000 people in the UK have an LTNC, for whom exercise has previously been discouraged or poorly supported. Our research has enabled people with Parkinson’s disease to benefit from exercise, having been translated into the exercise pillar of the UK\-wide ‘First Steps’ intervention delivered by Parkinson’s UK for people just diagnosed, which it rates as 1 of its 8 stand\-out achievements since 2015. We have played a key role in increasing the activity levels of people with chronic disabling conditions in Oxfordshire, which now has the lowest county rates of inactivity in this group in England \(34.8%; national average 44.0%\). We have also developed the UK National Occupational Standard for exercise prescription and influenced curriculum development for the training of professionals in five countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 To better understand exercise response and recovery, and address the safety concerns of patients and clinicians, the MOReS research team have, since 2001, led developments in safe, effective exercise for people with LTNCs. The research has been supported by 26 competitive external grants and resulted in 65 publications. Since 2013, our research has improved understanding of dose\-response and safe effective delivery of exercise in the community, leading to the development of evidenced, individualised exercise prescription. We have developed condition\-specific altered exercise response and recovery profiles that need to be considered when prescribing for people with LTNCs including Parkinson’s disease \(PD\) **\(R1\)**, multiple sclerosis \(MS\) **\(R2\)** and young people with neurodevelopmental conditions **\(R3\)**. 

 Our research has demonstrated that the altered physiological, neurophysiological and perceptual responses to different exercise doses found in people with MS **\(R2\)** underpin the heightened effort required during exercise and the longer recovery periods experienced. This improved understanding confirmed that high intensity exercise for people with MS is safe \- and improves functioning and fitness more than lower intensity exercise \- but is especially fatiguing for muscles, slowing recovery from exercise and thus is badly tolerated. We subsequently developed condition\-informed individualised exercise prescription to achieve better symptom management. This has been implemented in a pragmatic community\-based, remotely delivered MS Society\-funded study at Cardiff University \( [<ins>https://www.leapms.org/information\-suite/physical\-activity\-and\-fatigue/</ins>](https://www.leapms.org/information-suite/physical-activity-and-fatigue/)\). 

 Building on evidence produced from the ‘Long\-term Individual Fitness Enablement in people with long\-term neurological conditions’ \(LIFE\) study, which identified key components needed to support people with LTNCs to exercise **\(A\)**, we conducted a trial of self\-directed community exercise for people with PD **\(B\)**. Importantly, for those developing services we found that unsupervised exercise was safe, well adhered to and produced sustained benefits regarding motor symptoms in people with PD for 1 year \( *d* \-0.30 \(95% CI 0.07 to 0.54\)\) **\(R4\)**. 

 Our research in young people with neurodevelopmental disorders has identified barriers to participation in physical activity **\(R5\)** and resulting low physical activity levels **\(R6\)**. Research revealing altered motor control \(that results in children performing activities less efficiently\) and exercise responses \(which manifest in children perceiving exercise to be harder\) has informed five further studies of interventions from MOReS, designed to provide young people with the confidence and skills to participate in physical activity **\(**including **C\)**. Intervention components have been designed to be delivered at scale and evaluated in schools nationwide \(104 schools, n=18, 299 children\) **\(D\)**. In order to target resources, our research has also produced a screening system for schools to identify young people who may benefit most from intervention **\(R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 MOReS has been at the forefront of a paradigm shift: from fear that exercise might trigger and aggravate symptoms in people with LTNCs towards the determination of specific condition\-informed prescription for therapeutic benefits of physical activity and exercise. Exercise is now seen as an essential part of managing these conditions to benefit function, health and well\-being, and in children to also benefit skill and academic development. We have produced evidence and developed interventions for safe, effective exercise across a number of conditions including, but not limited to, PD, MS and demyelinating conditions, Huntington’s, stroke, acquired brain injury, cerebral palsy and development coordination deficiency. Our work has made a major contribution to the transformation that has taken place worldwide and directly influenced those recommending, supporting and providing exercise, and those involved in informing and training health and exercise professionals. 

 **Helping people with PD benefit from exercise**: Collett et al. 2017 **\(R5\)** established that people with PD were able to safely self\-manage and adhere to exercise in the community. These results were rapidly translated into the exercise component of the First Steps programme, which was conceived by people with PD to provide information and support and empower self\-management for those newly diagnosed. We designed the exercise component of the programme and, in 2017, Parkinson’s UK funded Dawes to develop First Steps into a program that could be offered to all people newly diagnosed with PD in the UK **\(S1\)**. The First Steps service was adopted by Parkinson’s UK and has been running at nine UK sites **\(S2\)**. Unfortunately, roll out to all 21 regional excellence network centres has been delayed due to COVID\-19. However, Parkinson’s UK rates First Steps as 1 of its 8 stand\-out achievements since 2015, and report that participants gave it a 100% satisfaction rating **\(S3\)**. In conjunction with this, the team’s research insights into exercise\-altered responses in people with PD **\(R1\)** have informed dose and intensity guidance as part of the Parkinson’s Exercise Framework created by Parkinson’s UK **\(S4\)**. The Framework complements First Steps in supporting approximately 200 health professionals to prescribe exercise for those with PD. 

 Because of the team’s unique insight into the metabolic response to exercise in people with PD **\(R1\)**, the team were able to successfully support Robin Abby \(who has young\-onset PD\) row across the Indian Ocean. The team assessed his exercise response and recommended individualised safe exercise training parameters and intensity limits to enable him to complete the row \(more people have been to the Moon than have completed this challenge\). Robin benefitted at an individual level, with his crewmates noticing that his limp had gone at the end of the row and the monitoring teams showing that his motor symptoms \(rigidity and gait\) had improved. The purpose of the challenge was to raise awareness of young\-onset PD, with the empowering message of what you can achieve with PD. It achieved excellent public and media engagement worldwide across TV, radio and print, with articles in The Express, The Telegraph and Huffington Post, and coverage by the BBC, ITV and ABC in Australia **\(S5\)**. 

 The overall contribution of our research impact on people with PD was externally recognised by Universities UK in ‘Made at Uni: 100 ways Universities are saving lives and keeping us healthy’, a campaign showing how universities improve everyday lives **\(S6\)**. 

 **Improving local community physical activity provision:** Our research identified barriers and facilitators for people with long\-term conditions and disabilities participating in physical activity **\(A\)**. This research has informed the physical activity care pathway in Oxfordshire. We ensured the pathway \(GO Active\), commissioned by Sport England in 2014 for the general sedentary population **\(S7\)**, was appropriate for those with chronic disabling conditions through providing specific training to eight motivational interviewers and advising on activities. Since the implementation of GO Active, there has been an increase in those with chronic disabling conditions being active in Oxfordshire **\(S8\)** equating to 46,349 people with disability in Oxfordshire in 2018 being active and the county having the lowest rates of inactivity in this group in England \(34.8% compared with the national average of 44.0%\) \( [<ins>https://www.sportengland.org/know\-your\-audience/data/active\-lives/active\-lives\-data\-tables</ins>](https://www.sportengland.org/know-your-audience/data/active-lives/active-lives-data-tables)\). Subsequently, Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group funded the pathway for people with diabetes \(between July 2018 and November 2019, the programme recruited n=1,035\), with 29% meeting UK physical activity guidelines at baseline increasing to 41% at 3months. 

 In addition, our pioneering research has revealed altered perceptions of effort in children with movement difficulties, whereby exercise feels harder and more fatiguing **\(R3\)**. This, combined with our research that identified the support required for children with movement difficulties **\(R5\)**, has led to improved understanding and adapted programmes to support exercise. We have implemented these programmes through our Clinical Exercise and Rehabilitation Unit to support local schools. The direct benefit to young people was demonstrated in an OFSTED report **\(S9\)** that states ‘ *… This provides these students with highly specialised clinical exercise and rehabilitation support. There is detailed, effective and frequent communication between staff of the resource base and staff at the university. Consequently, these students make good progress.’* 

 Furthermore, these insights have been incorporated into interventions that can be delivered at scale through schools and the community **\(R6, C\)**. This research is being used by the Iranian Ministry of Education to support Physical Education **\(S10\)**. Dawes delivered training that was incorporated into Shad \( [https://www.shad.ir/](https://www.shad.ir/)\) the online learning platform used by Iranian schools, watched by 46,000 people live and available to approximately 14,000,000 users. The Deputy Minister of Education advised that these materials be used to increase physical activity. 

 **Leading the training of professionals:** We developed the UK National Occupational Standard ‘ *Design, agree and adapt a physical activity programme for adults with long\-term neurological conditions’* \(NOS D522\-  [https://studylib.net/doc/7685627/d522\-\-\-skillsactive](https://studylib.net/doc/7685627/d522---skillsactive)\) predicated on the body of research across various LTNCs and specifically the findings of the LIFE study **\(B\)**. Previously, we were the only accredited provider to deliver these standards, training 136 professionals and enabling them to prescribe exercise for people with LNTCs through the registered qualification. Since 2019, the Wright Foundation \(a community interest company and training provider\) has also been accredited to deliver the National Occupation Standard we developed. Running four intakes a year, the new course will provide the opportunity for the number of exercise professionals with this expertise being trained each year to be increased by approximately 80 \( [<ins>https://www.wrightfoundation.com/Neurological.php</ins>](https://www.wrightfoundation.com/Neurological.php)\). 

 Internationally developed curriculums for professional use have been delivered in China, Brazil, Australia, Iran and Jordan. For example, our training standards have been incorporated into the first Rehabilitation MSc in Jordan, funded by Erasmus\+ to support the refugee crisis **\(S12\)**. The team trained lecturing staff from Hassemite, University of Jordan and Jordan University of Science and Technology, and developed the lecturing materials. Further to the 30 physio and occupational therapists trained so far on the MSc, a face\-to\-face training workshop was delivered in the UK to 11 clinical academics from three universities and one hospital in Jordan, with the aim of further dissemination to approximately 1,000 physio and occupational therapists in Jordan. This will empower them to support exercise in adults and young people living with neurological or multiple conditions. 

 OnLineTraining Ltd, a training provider for teachers and teaching assistants who support children and young people with special educational needs, which operates in 104 countries, recognised our work and asked to incorporate our research insights into their motor coordination difficulties course **\(S11\)**. The course now includes content, directly informed by our research, on assessing gross motor skills and identifying children with problems, considering exercise capacity and the perception of exercise and fatigue, identifying appropriate activities and interventions to improve fitness and coordination, as well as suitable techniques. Despite COVID\-19, 156 people \(n=28 in the UK and n=128 in Australia\) have completed the training since 13 January 2020 and have improved knowledge of how to support exercise in these children.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ethnographic research carried out by SOAS at the House of Commons has transformed working practices in the UK Parliament, leading to \(a\) a better understanding of MPs’ circumstances, work and needs among Commons’ officials; \(b\) service improvements, including better induction for MPs and support to constituency offices; \(c\) improved relationships between officials and MPs. Select committees have benefited from drawing in more diverse witnesses and viewpoints, greater procedural transparency in their conduct, better press coverage and a deeper understanding of the nature of evidence; and \(d\) closer relationships between Parliament and scholars, vital for gathering wide\-ranging evidence and scrutinising government. Findings about these improved relationships have been adapted internationally to increase understanding of how to deepen democracy both at home and abroad.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prior to 2000 the contemporary study of the UK parliament was dominated by political scientists focusing on outputs, functions and roles; they overlooked change, heterogeneity, and entanglements in politicians’ work as well as cultural meaning\-making, rituals and relationships. This mirrored a neglect of MPs’ diversity, and those they interact with, by officials managing Parliament. These officials lacked an understanding of varying pressures on MPs and their staff. They used to contract an outside agency to conduct a survey with MPs about the services that officials provided and how they could be improved. It was rarely filled out by MPs and generated minimal information of use to parliament. In 2013\-14 Crewe designed a new system of interviewing by officials within the House of Commons that replaced the old system of surveying MPs by an outside contractor, based on her 30 years of experience in evaluation. Her ethnographic approach generated far higher quality results and continues to the present in the Commons. 

 Emma Crewe, Professor of Social Anthropology, employed by SOAS since 2008, has been studying parliament since 1998. Her research at SOAS has been funded by Leverhulme Trust \(2011\-2013, GBP44,975\), ESRC\-DFID \(2014\-2017, GBP502,000\), AHRC/GCRF \(2017\- 2021, GBP1,843,004\), ERC \(2019\-2024, GBP2,218,664\). Her first ethnography of the UK’s House of Commons, based on in\-depth fieldwork carried out 2011\-13, was published in 2015 **\[3.3\]**. Taking Westminster and selected constituencies as a field of study, Crewe’s ethnography **\[3.3, 3.4\]** involved 350 formal interviews \(including 56 MPs, 30 former MPs, 115 clerks and parliamentary staff, 24 MPs’ staff and 10 journalists\); close observation of day\-to\-day parliamentary business, including debates in the main chamber and inquiries by committees; shadowing MPs in 9 constituencies; and mini\-histories of two bills and a by\-election. 

 Crewe’s research uniquely explained how: \(a\) the diversity of experience among MPs create additional burdens on specific groups, including women **\[3.2, 3.4**\]\). The provision of induction, training and services to MPs used to be standardised on the flawed assumption that people should be treated the same, whereas equality is only achieved by recognising difference. This research alerted officials to how inequalities, past experience and distance to constituency lead to different needs and pressures for MPs; \(b\) the complex entanglement of different processes \(representation, policy\-making, governing, scrutiny, media etc **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.5\]**\) meant that services provided to MPs have to take account of links between different types of work. Training should not be only offered when they join but throughout their terms, \(c\) significant changes to their work, including the decline in obedience to party and the huge increase in constituency work **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.6\]**\) **,** have to be factored into planning services for MPs. 

 Crewe also found through her research that select committees do not invite a diverse enough range of witnesses to give evidence and pay insufficient attention to how evidence is produced and what claims are made about its rigour. Crewe followed this up with research on select committees in 2019 **\[3.5\]**, commissioned by the Clerk of Committees, with a psychotherapist, Nicholas Sarra \(University of Exeter\). They investigated the way committees are managed, presenting their findings to the Committee office and uniquely drawing their attention to the importance of recognising the emotional labour involved. In 2019\-2020 she also collaborated with former Director of Human Resources and Change in the House of Commons, Andrew Walker, to learn the institutional lessons about the expenses scandal – why it happened and how such a failure of probity could be avoided in the future **\[3.6\]**, at the suggestion of the then Clerk of the House. The main conclusion was this scandal was caused by the failure to adjust to broader social and political change \(e.g., by addressing MPs’ relatively low pay and anticipating the impact of the Freedom of Information Act\) and cultural assumptions about their entitlements.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Many scholars, MPs, civil servants and Commons officials have been significantly influenced by Crewe’s findings and her ethnographic approach transforming both the study of parliament but also the evaluation of Commons’ services and the running of select committees. Crewe’s research has enhanced the in\-depth scrutiny of parliament, the commitment of the House of Commons to undertake research \(on its own and with others\), and its capacity to improve the management of the institution. Officials have introduced new processes, acknowledged and addressed both cultural and practical problems, and developed processes for evaluating and improving management. The institution and its members have benefitted in the following ways: MPs experience better services and support; the culture that was supporting falling standards in the conduct of politicians is better understood and steps have been taken to strengthen probity and standards; and the increased diversity of outside experts called upon to give evidence to select committees has led to better scrutiny of government. The impact of these benefits go beyond the institution of Parliament as MPs serve all four nations of the UK, so developing their capacity has the potential for national \(and even international\) impact. 

####  Transforming induction, training and support to MPs and their staff 

 Crewe’s guidance to officials led to the replacement of an annual survey of services in 2013 by a system of qualitative evaluation **\[5.1a\]**. With officials she co\-designed the system for reviewing services and assisted in training staff to interview MPs. In the first instance 95 MPs were interviewed, their views analysed and recommendations implemented. The impact has been multi\-fold **\[5.1a, b\]**. The Commons has better information about how different MPs and MPs’ staff view services, which has alerted officials to the diversity of their circumstances, work and needs, leading to individually tailored induction and training for MPs and their staff, first introduced in 2015. Flowing from this better evaluation, service improvements included: \(a\) a ‘buddying system’ pairing officials with every new MP to give them individual advice about how to set up offices and learn key elements of the job, which has transformed induction since 2015; \(b\) bringing in more external experts to facilitate continuing professional development, which has also been positively rated by MPs; \(c\) better support and improved security for constituency offices, especially since 2017. Subsequently, the Commons undertook a dedicated evaluation of the specific experience and needs of women MPs. The improvements, and the value of Crewe’s advice and guidance given between 2013 and 2014 on the methodology, were acknowledged \(a\) in a report to the Administration Committee in 2014, by the Director of Service Delivery **\[5.1b\],** and \(b\) in a report about ‘Research Impact and Legislatures’ by UK Parliament, showcasing the impact of academics including Crewe **\[5.2a\]** and championing several new academic fellowship schemes in Parliament and greater involvement of academics established to build on these achievements **\[5.2b\]**. 

 Parliament reported in 2018 that Crewe’s work “led to the 2014 House of Commons Administration Committee recommendation to replace the annual survey of Members and Members' Staff with a detailed series of interviews. The academic trained parliamentary staff on qualitative interviewing and has continued to provide advice on the scope and design of subsequent projects” **\[5.2a pg3\]**. The current CEO of the Commons added: “The findings were used to inform work on Departmental action plans and have also supported organisational change, including the establishment of new teams focused on customer insights and evaluation. The findings also led directly to a series of constituency regional roadshows, to support the needs of their constituency\-based staff.” **\[5.1\]**. 

####  Enhancing standards of politicians’ conduct 

 Crewe’s research deepened officials’ and outsiders’ capacity to operate more effectively within the Commons. Since 2016, her 2015 book has been issued as part of the induction for members of the Standards committee: “I have myself frequently described the volume on the House of Commons as the best guide to what it actually feels like to be an MP that is available. When we appointed a new breed of “lay members” of our Standards Committee in 2015, the senior governmentside MP on that committee asked, successfully, that each of the newly appointed lay members should be provided with a copy of that book out of public funds. I believe that is a strong testimony to the esteem in which Professor Crewe’s work is held by legislators themselves”, writes the former Clerk of Committees. **\[5.6\].** This has inspired others to seek Crewe’s advice on conducting research, training and management. The Committee on Standards in Public Life \(CSPL\) inquiry has published research about MPs’ work as part of its inquiry into MPs’ outside interests and included some of Crewe’s data about MPs’ daily schedules \[5.4b\], which has been reprinted by the government **\[5.4c\]**. The former Clerk/CEO asked Crewe to research the lessons learned from the 2009 expenses scandal with a parliamentary official, written up in Crewe and Walker \(2019\), indicating how much she is trusted but also enhancing the Commons’ potential to learn from the past **\[5.6\]** Lord Bew, Chair of the CSPL, recognises that Crewe’s work has been a “valuable contribution” to the CSPL’s pushing ahead with recommendations for increased transparency to “‘prevent further erosion of public trust” **\[5.4a\]**. The parallels between this and prevention of abuse led the Leader’s Office, and the Director of Cultural Transformation, to call Crewe to meetings to discuss how to prevent and respond to allegations of bullying within Parliament. 

####  Increasing diversity of expertise and understanding of evidence in select committees 

 Since 2015 Crewe has advised Committee Office staff about improving their assessment of evidence **\[5.1a, 5.6\]**, and how to judge rigour, as well as relationships with existing and potential witnesses. The former Clerk of Committees commented, “The value of Professor Crewe’s work and the esteem in which she is held have been amply demonstrated by the frequency with which she has been asked to assist committees of the House by giving formal evidence and expert advice, including on matters of governance and ‘culture’ as well as her particular specialism of development studies” **\[5.6\]**. Drawing attention to the quasi\-legalistic language, assumptions and rules of select committee evidence sessions led to improvements in communication with witnesses. She gave evidence to select committees \(both written and oral, public and private, to five committees\) and has been quoted in several select committee reports **\[5.3 a, b, c, d\]**. She has contributed to diversifying witnesses to improve the range of evidence available to select committees **\[5.7a\]**. 

 As Director of the Global Research Network on Parliaments and People, Crewe assisted scholars from the Global South to give oral and written evidence to the International Development Select Committee \(IDSC\) **\[5.7a\]**. In 2017 the then Head of International Development Research at the ESRC, acknowledged Crewe as generating a “wealth of questions” for poverty alleviation policy making, especially on partnership and capacity development in the Global South **\[5.5\]**. In 2019 she persuaded the IDSC, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Global Challenges Research Fund to host an international conference in the House of Commons for 150 MPs \(global\), peers, officials, scholars and activists **\[5.7b\]**. This showcased research by Global South scholars but also enabled discussion about how to improve links between scholars and politicians, particularly the process of giving evidence to Parliaments. The IDSC publicly committed to taking more evidence from Global South scholars at the conference. In 2017, Crewe launched the new Royal Anthropological Institute Committee on Anthropology of Policy and Practice **\[5.8.a\]**, with links to the Whitehall Anthropologists Network, which regularly shares information about select committee calls for inquiries. Crewe has also published associated guidance to UK and global scholars about giving evidence **\[5.8 b\]**. 

 As the Clerk of the IDSC explains, Crewe helped to increase parliamentary accountability noting that Crewe “continues to be one of the academics making a regular contribution to parliamentary scrutiny”, helping to “organise external analysis of, and support for, the proposal that Parliament retain and/or develop a dedicated select committee to scrutinise Official Development Assistance to mitigate the merging of DFID into the FCO. The arguments presented…prevented a loss of a respected focal point for aid and development discourse, an important channel into government, as well as expertise, contacts and capacity for Parliament, all of which is expected to help maintain the UK’s ability to reach exceptional standards in its international development policy and programmes.” **\[5.7\]**. 

####  Increasing public awareness and understanding of parliaments in the UK and abroad 

 These enhancements in support, conduct and diversity have been complemented by Crewe’s campaign to encourage public engagement through a better national and international understanding of parliament. Through accessible publications, social media and media coverage **\[5.9a\-e\]**, she has informed political observers about the recent changes to parliament as well as the need for further reform. This resulted in impact within the creative sector – most notably the inclusion of her research ‘An MP’s Typical Day’ in the National Theatre’s production of Hansard **\[5.10\]**. In order to create similar opportunities for scholars to improve working practices within parliaments in other countries, she led a team to establish a new programme of research and engagement for civil society and universities in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Myanmar. Raising more than GBP4,000,000 in total from the AHRC/GCRF in 2017, and from the ERC in 2019, has enabled Crewe and partners to give grants to researchers and creative industries to scrutinise their political worlds. They have audited public engagement, assessed the performance of parliament, and researched the relationships between politicians and the public to make recommendations for change and reimagine the democracies of Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Myanmar **\[5.9e\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the UWS team in Migration and Ethnic Studies has made significant contributions across policy and practice related to migrant and refugee social inclusion and integration that are of global importance. This committed work, adopting an interconnectedness lens, has engaged with numerous migrant communities:

 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 Impact on refugee and migrant integration has been achieved through the following five strands of sustained and engaged research work: 

 1\) Trajectories of **Polish migration** and settlement patterns in Scotland and accompanying questions of citizenship and integration, with a focus on education and employment sectors **\[3.1, 3.2\]** 

 2\) The lived realities of **HIV positive refugees from Africa** who are living in Scotland with multiple disadvantages and experiencing high degrees of social exclusion **\[3.3\]** 

 3\) **Roma communities from central and Eastern Europe** and their experiences of everyday racism, socio\-economic in/exclusion and integration in Glasgow **\[3.4\]** 

 4\) Anti\-immigrant **racism in Northern Ireland**, and how a ‘race relations’ framework offers little in terms of the structural factors that reproduce race/class discrimination **\[3.5\]** 

 5\) The **Scottish experience** of raising awareness across communities of the problem **of human trafficking**, and the development of a strategy to tackle this issue **\[3.6\]** 

 Combined, this body of academic work can be synthesised as examining population mobility and experiences of growing vulnerabilities, borders and boundary\-making vis\-à\-vis nationality, ‘race’, ethnicity, community, and welfare rights. The academic outputs problematise the nature of UK public policy and service provision to communities whose precarious citizenship status is often linked to issues of nationality, ‘race’, gender, ethnicity and age. 

 What connects the studies of Polish migrant families **\[3.1, 3.2\]**, Africans in Scotland **\[3.3\]**, Roma communities from central and Eastern Europe **\[3.4\]**, and minorities facing anti\-immigrant racism in Ireland **\[3.5\]**, are shared experiences of multiple vulnerabilities in citizenship, belonging, and everyday racism. The public policy measures and community impact of an important aspect of vulnerable migration, the case of human trafficking, are also considered **\[3.6\]**. 

 Specifically, the research evidence collated via outputs **\[3.1 \- 3.6\]** detail the systems, processes and structures that contribute to migrant and refugee precarious status and sustain *unintegrated* neighbourhoods with evidence of multiple discrimination. In the case of Poles and Roma, outputs **\[3.1, 3.2\]** and **\[3.4\]** illustrate that settlement practices in Scotland are impacted by different migration drivers; gender, age, class, and ethnic composition, as well as the reception offered to the communities, post\-arrival. 

 Similarly, African refugees who are living with HIV in Scotland are said to be ‘living in limbo’ **\[3.3\]** due to their health and immigration status. This photo\-based research, as with **\[3.1\]** and **\[3.4\],** illustrates that racialised ‘othering’ can be challenged via active policy interventions that raise awareness and challenge underlying perceptions. 

 While set within the Scottish context, these concerns are relevant globally and the value of the Northern Ireland work is that tackling anti\-immigrant racism via a dominant ‘race relations’ lens and policy framework is of limited value **\[3.5\].** 

 The underlying research also contributes to a greater awareness of human trafficking, through the prism of ‘invisible crimes’ **\[3.6\].** It recognises the role of transnational networks and how human trafficking has shifted from a peripheral concern to a core issue in Scotland’s political, policing and community safety landscapes. 

 Overall, this body of research **\[3.1 \- 3.6\]** documents how macro level structures of citizenship, identity and representation operate at the meso and micro levels illustrating migrant and refugee experiences of exclusion and integration in Scotland.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Collectively, the high\-profile and innovative impact work of the UWS team has assisted in changing perspectives and policies at local, national and international levels. Migrant and refugee integration and inclusion policies and practices are rarely undertaken with ideological neutrality or without political concerns and interventions. As such, migrant and refugee agency and perspectives are foregrounded in the policy and practice impacts of the UWS research team and drive forward staff research and outreach activities. Working in partnership with a range of civil society bodies and Government agencies to deliver socially useful research that helps make a difference is core to such activities. 

 **i\) Promoting self\-representation and agency of migrants and refugees** 

 Sustained impact on refugee policy and practice is demonstrated via the gathered testimonials included as corroborating evidence. Polish community organisations in Scotland, as well as the Scottish Government, have benefited from Pietka\-Nykaza’s research **\[3.1, 3.2**\] as her expertise and knowledge has been translated into well\-regarded evaluation and advocacy tools **\[5.1 \- 5.3\].** For example, her contribution to expert debates on migrant voting rights, as well as contributing to an expert focus group and networking session at the Scottish Parliament, demonstrates that shared knowledge can have meaningful and sustained impact via influencing Scottish Government policy and practice on refugee and migrant integration. Refugees, MSPs and policymakers were informed via Sidhva’s research **\[3.3\]** as this led to the creation of visual mediums that facilitated refugee voices to be seen as well as heard, via travelling photographic galleries and exhibitions in **Scotland, India, South Africa,** and **Jordan**. The high\-profile Scottish Parliament launch of the exhibition generated significant media attention **\[5.4, 5.5\]** Roma rights NGOs \(e.g., Romano Lav\), Glasgow City Council, COSLA \(the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities\) and the Scottish Government \(Equalities Unit\) have all benefited, in a policy and practice sense, from Clark’s long\-term ethnographic research **\[5.4\]** which has emerged from his committed advocacy scholarship work with local Roma communities to ensure their voices are central to their own emancipation, especially for younger members of these disenfranchised communities **\[5.6, 5.7\].** 

 **ii\) Influencing strategies and practices of agencies and organisations working with migrants and refugees** 

 Government and NGO strategies and policies have used the robust evidence base offered by the UWS research team. For example, an evaluation of the provision of integration services to refugees as well as the holistic integration service model has been informed by Pietka\-Nykaza’s **\[5.1 \- 5.3\]** research. **UNFPA/UNICEF** review and adopting new policies on child marriage have been informed by Sidhva’s **\[5.4, 5.5\]** work as an Expert Panel Member on their Global Consultation on ending Child Marriage among Refugees \(Jordan, Feb. 2020\). More inclusive higher education policies and practices for Roma migrant students has resulted from policy advice delivered to the **House of Lords** by Clark **\[5.6, 5.7\]**, as well as via his appointments as Director, Trustee and Advisor, to various UK\-based Roma, Gypsy and Traveller NGOs. Similarly, the NGO Scottish Detainee Visitors \(SDV\) has benefited from Gilligan’s contributions as Board member, and his research has helped shape SDV’s policy approach to refugee detention. Staff have used their research expertise in a manner that assists third\-sector organisations in their strategic planning and policies and practices. 

 **iii\) Awareness raising of issues impacting the everyday lives of migrants and refugees through media/outreach work** 

 High\-profile media attention of UWS research has helped set the public agenda on refugee and migrant integration in Scotland. For example, Sidhva’s ‘Living in Limbo’ photographic exhibition about HIV\+ **African refugees** in Scotland and Pietka\-Nykaza’s work with **Polish migrants** in Scotland, as well as her ongoing work with the **Scottish Refugee Council**. Similarly, Clark’s engagement with **Romanian** and **Slovakian Roma communities** in Scotland has helped families to challenge the continual negative representation by the media and the racism \(Anti\-Gypsyism\) that communities endure. Clark’s ongoing **trustee work with Romano Lav** stands out in this regard, helping to challenge hostile media/political discourses **\[5.7\].** Journalists routinely approach the UWS team for comments or opinion articles on refugee and migrant integration and this helps establish fresh perspectives and new policy ideas for promoting inclusion and belonging. 

 **iv\) Improving the evidence base used by Government and NGOs, regarding migrant and refugee needs from policy and practice** 

 Meaningful impact comes through reliable data and improving the evidence base. Gilligan’s academic work **\[5.5\]** has led to roundtable invitations allowing him to network and disseminate knowledge. Pietka\-Nykaza’s research **\[3.1, 3.2\]** has enabled invitations to high profile events **\[5.1 \- 5.3\]** that assist in transmitting policy and practice guidance to NGOs working in the field of migrant and refugee rights. Sidhva’s commitment to high quality practice\-based work **\[3.3\]** has promoted active exchanges with Government/NGO bodies regarding the needs and expectations of refugees in vulnerable conditions **\[5.4, 5.5\].** Clark’s voluntary engagement with different organisations, including the Scottish Human Rights Commission, the Traveller Movement **\[5.6\]**, Romano Lav \(Roma Voice\) **\[5.7\]** and the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights **\[5.8\]** has enabled him to offer research evidence **\[3.4\]** to inform the grassroots policy and practice work of these bodies. Atkinson’s innovative research **\[3.6\]** helped to directly shape the policy and strategy of the Scottish Government Taskforce on human trafficking **\[5.9, 5.10\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 As described by the UN Rapporteur on the Right to Food, good food is a prerequisite for a strong market. When healthy food is not affordable or accessible to consumers, their welfare may be jeopardised, and the likelihood of poverty within society may increase. Food affordability is a key factor determining access to food, dependent not only on food cost but also on the disposable income that can be spent on food. Ulster University Business School’s \(UUBS\) research has been used to inform and support the strategic direction of non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\), public sector bodies and retailers to promote the affordability and accessibility of food to consumers, thereby tackling the wider societal challenges of reducing food insecurity and an obesogenic environment. Our research has: 

 **I1**: Informed the strategic direction of NGOs working on the global challenge of food insecurity. 

 **I2**: Stimulated policy debate on food insecurity and influenced public health messaging as priority areas requiring government action. 

 **I3**: Initiated a collaborative stakeholder approach to inform public debate on the healthiness of food retail promotions. 

 **I4**: Changed retailers’ strategies around the prominence of healthier food products to make the healthier choice the more affordable and accessible choice for consumers.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Food is a basic human right. When this right is breached it can result in food insecurity: a lack of physical and economic access to food. The role of the retailer and policy\-maker as ‘significant gatekeepers’ of our food supply must be considered to achieve a food system that is equitable for all. Maintaining the nutritional quality, value \(e.g., volume\-and price\-based promotions\) and choice \(e.g., shoppers’ decision\-making\) of the foods consumers access, at a price they can afford, is a growing concern within the UK and globally. 

 Furey and Farley **\[R1\]** explored in 2001\-2002 the issue of financial access to food and concluded that across 109 food stores, supermarket multiples were more affordable than small local convenience stores, which were typically 39% more expensive and offered reduced food choice. This study initiated a programme of research exploring inequitable food accessibility and affordability contributing to food insecurity. **R2** \(Furey\) found in 2017 that an emergency food parcel \(consumer cost GBP17.66\) does not contain all the minimum essential food items for a healthy diet, according to MacMahon and Weld \(2016\), which would cost GBP57.05, a threefold price difference.  Results from 2016\-2019 research **\[R3\]** \(Furey and Hollywood\) provided a justification, evidenced by the literature, for recommending the measurement of food insecurity within the UK by adopting the use of the US Household Food Security Severity Module as a suitable metric. 

 In 2015, competitive grant funding obtained from the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\) focused on retailer promotional offers. The results of **R4** \(Hollywood and Furey\) highlighted significant differences in the mean prices for promotional offers \(as opposed to a full basket shop\) across retailers. Using 2016\-17 data convenience store retailers offered lower average promotional prices per item \(£0.54\) and more products classified as healthy \(55.9%\), compared to supermarkets/discounters \(£0.66 and 50.7% respectively\). This study developed a bespoke ‘traffic light’ scoring system based on the FSA Front\-of\-Pack colour\-coded labelling system \(categories: red, amber and green signifying foods of low, medium and high nutritional quality respectively\) for assessing the healthiness of the promotional offers available in\-store. Results identified a similar number of products categorised as ‘red’ \(47.5%\) \(e.g., High Fat, Salt and Sugar, HFSS\) as categorised as ‘amber’ or ‘green’ \(52.5%\) and revealed the need for retailers to consider the prominence of healthy promotions within their store design \[ **R4** Hollywood and Furey\]. 

 The results of **R5** \(Hollywood and Durkin\) highlighted how a deep knowledge of the consumer can assist the food and drink industry in predicting future consumer purchasing behaviour. Subsequently in 2016, a grant was secured from The Food Safety Promotion Board \( **safe**food\) to conduct a comparable study on the consumer component \(e.g., survey and accompanied shops\) to afford better understanding of the drivers impacting on consumer choice. This study not only extended the research into a different jurisdiction, but resulted in new guidance being publicised. For example, the concept of an inverted food promotional pyramid was developed. Contrary to current healthy eating advice, where the bottom of the Food Pyramid represents proportionately more healthy food and the top of the pyramid proportionately less unhealthy food, our results found that 35% of the 69,620 food products audited were categorised at the top \(i.e., unhealthy foods\), increasing to 56% in convenience stores – see Images 1 and 2 \[ **R6**\] Furey and Hollywood\]. Using this model supports retailers and consumers alike to understand the influence of promotional offers on healthy food choices.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Ulster University Business School’s \(UUBS\) research on food policy and consumer choice continues to inform the strategic direction of NGOs, public sector bodies and retailers on the affordability and accessibility of food to the wider public. Our ground\-breaking research is the first of its kind in the UK and has been used as the independent evidence base by these stakeholders, resulting in four key impacts. 

  

 **I1**: *Informed the strategic direction of NGOs working on the global challenge of food insecurity* 

 Our research \[ **R2**\] was used by a coalition of NGOs \(e.g., Independent Food Aid Network \(IFAN\), Children in Northern Ireland \(CinNI\) and Food Foundation\) to continuously improve their collective knowledge surrounding food insecurity. First\-hand knowledge of the scale and nature of food insecurity in NI was deemed critical to policy partners given that there is a lack of UK\-wide data. Our work has particularly impacted on IFAN’s campaign work regarding food insecurity measurement. We compared three existing food insecurity indicators: *EU\-Survey on Income and Living Conditions, Food Insecurity Experience Survey and Household Food Security Scale Module \(HFSSM\)*, and confirmed agreement between the indicators, concluding the HFSSM to be the scale most comprehensible to consumers. IFAN and coalition members referred directly to our research in a key meeting on food insecurity measurement, Better Data on Food Insecurity, held by the UK’s Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) in 2019. As indicated by IFAN’s Coordinator \[ **C1**\], *“As a result of this research, the UK Government introduced a national index of food insecurity requiring its standardised measurement across all four UK nations. For the first time, via the Department for Work and Pensions’ \(DWP\), a UK\-wide annual Family Resources Survey was established that monitors household incomes and living standards. In the absence of the recent and relevant data on household food insecurity... \[Dr Furey’s\] work has provided unique detail on the scale of hunger in the UK and my colleagues and I have been able to use this data to support our call for UK\-wide food insecurity measurement”.* 

  

 Additionally, CinNI adopted our research \( **R2**\) to inform its work as the lead organisation in NI for the Children’s Future Food Inquiry \(CFFI\) which has the support of a cross\-party group of 14 parliamentarians, two all\-party Parliamentary Groups, and the Children’s Commissioners in all four UK nations. Our evidence submission and presentation were used in the development of the final report \[ **C2**\]. According to CinNI’s Policy Officer, *“The result has been continuous improvement in our knowledge surrounding food insecurity \[and\] ensured that academic research is incorporated into policy consultations and calls for policy change … The independence of the research has also been important. The rigour and professionalism has meant people do take heed of the findings and don’t dismiss as they would otherwise have done”* \[ **C2**\]. Our findings proved an *“invaluable contribution” and played “a direct role in shaping the Children’s Future Food Inquiry’s next steps, including the report”* that delivered the project’s final recommendations for tackling the problem \(Communications Manager, Food Foundation\). This culminated in a UK\-wide *Children’s Right 2 Food Charter* which has formed the foundation of ongoing calls to action around the provision of nutritious school meals/direct cash transfers during school holidays \[ **C2**\]. 

  

 **I2**: *Stimulated policy debate on food insecurity and influenced public health messaging as priority areas requiring government action* 

 Our UUBS research \[ **R2 \- R3**\] has ensured that food insecurity has attained policy attention with citations in the House of Lords Select Committee on Food, Poverty, Health and the Environment report \[ **C3**\]. Further confirmation of our thought\-leadership status in this area was an invited contribution to *The Lancet Neurology* \[ **C10**\] which stated that food insecurity is a *“new epidemic and mental health emergency”* and a publication in *The Lancet* \[ **C10**\]. **R2** and **R3** have ensured the inclusion of food access in the cross\-Departmental NI Future Food Policy as a compulsory consideration for any future policymaking in the agri\-food agenda connecting health, education, environment and economic aspects into a longer\-term, collective vision. This benefits Northern Ireland consumers by ensuring that physical and economic access to food are not barriers to healthy food. Our findings in the area of food access and food poverty in Northern Ireland have been adopted by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs \(DAERA\) confirming UUBS as the go\-to researchers in this very important policy area. As indicated by the Director of Future Food Policy, DAERA \[ **C4**\], *“UUBS research in the food poverty and policy arena has helped to inform thinking in this area of the agri\-food agenda and will continue to do so as we move forward in this inter\-departmental policy development process to further strengthen the evidence base where necessary”.* 

  

 Our research \[ **R6**\] has made a substantial contribution influencing a multi\-media national health campaign by **safe**food across the Republic of Ireland. The research was used as *“the evidence base for the ‘Transform your Trolley’ campaign”* \( **safe**food Scientific Officer, **C5**\), to raise public awareness of unhealthy food promotions, as part of a wider public health campaign to educate shoppers on how to achieve a healthy shop. The *‘Transform Your Trolley’* campaign provided shoppers with 12 tips to achieve a healthy shop with Tip \#3 *“Beware of special offers”* stating our findings that *“A third of foods on special offer aren’t that good for you so unless they are on your list, walk by”* \[ **C5**\]. Our data \[ **R6**\] were also used to visually categorise foods on promotion against the government\-endorsed healthy eating guidelines using an infographic \(images 1 and 2 in Section 2\) to teach consumers how much of what they eat overall should come from each area \(e.g., vegetables, salad and fruit\) to achieve a healthy, balanced diet. This infographic, available on the **safe**food website, which gained significant social media attention, is used as a guide for making more informed decisions about the foods they purchase \(for consumers\) and place on promotional offer \(for retailers\) \[ **C5**\]. Finally, our research \[ **R6**\] informed the basis of a **safe**food press release \[ **C5**\] that alerted media and consumers of how out\-of\-sync retailers’ promotional food offers were, when compared to the Food Pyramid. This resulted in our research being promoted across main stream media outlets in the UK and Ireland, featuring in the *Irish Independent, The Irish Times, The Irish Sun, Daily Mirror, Evening Echo, Daily Mail, Journal.ie*, *Evoke.ie* and the *UK Times.* 

  

 **I3**: *Initiated a collaborative stakeholder approach to inform public debate on the healthiness of food retail promotions* 

 Our report \[ **R4**\] highlighted the need for greater engagement between public bodies \(e.g., Food Standards Agency \[FSA\]\) and grocery retailers to tackle wider societal problems such as food affordability in a more collaborative way, leading to the inception of a bi\-annual retailer forum. This consortium, chaired by the FSA, represents UK multiples \(Tesco, Marks and Spencer, Asda\), discounters \(e.g., Lidl\) and distributors to SME retailers \(Henderson’s \[Spar/Eurospar\] and Musgrave \[Centra\]\), highlighting the reach of our research in dealing with the issue of food affordability. Since inception in 2017, the consortium has met five times to examine mutually challenging policy issues impacting on current retail practice \(e.g., possible mandatory legislation on the healthiness of promotional offers\). The Director for Research and Policy at the NI Retail Consortium \(part of the British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing 70% of UK retailers\) affirmed that our work *“led to the inception of the retailer forum with the FSA and the Department of Health which has been incomparably useful in initiating dialogue \[and\] creating better relationships between retailers and government agencies”*. He also highlighted how our research *“made a tangible difference to our thinking and engagement with Northern Ireland … in how any ongoing nutritional surveillance would be actioned, and our desire to continue to be involved in this public health conversation”*, and that it has since *“re\-visited the recommendations in light of this research to consider in our strategies and policies on nutrition, obesity, promotions and engagement with Government agencies”* \[ **C6**\]. 

  

 **I4**: *Changed retailers’ strategies around the prominence of healthier food products to make the healthier choice the more affordable, accessible and available choice for consumers* 

 Several testimonials from retailers \[ **C7 – C9**\] and a trade body representative \[ **C6**\] discussed how our research \[ **R4; R6**\] has changed the strategies used in retail practice in the following ways: 

 \(1\) The prominent placement of healthier items in\-store, for example the Supply Chain Executive from Lidl stated, *“Ulster’s research \[ **R4**\] has complemented our ‘Fresh Approach’ retailing strategy. We have improved access to healthy food by introducing ‘healthy tills’ \(e.g., the replacement of sweets\) and the increased prominence of fresh food on promotion, whereby fruit and vegetables have been relocated to the front of store”* \[ **C7**\]. 

 \(2\)  Increased the quantity and nutritional quality of foods within their offering, for example, Commercial Sales Manager for Henderson Group stated that *“Ulster’s research* \[ **R4**\] *has emphasised to us the value … of ensuring that high value product categories which can offer health benefits to consumers are the easy and affordable choice for consumers at the point of choice … EuroSpar has increased the quantity and nutritional quality of foods they choose to locate in prominent sites across its stores, and notably at store fronts where customer footfall is greatest, with healthy fresh produce and snacks more visibly and conveniently located at the front of stores, in standalone displays, and at checkout points”* \[ **C8**\]. 

 \(3\) Reduced reliance on the use of volume\-based promotions, for example, the NI Retail Consortium stated that on behalf of the industry, *“\(We\) have re\-visited the recommendations \[ **R4**\] in light of this research … \[which\] reinforces our general direction of travel including our shift away from multibuys to straight discounts”* \[ **C6**\]. 

 \(4\) Investment in healthier options through product reformulation, for example the Head of Food Innovation for Marks & Spencer stated that our research \[ **R4**\] *“influences our current thinking on how we approach marketing of HFSS and how we balance every day eating occasions with special occasions and treats. Reformulation is key to this”* \[ **C9**\]. 

  

 In summary, our research has been used by organisations with the authority to make impactful changes which benefit consumers and allow them to access healthy, more affordable food.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Rooney’s research by practice in Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt is focused on the reconstitution of Arab civil societies through creative means. Since 2012, she has engaged in projects that effect regional trust\-building and community regeneration. This has enabled her: to inform policy\-making and the public on Palestine and a conflicted Middle East through a series of findings that have been taken up by NGOs and British MPs; to build communities and trust through arts activism in the context of a Middle East fractured by sectarian conflicts and authoritarian divide and rule; and to further creative arts exchanges and education through consultancies that have benefited artists and conflict\-affected schoolchildren. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Rooney’s research has explored the different trajectories of extremism and revolutionary radicalism in the Middle East, and has enabled her to identify the three key research areas that underlie this case study: the protraction of the Israel\-Palestine conflict; trust\-building in Lebanon and other post\-conflict societies; and community\-building through the arts in post\-revolutionary Egypt. Rooney’s work shows how arts activism is highly effective in establishing new kinds of participatory citizenship that answer to the demand for *karamah* \(dignity\) that the Arab uprisings brought to the fore. Committed to culturally informed approaches, the work draws on extensive periods of fieldwork, including interviews, workshops, and arts projects, in three countries of the MENA region. 

 **Palestine**: In **2013**, Rooney undertook fieldwork research in Palestine with film director Mai Masri. They interviewed former child prisoners at the Hebron YMCA and therapists working with former prisoners at the Beit Sahour YMCA, together with human rights workers. Rooney followed this fieldwork up with further research leading to her **2015** article ‘Prison\-Israel Palestine’ **\[R1\]**, which shows how the dynamics of the Israel\-Palestine conflict are those of the gated community \(regarding Israel\) and the prison \(regarding Palestine\). This investigation issued in two research\-by\-practice projects on the predicaments of Palestinian prisoners: the play *The Keepers of Infinite Space* \( **2014**\), which Rooney instigated and pitched to the Park Theatre, London, with contributions to its script \(plot design and dialogue\) and production process; and the advocacy documentary *Breaking* *the Generations: Palestinian Prisoners and Medical Rights*, directed by Rooney with William Parry \( **2015**\) **\[R2\].** 

 **Lebanon**: Following on from her previous research on the Lebanese civil war **\[R3\]**, Rooney mounted a workshop in Beirut on trust\-building with Lebanese journalists, psychoanalysts and activists \( **2013**\). This led to her scripting and directing \(with Rita Sakr\) an arts documentary, *White Flags* \( **2014**\), which portrays the different approaches to rebuilding war\-torn Lebanon on the part of the film’s interviewees across the areas of humanitarian aid, psychoanalysis, journalism, and the arts **\[R4\]**. The film provides counter\-narratives to those of sectarianism through exploring processes of mourning and memorialisation, civil society initiatives for justice, and the role of popular culture in community\-building. 

 **Egypt**: Rooney has mounted a number of research workshops in Egypt to explore local arts activism, including ‘Geographies of Negligence’ \(Cairo University and the British Council, **2015**\), and co\-inaugurated the Egyptian Forum for the Study of Popular Culture and a ‘Living Heritage’ series on music, film, art, and literature \(with Fekri Hassan, French University of Egypt, **2016\-17**\). Her research in this area has led to several articles, including **\[R5\]**, and culminated in her monograph *Creative Radicalism in the Middle East* **\[R6\]**, which explains the differences between radicalism and extremism in terms of different forms of popular culture and their signifying practices. This work establishes that creative radicalism is the democratic alternative to the deadlock between authoritarian neoliberalism and destructive extremism.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Informing Policy\-Making and the Public on Palestine and a Conflicted Middle East** 

 Rooney’s research is frequently used by policy\-makers and parliamentarians for insights into radicalism and extremism in the Middle East. This has led to Rooney informing policy advice in a range of areas, including cultural soft power, religious literacy, and human rights. Examples during the REF2021 period include the evidence Rooney provided in **2014** to the House of Lords select committee on ‘Soft Power and the UK’s Influence’ \(with the ensuing policy report quoting her research\); the policy briefing on religious literacy mounted by John Wolfe and launched by Salisbury MP John Glen and Lapido Media in **2015**, to which Rooney contributed material, and which has raised journalists’ awareness of how to discuss religious difference in reporting political events; and her regular participation between **2014** and **2016** in the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Global Uncertainties, which included, for example, breakfast meetings on ‘Europe’s role on bringing peace to the Middle East’, ‘Security, religion and radicalisation’, and ‘Terrorist propaganda and social media’. In **2015**, Rooney’s role on this AAPG led to the Head of the Home Office’s counter\-radicalisation unit to set up a private meeting \(under Chatham House rules\) to discuss follow\-on implications from Rooney’s work on counter\-narratives **\[a\]**. 

 The most sustained impact of Rooney’s research on policy\-makers and the public has been in matters concerning Palestine. In the Palestinian case, impact entails generating public and policy support for the peace process and for Palestinian rights in the face of powerful lobbies, mainstream media, and Western governments that unilaterally support the Israeli government’s position. Rooney has accordingly worked with activists \(Palestinian and Israeli\) to thwart the censorship of Palestinian concerns. Activist Ghada Karmi confirms that Rooney ‘has been especially successful at engaging audiences over the importance of persisting with a valid Israeli\-Palestinian peace process’ **\[b\]**. 

 In **2014**, Rooney co\-produced her play *The Keepers of Infinite Space* for a nearly sold\-out three\-week run at the Park Theatre in London, including three platform debates about issues raised in the play, such as cultural resistance, the prison system, and human rights. Reviewers noted the effect of the play on its audiences: ‘it is necessary and bold political theatre, and it will have you thinking for days’ \(Everything Theatre\); this play ‘takes an iron grip on you’ \(WhatsOnStage\); ‘This is very much for people who want to see theatre exploring important issues whilst helping to illuminate’ \( *Time Out*\). Al Jazeera featured the production in a news interview to make the point that British theatre could present a humanising view of Palestinian prisoners, thus correcting the international perception of a British lack of concern **\[c\]**. 

 In **2015**, Rooney collaborated with William Parry, then with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, to co\-direct *Breaking the* *Generations* **\[R2\]**, which is based on Rooney’s research into the violation of the medical rights of Palestinian prisoners. The film had a range of public screenings in **2016** and **2017** \(e.g., at the 2016 Toronto Palestine Film Festival; at the 2017 Medact Health Through Peace Conference; and at events organised by both Palestinian and Israeli NGOs, including Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association; the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel; and Physicians for Human Rights Israel\). In **2018**, the film was shortlisted for the AHRC Medical Humanities Medal; in **2021**, Ken Loach approached co\-director William Parry about the possibility of future screenings of the film. 

 The film has been used to raise awareness among UK parliamentarians for the cause of Palestinian human rights. Rooney chaired a session after a screening of the film at the Holyrood parliament on **9 December 2015**, organised by Philippa Whitford, then MP for Central Ayrshire, to brief MSPs on the film’s findings. Subsequent debates included: 1\) a Commons debate on **6 January 2016** on ‘Child Prisoners and Detainees in the Occupied Palestinian Territories’, in which Whitford expressly shared the concerns of the film; 2\) an address on the possibility for secular democracy in Israel and Palestine by the prize\-winning Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, followed by a Q&A session, on **24 May 2016,** organised by Rooney and Richard Burden MP, Chair of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Palestine; 3\) a public debate on the peace process and the One State solution with Ilan Pappé and Gideon Levy on **25 May 2016**, which attracted 180 attendees and was filmed for YouTube, achieving 27,000\+ viewings, with many comments highlighting its importance in demonstrating ways forward **\[d\]**. 

 The film **\[R2\]** was also taken up as a campaign tool between 2016 and 2017 by Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights \(LPHR\) and Medical Aid for Palestinians \(MAP\). Tareq Shrourou, Director of LPHR, notes that the film ‘has constituted an important campaign tool for us in building platforms with NGOs that share our concerns’, and that it was successful ‘in raising awareness of the issues at stake among different audiences \[LPHR\] engage\[s\] with, ranging from law students to lawyers to parliamentarians’ **\[e\].** Dr Aimee Shalan, Chief Executive of MAP, confirms the central use of the film ‘in a letter\-writing to MPs campaign’ **\[e\]**, which resulted in growing support for Early Day Motion 563 on Military Detention of Palestinian Children by Israeli Authorities’, tabled on **20 November 2017**, signed by 145 MPs across six parties, and debated in the Commons on **7 February 2018**. Marsha de Cordova MP, then Shadow Minister for Work and Pensions, echoed the title and argument of the film in her speech at this debate when she noted that the detention of Palestinian children is a ‘system \[…\] designed to repress, crush and intimidate generation after generation of Palestinians’ **\[d\]**. The outcome of the debate was a resolution to support justice for child prisoners. 

 **Community\- and Trust\-Building Through Arts Activism** 

 Rooney’s research has also enabled community\- and trust\-building initiatives in various post\-conflict societies. Her film *White Flags* **\[R4\]**, made to disseminate Lebanese expertise on these matters, has been shown in galleries and at events internationally, including in Lebanon, Croatia, Cyprus \( **2015**\), and Egypt \( **2016**\), with media coverage. The Nicosia screening on World Poetry Day **2015** exceptionally brought people together across sectarian divides and provided impetus for the ensuing bridge\-building anthology *Nicosia Beyond* *Barriers* \(Saqi Books, 2018\), whose editors participated in the event and drew inspiration from it. The film was screened at the Freud Museum, London, in **2015**, and it has been taken up by Brazilian psycho\-social professionals working in the favelas of Puerto Rico for repeat screenings in the context of the Newton Fund/Brazil\-UK Testimonial Clinics Programme and Professional Development Centres for Psychological Repair and Tackling Violence. The UK partner for that cooperation confirms that ‘the film’s ideas on trust building were felt to be most usefully applicable to the psychotherapy practices of Brazilian colleagues’ **\[f\]**. 

 Drawing on the Lebanese initiatives explored in *White Flags* **\[R4\]**, Rooney furthered local public engagement in post\-revolutionary Egypt through involving disadvantaged neighbourhoods in their shared cultural heritage. While heritage is mainly managed at an institutional level in Egypt, Rooney introduced arts activist approaches to community engagement in historic Cairo. Fekri Hassan, former adviser to the Egyptian Ministry of Culture, confirms that Rooney’s work helped to ‘open up new venues for how heritage is conceived and to promote investment in literature, music and art as a contribution to Egypt’s cultural capital’ **\[g\]**. Ventures included a **2016** memorabilia exhibition mounted by the High Institute for Folk Arts and co\-curated with the local residents of El\-Moez Street; an art exhibition in **2017** at Beit el\-Sinaari showcasing the work of young artists responding to the ‘living heritage’ of the area **\[g; h\]**; and workshops in **2016** on Egyptian dream interpretation involving local sheikhs \(responsible for the shrine of Ibn Sirin, author of *Taabir Al Ro’oya* \[ *Interpretation of Dreams*\]\) and working\-class residents in relation to social dreaming. A recent book chapter \( **2019**\) about these dream interpretation workshops describes their outcomes as ‘a new methodology’ and ‘a shared aesthetic language across cultures’ **\[i\]**, noting the benefits of the project to the local community. 

 Rooney’s work with the band Oxford Maqam, a UK\-based Arabic ensemble comprising vocalists and musicians, led to the rediscovery a lost strand of musical heritage \(the Nahda\) being brought to Egyptian musicologists and musicians, enabling them to revive this tradition at a concert on **25 March 2017** at the Egyptian Centre for Culture and the Arts \(Makan\) in Cairo for the benefit of local audiences **\[i\]**. In addition, a new tour guide map of El\-Moez Street was produced, together with a new Naguib Mahfouz walking tour map **\[g; i\]**. The outputs of the project were taken up by the Egyptian Ministries of Tourism and Culture, with whom Rooney’s Egyptian colleagues have continued to work in the area of folk and popular arts. Fekri Hassan confirms that: ‘One of the main achievements of the project is a policy brief to governments, universities and the public with a plan for future investment in cultural heritage as a driver of economic and social development’ **\[g\]**. 

 **Furthering Creative Arts Exchanges and Education through Consultancies** 

 Rooney’s expertise in working with artists in the Middle East led to her invitation to act as consultant curator of the **2016** Masāfāt festival organised by the Institute of Contemporary Arts \(ICA\), taking place in Cairo and London. The Curator of Education Partnerships at the ICA confirms that Rooney’s ‘expertise \[…\] in the area of contemporary Middle Eastern culture was essential for the development of the 2016 Masāfāt Festival’ and led directly to practitioner exchanges between young UK and Arab film\-makers and musicians **\[j\]**. Rooney has also acted as international consultant for Qatar Foundation arts projects and for research at the Doha Institute \( **2017\-18**\) concerned with understanding the cultural transnationalism of the Arab uprisings. She has briefed civil servants, arts organisation CEOs, funders, and researchers at the Centre for Science and Policy \(Cambridge\) on social interventions through the arts. This work has resulted in a confidential policy briefing entitled ‘An overview of UK policy priorities and how the arts and humanities can help to address them’, in which Rooney is quoted **\[k\]**. 

 In **2019**, due to her work on Palestinian child prisoners, Rooney was appointed a Trustee of the charity Ajyal Foundation for Education, which supports the rehabilitation of conflict\-affected children through creative educational projects with schools. Rooney’s work on how the prison system is used to break resilience **\[R1\]** is central to Ajyal’s new socio\-emotional learning programme, as confirmed by its CEO and co\-founder: ‘Ajyal has benefitted from \[Rooney’s\] research on how resilience is undermined in a Palestinian context with a view to how it may be rebuilt, along with the re\-building of trust’ **\[l\]**. The programme helps to re\-engage conflict\-affected pupils who are struggling with their schooling through a holistic approach to education. It has been rolled out to six schools in the West Bank with the support of the Palestinian Ministry of Education, directly benefiting ‘103 educators and \[…\] 1885 children currently attending the schools’ **\[l\]**. In **2020**, Ajyal put together an education pack for Palestinians needing to home school due to social isolation during the pandemic, over which Rooney was consulted **\[l\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Dr Antonis Alexandridis of Kent Business School in 2016 for Eurobank Property Services \(a leading Greek and Romanian mortgage lender\) resulted in an automatic mass valuation system for the real estate sector. The new tool was implemented by Eurobank Property Services in relation to its mortgage valuations from 2016 onwards, and helped reduce the risk of non\-performing loans \(i.e. those with property as collateral\). The tool was also used by the Greek Ministry of Finance and the European Commission to objectively define the value of real\-estate properties in Greece and to inform the tax rate applied to individual properties. The introduction of the system resulted in a range of efficiencies for the bank and cost savings for its clients. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The need for objective and systematic assessment of real\-estate property values has always been important. This need became all the more essential following the Eurozone crisis in 2014, when EU countries started exiting bailout programmes and banks needed extra assurances on the value of properties before issuing mortgages, to help reduce the proportion of non\-performing loans.  Governments require similar information, before they can set annual property tax rates. As a result, banks, lenders, and government bodies need to find ways to provide fast and accurate real\-estate valuations at frequent intervals. However, in countries such as Greece and Romania, property markets are in their infancy. Financial institutions see them as inefficient, non\-homogeneous, and governed by a consistent lack of information. This presents significant challenges to the accurate valuation of real\-estate property in these national contexts. 

 Alexandridis’ expertise lies in the areas of mathematical modelling and forecasting. Together with Professor Zapranis Achilleas of the University of Macedonia, he developed a statistical methodology for modelling real\-world problems using wavelet neural networks in the context of financial applications **\[R1, R2\]**. This enabled him to address the problem of real\-estate valuation in non\-homogenous, newly developed markets by developing an automatic mass valuation system \(referred to variously as AMVS or AMV in the documentation cited in this case study\) **\[R3, R4\]**. The model used a large database of historical prices from Greece, Romania, and Serbia to obtain accurate property valuations for these markets. Alexandridis’ research applied a non\-linear automatic valuation method based on an optimised machine\-learning technique or neural network. This method forecasts real\-estate prices based on characteristics found in hedonic indexes. 

 Alexandridis worked in collaboration with two senior managers of Eurobank Property Services, Dr Dimitrios Papastamos \(Head of Research and Analytics Division\) and Dimitrios Andritsos \(Chief Executive Officer\). With their input, Alexandridis built a three\-layer neural network –consisting of an ‘input variables’ layer, a ‘hidden units’ layer, and an ‘outputs layer’. The novelty of this method stemmed from the use of a black\-box model that was presented with a training and a validation sample. The use of this training\-validation combined sample helped Alexandridis to select the appropriate number of hidden units, and to identify the statistically significant variables for real\-estate valuation purposes. These regularisation methods fine\-tuned the neural network to avoid the over\-fitting of the method to a given sample, which would have rendered it invalid for other datasets. The use of these techniques in this project \(and across Alexandridis’ previous research\) to avoid over\-fitting has proven to be an especially innovative approach, which improves the accuracy of real\-world predictions and outperforms other standard valuation methods such as MRA or SMV **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. 

 The results of Alexandridis’ research with Eurobank Property Services indicated that the proposed method **\[R3\]** outperformed the bank’s previous property valuation method by reducing the out\-of\-sample forecasting Mean Square Error \(MSE\) from 21% to 15%. Alexandridis and his collaborators also identified the property characteristics that led to large forecasting errors. The results indicated that the forecasting error increases when the area of the residence exceeds 120m<sup>2</sup>, the property is a house as opposed to a flat, or when a large unbuilt land area is included. Similarly, properties built before 1950 lead to larger forecasting errors, as the conservation status of the properties and alterations it may have undergone have effects on the actual value. However, the analysis by Alexandridis and his collaborators at Eurobank Property Services revealed that neural networks are less sensitive to changes in these characteristics than are other methods. The results indicated that the proposed methodology constituted an accurate tool for property valuation in non\-homogeneous, newly developed markets. The resulting automatic mass valuation system can be adapted in applications such as mortgage quality control or appraisal review, loss mitigation analysis, portfolio valuation, and appraisal process redesign. 

 Findings from this project were published in 2018 in the *Journal of the Operational Research Society* **\[R3\]**, having previously been disseminated at a conference in 2017 **\[R4\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The global financial crisis of 2007, and the following Eurozone crisis of 2009\-14, resulted in a significant decline in house prices in Greece and Romania; as a result, mortgage lenders lost large amounts of capital through defaulted mortgage loans and other non\-performing loans. Following Dr Alexandridis’ consultancy work with Eurobank Property Services in 2016, a new automatic mass valuation system was implemented by financial institutions in Greece and Romania, and also adopted by government departments in Greece and the European Commission to determine taxation thresholds. 

 **Greek Ministry of Finance and European Commission: aiding reform of property taxation in Greece** 

 By 2016, Greek taxpayers were paying seven times more in property tax than in 2009, despite the huge increases in unemployment and drops in living standards following the Eurozone crisis of 2009\-14. According to European Commission figures for 2015, the only EU countries with higher property taxes were France and Britain. Within this context, the Greek Ministry of Finance decided in 2018 to revise its unified property tax, using accurate values to determine property taxation rate intervals. To achieve this **\[a\]**, the Ministry needed accurate data on the current value of each residential property in Greece. In June 2018, the Ministry contracted Eurobank Property Services to conduct a pilot survey of 829 real\-estate zones across the country. This was achieved using the automatic mass valuation system developed by Dr Alexandridis to accurately define the market value of real\-estate properties in the surveyed zones **\[b, c\]**. 

 Following this pilot, Eurobank Property Services won a tender from the European Commission \(in July 2018\) to objectively define the value of real estate in the country’s remaining 10,000 building zones **\[d, e, f\]**. Eurobank Property Services \(by then operating as Cerved Property Services\) continued to use the automatic mass valuation system to carry out annual valuations for the Greek Ministry of Finance and the European Commission to inform the tax rate applied to each property **\[g\]**. 

 **Greece: improving property valuation processes for Eurobank Property Services** 

 The Eurozone crisis left Greek banks with a high proportion of non\-performing loans with real estate as a collateral. This put the financial sector in Greece under considerable strain. Alexandridis’ automatic mass valuation system \(AMV/AMVS\) enabled Eurobank Property Services to better assess the value and risks associated with lending against property and helped reduce running costs through the optimisation of its operations **\[g\]**. 

 More specifically, since 2016, Eurobank Property Services \(now Cerved Property Services\) has used Alexandridis’ automatic mass valuation system to: 

-  Revalue its real\-estate portfolio \(comprising approximately 4,000 loans with real estate as collateral\) twice a year. 

-  Revalue several non\-performing loan portfolios for clients such as Elliott Advisors or Bain Capital. Both organisations used the automatic mass valuation system in 2019 to revalue five non\-performing loan portfolios \(approximately 50,000 properties in total\) owned by three systemic retail banks in Greece. 

-  In 2019 and 2020, more than 5,000 valuations have been reviewed by external appraisers using the automatic mass valuation system as a substitute for manual reviewing processes **\[g\]**. 

 In summary, the automatic mass valuation system has improved the company’s forecasting and valuation methods from 2015 onwards. This was achieved through a 6% reduction in forecasting errors \(from 21% to 15% **\[R3\]**\), as well as through reducing the time required to conduct valuations on this scale. **\[g\]**. As Cerved Property Services’ Head of Research and Analytics Division, explained: ‘Every individual \(AMV\) exercise required the commitment of max 2 FTEs for an average period of 2 weeks. The alternative being desktop valuation reports practically would be a blocking factor for CPS’s valuation division, since will be required 10 FTEs for 6 months to complete the above projects on time.’ **\[g\]** 

 **Romania: improving the valuation practices of leading mortgage lenders** 

 The successful application of the automatic mass valuation system in Greece led Eurobank \(Romania\), Eurobank Property Services \(Romania\), and Bancpost S.A. \(Romania\) to adopt the same approach from 2015 onwards. Given the specific challenges and characteristics presented by the Romanian housing market, Alexandridis adapted the system accordingly **\[h\]**. 

 Introducing a new version of the automatic mass valuation system enabled Eurobank Property Services to perform mass revaluations of very large residential portfolios in a more cost\- and time\-effective manner. The company carried out four mass revaluation exercises involving approximately 20,000 residential collaterals between 2015 and 2018. Achieving this using the previous manual, desktop approach would have occupied the entire valuation department \(seven full\-time employees\) for 16 months. By using Alexandridis’ automatic mass valuation system, each of these exercises occupied just two employees over an average period of three weeks. In addition, using the system reduced the verification time of a valuation report by approximately 0.5 days on average **\[i\]**. The system was also deployed in real time to check valuations from professional real\-estate valuators and to minimise fraud **\[i\]**. 

 **Benefiting clients** 

 From the perspective of Eurobank/Cerved Property Services’ clients, the utilisation of the automatic mass valuation system has led to significant cost savings. The use of this tool meant that valuations carried out using the automatic mass valuation system \(AMV\) are, according to standard banking costs fees, five times cheaper than the alternative desktop valuation approach **\[g\]**. As the General Manager of Eurobank Property Services in Romania stated: ‘From the bank’s/client’s perspective the utilization of statistical tools – including AMV – has led to a significant cost saving impact. Indicatively we can refer to the 4 \[…\] exercises of approx. 20,000 collaterals. The cumulative fee for these projects was roughly €130,000 while assuming that the same projects would be performed in a desktop approach and in accordance with the agreed fee lists the overall cost would reach €780,000, roughly 5 times more than the actual fees paid.’  **\[i\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Leston\-Bandeira’s research has changed the thinking of UK and international parliamentary officials on developing and implementing public engagement practices within their respective legislatures. In the UK, Leston\-Bandeira’s research has significantly influenced key elements of House of Commons public engagement practice, specifically in making its e\-petitions system more effective. Internationally, her research has informed and guided the parliaments of Australia, Brazil and Portugal on how to design and reform their public engagement efforts to make them more effective, more citizen\-led, and better positioned to shape parliamentary decisions. This has helped address the critical challenge of acute mistrust of politics in contemporary democracies. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Trust in political institutions in western democracies has been in decline over the last few decades, with only 19% in the UK saying they trust Parliament in 2019 **\[1\]**. Faced with rising levels of political disaffection, parliaments have become more pro\-active in developing ways of engaging with the public. However, this has been a slow and inconsistent process. Professor Leston\-Bandeira has researched this development, identifying how specific characteristics of parliamentary institutions influence the effectiveness of public engagement activities. 

 The discipline of legislative studies has traditionally focused on the relationship between parliament and government, neglecting parliaments’ relationship with citizens. Leston\-Bandeira made a significant contribution in shifting this focus toward research on parliamentary public engagement \(PPE\). Through comparative research across different legislatures **\[1\]**, she has examined specific forms of public engagement that have become particularly popular with parliaments, such as digital engagement and the use of e\-petitions. Her findings in this area can be summarised as: 

-  Identification of a systemic ‘institutional representation’ of parliament, characterised by a collective and abstract style of representation, which constrains the practices of PPE **\[1\]**; 

-  Establishment of the importance of symbolic representation \(i.e. where representation is embodied in symbols, such as a building, rather than political messages\) in the way the public develops connections to the parliamentary institution, and through which public engagement can act **\[1,3,4\]**; 

-  Identification of the importance of integrating the activity of public engagement with actual parliamentary business rather than developing it separately **\[2,4,5\]**; 

-  Evaluation of what makes for effective PPE, namely that it should be issue\-based, go where the people are, and use a multiplicity of channels of communication and methods **\[2,4,5\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research identified how the structures and processes of parliament – what she calls ‘institutional representation’ – inhibit implementation of public engagement activities. Parliaments are collective institutions lacking a single voice that speaks for the institution **\[1,3\]**. They serve multiple agendas of different actors, often in conflict with each other and the institution itself. Moreover, parliaments are highly visible institutions accountable to the public. The combination of these characteristics hinders organisational decision\-making, rendering parliaments particularly cumbersome, slow and risk\-averse institutions; all of which are detrimental to the development of public engagement, which requires innovative, quick and flexible decision\-making processes. Leston\-Bandeira’s research into parliamentary initiatives implementing public engagement has shown them to be led often by procedural objectives, such as the formal process to consider a bill, rather than engagement\-oriented objectives, such as listening to the public’s views **\[2,4\-6\]**. The research has outlined that PPE relies mainly on the input from parliamentary officials, rather than politicians, and *avoids* politics **\[1\-3\]**, which explains why symbolic representation has become a key vehicle for facilitating engagement between legislatures and the public. Her co\-developed research with the UK House of Commons Petitions Committee provided further evidence of the value of integrating public engagement with parliamentary business and focusing on the public rather than parliamentary processes **\[4\-6\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s analysis of specific public engagement activities, such as e\-petitions **\[4\-6\]** and the integration of the public’s voice into the legislative process **\[2\]**, has enabled a better understanding of how PPE can become more effective. The research stresses the importance of thinking carefully about the parliamentary processes in place and avoiding the pitfalls of developing public engagement as an add\-on. It also shows that the public engages with parliament on issues that matter to them, rather than because of a generic desire to engage with democracy **\[2,4,5\]**. This implies an approach to public engagement focused on the public and their concerns, rather than on parliament and its processes, as well as one that integrates the public’s input into parliamentary business, rather than as a parallel activity.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research has \(i\) altered parliamentary officials’ understanding of public engagement in Australia, Brazil, Portugal and the UK, and \(ii\) changed how public engagement is implemented in the Brazilian, Portuguese and UK parliaments. Her research has provided an evidence\-base and policy recommendations that have helped parliamentarians better understand, enhance and promote engagement with the public. Whilst parliaments have therefore been the direct beneficiaries of her research, the general public also ultimately benefits through access to more effective mechanisms \(e.g. e\-petitions\) and greater capacity within parliaments to facilitate this engagement. 

 **i\) Changing understandings of public engagement within parliaments** 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s longstanding expertise on PPE has led to invitations from several legislatures to be part of key commissions reviewing public engagement processes and/or to give evidence to key inquiries. She was first invited in 2014 by the Speaker of the UK House of Commons to be the only academic among eight core members of the *Digital Democracy Commission* \(DDC\). Since then, drawing on her research developed at the University of Leeds, she has continued to be involved in the implementation of the DDC report’s recommendations within the UK Parliament, engaging with officials on a regular basis across a range of services, from committees to digital engagement. This has led to further invitations and a deeper working relationship with parliamentary officials in a range of legislatures besides the UK Parliament. In 2016, she was invited by the President of the Portuguese Parliament to be the special adviser to their *Digital Parliament Commission \(*DPC\), which was followed by an invitation to help shape and give evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s *Parliamentary Reform Commission* \(PRC\) in November 2016. These Commissions and their subsequent implementation work drew heavily from her research **\[1\-3,5,6\]**, with Leston\-Bandeira’s input being instrumental in highlighting the importance of focusing parliamentary tools on the needs of the public, rather than on parliamentary processes. The former UK House of Commons Speaker explains that her *‘evidence\-based approach’* made *‘an enormous contribution to the success of the \[DDC\]’* **\[A\]**, whilst the Portuguese Parliament’s President remarks that collaborating with Leston\-Bandeira was *‘invaluable’* for the DPC **\[B\]**. 

 In 2019, Leston\-Bandeira played an important role in the House of Commons Liaison Committee’s inquiry into the effectiveness of select committees. Besides her formal submission of evidence, she was closely involved in the set\-up of the public engagement themes of this inquiry, as well as shaping the inquiry’s recommendations. She was firstly invited to a private meeting of the Committee, where she made key contributions, as recognised by the Former Chair of the Committee in her letter commending Leston\-Bandeira’s involvement **\[C\]**; this was followed by meetings with the Committee’s clerks in the run up to the writing of the inquiry’s report. Leston\-Bandeira’s research on PPE became a key piece of evidence convincing the Committee of the need for a more systemic approach to public engagement and of the importance of listening rather than broadcasting, reflected in the report’s first heading about public engagement \( **\[D\]**, p. 22\). Her evidence was cited 17 times in the report to support a move towards a more integrated use of public engagement across committee work, rather than as a parallel or an add\-on activity, and the adoption of more accessible formats in committee reports in order to reach a wider audience of citizens. One of the most senior officials of the House of Commons at the time, the Clerk of Committees, stated that the ‘ *landmark report*’ established that committees should ‘ *turn towards the public in all committee activity’* **\[D\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research has also impacted upon the planning of public engagement by the House of Lords, namely through the written and oral evidence she submitted to its Constitution Committee in 2018, specifically on effectively integrating public engagement into the law\-making process **\[2,a\]**. This evidence was cited in the inquiry’s report, with paragraphs 110 to 112 listing further opportunities for public engagement in the legislative process, directly following Leston\-Bandeira’s own recommendations **\[E\]**. 

 Beyond Westminster, Leston\-Bandeira’s research has informed the Scottish Parliament PRC’s 2017 conclusions, namely recommendations no. 62 and 67 , which call for the creation of a Committee Engagement Unit and a *‘more personalised system of feedback to those who engage with it*’ \( **\[F\]**, p. 61, 66\). Both recommendations reflect Leston\-Bandeira’s oral and written evidence calling for a better integration between public engagement and parliamentary business by focussing on committees and being issue\-led, which makes sure the feedback loop to citizens is closed. The new Unit was subsequently created in 2018, with which Leston\-Bandeira has continued collaboration and direct policy change. As noted by the Head of the Committee, Leston\-Bandeira *‘was a key influence on the remit given to my unit… focusing on issues\-based engagement in the work of committees \(…\) we have drawn on \[her\] research in developing our engagement practice \(…\) in particular her findings about the importance to citizens of the engagement process \(…\) \[and\] on the role of social media in public engagement to develop our use of social media towards dialogue rather than just information giving’* **\[F\]**. 

 As outlined above, Leston\-Bandeira has also changed the thinking of parliamentary officials beyond the UK. In 2019 she was invited for a Visiting Fellowship in Brazil where she advised officials in the Brazilian Congress on the integration of public engagement into parliamentary structures, based on her research on e\-petitions **\[6\]**. The Head of the e\-Citizenship Programme of the Brazilian Senate confirms, *‘her research on the UK e\-petitions system \(…\) enlightened me and directly influenced me \(…\). This \[new method\] enables citizens to have a clearer perception of how their input into the Senate’s e\-Citizenship programme has led to specific draft bills and other outputs’* **\[G\]**. The international reach of her research is further demonstrated by invitations from the petitions committees of the Australian Parliament and of Western Australia’s State Legislature, which cited specifically her expertise when inviting her: *‘given your work on parliament and public engagement, the Committee is interested in your insights into the role of petitions in a modern parliament*’ **\[H\]**. Leston\-Bandeira’s evidence was cited eight times in the Australian Parliament’s report on their petitions system, in relation to how debates on petitions are conducted. The committee subsequently recommended the introduction of debates on petitions to enhance petitions’ visibility **\[H\]**. 

 **ii\) Changing how parliaments implement public engagement** 

 Besides changing understandings of public engagement, Leston\-Bandeira’s research has also impacted upon actual practices, with consequent benefits for both officials and the general public. She was involved with key preparatory work for the new UK Parliament e\-petitions system launched in 2015. Since then, over 70,000 petitions have been submitted to this new system, with over 21,000 accepted, nearly 200 debated and over 24 million unique signatures. Since joining Leeds in 2015, she has worked closely with the new Petitions Committee to provide research evidence and expert advice on the new system’s processes and policy, to make it more impactful in terms of policy effect and petitioners’ satisfaction. This has been facilitated via over 100 regular meetings, email correspondence with the Committee staff, co\-development of research and participation in events. 

 These activities were supported by an ESRC\-funded Impact Acceleration Account Knowledge Exchange Fellowship for Leston\-Bandeira awarded in 2016 **\[b\]**, which allowed her to shadow the Petitions Committee in 2016/17 and study its workings. This has led to continuing knowledge exchange and co\-production with the Committee \(with over 30 meetings with Committee staff and in excess of 100 email exchanges since the Fellowship\), developing further research on the processes implementing the e\-petitions system and petitioners’ reactions to these **\[5,6\]**. This resulted in a 2017 report to the Committee, outlining five overarching recommendations and 39 specific recommendations **\[4\]**, which has had a strong impact on the e\-petitioning process. As one of the Committee’s officials remarked: *‘Cristina’s research showed us that we were concentrating very much on what we could do, on changes that we could make \(…\). But looking at the report and the recommendations, it was quite clear that that was exactly our bias – it didn’t reflect what needed to be done to achieve our aim of really enhancing the relationship between Parliament and the public’* **\[I\]**. As a result, the Petitions Committee has adopted Leston\-Bandeira’s 2017 report as a key element in its development, utilising her recommendations to plan further developments in the system, directly informing the Committee’s Public Engagement Strategy. A Committee official explained the importance of the report for the Committee’s self\-reflection: *‘the report and her work is frequently brought up in discussions about how we can do better, when we examine our working practices and is used as evidence to support the changes we need’* **\[J\]**. This led to changes, such as a differentiated focus on petitioners, by inviting them to the parliamentary debate of their e\-petition, and an enhancement of the petitions debates so as to be more inclusive and integrated with parliamentary business. Specifically, the Committee used her research *‘to evidence the need for changes to the e\-petitions site, such as changing the language used’* and *‘to bid successfully for resources to connect petitioners with other items of parliamentary business related to the topic of their petition, which will affect how millions of people engage with Parliament’* **\[J\]**. 

 Besides her work with the Petitions Committee, Leston\-Bandeira has influenced how digital engagement is implemented in the House of Commons. For example, following a DDC recommendation to introduce ‘digital debates’, she led on a collaborative project with the House of Commons to investigate enhancement of digital engagement. Thanks to this collaboration, in 2019 three committees \(on plastics use in packaging, pavement parking, and endangered species\) accepted suggestions based on her research **\[2,4,6\]** to link their inquiries to ongoing petitions. This helped the Committees reach a wider public affected by the issues addressed in the inquiries \(for example, in excess of 300,000 people in the case of the report into plastics use;  [EFRA 2019](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvfru/2080/2080.pdf), p.5\). 

 In addition, Leston\-Bandeira’s research **\[6\]** has informed the new e\-petitions system and digital platforms in the Portuguese Parliament, inaugurated in 2018, by making it more public centred and enabling the public to track the progress of their e\-petition. This resulted in a completely new approach on the parliament’s website, adopting open data, and a more citizen\-oriented communication approach. The President of the Portuguese Parliament explains that Leston\-Bandeira’s work *‘was decisive to develop even further the investment on citizens’ participation and to advance towards more and better instances of bilateral communication with citizens \(namely through the creation of the online platforms, on Parliament’s new portal, the submission and collection of signatures of petitions, citizens’ legislative initiatives and popular referendums’ initiatives\)’* **\[B\]**. Her research **\[5,6\]** has also led to changes in elements of the Brazilian Senate’s *E\-Cidadania* platform to make the outputs of petitioning clearer to those citizens making suggestions for policy change **\[G\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research has therefore both affected how officials perceive the purpose and use of public engagement, and resulted in changes in the actual practice of public engagement of at least three parliaments.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The timely creation of accurate flood models has assumed large\-scale significance in an era of climate change. Researchers at the University of Exeter \(UoE\) developed a cellular automaton flood simulation method \(CAFlood\) that models flood risk significantly more rapidly than conventional approaches. This method has been adopted by national and international governmental organisations and industries to provide early warning flood forecasting, analyse flood risk at higher resolutions and quantify uncertainties in complex scenarios. Impacts include: 

 **Protecting people, properties and businesses** 

-  £78m potential damage prevented by £3.4m Torbay flood defence investment 

-  2.6 million people protected in Taipei City, Taiwan 

 **Benefits to the water, reinsurance and risk assessment sectors** 

-  Improved risk analysis for global reinsurance companies \(e.g. MunichRE\) 

-  Reduced water main burst damage by 60% for Thames Water 

 **Influencing policy and risk strategies** 

-  Underpinned the Environment Agency case for scalable flood risk assessment systems 

-  Developed strategies to protect over 970,000 people in Naples, Italy 

-  Supported the development of community consensus on the implementation of sustainable land management practices 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research is based on **Keedwell’s** work in developing novel algorithmic solutions to problems in the water sector, including the application of cellular automata to the optimal design of water distribution networks **\[3.1\]**.   Here, the research was carried out by a multidisciplinary team involving **Keedwell** \(Computer Science\), Savic and Djordjevic \(Engineering\), together with Chen, Guidolin and Ghimire and three PhD students, Duncan, Austin and Gibson. This EPSRC\-supported research \(EP/H015736/1, £425k, 2010–2013\) investigated a radically different cellular\-automaton approach to modelling flood dynamic behaviour over 2D terrain and created a novel cellular automata flood modelling system \(CAFlood\) implemented for both stand\-alone and distributed computing platforms. **\[3.2\]**. 

 The approach adapted the well\-known artificial life method of cellular automata \(CA\), previously used to model physical systems, epidemiology and bacterial colonies, to the problem of flood simulation.  The approach makes use of the core CA principles of *localism*, *homogeneity* and *parallelism* coupled with exploitation of modern graphical processing unit \(GPU\) designs and novel hydraulic modelling approaches to deliver transformational computational efficiency increases that have in turn enabled applications that would not have been previously possible. 

 The main findings from the research underpinning this impact demonstrated that: 

1.  The use of cellular automata in the simulation of flooding provides discretization of space and time, which in turn leads to increased speeds of 10\-20x over existing flood modelling techniques. 

1.  The benefits of the cellular automaton approach are amplified when adapted for the architecture of modern GPUs.  GPUs lend themselves to the local, distributed computation of a cellular automaton and the intelligent deployment of the native ‘lattice’ of CAFLOOD models on GPU technologies enables transformational speed increases. 

1.  The flexibility of the cellular automaton approach provides the mechanism to innovate and optimise cell sizes, shapes and state\-transition rulesets to serve a variety of high impact applications in flood modelling. 

 The research findings were applied to benchmark \(Environment Agency benchmarks\) and real\-world flooding instances \(Torbay\) to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and the potential for faster modelling through CA.  The results were published in the Journal of Hydroinformatics **\[3.2\]** and Environmental Modelling and Software **\[3.3\]**, with the underpinning theoretical work on the GPU acceleration of cellular automata published in the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing **\[3.4\]**. Work on the software framework **\[3.5\]**, and the potential for automation of state transition rules through genetic programming **\[3.6\]** were disseminated via international conferences. Furthermore, a PhD was awarded on this topic in 2015 \(Gibson; supervisors: **Keedwell** & Savic\).   In late 2018, follow\-on funding of £39K was awarded via a competitive process from the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account at the University of Exeter to further explore the commercialisation of the CAFlood system.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Climate change is leading to increased frequency and severity of flooding, and in the UK, damages from flooding and coastal change are already high \(estimated at an average of £1 billion per annum \( *UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Synthesis Report: priorities for the next five years \(2016; p32\)*\). The combination of increased extreme weather events and population growth will lead to even greater impacts and globally it has been estimated that by the end of the century coastal flooding events could threaten assets worth up to $14.2 trillion worldwide, one fifth of the global gross domestic product.  CAFlood was developed to help mitigate the risks of flooding through accurate modelling of pluvial and fluvial flooding and coupled with a step\-change in computational efficiency has resulted in the following impact. 

 **Protecting people, properties and businesses** 

-  **Securing investment of £3.4m for the Torbay flood defence system, that will protect 3,000 people and prevent up to £78m in potential damage** \[5.1; 2018\]  Torbay Council, as part of an EU Horizon 2020 project \(EU\-CIRCLE\), adopted CAFlood for high\-resolution flood risk assessment in Torquay, Paignton and Brixham under multiple current and future climate conditions and was used to evaluate the effectiveness of various adaptation measures. The results provided evidence that flood damage could be reduced from £78m to £0.2m by installing a secondary flood wall, safeguarding more than 3,000 people in 700 households, 330 commercial properties and 165 hotels **.** The uniquely rapid and accurate set of CAFlood simulations was key to Torbay Council securing £3.4m government investment in critical infrastructure to improve resilience against flooding. 

-  **200,000 households and over a million commuters benefited** \[5.2; 2019\]** 

 Taipei City Government worked with National Taiwan University \(NTU\) to build a flood forecasting and early warning system to strengthen the city’s response to flooding events. For example, flooding from Typhoon Nari in 2001 claimed 30 lives, affected over 1 million commuters and resulted in losses of over £1billion. Following an evaluation of flood simulation systems, NTU selected CAFlood in 2018 due to its computational efficiency and high accuracy. Collaborating with the UoE, NTU has successfully used CAFlood to inform the early warning system which has transformed the Taipei emergency services approach to flood crisis management. The high accuracy of CAFlood has enabled early warnings to be issued, so that citizens in identified hotspots can take measures to ensure safety \(for example through the evacuation of vulnerable residents to emergency shelters or the closure metro station entrances to protect the subway system\) and minimise disruption and damage. As a result, the 2.6 million population of Taipei City consisting of over 200,000 households and a million commuters in the Metropolitan Taipei Area are benefitting from this system based on CAFlood. 

-  **Other Organisations protecting people, properties and businesses with CAFlood** 

 CAFlood has been adopted by national and international industries and government organisations for fast flood risk assessment to protect citizens and businesses including organisations in Boston \(USA\), Bangalore \(India\), and Khulna \(Bangladesh\). The Slovenian environment agency \(ARSO\) has also adopted the software to establish an operational system to provide real\-time flood warning for Slovenia. RMS \(India\) have developed flood hazard layers using CAFlood for area in India, which in turn is being used by insurance companies to provide underwriting solutions. One Concern \(USA\) have adopted it to establish a scalable urban flood early warning and response system and engineering consultants JonesEdmunds \(USA\) has also used CAFlood in its development of environmental infrastructure solutions. 

 **Benefits from commercial applications** 

 Industrial commercialisation has been driven by the licencing of CAFlood Pro. The licences, although modest in value, are providing a valuable route for wider application of CAFlood across sectors such as global insurance/reinsurance and the US municipal market. 

-  **Flood risk assessment at continental scale for a major global re\-insurance industry** \[5.4; 2015\-2016\]**MunichRE, one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies \(revenue in 2019 \- €51.1bn, in 2017 alone they insured losses due to hurricanes and cyclones to a value of an estimated £135bn worldwide\) collaborated with UoE in 2014 to customise the software to meet the needs of large\-scale commercial applications. A £51K license and contract research package allowed the development of continental\-scale flood models covering thousands of events, such as tropical cyclones, in Asia and Australia, without requiring any additional computational infrastructure. They noted in May 2020 that, *“Since its development, we have made widespread use of the CAFlood model in the framework of the in\-house catastrophe modelling setup \[…\] CAFlood made a significant contribution to the competitiveness of our business during this period*”.  The use of CAFlood by MunichRE benefitted their clients through more accurate and efficient risk analysis and premium calibration, as well as provision of advice for better protection of clients’ assets **\[5.4\]**. Since then, another leading reinsurer, Swiss Re Group, tested CAFlood and confirmed that it was able to improve the resolution of their modelling, enabling a 10x improvement in the speed of their computations **\[5.5\]** *.* Also, the US climate risk analytics company, risQ, licensed CAFlood in January 2020 to analyse climate risk for the US municipal market, to ensure that project and investment decisions such as the construction of schools, hospitals or roads, are based on robust risk assessment models. **\[5.6\]** 

-  **Assisting Thames Water prioritise its maintenance strategy, contributing to 60% reduction in properties impacted by water main bursts** \[5.7; 2014\-2016\]** 

 CAFlood was adopted by an SME, ICS Consulting, through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with UoE, to simulate flooding caused by water main bursts. As a result, ICS secured a £100k contract with Thames Water \(the UK’s largest water company with 17 million customers\) to identify vulnerable locations within London at risk of flooding from these bursts. The 120,000 CAFlood pipe burst simulations took just one week to complete where conventional hydraulic models would have required months. From this information Thames Water prioritised high risk areas in a £247m maintenance programme that has helped drive a 60% reduction in properties affected by large bursts **\[5.8\]**. In addition to the economic benefits of protecting businesses and infrastructure, this has reduced the health and safety threats to significant numbers of people in London and the surrounding areas. 

-  **New Flood Risk Assessment products** 

 A new product, Infrastructure Flood Risk Assessment \(inFRA\) was created in 2018 as an outcome of the KTP with ICS Consulting, using CAFlood as its core engine **\[5.7\]**. inFRA has added significant additional capability to ICS’s consultancy and contributed to their growth. As a result, they were shortlisted for the Water Industry Achievement Awards in 2017. With this competitive advantage, ICS’s turnover with existing clients has increased by over £100k per year. inFRA has also led to a £100k contract with Scottish Water, and expansions into new markets in Europe, Canada and the US, which ahead of the Covid\-19 pandemic had been expected to contribute an additional £0.5m of annual exports by 2020 \(now expected by 2021\). 

 **Wider impacts on policy and risk strategies:** 

-  **Influencing flood risk policies/systems \(e.g. *National Flood Risk Assessment 2 \(NaFRA2\)  \[5.9; 2018\]** 

 The Environment Agency \(EA\) included the recommendation for a scalable flood risk assessment system in its NaFRA2 business case \(2018\) based on the demonstrated capability of CAFlood, as acknowledged by the EA’s Specialist Technical Input Group. 

-  **Strategies to protect over 970,000 people in Naples** **\[5.3; 2019\]** 

 The Italian government\-funded Centro Euro\-Mediterraneo sui Cambiomenti Climatic \(CMCC\) Foundation, adopted CAFlood in a pilot project for flood risk assessment in the city of Naples \(970,000 inhabitants\). The pilot in 2019 demonstrated the advantages of CAFlood over the CMCC’s existing system, saving 3 months and €12,000 for 30 simulations *.* CMCC have dedicated €40,000 per year for CAFlood applications to investigate flood risk in Naples under future climate change scenarios. The results are enabling CMCC to collaborate with the Municipality to develop adaptation strategies for future flood impact reduction and to protect the public. They plan to extend the application of CAFlood to pluvial flood modelling in other European cities. 

-  **Engaging communities in the implementation of sustainable flood minimisation approaches \[5.10; 2018\]** 

 CAFlood was fundamental to the Westcountry Rivers Trust \(WST\) use of serious \(educational\) games as a tool to facilitate public and policy dialogue on sustainable environmental management. The Cornish village of Millbrook was used a case study, which had suffered from serious floods in 2012, where traditional consultation and engagement exercises did not enable stakeholders to fully understand the cause of the flooding and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. WST developed a game based on high resolution CAFlood simulations with over 432 parameter combinations and used it to engage local residents, including farmers and parish councillors to develop a consensus on effective and sustainable flood management strategies. The CAFlood simulations transformed the attitude of 70% of the participants with regard to sustainable farming and drainage strategies. For WST the “ *…outcome has positively influenced the policy\-making process in that nature\-based solutions have been incorporated into Millbrook parish’s flood management strategies…to protect two thousand vulnerable citizens from the impact of flooding*”.

 **5.2**  National Taiwan University \(Taipei\) Letter 

 *“The high performance and reliability of CAFlood allows us to quickly evaluate citywide flood risk at high spatial resolution, such that hotspot areas can be identified in advance. The system has transformed the emergency services’ Standard Operation Procedure for flood crisis management. The model is utilised by our Emergency Operation Centre and gives them a 3 hour window to prioritise response missions to these hotspot areas identified by the model, to actively protect flood threatened areas. The emergency operation centre is now able to deploy its first responders to these high risk areas, to set up temporary defences and pumps to reduce flood levels. This safeguards critical infrastructure and lifeline services. For example, flood gates can be closed at the entrance of metro stations to protect the subway system.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Alternative cultures, defined as self\-organised events and spaces of a creative nature, are important markers of urban vitality. Working in conjunction with nightlife activists in Geneva, and with festival directors from Prague Fringe, Hollands’ long\-term research on such urban cultures has created beneficial impacts for independent nightlife and festival stakeholders by: \(a\) raising their profile and representation in contributing to urban creativity; \(b\) aiding their capacity, networks, and sustainability; and \(c\) challenging existing policy\-making to recognise and account for the importance of the alternative sector in fields like culture, licensing, and tourism. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Hollands’ long\-term research and engagement with alternative urban cultures **\[PUB 1\-6\]** has been instrumental in defining them as self\-organised events and spaces of a creative nature, including independently organised nightlife and arts spaces, and some types of fringe festivals. It has also critically questioned some of the limits of standard models of urban regeneration achieved through mainstream cultural provision and conventional tourism, such as gentrification, over\-tourism, and a ‘one size fits all’ governance \(particularly licensing\) regime. Finally, it has asserted the important idea that ‘real’ urban creativity is rooted in the strength and sustainability of its alternative cultures, spaces, and movements, and that they provide the basis for imagining more democratic and sustainable models for cultural and tourism policy. Hollands’ research has been supported by the ESRC, with two grants, first in 2000\-2002 to investigate the operation of urban night\-time economies \(including alternative nightlife\) **\[GRANT 1\]**, then in 2008\-2009 looking at the transformative power of an alternative arts organisation **\[GRANT 2\]**. This research was supplemented by a later Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship \(2015\-2017\) which examined the potential alternative cultural organisations and movements have for enhancing urban creativity and change **\[GRANT 3\]**. Within these broader fields of enquiry, the two areas that have been directed to impact have been on defining and nurturing creative alternative nightlife and arts spaces in Geneva \(for the past decade\), and a body of work championing Prague Fringe as engendering new forms of cultural and tourism experiences \(going back nearly two decades\). 

 For instance, Hollands’ pioneering work with Paul Chatterton \(Newcastle University at the time\) on the night\-time economy, led to their significant research\-based methodological distinction between ‘alternative’ and ‘mainstream’ nightlife cultures and spaces **\[PUB 1\]**. In contrast to the alcohol based, commercial monoculture of the mainstream, they emphasised the experimental, accessible, and self\-regulating ‘do\-it\-yourself’ character of alternative nightlife, found in independent bars and clubs, cultural/ art squats, and the ‘free party scene’. They also outlined the need for this alternative sector to protest, organise, and create progressive pressure groups to challenge the dominance of the ‘corporate nightlife machine’. These research findings have had a particular resonance over the last decade with the alternative creative sector in the city of Geneva, which has had to combat soaring property prices, increased gentrification of cultural life, and draconian legislation preventing alternative venues from thriving \(i.e. anti\-squatting and licensing restrictions\) **\[PUB 2\]**. In 2010 Geneva experienced a wave of ‘night protests’ which set in motion a whole series of public reports, events, and debates centrally informed by Hollands’ and Chatterton’s research and methodology **\[PUB 1\]**. This impact pathway culminated in the creation and operation of an influential nightlife pressure group, called the Grand Council of the Night, as well as the emergence of other alternative cultural sector organisation, activity, and decision\-making **\[PUB 3\]**. 

 A related stream of research is Hollands’ work on the alternative cultural sector in Prague, particularly through his long\-term engagement \(18 years\) with the Prague Fringe, an independent and annual performer\-led theatre festival. Prague is an ideal case study because after the ‘Velvet Revolution’ in 1989, it rapidly developed as a culture\-led city experiencing significant ‘over\-tourism’. Following an initial report in 2005 concerned with how the Prague Fringe might survive in a city exploding with commercial culture and conventional tourism, Hollands produced three additional independent audience demographic and economic impact research reports on the fringe based on over 800 survey respondents \(2007, 2012 and 2016\) \(see webpage  [http://www.praguefringe.com/about/research/](http://www.praguefringe.com/about/research/) for report details\). The overall research focus has been on the need for the city council culture department to recognise the alternative cultural sector in Prague \(including the fringe\), specifically through the provision of separate funding streams **\[PUB 4\]**. Hollands further developed the idea that Prague Fringe was emblematic of an ‘alternative form of cultural tourism’ **\[PUB 5\]**. In this regard, the research demonstrated that small independent fringes like Prague are characterised by different forms of cultural production and exchange, non\-hierarchical structures \(including being gender friendly\), high levels of accessibility, and unique social bonding between performers, audiences, locals, and tourists. Also, it was noted that the Prague Fringe was importantly located in a less visited part of the city \(avoiding ‘tourist bottlenecks’\) and was also characterised by high levels of repeat visitors amongst its audience. In his most recent independent audience study/ impact report produced on the Prague Fringe **\[PUB 6\]**, Hollands’ research documented the combined economic, social, and cultural benefits of the festival for the city.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Details of the research impact will be presented as two case studies. Case 1 is concerned with enabling alternative nightlife in Geneva, while Case 2 focuses on the impact of research supporting the Prague Fringe. Whilst there are slightly differing emphases within the cases, the main types of impact discussed and evidenced here focus around: \(a\) raising their profile and representation; \(b\) contributing to capacity, networks, and sustainability; and \(c\) challenging orthodox policy thinking in the cultural, licensing, and tourism fields. 

 *Case 1. Alternative nightlife in Geneva: Enabling recognition/ representation, networks, and capacity* 

 The major impacts of Hollands’ research in Geneva include fostering alternative nightlife recognition and representation, as well as aiding the networking strategies and capacity of independent creative spaces. Pathways to creating this impact require a brief elaboration. Following an influential public presentation of their research **\[PUB 1\]** at the Electron Festival in the city in May 2010, Hollands and Chatterton’s ideas were directly picked up and implemented by a prominent cultural city councillor, André Waldis. This led to their ‘nightscape methodology’ of distinguishing alternative from mainstream nightlife being adopted in a highly influential survey of Geneva nightlife commissioned by the city culture authorities entitled *Journey to the End of the Night* \(2010\). The main finding of the survey was that there was a lack of alternative nightlife provision in the city, and this prompted a high profile week\-long public debate in 2011 called ‘General State of the Night’. Hollands was a keynote speaker and made specific recommendations about the need for the alternative sector to raise its profile and gain public representation through networking and making alliances **\[PUB 2\-3\]**. As a result of this event, a unique ‘pressure group’ concerned with nightlife issues comprised of professionals, practitioners, managers, and researchers, called the Grand Council of the Night \(GCN\), came into being in 2011. Within the entire REF impact period, the GCN has sought to raise nightlife issues and influence policy and law\-making particularly as they relate to the independent sector. Due to the direct impact of Hollands’ research recommendations **alternative nightlife concerns have been specifically well represented on this body to the present day**. Hollands’ influence is evidenced by a testimonial from the ex\-president of the CGN, who said, *‘In forming the group, we were conscious from Hollands’ research, that it was important that the alternative sector had adequate representation and a strong voice in the organisation…’* **\[IMP 1\]**. Alternative representation on the GCN body is also evidenced by the fact that four prominent alternative cultural organisations, the Association for the Living Reconversion of Spaces, Motel Campo, L’Usine, and the Federation of Kugler Artists, have served as members of this important nightlife pressure group throughout the entire REF impact period **\[IMP 2\]**. In addition to influencing the constituency of this lobbying body, the GCN has also used Hollands’ research to help create policies and laws that are advantageous to sustaining the alternative nightlife sector **\[IMP 1\]**. Specifically, they utilised the important idea of his that to maintain nightlife ‘diversity’ and encourage independent nightlife spaces, exceptions in the law \(specifically in the area of governance and licencing\) would have to be fought for **\[PUB 1\]**. In this regard, the CGN actively and successfully lobbied for exceptions in the formation of a new licencing law \(passed on January 1, 2016 **\[IMP 3\]**\), which allowed for events that are ‘primarily cultural’ not requiring state approval of an alcohol license, thereby benefiting alternative cultural providers in terms of avoiding extra costs and ‘red tape’. For example, one co\-founder of an alternative venue said of the legal exception: *‘It’s lighter in terms of infrastructure, we don’t have the same constraints, and we have more flexibility’* **\[IMP 4\]**. 

 Hollands and Chatterton’s alternative nightlife typology referred to above **\[PUB 1\]**, and Hollands’ related research **\[GRANT 3\]** emphasising the importance of developing a collective infrastructure for this sector **\[PUB 2\-3\]**, has also led to other significant impacts concerning **increasing networks and capacity of independent creative spaces**. For example, his research and participation in the event ‘Cultural Resistance, Urban Activism and the Arts’ workshop \(held in Leeds Sept 8, 2015 and attended by Geneva activists\) has fed into the networking activities of other cooperative ventures in Geneva beyond just nightlife. One such cooperative, the artist\-led Ressources Urbaines \(founded in December 2015\), who work with city authorities in Geneva to identify empty buildings and help to provide affordable spaces to alternative groups, have used Hollands’ research work to aid their infrastructural and decision\-making strategies. A spokesperson for the group has said *‘Hollands’ definition of what is meant by alternative and his research on the importance of creating an alternative infrastructure was useful for us in terms of our networking strategies and deciding on which kind of cultural practices we wanted to actually support’* **\[IMP 1\]**. The research has aided the organisation to distinguish exactly which types of artist groups they should offer spaces to, which has included helping hundreds of alternative artists to gain a foothold in the city. For example, they obtained places for 80 independent artists in one space alone in September 2017 **\[IMP 5\]**, offering further evidence that the research has indirectly contributed to increased growth in the alternative creative sector in Geneva. 

  

 *Case 2. Prague Fringe: Raising profile, ensuring sustainability, and influencing policy thinking* 

 The major pathways to impact in this case study include the production of audience and impact reports containing recommendations, a special participatory workshop \(see details below\), and interviews with key policy personnel in the city, with the main beneficiaries identified as fringe stakeholders \(directors and fringe staff, as well as audiences, performers, and culture/ tourism personnel\). Regarding **raising the profile** of the Prague Fringe to a range of constituents, Hollands’ 2016 impact report **\[PUB 6\]** has helped create awareness of not only what Prague Fringe is, but what extra benefits it can generate economically \(bringing in GBP640,000 into the city in 2016\), socially and culturally. Three hundred copies of the report were distributed to key stakeholders \(listed above\), and the Prague Fringe website containing the report has attracted over 2000 visits during the last three years. In addition to this, the research report was specifically sent to various culture and tourism personnel in the city to showcase the Fringe and was followed up by taped interviews. One prominent senior tourism and culture official said that the report showed *‘…the importance of the position of the festival in Prague’*, and that Prague Fringe *‘…has some special role’* in the city, while a spokesperson from Prague City Tourism said *‘…it has been more visible this year’* \(2017\), evidence that the report has helped **raise the festival’s profile** as a significant cultural event for two key decision\-makers **\[IMP 6\]**. A second type of impact of the research concerns its **beneficial effect on the Prague Fringe’s sustainability and growth \(capacity\)**. At the launch of the 2016 report, at a participatory workshop \(including fringe audience members, performers and staff\) entitled ‘Loving Your Work': Engagement, Impact, and the Prague Fringe’ \(October 2016\), presentations by two of the fringe directors revealed the importance of Hollands’ research in helping to sustain funding for the festival, with one key audience member and fringe supporter, later remarking *‘…without it \[the research\] I don't know if \[Prague Fringe\] fringe would have survived’* **\[IMP 7\]**. More specifically, one director of the Prague Fringe has said of Hollands that *‘…his research work has been utilised to secure future funding and helped shape decision making as we seek to make our fringe more responsive to our various stakeholders*’ **\[IMP 7\]**. Further evidence that Hollands’ 2016 research report findings have impacted on Prague Fringe funding and capacity, comes from the fact that it has helped them secure baseline funding by the local council from 2017 onwards \(CZK30,000 a year\), and aided capacity, in the form of a 30% rise in ticket sales from 2013\-2018 **\[IMP 8\]**. This has been achieved, in part, by recommending a ‘student discount scheme’, but also using Hollands’ research findings that the majority of fringe audience is female **\[PUB 5\-6\]**. This finding was utilised to help brand the 2018 event as ‘female friendly’ **\[IMP 9\]**.  A final type of impact **has been to use the research on Prague Fringe to influence alternative tourism strategies.** Research on the Prague Fringe shows the advantages of alternative forms of culture in terms of tourism, as fringe\-goers stay longer, are more likely to be repeat visitors, and inhabit less busy areas of the city than conventional tourists **\[PUB 5\-6\]**. In an interview with Hollands, a Prague city councillor with a special remit for culture and tourism, acknowledged that his research findings **\[PUB 6\]** show that alternative spaces like the Fringe *‘…is the way for the future development of tourism’* **\[IMP 10\]**. Additionally, after a visit by Hollands in May 2016 to discuss these issues with a senior strategy official of Prague City Tourism, the Prague Fringe, plus a range of other alternative cultural venues, were featured in the main 2017 spring tourism brochure for the very first time **\[IMP 10\]**, demonstrating that the research has influenced how key actors connected to city tourism are beginning to see the benefits of alternative cultures in both marketing and policy thinking. 

 In summary, while each case study here is unique, impacts common to both have been strategically focussed around raising the profile of the sector, increasing capacity, networks, and sustainability, and intervening in current policy thinking and decision\-making. Championing the alternative sector has been vital not only to its survival and growth, but in challenging the limits of current cultural and tourism policy orthodoxies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our development of novel algorithms for automatic threat item detection and associated capabilities for use within X\-ray and Computed Tomography \(CT\) security scanners informed government policy, commercial product development and airport technology planning in this area. This research, carried out between 2014 and 2020 at Durham University, directly: 

-  informed **UK/US government** policy for aviation and border security screening 

-  provided new enhanced software capabilities within the design of security scanners by   **Gilardoni S.p.A. , Kromek PLC, Micro\-X Ltd, Rapiscan Ltd** and **Smiths Detection** 

-  informed the design, development and evaluation of new software capabilities for security scanners with **Cosmonio BV, Battelle, L3Harris Technologies** and **VisionMetric Ltd** 

-  informed the procurement of airport security screening products at **Gatwick Airport** 

 These impacts directly contribute to the security of over 500 million passenger journeys per annum with additional potential reach to 2\-3 billion passenger journeys across 30\+ countries globally.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 This research relates to the use of automated image understanding techniques to provide enhanced automatic screening for the detection of threat or contraband items within X\-ray and CT security imagery. This addresses the question *“What is in the bag/parcel/package?”* \(Figure 1\) *.* Conventional X\-ray screening offers multiple\-view \(2D\) images of a scanned item \(Figure 1, left\) whilst recent advances in high\-throughput CT imaging offer a full 3D volumetric image \(Figure 2, left\).  Across both domains, the key challenge is to be able to address this issue with a high probability of detection \(true positive\) whilst minimising the false alarm rate \(false positive\) within highly cluttered scanner imagery under real\-time processing bounds \(as the item passes through the scanner\). Furthermore, the aim must be achieved whilst working from limited example data availability \(compared to other image understanding domains\). 



 *Fig1: Exemplar X\-ray image \(single view, 2D – left\) and CT image \(3D volume, rotatable – middle\) imagery of a baggage and the on\-site X\-ray testing facilities at Durham University \(right\).* 

 The Durham research team pioneered the use of object recognition algorithms for this task: firstly, by extending existing object recognition paradigms for use with 3D CT security imagery \[R1, R2, R5\] and subsequently by introducing the use of deep convolutional neural network \(CNN\) based approaches to the domain of X\-ray based security screening \[R3, R4\]. Furthermore, we were able to extend this research to support the related research question of how to perform threat image projection \(TIP\) within CT imagery i.e. *“How do we realistically insert a threat item into an otherwise benign 3D bag image”?* \[R5, R6\]. TIP inserts such “fake” threat items into an otherwise benign baggage item in order to monitor security screening operator performance. This is a legally mandated process already in place for all X\-ray based aviation security screening processes \(UK/EU and beyond\). In addition, it will now be increasingly used for 3D CT\-based aviation security screening processes, due to the move to new mandatory UK/EU security screening standards for both hold baggage \(ECAC EDS standard 3 \- EU Regulation 1087/2011, September 2020\) and cabin baggage \(ECAC EDSCB C1\-C3, December 2022\) – both of which require the 3D CT security screening. The key findings of this research at Durham were that: 

-  object detection can be performed using an extended 3D bag\-of\-visual words architecture in cluttered CT imagery to achieve \~98% true positive detection with low false positive <1%  \[R1\]. 

-  plausible TIP within 3D CT imagery can be performed, by using materials\-based segmentation for void space determination \[R2\] with lesser concern for noise and artefact filtering \[R5\], within an optimisation\-based emplacement framework \[R6\]. 

-  transfer learning, with a CNN architecture pre\-trained on visible\-band imagery and refined on X\-ray imagery, enables object detection in cluttered X\-ray imagery with a high true positive \(98%\+\) and low false positive <1% despite limited data set availability and inherent differences in image characteristics \(projection, spectral\-band, colour/texture\) \[R3, R4\] \(Figure 2\). 

-  the levels of performance achieved by these CNN approaches are repeatable over multiple datasets including those independently provided by the UK government \[R4\]. 

-  deep neural networks enable object detection in cluttered X\-ray imagery \[R3, R4\] significantly outperforming earlier feature\-based approaches \(83% true positive / 3% false positive, \[R4\]\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 X\-ray, and more recently CT\-based, security screening is used in both transport and border security for the detection of explosives, weapons and contraband for the purposes of both law enforcement and counter terrorism. Whilst the regulatory mandate for this technology in aviation and border security is a policy matter for government, the technical development of security scanners to meet these regulatory requirements is carried out by commercial suppliers. The research work at Durham \[R1\-R6\] has had both policy and commercial impact. 

 **Impact on Government Policy:** Based on this research at Durham, Professor Breckon has:

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime \(ESYTC\) had two main impacts: \(i\) it was the primary evidence\-base underpinning the introduction of radical legislation that increased the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland from 8 to 12; and \(ii\) it formed the evidence\-base for two new youth justice strategies: the Scottish Prison Service’s ‘Vision for Young People in Custody’ and the Scottish Government’s ‘Youth Justice Strategy 2015\-20’, which together led to substantial reductions in the number of young people being convicted \(34% fall since 2015\) and sent to prison \(45% fall since 2015\) – the lowest figures since 1972. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The ESYTC is a prospective longitudinal study of pathways into and out of offending amongst a cohort of approximately 4,300 young people who started secondary education in the City of Edinburgh in 1998. Data collection for this case study occurred between 1998 and 2012. It is the biggest UK\-based criminological life\-course study and one of few world\-wide that includes both girls and boys in its cohort. 

 Sources of data on the cohort include: repeated self\-report questionnaires; semi\-structured interviews with sub\-samples of the cohort; data from official records \(police, social work, juvenile justice, criminal conviction, schools\); a parents’ survey; a pastoral teachers’ survey; and a geographic information system based on census data and police recorded crime. 

 The key findings based on analysis of ESYTC data by McAra and McVie that support this case study are: 

-  Offending behaviour in the teenage years is common; however, only a very small proportion of young people become persistent and serious offenders \(3.1\). 

-  Persistent and serious offenders typically come from impoverished family backgrounds, live in deprived neighbourhoods, and experience a range of adversities and vulnerabilities during childhood and adolescence \(3.2\). 

-  Experience of poverty and early system intervention in early childhood are significant predictors of offending in adolescence and criminal conviction in early adulthood \(3.3\). 

-  Educational exclusion is highly damaging to young people’s life chances and is one of the best predictors of later imprisonment \(3.3\). 

-  Early adverse childhood experiences serve to capture and retain young people in the justice system and, despite wider societal change in which offending has declined, these individuals continue to be recycled around the justice system with deleterious effects \(3.4\). 

-  Where a young person does end up in custody, positive outcomes can occur when the regime is predicated on an educational model of care as well as strong and supportive relationships between young people and their key workers \(3.4\). 

-  In recent years, youth crime has been displaced away from the street into cyberspace, but there is an increasing concentration of poor, marginalised and vulnerable young people in our youth and adult justice systems \(3.4\). 

-  Keeping young offenders out of the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems for as long as possible reduces their risk of further offending and repeated justice system intervention \(3.5\). 

-  Repeated justice system contact perpetuates cycles of poverty and leads to inequality in terms of educational exclusion and disadvantage, poor labour market outcomes, poor physical and mental health \(including suicidal ideation\), relationship breakdown and social isolation \(3.5, 3.6\). 

-  Diversion from formal justice measures and minimal intervention are more effective in tackling serious and persistent youth offending, and supporting pathways out of offending, than intensive and punitive interventions \(3.5, 3.6\). 

 Taken together, these findings are strongly supportive of policies that avoid the criminalisation of young people through increasing the age of criminal responsibility to internationally agreed minimum standards; diverting young people from formal criminal justice measures \(especially imprisonment\) where possible; and developing policies of educational inclusion.

 4. Details of the impact 

 \(i\) Raising the age of criminal responsibility \(ACR\) in Scotland 

 The Age of Criminal Responsibility \(Scotland\) Act 2019 marked a radical change in juvenile justice and brought Scotland more into line with international human rights standards than other UK jurisdictions. ESYTC formed the underpinning evidence for this change, as stated in the Policy Memorandum accompanying the Bill when introduced to Parliament \(5.1\). 

 Legislative change was initiated by a Scottish Government Advisory Group on ACR, established in 2016, which extensively used ESYTC findings to inform debate and support its recommendation to raise ACR to 12 \(5.2\). Robert Marshall \(Chair of the Scottish Government Advisory Group\) stated: *“\[The ESYTC\] provided us with solid evidence on which we based our discussions, playing a significant part in informing and guiding the thoughts of the Advisory Group in order to make recommendations that the law be changed”* \(5.3\) *.* Paul Carberry \(Advisory Group member and Director of Action for Children Scotland\) stated: *“There is no doubt the study by McAra and McVie has been the most influential academic research into youth justice in the 30 years I have been working in this area. The findings significantly influenced the approach to working with young people in trouble to the significant benefit of many thousands of children and young people in Scotland…\[T\]he research findings were widely drawn upon and provided an important benchmark for a group of advisors from different professional backgrounds”* \(5.4\) *.* 

 An independent inquiry was launched by Action for Children and the Scottish Children’s Commissioner to feed evidence into the Advisory Group. McAra and McVie were key contributors \(5.5\). Richard Holloway \(Chair of the inquiry\) stated: *“The evidence from the \[ESYTC\] was enormously helpful in our work and was hugely influential to our thinking…Their findings have demonstrated convincingly that criminalising children is not only wrong, it is counterproductive. Professors McAra and McVie can claim credit not only for this significant change in policy, but also for providing irrefutable evidence that the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland, currently set at 8 years of age, is both morally and empirically unsupportable. And the Edinburgh Study was undoubtedly one of the key catalysts behind the current Bill”* \(5.6\). 

 A Scottish Parliament Information Centre Briefing Paper on the Bill heavily cited the ESYTC in support of raising ACR \(5.7\); and McVie gave expert evidence to a Parliamentary Committee \(5.8.a\), which was debated by MSPs during passage of the Bill through Parliament \(5.8.b\). 

 \(ii\) Youth Justice Strategy 

 In December 2014, the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\) published its ‘Vision for Young People in Custody’, a strategy aimed at ensuring that time spent in custody by young people should “enable them to prepare for a positive future” \(5.9.a\). The Professional Advisor for the Young People’s Strategy with the SPS stated: *“Evidence from the Edinburgh Study provided an essential part of the evidence base for design of the SPS strategy and has continued to inform thinking during the implementation stages”* \(5.9.b\); and further noted: *“It is very important that staff who work with young people in custody understand this evidence, to combat any misconceptions and to give them a sound base from which to undertake their role in supporting the young people to prepare for a positive future. Messages from the Study have been incorporated into staff training and development”* \(5.9.b\). 

 ESYTC findings also formed the basis of the Scottish Government’s national ‘Youth Justice Strategy 2015\-20’, aimed at improving life chances for children and young people up to age 21. According to the Strategy: *“Findings from the \[ESYTC\] tell us that: serious offending is linked to a broad range of vulnerabilities and social adversity; early identification of at\-risk children runs the risk of labelling and stigmatising; pathways out of offending are affected by critical moments in the early teenage years. In particular, school inclusion and diversionary strategies facilitate the desistance process. This strategy is founded on a shared commitment to dealing with the issues raised by that evidence”* \(5.10.a\). 

 Following implementation of these strategies, national statistics on Criminal Proceedings in the Scottish Courts published by the Scottish Government showed major reductions in the number of young people aged under 21 entering the criminal justice system. This included a 34% reduction in convictions in the Scottish Courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19 \(5.10.b\) and a 45% reduction in imprisonment between 2014/15 and 2019/20 \(5.10.c\). These are the lowest numbers since comparable records began in 1972 \(5.10.d\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Green and Hiribarren has led them to shape new narratives and educational frameworks that have been widely adopted to recast the teaching of West African history. Their new research has enabled: 

-  the expansion of secondary school teacher engagement with the significance of West African history in the UK and in West Africa, moving beyond narratives of slavery and victimisation; and 

-  the creation of adaptable resources for researching and teaching African history in Africa and the UK. 

 It has done so via: 

-  building digital archives, open\-access pedagogical materials, and accessible writing; and 

-  creating teaching fora and tailored tools, including a new OCR\-accredited A\-level module for UK students and a flexible, co\-produced and freely available History syllabus for English\-speaking West African teachers. 

 Both in Africa and Britain, their work has reshaped pedagogical approaches to the history of West Africa, moving away from older narratives of slavery and colonialism to create a better understanding of the region, its politics and its peoples.

###  2. Underpinning research 

#  Redefining narratives of West African history 

 In a variety of ways, the work of Green and Hiribarren has redefined the historical study of West Africa, moving beyond narratives of slavery and victimisation, which stress the rupture of European colonialism, towards stories of agency, adaptation, survival and longevity. 

 One key claim has been arguing for the role and brokerage of West Africa in the development of the Atlantic World. Green’s monograph on early African–European relations \[1\] showed the connections between pre\-colonial trans\-Saharan trade networks and social structures and those that were established in the era of the early trans\-Atlantic slave trade, demonstrating for the first time the influence of African societies in early global social formations. It also revealed the importance of early West African commercial and social practices in creating mixed societies in the first generations of the colonial Americas. Green’s edited book \[2\] established the range of trades in pre\-colonial Western Africa, while his multiple award\-winning book *A Fistful of Shells* \[3\] took these arguments further still, examining the structure of pre\-colonial Africa through the lens of monetary and cultural exchanges instead of slavery. 

 The other central research strand challenges imperially\-defined periodisations from the perspective of modern history. These periodisations reinforce a radical caesura between pre\- and post\-colonial practices. By contrast, Hiribarren’s work on borderlands in West African history was the first to link the historical study of space with that of state administration in pre\-colonial, colonial and post\-colonial Africa. Because of its *longue* *durée* approach exploring the heartland of the Kanuri\-speaking royal empire, Hiribarren’s first book \[4\] \(which was nominated for the RHS Gladstone Prize\), depicted Borno as a survivalist state, extremely well\-adapted to harsh conditions and powerful rivals, drawing on a rich archival assemblance and including recently released ‘migrated archives’. Hiribarren’s redefinition of Borno’s political and social identities was thus able to stress longevity and the persistence of territorial integrity in contrast to traditional narratives that sharply divide pre\- and post\-imperial African states, punctuated by slavery, colonial exploitation of resources and the ‘scramble for Africa’. Hiribarren’s innovative approach, for the first time, provided a truly historical context for, and explanation of, the deep roots of contemporary instability in north\-eastern Nigeria. Both Green and Hiribarren’s research therefore speaks to the capacity of West African histories to reshape Eurocentric conceptualisations and challenges the historiographical insularity of understandings of globalisation and imperialism. 

#  Digital histories of Africa 

 Both Green and Hiribarren have also contributed to ongoing scholarly debates about how to reposition North–South dynamics in the academy, particularly focusing on the ways in which African countries are empowered to preserve and write their own histories. Both see digitalisation as a potential tool for such work, though not uncritically so, for they note its potential for further embedding imbalanced power structures. 

 In a special issue of *History in Africa,* Hiribarren et al offered wider theoretical reflections on the issue of digitalisation and governance in Africa, especially drawing attention to the way in which the digital turn can act as a form of imperialism \[5\]. They noted that the “complex of the white saviour” has morphed into the “complex of the digital saviour”, warning against a dismissal of existing non\-digital archival work done by Africans, which already suffers from underfunding and an inability to engage with many of the research and technological practices taken for granted by western academics. Their intervention was sceptical about market\-driven, private digitalisation projects that rarely take seriously the notion of archives as a public service ensuring accountability and good governance. 

 Green has also discussed his own experience of collaborating between Northern and Southern institutions and his attempts to ensure that African partners were the ones directing the work \[6\]. Drawing upon a European Union funded project linking four African and four European universities, he charted the initial phases in which the European universities had drawn up the main research aims and agendas, fostering a sense of disempowerment. The nature of the partnership was, however, transformed through the development of a digital platform \(to be launched in Feb 2021\) maintained by KCL but run by institutions in Portuguese\-speaking Africa \(thereby maintaining the paramount importance stressed by Hiribarren \[5\] and Green \[6\] of African countries controlling how their histories are told\). 

 For both Green and Hiribarren, there is a strong link between refashioning the conceptual and analytical frameworks for writing the histories of West Africa and reconfiguring the North–South dynamics in the production of teaching materials, the identification and preservation of archival repositories and the presentation of recast histories in classrooms in both the North and South. This has been invaluable for telling the history of West Africa in a way that moves beyond well\-worn narratives of slavery and imperial domination, and which has demonstrated the potential to advance both academic debates and to inform and alter school and university teaching practices in Britain, Africa and both North and South America.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research and its impact in Africa, the Americas and Europe led Green and Hiribarren to develop pathbreaking curricula resources that transformed the pedagogical environment in both West Africa and the UK for the teaching of African history. Impact came through the development of new resources and pedagogical training in both the UK and West Africa: firstly, through the creation of a suite of new resources in the UK at Key Stage \(KS\) 3 and 5 \(A\-level\) including a free online ebook by Green, *African Kingdoms*; and, secondly, through the creation of a new, free internet\-based history textbook \[I\] for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination \(WASCE\), which has formed the part of a major redevelopment of curriculums in the region. 

#  Teaching material at KS3 and KS5 

 The teaching of African history in UK schools has almost exclusively focused on slavery and victimisation. It was thus extremely difficult for teachers \(in secondary classrooms\) to deconstruct imperialist imaginaries that construe Africa exclusively through framings of suffering and poverty, rather than approaching African history on its own terms \[C\]. Through Green’s recruitment to and pivotal contribution in the development of the new A\-level option, African Kingdoms, for the OCR exam board \[A\], he has played a crucial part in changing the teaching of African history in the UK. At a time when pedagogical and cultural debates are increasingly couched around the legacy of slavery in Britain, Green’s work demonstrated the importance and potential of reframing African history in a way that moves beyond such binary, and even reductive narratives, towards understanding West African histories as part of multiple interlinked global histories in which slavery was merely one \(albeit significant\) facet. 

 Green’s research \[1,2,3\], which illuminated the commercial and social patterns of early modern Africa and their global importance, was crucial in the development of this new A\-level unit that gave students a novel view of African history privileging agency and world historical influence. Green was approached by OCR, through the recommendation of the Royal Historical Society, precisely because of this expertise, and he became the Lead Consultant for the module. The Head of History at the OCR said that the development of African Kingdoms would not have been possible without Green’s support and suggested that that the syllabus was “one of the most significant developments to the A Level History landscape, quite possibly for several decades” \[B\]. 

 As mentioned, Green wrote an ebook based on his *Fistful of Shells* \[3\] for use by teachers and school children and created a supporting website to accompany the teaching of this new A\-level option \[E\]. This too proved crucial to the development of the curriculum and informing teaching practices. One teacher described it as an essential resource for “a base of knowledge” that “forces students to challenge their pre\-conceptions of the continent of Africa … I have lost count of the number of times that students have told me that their study of African Kingdoms has enabled them to have a greater understanding of the current situation in African countries today and how they can use this to challenge the views of those around them” \[C\]. 

 Green’s efforts to support the teaching of African history in schools raised public awareness of the new ideas to key beneficiaries in the teaching profession. These included: 

-  delivery of plenary lectures on teaching African history in schools at the Schools History Project \(SHP\) Conference \(Leeds Trinity University, July 2017\); 

-  participation in the Historical Association \(HA\) Teacher Fellowship programme on the teaching the trans\-Atlantic slave trade in schools \(April 2019\) and a plenary lecture to 516 delegates at the November 2020 Zoom Historical Association conference \[F\]; and 

-  participation in a panel on Black Lives Matter and education at the October 2020 Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference for Private Schools. 

 The availability and accessibility of resources for teachers was also facilitated by the delivery of two webinars \(attended by 40 teachers\), four podcasts through the Historical Association \(covering four West African Kingdoms from 1400–1800 and with over 11,147 track plays\) \[F\] and, between April and June 2020, through a series of five free webinars delivered with Professor Trevor Getz of San Francisco State University to over 150 UK history teachers, targeting the teaching of African history at KS3 \[D\]. Summarising these initiatives, the CEO of the Historical Association \(HA\) reflected: “All these interventions helped to highlight to teachers across the UK that African history should not be taught simply in terms of victimisation and slavery … \[dismantling\] preconceptions about what is often regarded as difficult and challenging subject matter, while providing the resources and confidence to … transform views of Africa among the next generation, … and develop out their own content drawing upon the resources on the supporting website” \[F\]. 

 Feedback from Green’s talk at the 2020 Historical Association virtual conference was extremely positive: “Green’s session was so helpful, the invaluable resource sharing he did were a true highlight” and “Green’s session was also excellent — huge amount of knowledge \[was\] very accessibly developed.” \[F\] Likewise, responses to his HA webinars demonstrated a significant uptake of his ideas among teachers \(with 100% of respondents saying they were ‘Very likely’ to ‘use what \[they\] have learnt in their teaching’\). Indeed, many resolved to refashion the way they taught the subject using Green’s resources and books: “I now have the confidence to teach a short unit on this topic. Since the last webinar I have bought his book and will be using it to inform the teaching of a series of KS3 lessons”; “excellent demonstration of resources and suggestions of how to teach the topic. I will be introducing a topic at KS3 on either Benin or Kongo, currently leaning towards Benin. I will use the recommended resources and am looking forward to the follow up seminar to gain more subject knowledge.” \[F\] 

 Such cumulative work has led to a definite step\-change in approaches to teaching African history \[C,D,E\]. Teachers used the new resources to change their own practice and options for teaching African history at both KS3 as well as at A\-level, in one case transforming the delivery of history to over 800 students through working through a new scheme of work on Benin following exposure to the resources by Green \[C\]. Several teachers developed and delivered entirely new schemes of work centred on the resources and cited Green’s research in their materials, as documented on the African Kingdoms website \[E\]. The feedback from the Teacher Fellowships \[F\] and webinars \[D\] shows that this allowed teachers to provide a much richer African contextualisation to the delivery of content at KS3; as one noted “it gives great opportunity for students to challenge assumptions/misconceptions about African history” \[C\]. Thus, new cohorts of students from up to 150 schools from across England, from Croydon to Newbury, benefited from the development of these new resources. The growing popularity of the African Kingdoms curriculum in schools was covered by the *Independent* newspaper, ‘African Kingdoms: Why a growing number of schools are teaching pre\-colonial African history for A\-levels’ \(11 November 2020\). 

#  Digital humanities and education: WASSCE option and its wider impact 

 Hiribarren and Green have also worked together to facilitate the writing of new histories of Africa for use in West African schools. Like the OCR module, the West African Secondary School History \(WASSCE\) syllabus stressed empowerment and autonomy but concentrated less directly on writing agency into African history and more on allowing people to have control over their own past, enhancing the writing and understanding of history in Africa. This project was, in essence, a practical manifestation of the attempt to challenge the power dynamics within the 21st century academy between institutions in the global North and South \[6\]. It also aimed to build a digital resource that genuinely contributed to the public good in West Africa and was led by West African scholars, eschewing patronising paternalism \[5\]. 

 The launch of the OCR A\-level resource, including the free *African Kingdoms* ebook, led colleagues in West Africa to ask if something similar could be developed for the West African secondary schools. Hiribarren and Green’s AHRC\-project, *From Monograph to Classroom*, drew on their research \[3,6\] to develop a free internet\-based textbook, *History Textbook: West African Senior School Certificate Examination* \(2018\), thereby providing the first ever widely available, innovative history syllabus across West Africa and replacing obsolete teaching materials dating from the 1960s \[I\]. The WASSCE textbook team mobilised seven contributing authors \(two from Ghana, one each from Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, as well as Green and Hiribarren\). The outline for the textbook was co\-created by a workshop at the University of Sierra Leone in Freetown \(May 2017\); curriculum development was shaped in West Africa, as the team of West African authors suggested two new chapters that had not been on the original syllabus, one on Gender history and another on Environmental history. This entirely new and free resource is available for all schoolchildren studying History for the WASSCE exam in English\-speaking countries across West Africa and has been used by 208,306 new users between 1 June 2019 and 6 December 2020 \[H\]. The beneficiaries included history teachers across West Africa \(Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and The Gambia\) and secondary school students in these countries, who used the materials to support their studies on the core General History paper. 

 The transformations on educational pedagogy and teaching practice were marked. By November 2019, five schools in the Ashanti region in Ghana that had not taught History before commenced as a direct result of the resource’s creation \[G\]. In January 2020, the Secretary of the Ghana History Teachers’ Association estimated that 1,223 teachers were using the resource and that “almost all the popular schools offering history as a subject are using it” \[G\]. In The Gambia, the book was being used as a key text in seven senior secondary schools, while in at least 10 others, certain topics like those on empires and the slave trade used it as a key text for teaching \[G\]. There were also rave reviews of a linked quiz designed for the website \(“superb, it’s very emotional and addictive for students”\), which Hiribarren developed in July 2018 as an app available on Android and Apple smartphones \[H\]. In Nigeria, where History had disappeared entirely from the school curriculum between 2009 and 2018, one teacher described how the resource was leading directly to more students studying History at school and university \[J\]. 

 This educational impact followed as a direct result of the research and associated activities funded by Green’s AHRC Leadership Fellowship and collaborative follow\-on funding for Green and Hiribarren, deploying Hiribarren’s world\-leading expertise in the digital history in Africa. 

 High\-level educational policy development was a priority to ensure that the textbook was adopted by the largest number of teachers and students. The new resource was presented at the West African Education Council \(WAEC\) at Banjul in March 2018. Green and Hiribarren immersed secondary school teachers in the latest scholarship of and on the continent \(Green in Kumasi in March 2018; Green and Hiribarren in Banjul during the WAEC meeting\). These meetings were an opportunity to ensure that the production of knowledge on Africa was not one\-sided or led by European and North American institutions and academics, but could instead pave the way for a new generation of scholars in Africa. 

 Further educational impact across West Africa followed. Green and Hiribarren used digital \(apps\), pedagogical \(teaching workshops\) and academic \(conferences\) tools to increase the uptake of the resource and recalibrate agendas in History teaching in West Africa \[J\]. Their multi\-pronged strategy was conceived to be as diverse and inclusive as possible and \(supported by Hiribarren’s securement of a British Academy grant\) resulted in pedagogically\-orientated workshops drawing on the textbook in Ghana, Mozambique and Senegal with 65 academics on the continent across three different languages \(English, Portuguese and French\). Presentation of the textbook findings at academic conferences has also led to well\-developed, in\-progress conversations for extension of coverage to Mali. 

 The educational impact of these pedagogical and digital initiatives on curriculums in British and West African schools has been transformational. The educational materials have been used by educators to recast historical narratives about West Africa as presented in national curricula and secondary school classrooms. These initiatives, especially the digital resources, also lay the foundations for further extension and expansion and actively redress already some aspects of the North\-South disparity in academia.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Wi\-Fi devices should operate in a way to reduce interference between them and thus increase spectrum capacity to meet growing service demands. The EU H2020 funded Wi\-5 project developed novel algorithms for such a solution. Its impact includes \(a\) the text here redacted, \(b\) solution exploitation for securing two government grants worth £7.8m to create 5G\-supported digital health and social care services with estimated annual savings of £247,688 per hundred users, \(c\) consultation with 16 telecommunication operators in 7 countries \(e.g., the text here redacted\), and \(d\) 16 contributions to standardisation bodies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning Research 

 Wi\-Fi has been facing growing pressure to provide quality\-of\-experience support through Access Points \(APs\) to an ever\-increasing number of mobile devices \(e.g., smartphones\) driven by a surge of bandwidth\-intensive services \(e.g., online meetings\). This rising demand is causing Wi\-Fi saturation and hence interference among competing APs, particularly in dense areas like university campuses and business centres, which negatively impacts users’ experience in Wi\-Fi services. 

 The EU H2020 funded Wi\-5 project coordinated by LJMU \[7\] aimed to rectify the above interference problems by proposing smart solutions based on Software Defined Wireless Networking \(SDWN\) techniques to cooperatively reduce interference between neighbouring APs and provide optimised service connectivity. The main novel results \[1\]\-\[6\] produced from the project by the UOA staff \(Bouhafs, Raschellà, Mackay, Shi\) in collaboration with the project partners, which underpin the impact of this case study, include: 

-  Spectrum programming architecture for Wi\-Fi radio resource management \[1\], which introduces the first definition of a spectrum control plane for fine\-grained allocation of radio resources, flexible configuration of wireless networking parameters, and continuous monitoring of the network status. 

-  AP selection framework \[2\], which is among the first contributions to address Quality of Service \(QoS\) awareness in enterprise Wi\-Fi networks using SDWN to determine the most suitable APs for satisfying users’ QoS requirements with minimal interference and associate their devices to these APs. 

-  Interference management algorithm \[3\], which considers the network\-wide impact of Wi\-Fi to dynamically adjust the allocation of radio resources with respect to users’ service quality requirements while minimizing its effect on neighbouring APs. 

-  AP selection algorithm \[4\], which is among the first to use a centralized game theory\-based approach to address high AP interference problems by seamlessly reallocating connected users to more suitable APs for better services when their connections are negatively affected by interference. 

-  Channel assignment algorithm \[5\], which is able to jointly optimise the transmission power and RF \(Radio Frequency\) channel assignment of APs by taking into account users’ required service qualities while minimising their interference impact throughout the Wi\-Fi network. 

 The above results were evaluated based on extensive simulations to demonstrate their effectiveness and performance, e.g., the channel assignment algorithm evaluation in \[6\]. They were also integrated into a smart Wi\-5 platform to provide channel assignment and AP cooperation for systematic Wi\-Fi resource management \[1\]. In collaboration with the project partners ""Universidad de Zaragoza"" \(UNIZAR\) and AirTies, the solution was implemented on Wi\-Fi equipment and incorporated into a testbed provided by AirTies to further evaluate its performance in real\-world scenarios. Then another project partner PrimeTel PLC performed field trials to widen the evaluation in practical settings. 

 The above thorough evaluation concluded that the Wi\-5 solution is capable of optimising AP interference reduction and thus Wi\-Fi resource utilisation systematically, dynamically and automatically. Particularly, when many devices are deployed in close proximity, the solution shows significant improvements over existing techniques \(e.g., a reduction of users’ service dissatisfaction by up to 83% \[4\]\), as their performance deteriorates considerably under dense deployments in terms of data rates, delays and connectivity.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The main impacts of the Wi\-5 solution outlined in Section 2 include improved Wi\-Fi services, new service exploitation and informed technology choice. These three impact areas are elaborated separately below: 

-  Wi\-Fi service improvements: The text here has been redacted. 

-  New service exploitation: The Liverpool 5G Testbed project \(03/2018\-01/2020\) involving 12 partners was funded by the DCMS \(Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport\) to showcase the feasibility of 5G technology for improving health and social care services \[a\]. The Wi\-5 solution helped to secure the funding \(£3.5m\) as it was used to formulate the part of the proposal regarding unlicensed 5G mmWave wireless network management fundamental to the project. Specifically, the SDWN\-based platform \[1\] developed by the Wi\-5 project was employed to build a Self Organising Network \(SON\) management system in collaboration with an industrial partner, Blu Wireless, specialising in mmWave network products and services. Such SONs provided network flexibility and intelligence to support the proposed use cases of health and social care services. 

 The project resulted in promising impact on the considered care services \[b\]. Notably, the cost savings from the implementation of the tested use cases for care services were estimated to be £247,688 for every hundred users per year. Also, the project was mentioned in over 160 press and media articles for its impact dissemination and had over 60 organizations interested in partnerships and/or collaborations. The significant benefits demonstrated by the project led to a further DCMS grant of £4.3m for the follow\-up Liverpool 5G Create project \(08/2020\-03/2022\) to further develop and widen the benefits in selected areas of Liverpool \[c\]. 

 The text here has been redacted. 

-  Informed technology choice: The Wi\-5 consortium actively engaged with industry and the community for result sharing. For example, the project established an Operator Board with 16 telecommunication operators in 7 countries and met 5 times over the project period \[d\] to inform them of the project progress and demonstrate the results \[1\]\-\[6\], which influenced their choices of Wi\-Fi technologies. The text here has been redacted. Additionally, the Wi\-5 project made 16 contributions to three standardisation bodies: IETF \(Internet Engineering Task Force, 9\), HGI \(Home Gateway Initiative, 2\) and BBF \(Broadband Forum, 5\) for result dissemination \[d\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken at University of Strathclyde since 2004 was applied in the development of the UK’s first commercial CubeSat by Clyde Space Ltd., Glasgow, launched into space in July 2014. Over the next 5 years Clyde Space became a market leader, supporting around 30\-40% of all CubeSat missions, and with a EUR7,600,000 annual turnover by the end of FY2019. The success of Clyde Space, together with availability of expertise from Strathclyde researchers, attracted other high value satellite and data analytics companies to the central belt of Scotland. Strathclyde research has led to capacity building and development of satellite technology in Mexico, South Africa, Namibia and Kenya, has influenced international strategy and planning, and has informed NASA’s approach to small spacecraft.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2013 the UK Government identified ‘eight great technologies’ which would propel the UK to future growth; one of these was ‘satellites and commercial applications of space’. Since then, ‘new space’ has emerged as the term used to describe the private\-sector driven, space start\-up ecosystem that is leading the democratisation of space, with small, low\-cost, high\-performance satellites and their associated data products providing valuable information on the Earth’s weather, oceans and ecosystems. When deployed as a fleet, small satellites can be used to provide near\-real time global coverage and measurements. The reduction in cost and size of satellites, with advances in remote sensing technology, has been identified as a disruptive innovation by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. A CubeSat is one type of miniaturised satellite commonly used. The miniaturisation of components is continually improving and CubeSats are capable of increasingly advanced tasks, often replacing or complementing much larger satellites in scientific and commercial missions. 

 Since 2004, the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Strathclyde has established one of Europe’s largest multi\-disciplinary space engineering research clusters, focussed on the development and application of space systems. This cumulative expertise has given a ‘technology push’ to the space industry and supports the growth of commercial small and nano\-satellite companies, by providing algorithms and identifying enabling characteristics of technology to be exploited. An important area of research ongoing since 2009 has been into the nanosatellite technology development process, with some key outputs \(below\) selected from a wide body of research which provides insights into: 

-  How to develop disruptive innovations, for example increase the technology readiness level of solar sailing, \(where spacecraft are propelled by the radiation pressure of sunlight\) and develop technology roadmaps that exploit the unique characteristics of these innovations \[ **R1**\]; 

-  Model\-based and hardware\-in\-the\-loop simulation \[ **R2**\], to aid accelerated concept and hardware development, validation, and verification in the design and implementation of small satellite technology; 

-  Theoretical research on networked systems \[ **R3**, **R4**\] with results which offer parallels with biological flocks and swarms, and with implications for the design of technological networks, for example, how fleets of spacecraft can be developed, deployed, and exploited \[ **R5**, **R6**\]; 

-  Algorithms that enable resource allocation within network systems \[ **R3**\] and the structure of networks and algorithms for the identification of communities within them \[ **R4**\]. In\-turn, these algorithms and insights have enabled development of methodologies for agile and timely control and operation of fleets of small satellites \[ **R5**\]; 

-  Algorithms for near\-optimal data routing through delay and distribution tolerant communication networks, characteristic of a spacecraft fleet, without the need for all spacecraft to communicate instantaneously, or for global system knowledge \[ **R6**\]. 

 Research findings were implemented through sustained collaboration with Clyde Space Ltd., supported by a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) and a series of industrial fellowships. From 2008 – 2011, McInnes had a KTP with Clyde Space Ltd., joined by Macdonald in 2010. On completion of the KTP in 2011, the KTP associate \(S. Greenland\) was employed by Clyde Space. From 2013 – 2015, Greenland held an industrial fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 to continue work with Macdonald. In 2011 Clyde Space also sponsored an EPSRC iCASE PhD student \(C. Lowe\), under the supervision of Macdonald. Cumulatively, these projects supported and underpinned the development of Scotland’s first spacecraft, and the UK’s first commercial CubeSat, UKube\-1.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Research findings were implemented through a KTP, a series of industrial fellowships, projects funded by RUK Global Challenges and the UK Space Agency, industry collaboration and knowledge exchange via the Scottish Centre of Excellence in Satellite Applications \(SoXSA\). Strathclyde research directly led to and supported the following benefits: 

-  Sustained **commercial success and economic benefit for Clyde Space Ltd**. This company, together with Spire Global, became a driver for the **expansion of satellite manufacture in Scotland**, with Glasgow becoming a global centre of space and satellite innovation. 

-  Satellite data provided by Glasgow\-built spacecraft, and the data companies they enable, now serve a global customer base in the private sector and government, providing **efficient mapping and monitoring of the Earth’s resources, ecosystems, and events**. 

-  The research has also been applied to support **international expansion of ‘New Space’** technology in Low to Middle Income countries, and research\-based expertise has informed policy and planning by organisations such as NASA. 

###  Expansion of Clyde Space following success of UKube\-1 

 With research translation through a KTP and industrial PhD projects supervised by Macdonald in collaboration with Clyde Space, UKube\-1 was designed and built as an advanced micro\-spacecraft suitable for a range of applications, including Earth observation. Launched from Kazakhstan in July 2014, the mission aimed to attract and train future generations of engineers, encourage collaboration across sectors and institutions, and accelerate the development of space technology. Following the successful completion of the 14\-month UKube\-1 mission, the UK Space Agency stated that UKube\-1 is *‘*one of the most advanced CubeSats ever built… UKube\-1 has also helped maintain the UK’s leading position in the CubeSat sector. Participation in the mission places Clyde Space in an excellent position to capitalise on the fast\-growing global nanosatellite market. The company has experienced 100% year on year growth, both in turnover and employees, as a direct result from involvement in UKube\-1 and is firmly established as a global leader’ \[ **S1**\]. 

 The CTO of Clyde Space confirms that ‘the KTP with Strathclyde was a fundamental building block that led to the development of UKube\-1’ \[ **S2**\]. UKube\-1 established Clyde Space as a spacecraft manufacturer, and secured follow\-on spacecraft orders for the company, with significant growth since 2014, as the company transitioned from a sub\-system supplier to a spacecraft system integrator and service provider. By 2017, Clyde Space was a market leader with more in\-orbit heritage than any other supplier and supporting around 30\-40% of all CubeSat missions \[ **S2**\]. In January 2018, the Swedish company ÅAC Microtec AB completed a share sale and purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the shares in Clyde Space \[ **S2**\]. The acquisition was paid for with 30,500,000 newly issued shares in AAC, and GBP2,000,000 in cash to create the company now known as AAC Clyde Space. The merger of the two companies established a strong commercial presence in Europe, the US and Asia, and by the end of 2020, AAC Clyde Space employed over seventy staff in Glasgow \[ **S2**\]. From January\-September 2020 alone, AAC Clyde Space net sales amounted to GBP6,130,000 and the company is now an established leader in the global space sector. A Framework Agreement has also been in place since late 2019 with the University of Strathclyde to support and develop further collaboration. This resulted in the EUR19,700,000 \(11\-2020\) xSPANCION project with the European Space Agency to manufacture ten spacecraft for a North American customer from December 2020, with University of Strathclyde as a project partner to apply research on novel inter\-satellite data routing, and on constellation management and ground station selection \[ **S2**\]. 

###  Growth and relocation of satellite and data analytics companies in Glasgow 

 With the success of Clyde Space, and the research expertise available locally, Glasgow came to be seen as an important global centre of space and satellite innovation, attracting investment from international satellite and data analytics companies. In July 2019, the CSO of AAC Clyde Space said: ‘ *I can't say enough how important UKube\-1 was to not only Clyde Space, but also to the Scottish space industry.  I believe it was one of the most important catalysts to the fantastic growth we have since seen to the Scottish space sector \- 13 years ago there was practically no industry and now we have one of the fastest growing space sectors in the world*’ \[ **S5**\]. Examples of this growth and relocation include: 

-  In 2015, Spire Global, a Silicon Valley start\-up founded in 2012, opened its first European office in Glasgow, with the co\-founder and CTO confirming: ‘ *the relationship between Spire and the University of Strathclyde has been, and continues to be, strong ever since the company located to Glasgow in 2015*. The availability of talent with local high\-quality universities and the proximity of supply chain were key factors for Spire locating in Glasgow, and these continue to be significant motivators for the expansion plans’ \[ **S3**\]. Spire designs and builds nanosatellites to collect data from space to identify, track, and predict the movement of the world's aviation, shipping and weather systems. Spire launched their 100<sup>th</sup> Glasgow\-built spacecraft into orbit in April 2019, and in September 2019 the company announced that Glasgow office would expand to 320 staff over the following five years. By December 2019 Spire’s Glasgow office was operating the world’s third largest private constellation of spacecraft, behind Planet and SpaceX, and by end 2020 had launched a total of 110 Glasgow\-built spacecraft \[ **S3**\]. 

-  Bird.i, a global real estate data analytics company, relocated to Glasgow in 2016, recognising that ‘Glasgow was becoming the space capital of Europe’ \[ **S4**\]. 

-  In 2019, Orbital Micro Systems \(OMS\) Inc., based in Boulder, CO, partnered with AAC Clyde Space to locate staff in the central belt of Scotland \[ **S2**\], with Macdonald joining the company in 2020 as an Independent Non\-Executive Director to support the company’s growth plans. 

-  In 2014 the University of Strathclyde won the bid to host SoXSA, which was 1 of 5 centres opened by the Satellite Applications Catapult. The remit was to accelerate the development of the Scottish space sector, and broker links between academia and industry. Since 2014 there has been engagement with over 500 organisations, more than 100 workshops and events, over 60 collaborative projects \[ **S6**\]. The iconic Tontine building in the centre of Glasgow was transformed into a tech start\-up hub as part of the Glasgow Region City Deal, a GBP1,130,000,000 infrastructure funding agreement between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments. In 2016, SoXSA received funding from the UK Space Agency to work with Glasgow City Council and the Tontine incubator to support the creation of new space\-related companies \[ **S6**\]. By 2020, this incubator had supported the creation of 12 new space sector businesses. An average start\-up in Tontine increases turnover by GBP126,000, and 2 employees, in contrast, Strathclyde\-supported space start\-ups in Tontine on average increase turnover by GBP274,000 and four employees \[ **S6**\]. 

 The combination of new space companies coupled with the expertise at Strathclyde provides Glasgow with an exceptional, end\-to\-end capability, rarely found elsewhere in the world, to take an idea from concept, through development and build, into operations in space, and data or service exploitation. This ultimately provides easier access to and more cost\-effective space\-enabled data and services for existing and future customers. As a consequence of the success of AAC Clyde Space and Spire, more spacecraft are built in Glasgow than anywhere else in Europe \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Improved nanosatellite design, and commercial products underpinned by satellite data 

 Glasgow\-built spacecraft enable the creation and improvement of a wide range of data applications, notable examples are: 

-  Based on the UKube\-1 design and with project review support from Macdonald, AAC Clyde Space developed the SeaHawk CubeSat for the University of North Carolina, to monitor the health of the Earth’s oceans. SeaHawk is 130 times smaller, 45 times lighter, has a ground resolution 7\-15 times better, and has a Signal/Noise Ratio approximately 50% better than the spacecraft it replaces. This provides the University of North Carolina greater accuracy to measure ocean colour data, which plays a critical role in marine ecosystem monitoring \[ **S2**\]. 

-  Orbital Micro Systems’ Global Environmental Monitoring Satellite \(GEMS\), using AAC Clyde Space’s CubeSat platform, launched in July 2019, provides actionable weather data to a markets including aerospace and maritime transportation, who use the data to plan routes that optimize real\-time weather conditions, reducing delays, fuel consumption and emissions while operating with greater safety. By July 2020 the GEMS satellite had been operational for one year, delivering ‘ *precise, unique datasets that translate into highly reliable weather intelligence*’ \[ **S7**\]. 

-  Data generated by Spire’s Glasgow\-built spacecraft is being used by partners around the world to track global shipping and trade patterns to help identify illegal fishing, and to better understand global weather patterns \[ **S3**\]. This data supported a change in policy from the US Government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\), who assessed Spire’s data and ‘concluded that the commercial sector is capable of providing the quality of data needed to help support NOAA’s operational weather forecasting needs’, finding that the data improved the accuracy of one\- and three\-day weather forecasts \[ **S3**\]. As a result, in November 2020 NOAA placed a two\-year indefinite delivery\-indefinite quantity contract with Spire worth up to USD23,000,000 \(11\-2020\) to procure commercial data for operational use for the first time \[ **S3**\]. 

###  International expansion and capacity building in ‘new space’ technology 

 Macdonald and Lowe have directly supported the development of satellite technology and regional expertise in low\- and middle\-income countries, with UK Space Agency GCRF funding for these collaborations. Macdonald has also held several advisory roles, which influenced wider national and international level approaches and policy on small satellites and new space. 

-  Between 2015 and 2017, Lowe and Macdonald collaborated with MX\-Space, Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, Mexico, and commercial partners in Glasgow to develop mission design software for the NANOBED Missions Laboratory \[ **S8**\]. The resulting NANOBED was the first of its kind to be deployed in Latin America and significantly accelerated the validation process of the Mexican\-built AzTechSat\-1 nano\-satellite \[ **S8**\]. From 2017, Strathclyde researchers supported the development of a Globalstar CubeSat terminal for the AzTechSat\-1 \[ **S8**\]. This terminal allows CubeSats to send data to Globalstar, a constellation of satellites used for phone and low\-speed data communications, enabling CubeSat data to be downloaded continuously, rather than 2 \- 3 times daily when the CubeSat itself passed overhead. This led to the first collaboration between the Mexico Space Agency and NASA on a spaceflight project, which saw AzTechSat\-1, with the Globalstar CubeSat terminal on\-board, deployed from the international space station in February 2020 \[ **S8**\]. 

-  Building on this collaboration and funded by the UK Space Agency, Clyde Space led the FireSat project in collaboration with Macdonald and Lowe, alongside Government and University partners in South Africa, Namibia and Kenya, to support the deployment of the ZACube\-2 spacecraft by South Africa \[ **S2**\]. Launched in December 2018, the ZACube\-2 serves as a technology demonstrator for remote sensing applications such as ocean colour monitoring, large fire tracking, and ocean vessel detection. 

-  On the basis of his research expertise and support to the ‘new space’ sector, Macdonald was invited to advise on Ireland’s first national space strategy and supported University College Dublin’s successful submission for funding in June 2019 to Science Foundation Ireland. The prestigious Frontiers for the Future grant \(EUR1,000,000 \(06\-2019\)\), together with Macdonald’s continued input, will support the development of a new Centre for Space Research and growth of Ireland’s space sector from 2020 onwards \[ **S9**\]. 

-  From 2015 \- 16, Macdonald was technology lead on the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee on ‘Achieving Science Goals with CubeSats’ \[ **S10**\]. The subsequent report, commissioned by NASA, made a number of recommendations, including how NASA should better structure itself to embrace this form of disruptive innovation. In 2018, as a direct result of the committee’s recommendations, NASA created a new role of Special Advisor for Small Spacecraft Missions \[ **S10**\]. According to the Special Advisor, ‘the University of Strathclyde’s research on nano\-satellite technology and space mission analysis, conducted by Prof Malcolm Macdonald and his team, has been instrumental in informing NASA’s approach to small spacecraft.’ \[ **S10**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Understandings of the integration of migrants have been heavily contested leading to lack of coherence in provision for refugees. Our initial work developing the ‘Indicators of Integration’ framework \(over 500 citations\) shaped debate on refugee integration, bringing increased focus on social connection and its impact on access to rights and services. Our continuing policy, practice, and community focused research work now underpins UK and Scottish Government refugee integration policy, has influenced the design of major refugee support programmes and policy globally \(including in the UK, Australia and USA\), and informs mapping of connectedness and trust in diverse migration settings. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2001, UK Home Office commissioned a Queen Margaret University \(QMU\) team led by *Ager* to identify indicators of effective integration for refugees. The research included reviews of academic, policy and practice literature and quantitative and qualitative data collection involving refugees and host communities. *Strang* led the literature review, field research and analysis. Data from primary and secondary sources were distilled to identify ten core domains of refugee integration. The Indicators of Integration \(IoI\) framework specified these as: ‘Markers and means’ \(employment, housing, education, health\); ‘Social connections’ \(bridges, bonds, links\); ‘Facilitators’ \(language and cultural knowledge, safety and security\); and the ‘Foundations’ \(of rights and citizenship\). UK Home Office Working Papers were published in 2004, and academic papers in 2008 and 2010. The research broke new ground in providing a holistic model of refugee integration drawing on multiple perspectives and emphasising the interdependence of the domains, and elaborating the distinct types of social connection and their contribution to integration. 

 From 2009\-2013 Strang served on the steering group for a Scottish Refugee Council \(SRC\) longitudinal study of new refugees’ integration experiences, based on the Ager & Strang IoI framework. On the basis of this evidence, the Holistic Integration Service, \(funded by the Big Lottery\) was launched in 2013, and continues \(funded by the EU/Home Office\). The programme used the ‘IoI’ framework to shape service provision for new refugees. Strang led a QMU/SRC research team to examine refugee integration pathways using the client database \(recording experiences in each IoI domain\); focus group discussions and interviews with beneficiaries; engagement with a front\-line practitioner Community of Practice; and policy stakeholder interviews. Key findings demonstrated: significant delays in welfare benefits payments; the detrimental effects of housing policy on language acquisition, education and the development of social networks.  Clear evidence emerged of the importance of beginner level language support across all domains of integration, and challenges in finding employment – especially commensurate with refugees’ pre\-migration educational/skill levels \(Strang et al. 2014; 2015; 2016; 2017\) 

 Identifying a gap in research tools, Strang designed a participatory approach to mapping social connections and tested this in refugee resettlement and humanitarian contexts. The tool measures connectedness \(the mobilisation of networks\), trust and reciprocity across contrasting cultural contexts. The approach has been used to research patterns of social connection and access to services in resettlement contexts \(Strang & Quinn, 2019\).  A study amongst displaced Iraqis revealed disparities between resources available to different members of the population affected by the conflict \(men/women, displaced/left behind\) for meeting basic needs, resolving community disputes and addressing domestic violence \(Strang et al., 2020\). 

 The social connections tool is currently being deployed in studies addressing health in contexts of fragility \(through the NIHR RUHF Global Health Research Unit\); refugee family reunion and integration \(EU Asylum and Migration Integration Fund \- AMIF\); access to health in protracted displacement \(GCRF in collaboration with University of Edinburgh\), social networks and integration of refugees in Scotland \(AMIF\); and impacts of COVID restrictions on refugees and asylum seekers \(Scottish Government & Scottish Funding Council\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **National policy** 

 The IoI framework shapes current UK integration and social cohesion policy. In 2019 the Home Office \(HO\) and Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government launched a refreshed IoI framework \(and toolkit\) \[1 & 2\] with respect to which HO\-funded refugee integration projects are expected to demonstrate their impact. Strang co\-authored this framework, incorporating new research insights. The International Organisation for Migration \(IOM UK\) delivered HO\-funded training on the toolkit \(2019\-2020\) for Local Authorities and key stakeholders nationwide \[3\]. Specifications for the evaluation of the HO resettlement scheme and for a new ‘Refugee Transitions’ fund both reflect IoI domains. The latter responds to research by Strang \(2016; 2017\) and others demonstrating the need for long\-term support for refugee ‘transition’ to effective participation. 

 The ‘New Scots’ Refugee Integration Strategy \[4\] uses IoI as its underpinning framework and embeds IoI principles.  Strang chaired strategy development and implementation 2012 to 2018 \[4\], drawing on her research. Phase 2, 2018 – 2021 continues the IoI holistic approach, support from arrival and the involvement of communities. IGHD research briefings \(Strang et al., 2014, 2015, 2016; 2017\) regularly informed the strategy. 

 During the *All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration Inquiry into Integration* the Consortium of Scottish Local Authorities \(COSLA\) noted the effectiveness of the New Scots IoI\-based structure for multi sector response \(APPG Interim Report 2017\). Integration policy in Wales and N. Ireland also reflects this. Strang represented ‘New Scots’ in the Scottish ‘Refugee Taskforce’ convened in 2015/6 which led to new cross\-sector partnerships for resettling refugees. 

 **National practice** 

 Following the 2004 publication, Scottish Refugee Council \(SRC\), shifted focus to prioritise establishing ‘Integration Networks’ building ‘bridges’ between refugees and local people.  ‘New Scots’ continues to provide impetus for cross\-sectoral investment in community cohesion \(Scottish Community Development Centre, 2018\). Research on the Holistic Integration Service \(HIS: 2013\-16\), led to improvements in statutory agencies’ practice: e.g. ‘Client Journey’ to process refugee benefit claims; shared understanding between partners \(British Red Cross, Workers’ Educational Association, Glasgow Clyde College\), and the development of new interventions e.g. the  [Family Keywork Service](https://www.scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scottish-Refugee-Council_s-Family-Keywork-Service-Evaluation-Report.pdf).   SRC consistently uses the IoI framework and HIS research as a basis for securing funds, service provision, training, policy engagement and public awareness raising \[5\].  As a result, refugees and local communities benefit from increased access to health services, employment, welfare and education; and improved social connections and social cohesion. 

 NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde commissioned Strang to employ social connections mapping to investigate social isolation and mental health amongst refugee men. Dissemination with policymakers and practitioners led to a pilot intervention,  [‘Peer Education for Health’](https://www.scottishrefugeecouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Peer-Education-Evaluation-Report.pdf), later extended across Glasgow and shared in practitioner forums in UK, Europe and Australia. Scottish Government and AMIF have implemented the research implications by funding the Sharing lives, Sharing Languages’ programme to build social bridges through shared activity. \[5\]. 

 In 2018, British Red Cross received funding to support the integration of approximately 800 reuniting refugee families. The service provides casework based on IoI, and interventions using the IoI lenses of ‘bonds’ and ‘bridges’.  BRC and SRC are currently embedding the IGHD social connections mapping tool in case work to enhance caseworker practice and inform project planning \[5 & 6\]. 

 **Practice internationally** 

 Large\-scale examples of refugee support programmes informed by IoI include: Foundation House, Victoria; STARTTS, New South Wales, Australia;  RISE, Colorado, USA \[8\], and the ‘Finland\-My Home’ programme.  UNHCR and World Bank \[10\] reference the research in examining approaches to refugee integration support. 

 Research using the social connections tool \(Strang et al. 2020\) enabled practice partners in Iraq to develop more locally sensitive humanitarian programming harnessing locally trusted resources and shaped the practice of organizations supporting refugees and other vulnerable populations \[7\]. 

 **International policy** 

 The research has had particular influence on policy in Australia, as evidenced by the National Youth Settlement Framework 2020, where the IoI framework was a catalyst to bring together diverse principles of good practice into a rights based policy \[8\]. The IoI framework and research on social connections also helped shape the UN’s IOM DISC \(Diversity, Inclusion & Social Cohesion\) global strategy \[3\]. Research \(based on IoI\) in the USA has led to enhanced rights for refugee integration support in the state of Colorado \[9\]. 

 Broader influence is evidenced by international research papers reporting research on refugee integration using the work, invitations to present the research at international forums, \(Finland, Russia, Australia & New Zealand, Japan, South Korea\), and to contribute to policy consultations \(EC, ECRE, NATO\) along with direct enquiries from researchers and policymakers.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research is informing both the development and the regulation of new currencies to alleviate social and environmental challenges. At the local level, it supported the non\-governmental organisation Grassroots Economics to improve the lives of thousands of the poorest people in Kenya by expanding new currencies that facilitate their livelihoods. This included launching currencies in 44 other poor communities, further reducing poverty. At the global level, the research has explained the promise and limitations of currency innovation, influencing a United Nations \(UN\) agency to adopt the topic within its regulatory guidance to help countries to write their laws. This included exploring policy options with UN member states at the World Investment Forum, the largest gathering of trade officials in the world. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 During the assessment period, the topic and practice of currency innovation has generated increased interest from the public as well as tech innovators; initially as a marginal economic tool to something more widely discussed, particularly with the fame of bitcoin. Within this context, the research outlined here drew attention to potential public benefits rather than private gains, in particular the pursuit of sustainable development. 

 Having collaborated with the founder of Grassroots Economics in the past, Bendell was invited to participate more actively and provide an academic grounding to their work in Kenya. This included an evaluation \(R1\) of a Kenyan\-based complementary currency system \(Bangla\-Pesa\) that allows Kenyans in informal settlements to trade goods and services and meet sustainable development objectives. Key findings demonstrated that the Bangla\-Pesa is shown to have facilitated, upon its launch, exchanges of roughly 50 Euros in value per day among 109 businesses, and after only a week of circulation, represented an estimated 22% total trade among community members. 

 This was explored further in R2 as part of a report for the UN Research Institute for Sustainable Development, where we demonstrated how currency innovations such as the Bangla\-Pesa encounter challenges in infrastructure investment due to a lack of understanding amongst development professionals. This led to engagement with the UN system. R3 also utilised the Kenyan example more broadly in the context of management studies and corporate social responsibility, using the Bangla\-Pesa as a case study to illustrate wider implications for adoption of currency innovations. 

  

 Overall, this body of research demonstrated that: 

-  Currency innovators claim economic, social and environmental impacts, yet these impacts are variable, so more involvement and engagement from donors and policy makers would be helpful \(R3, R2\) 

-  Certain forms of currency innovation that provide new liquidity for poor people by monetising their spare assets and time have proved successful in reducing poverty in certain cases. To raise awareness with development donors, there is a need for more evaluation, financial aid, and conducive policy innovation \(R1, R2, R3\) 

-  The fields of currency innovation and blockchain technologies are hampered by confusion amongst scholars, regulators, lawyers and innovators, about what money and currency are, how the current system works and the reasons for its limitations. More guidance to and from policy makers was recommended \(R2\). 

-  The main types of currency innovation and uses of blockchain technology, and their potential benefits, are becoming more widely recognised \(R2\), with the example for sustainable development \(Bangla\-Pesa\) in Kenya outlined in both an international journal article \(R1, R2\) and a peer\-reviewed publication from the UN \(R3\).

###  3. References to the research \(indicative maximum of six references\) 

 The research for this project was interdisciplinary, combining management studies with international development studies. One of the key outputs \(R3\) was a paper published by the UN’s dedicated research agency on development issues, which demonstrates the credibility, significance and international applicability of the findings. These UN papers are circulated to regulators, policy makers, intergovernmental agencies and academics worldwide. R1 and R2 feature in peer reviewed journals.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact 1: Anti\-poverty Local Currencies in Africa are Legitimised by Research to Enable Large Rollout** 

 Research on one type of currency innovation, that provides new means of exchange to poor people in Kenya \(R1\), was influential in two main ways. First, by being the first study to document the positive impact of the projects in Kenya, the research raised the confidence of staff, stakeholders and regulators, which enabled their further expansion and replication in other poor areas of Kenya and now also in South Africa \(S8\). At the time of the research, there were around 200 people involved, with transaction volumes equivalent to a few dollars a day. Yet from September 2018 to May 2020 there were nearly half a million dollars of trades by nearly 20,000 registered users who live below or near the poverty line \(S9\), equivalent to around $900 dollars/day. 

 Since Covid\-19, there has been a huge increase in usage. Grassroots Economics started working with the Red Cross in a new part of Kenya on April 6<sup>th</sup> 2020, and in one month, $95,600 USD of transactions had been generated representing 2,588 new users living near or below the poverty line \(S9\). 

 Second, Bendell took this research to a UN agency that informs development assistance and policy \(UN Research Institute for Sustainable Development\), to help them understand this topic, which had not previously been considered in development assistance. They released a peer\-reviewed UN paper on the topic \(R3\) and subsequently organised follow up events to promote understanding within the international community. Since then, the Red Cross has supported the organisation that operates these currencies, Grassroots Economics \(GE\), to scale them further. The Founder of GE notes that this research being published at such a high level helped them significantly, especially in the early days when there was limited Government understanding of this topic. The research has also helped development organisations like the Red Cross to engage in the aims of GE, the Founder \(S2\) stating how the research was *“instrumental in developing wider awareness of our currency innovation projects at a time when aid and intergovernmental agencies and blockchain investors were not engaging us”*. As a result, GE have already implemented new currencies in 44 locations across Kenya and assisted with 2 in South Africa, to help more than 40,000 small businesses, schools and other organisations take an active role in their own development. 

 **Impact 2: Research helps UN agency see Currency Innovation as a Sustainable Development tool, to offer Guidance on, and giving basis for major Philanthropic Donations** 

 The UN is recognised by international relations theorists as doing more to regulate and influence the lives of people than through its direct influence over governments. When it works on an issue, there are a myriad of influences, globally, on the private sector and civil society, and in relation to economics and society. Knowing this, Bendell used his conceptual review \(R2\) to influence and advise officials at the UN’s primary economics agency, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \(UNCTAD\), to put this field of innovation on its agenda. Together they organised UNCTAD’s first ever event on the topic, with a special session \(called Blockchain for Sustainable Development \[B4SD.net\]\) of the 2018 World Investment Forum \(WIF\). The WIF is the world’s highest\-level meeting of investment regulators and the session was attended by around 700 people, mostly officials from international agencies and country missions. Bendell’s opening keynote \(S10\) discussed the benefits of blockchain for humanity, for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and addressing the climate emergency, utilising examples from his work in Kenya \(Impact 1\). 

 A follow on video published by B4SD.net \(S4\), included comments from the CEO of cryptocurrency trading firm, Binance: “This is the first time blockchain appeared in the United Nations. I think this is a very significant milestone that block chains \[are\] no longer a small thing…It is now accepted and recognised internationally and it’s no longer avoided… it is at a size where we can discuss about the impacts at the UN. It’s important enough for this kind of topic to appear here…that’s historical.” A further contributor, the Director of Investment and Enterprise, UNCTAD, stated “the important thing is that blockchain is a new phenomena, and with new phenomena, policy makers worldwide should be open minded, they should analyse and try to embrace the new phenomena to seize advantage of that.” 

 The key beneficiary of this initial activity was the UN system itself, as they established their future work on this matter. A UN official stated that Bendell’s “ *research in the area of currency innovation and blockchain has informed our work as we sought to establish blockchain technology as an important issue for UNCTAD and our stakeholders to engage with*” \(S1\). The government delegates are one beneficiary of the UN’s work. In a survey of attendees, issued 18 months after the WIF B4SD event, 67% of respondents confirmed that the event, or resulting interactions, influenced their organisation’s work. 60% of the respondents indicated they had been influenced by the research of Bendell \(S5\). 

 Bendell helped the cryptocurrency trading firm Binance and their African development charity \( [www.binance.charity](http://www.binance.charity/)\) to engage with UNCTAD, and at the B4SD WIF event they launched their donation platform, which has since generated over 12 million USD. This has enabled over 100,000 people in Africa to receive charitable and humanitarian support. This includes humanitarian relief in the form of aid parcels to people surviving natural disasters. Our research enabled the launch to take place within a more strategic context \(at the B4SD WIF event\). This meant that the scale of its subsequent success had a greater impact on individuals. The research, and engagement \(via Bendell\) with the WIF catalysed and expedited this process; bringing humanitarian aid and benefits more rapidly to those people needing them \(S3\). 

 **Impact 3: Research provides intellectual basis for free online course which enables innovators around the world to start projects** 

 In 2014 the University of Cumbria made headlines as the first public university in the world to accept bitcoin for payment of tuition fees. This institutional commitment to this topic, in addition to the research on the general field of currency innovation \(R2\) was the main source for the knowledge in a free online course, the Money and Society MOOC. The course was completed by over 500 people between 2015 and 2020. The software and content of the MOOC was developed jointly by Bendell and the Community Forge co\-founder, with the two also serving as tutors. The pair created the MOOC because the fields of currency innovation, and especially blockchain, were hampered by confusion amongst scholars, regulators, lawyers and innovators about the nature of money and the politics of power around it \(S6\). To inform the course, Bendell drew on his research into these matters, including R1 and R2. 

 The Community Forge review \(S7\) of the MOOC reported how many organisations and initiatives have used the knowledge from the course to launch or improve new currency projects. The review includes feedback from participants \(S7\), who were asked how learning from the MOOC has been used in practice: 

-  Partitur Xpress \(Germany\) – “ *The Money and Society MOOC changed my mind how I think about money, so every decision in my life, that has to do with money, was somehow influenced by* what I learned.” 

-  Warsaw School of Economics \(Poland\) – *“I developed two lectures \(Alternative money and Virtual Currencies\), and launched postgraduate studies on Blockchain at my university.”* 

-  Fair.Coop \(Spain\) – *“I applied the knowledge I learned in the MOOC* within Fair.Coop”. 

-  Manly Local Exchange Trading System \(Australia\) \- *""The historical information in the development & uses of money, currencies and policies was very informative & personally useful in building up my knowledge base.”* 

-  Lowimpact.org \(UK\) – *“We've joined with open.coop to try to build a UK mutual credit network \(the open credit network\)”* 

-  Happonomy \(Belgium\) – *“I used it to develop an alternative monetary system named Sustainable* Money System or SuMSy” 

-  Boodaville \(Spain\) – *“Our permaculture education project teaches about ethical design in all aspects of life. One of the three key ethics is ‘Fair Share’ relating to gift economy, consumption and thanks to the MOOC I can confidently deliver sections on a more ethical approach to Economics.”* 

-  New Forest Cohousing Limited \(UK\) \- *“We attempted to launch a Grand Union local currency in Hertfordshire but the difficulties of getting four District Councils to agree proved very difficult. I used some course knowledge in setting up a community land trust for a community farm.”* 

-  Synpraxis Mesogaias \(Greece\) – “ *We plan to start a community project in the town where our social enterprise is active.”* 

 These are diverse projects in different parts of the world, seeking to be economically viable ways of making positive impacts in society. The beneficiaries are therefore the social entrepreneurs themselves, as evidenced by the above, with the MOOC directly changing individuals approach to finance, prompting new educational and community programmes and currencies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr Clarke’s practice as research has pioneered interactive ways of experiencing history where it happened. The award\-winning collaboration with Historic Royal Palaces \(HRP\), *The Lost Palace,* impacted the public, museum professionals, and creative industry partners. It attracted over 20,000 visitors to Banqueting House, enriching their cultural experience and engagement with the history of Whitehall, London. The collaboration shaped HRP’s approach to interpretation, leading to the development of their new R&D Studio and new business opportunities. Creative technology collaborators have applied these innovations to other commercial projects, and the success of *The Lost Palace* has enabled them to promote and grow their business. It has influenced other international museums and heritage organisations to change their digital interpretation practices. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Through a series of practice as research enquiries, Dr Clarke has used site\-specific storytelling and creative technologies to explore relationships between place, history and memory. These projects have developed ongoing collaborations with creative industry partners, experimented with new forms of guided tours, and explored potential applications of theatre, binaural audio and location\-sensitive mobile devices in heritage contexts. 

##  Piloting location\-based storytelling 

 In 2010, Clarke worked with app developers Calvium to create *Give Me Back My Broken Night* **\[3.1\]**, a guided tour of the future of a place, using GPS devices and mobile projectors. In 2011, Tate Britain commissioned a *son et lumière* by Clarke’s company Uninvited Guests and sound designer Lewis Gibson as part of the *John Martin: Apocalypse* exhibition \(September 2011 \- January 2012\). This pioneering approach to interpretation used theatre, surround sound and projections mapped onto Martin’s *Last Judgement* **\[3.2\]** triptych to animate the paintings and ‘push at the boundaries of conventional gallery experience’ \(Martin Myrone, Tate curator, *Daily Telegraph*, 2011\). In their *Talking Objects* publication, The British Museum used it as an example of ‘successful collaboration’ and an inspiring approach to ‘animating museums’, ‘breathing new life into a collection, changing cultures and behaviours in relation to collections’. This led to *Memory of Theatre* \(2012\) **\[3.3\]** *,* Clarke’s REACT Heritage Sandbox project, a collaboration with Gibson, Calvium and Tom Morris, Artistic Director of Bristol Old Vic \(BOV\). A new oral history archive was created of audiences' memories of BOV, which were recorded binaurally and made publicly accessible in the theatre using an innovative indoor, location\-based app. Knowledge from these projects was brought together by Clarke in *The Good Neighbour* **\[3.4\]**, a theatrical guided tour of Lavender Hill and nearby streets \(Battersea Arts Centre, October \- November 2012\), which drew on local archives and documentary interviews. 

##  Pioneering immersive experiences in heritage buildings and sites 

 The partnerships Clarke developed led to collaborative work on a prototype for Historic Royal Palaces \(HRP, 2015\), chosen from among 90 proposals for production as a full visitor experience for Banqueting House, the last remaining building of Whitehall Palace. This commission addressed the problem of how to offer a tour of historic buildings that no longer exist, as the palace burnt down in 1698. It was also an experiment into how rich a digital experience can be without the use of screens, and whether multi\-sensory technology, including haptics, could enable felt connections with the past. The research output, *The Lost Palace* \(2016\-17\) **\[3.5\]**, which Clarke wrote, directed and co\-designed, was a new visitor experience commissioned by HRP, developed in collaboration with Calvium, Gibson and theatre producers Fuel, along with designers Chomko & Rosier and multimedia design studio Limbic Cinema. 

 The conceptual and technical approaches were informed by learning from the pilot projects outlined above. Clarke dramatised historic events, based on archival documents, which were delivered in situ on the streets of Whitehall, using theatre and emerging technologies to enable visitors to experience history where it happened. The method developed employed binaural recording techniques to reproduce the acoustics of the absent buildings and produce a 3D, augmented audio experience, such that visitors were immersed in the historic scenes. In terms of technical development, Clarke co\-conceived a bespoke, handheld, wooden device, with no screen or buttons, which worked like a “historical surveillance device”, and co\-designed a range of novel interactions, including gestural triggers and haptic responses, which gave the users roles in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>\-century narratives.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Through the creation of a new visitor experience, *The Lost Palace* **\[3.5\]**, Dr Clarke’s research has produced cultural and economic impacts, benefitting museum professionals, the public, and digital creatives. 

##  Changing Historic Royal Palaces’ approach to immersive technology and visitor engagement 

 Museums and heritage sites have often struggled to create engaging digital content. By using theatre and innovative technologies, Clarke enabled Historic Royal Palaces \(HRP\) to create an immersive experience for visitors to engage with history where it happened. HRP ‘learnt vast amounts from *The Lost Palace* that will be able to inform how Banqueting House is developed as a visitor attraction and how we can tell the story of this palace that’s no longer there’ **\[5.1\]**. It transformed their interpretation strategy at Banqueting House, understanding of the potential of technology, and creative partnerships. 

 *The Lost Palace* ran every 20 minutes for 16 weeks across summer 2016 and 2017, for audiences of around 20, attracting over 20,000 visitors to Banqueting House, some of whom had not visited HRP before. 37% of *The Lost Palace* visitors were between the ages of 25\-34, which is rare for a heritage attraction **\[5.4\]**. A family\-friendly version with stories and interactions specially designed for 7\-14\-year\-olds resulted in high engagement from young audiences, plus there were out\-of\-hours ‘lates’ with content specifically targeted at adults. Furthermore, HRP benefitted economically from additional ticket sales of GBP12 for the adult tour and GBP7 for children. 

 Following successful collaboration, prototyping and production of *The Lost Palace*, HRP established a new R&D Studio in late 2016, which incorporated lessons from Clarke’s research and the iterative, user\-centred design process \( [https://www.hrp.org.uk/research\-and\-development\-studio/\#gs.jinpej](https://www.hrp.org.uk/research-and-development-studio/)\). This in\-house creative development studio provides opportunities for artists in residence to explore new forms of public engagement with heritage. It has led to commissions of performance, digital installations, and immersive storytelling at other HRP locations \(e.g. *The People’s Revolt* with East London Dance and Hofesh Shechter’s *East Wall: Storm the Tower*, Tower of London\). *Lost Palace* partners Chomko & Rosier subsequently took part in these residencies, developing two further multisensory visitor experiences in the form of permanent installations for Henry VIII’s Kitchens and Base Court at Hampton Court Palace \( [https://chomkorosier.com/kitchens.php](https://chomkorosier.com/kitchens.php); https://chomkorosier.com/base\-court.php\). 

 According to the Head of the R&D Studio at HRP, *The Lost Palace* was ‘innovative in its approach to collaborating with creative partners and shows a huge leap in the use of digital technologies within a heritage environment’ **\[5.1\]**. The founder of MuseumNext states ‘The result is a triumph and shows the benefits of both collaboration and investing in R&D. What could have been another unremarkable museum app \[was\] instead something truly memorable and immersive’. For him, it was ‘pioneering’, ‘one of the best executed digital experiences I’ve seen from a museum’, and ‘has a ton of lessons for those trying to make magic happen with digital in a heritage or cultural setting’ **\[5.2\]**. 

 The project significantly raised HRP’s and creative partners’ reputations in the area of digital heritage/interaction and led to international awards, including the IMAGINES Project of Influence award at The Best In Heritage awarded by ICOM \(International Council of Museums\) and Europa Nostra \(Dubrovnik 2018\). This recognises the multimedia/technology project judged to have made the best impact on global museum professionals and to have the ‘potential to produce change and advance professional practices by their power of inspiration’. *The Lost Palace* also received Best Achievement and Interactive and Games Awards at European Heritage in Motion \(2017\), and the Museums \+ Heritage award for Innovation \(2017\), the judges of which wrote, ‘a genuinely innovative project which successfully harnessed new technology to bring to life the history which surrounds us in a new multi\-sensory, tangible way’. It was also shortlisted for a 2017 IXDA award \(global network for interaction design\) **\[5.3\].** 

 *The Lost Palace* was critically acclaimed in professional museum and technology publications, and in the popular press. *Museums Journal* wrote that, ‘both the technology and the content are of high quality and, just as importantly, are used together effectively to bring the past to life. Buzzwords such as immersive, innovative and intuitive can be overused, but in this instance, they feel justified’. *BBC Click* described it as ‘a really thrilling experience... beautifully constructed & well put together... neither the theatre nor the tech unbalanced each other’ and *Time Out London* as ‘Funny, moving and fascinating, it’s a brilliantly created tour with plenty of smart surprises… more attractions should be creating experiences like this’. Mar Dixon, of Teens in Museums, the multinational CultureThemes and Twitter's Ask a Curator Day, said it was the ‘perfect marriage of storytelling and technology’. It ‘Brings history to life in an immersive way. Great for all ages. Even my teen loved it\!’ **\[5.5\].** 

##  Inspiring digital innovation in the wider museum and heritage sectors 

 *The Lost Palace* created a new approach to digital interpretation in historic buildings and museums, an approach that has been shared widely within the sector. It has been used as a point of reference in the field of museum interaction and digital heritage and led to invitations to present at professional conferences internationally over 2017\-2020: MuseumsNext, New York 2019 and Rotterdam 2017; MTI2017, Paris; Digital Design Weekend, V&A; REMIX Summit Sydney; Culture Technology Entrepreneurship, Oxford University; Digikult, Heritage Istanbul 2018; keynote at The Best in Heritage 2019, Dubrovnik; Exponatec, Cologne 2019; StoryFutures AHRC Creative Cluster Story Lab, National Gallery; National Lottery Heritage Funded Inspiration Day at Battersea Arts Centre; 5G and Smart Tourism Workshop, The Roman Baths, Bath. 

 The project’s method of recording dramatised accounts in immersive 3D has been taken up by New York’s Met Museum in the production of a binaural audio experience as part of *Visitors to Versailles* \(2018\). For the Managing Editor and Producer of the Met’s Digital Department, when researching a solution for creating a “you\-are\-here” audio experience, ‘the key turned in the lock when I attended a museum conference and learned about \[ *The Lost Palace*, a\] walking tour produced in London that mimicked the 3D sound we experience naturally \[by using\] binaural sound recordings’ **\[5.6\]**. *The Lost Palace* is cited as an exemplary ‘audio journey’, a ‘form of audio augmented reality’, in *Immersive Content Formats for Future Audiences*, a report produced for Digital Catapult, 2018, and is used as a case study in *Inspiring Creativity, Heritage & The Creative Industries*, a report on fruitful collaborations between creative industries and the heritage sector, produced for the Heritage Alliance, the biggest national coalition of heritage organisations. It is also the case study for the ‘Social Experiences’ theme in *Immersive Experiences in Museums, Galleries and Heritage Sites*, a discussion paper for the AHRC Policy and Evidence Centre, led by Nesta, 2019 **\[5.7\]**. 

##  Enhancing visitors’ experience, engagement with history, and connection to place 

 *The Lost Palace* enabled visitors to experience historical events in the exact locations where they happened in an accessible, multisensory way that engaged them emotionally with people and stories from Whitehall’s past. 93% of visitors agreed that ‘the experience was unique to others I’ve had at visitor attractions’, noting how different it felt to the simple museum audio guides they had previously tried. For 92% of those surveyed it ‘brought the history of this time and place to life’ and 90% agreed that it ‘made me feel more connected to the past’ **\[5.4\].** The Nesta discussion paper **\[5.7\]** argues that *The Lost Palace* shows ‘how powerful social interactions can be during immersive experiences’, which ‘can seed strong connections not only between people and place, but from person to person also’. Visitors said, I ‘definitely haven’t connected to history like that before’, that it gave them a ‘whole new understanding of \[the\] history of Whitehall\!’ and, ‘if history had been taught this way, I might not have become a scientist\!’ One wrote, ‘I was amazed how easily modern life drifted to the background whilst the past became more vivid and alive around me’. They had ‘never experienced anything like’ it, found *The Lost Palace* to be ‘an incredible immersive experience’, ‘such an imaginative venture’, ‘evocative’, ‘innovative, informative \+ fun’, ‘exceptional, playful and very moving\!’ **\[5.8\]**. 

##  Creating new business opportunities for creative industry partners 

 *The Lost Palace* has led to additional economic benefits for the creative industry partners involved. The methods, applications, and technologies developed have been transferred to other contexts and enabled them to successfully bid for new commissions totalling GBP350,000. Calvium stated that ‘funders liking *Lost Palace*’ and its ‘resounding success’ has led to opportunities to tender. It has ‘helped with brand building’ and ‘as a case study for general sales pitches’, specifically ‘to demonstrate \[their\] capability for working on novel uses of technology’ **\[5.10\].** Their White Paper, ‘Optimising Digital Innovation for Cultural Heritage Institutions’ focuses on *The Lost Palace*, shares the approach and makes ‘recommendations for other heritage organisations’ on how to deliver ‘new, richer, and more engaging visitor experiences’ **\[5.9\].** *The Lost Palace* directly led to theatre sound designer Gibson being involved with many other heritage projects \(totalling GBP74,100\). Gibson was approached by ATS Heritage, who design audio and multimedia guides, after they saw *The Lost Palace,* and together they commissioned binaural content for numerous other historic sites, including The Cutty Sark, Orford Castle, The Royal Hospital Chelsea, Osborne House, Canterbury Cathedral, The Painted Hall \(Old Royal Naval College\), and Hever Castle. Gibson is also producing an audio\-led exhibition, using cutting edge locative technology developed by NOUS \(Austria\) for the new Hans Christian Andersen Museum in Denmark opening in Summer 2021 \(GBP50,000\). Gibson added ‘this commission came about because the creative directors of the project saw *The Lost Palace* and it involves a great deal of skills… developed on the project’ **\[5.10\]**. For partners Limbic Cinema, ‘having a small part in the award\-winning project… has definitely added some calibre to our pitch documents’. They have since won several commissions locally for education and historic institutions, including: five new permanent installations for Bristol’s We The Curious \(GBP70,000\); four pieces of digital heritage interpretation for Bristol Old Vic, including an AR collaboration with Zubr and projection\-mapping with Aardman \(GBP70,000\); and the SS Great Britain’s anniversary event \(GBP15,000\) **\[5.10\]**. Newly established company Chomko & Rosier commented that the industry attention from the success of *The Lost Palace*, its experimental nature and ambition, led to further projects within the heritage sector for clients including National Trust, and further work for HRP at Hampton Court. For them, the value of earnings resulting from *The Lost Palace* is within the region of GBP60,000\-GBP80,000. For Rosier it ‘informed how we manage collaborations and gave us the confidence to work with creatives and professionals from a wide range of disciplines’ **\[5.10\]**. It also ‘gave other institutions and commissioners confidence in our ability to collaborate in such ways’ and ‘to deliver large scale public work’. ‘There is continued interest in *The Lost Palace* within the heritage sector and beyond’, which ‘continues to lead to invitations’ and create ‘opportunities’ **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lymphatic filariasis \(LF\) is a mosquito\-borne parasitic infection that is endemic in 73 countries globally. In 2000, it was estimated that approximately 1,400,000,000 people were at risk with over 120,000,000 infected and 40,000,000 disfigured and incapacitated by disease. Morbidity management and disability prevention is a central component of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) objectives for LF elimination, and research at the Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases \(CNTD\) has developed innovative tools to estimate patient numbers, assess access to quality health services, and quantify the impact of care on the quality of life. This has resulted in more efficient identification of patients in need of life\-changing care and surgery by LF programmes in 7 countries, and the implementation of evidence\-based strategies that are helping endemic countries meet the WHO key criteria for LF elimination. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Lymphatic filariasis \(LF\) is a mosquito\-borne parasitic infection of public health importance. LF infection can impair the function of lymphatic vessels and associated tissues, and lead to chronic disabling and disfiguring conditions including hydrocoele \(scrotal swelling; affecting approximately 15,000,000 men\), and lymphoedema of limbs \(skin/tissue thickening; affecting approximately 25,000,000 people\). These are most often accompanied by secondary bacterial infections causing acute inflammation or acute dermatolymphangioadenitis \(ADLA\). These conditions have a significant impact on patients’ physical, social, mental and economic wellbeing and the family members who care for them. 

 LF is a major cause of disability and responsible for 5,250,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years \(DALYs\) worldwide each year. The WHO’s Global Programme to Eliminate LF \(GPELF\) was launched in 2000 to address this significant burden, with one of its aims being to alleviate suffering through morbidity management and disability prevention \(MMDP\). In 2015, the WHO advocated that national LF elimination programmes implement a minimum package of care; however, very few countries had information on the clinical burden, health services capacity or methods to assess impact. 

 To address this critical need, between 2013 and 2020, LSTM’s Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases \(CNTD\) developed and implemented a research programme to address the MMDP priorities. This was led by Dr Louise Kelly\-Hope, working in collaboration with national programmes and research partners in 7 endemic countries, and included the development, piloting, implementation and evaluation of an innovative mHealth reporting tool, field\-based decision\-making framework, hotspot mapping and assessment surveys. The aims were to enable national programmes to better determine i\) patient number estimates, ii\) access and quality of health services, and iii\) impact on quality of life. 

1.  **Patient number estimates** 

 An <ins>Innovative SMS mHealth tool</ins> was developed \(in 2013/2014\), piloted and used for patient reporting by community health workers \(CHWs\) across 7 endemic countries to send data on local LF cases digitally via phone SMS to the national programme at central level. Quality of SMS data were assessed via an online server and case identification data verified by medical experts \[1,2\]. 

 <ins>Field scenarios and a decision\-making framework</ins> were developed between 2014 and 2016 from the extensive field\-experience in scaling\-up the mHealth tool across diverse demographic and endemic settings, and taking into account feasibility, endemicity, population demography, health system structure and integration with other diseases \[3\]. 

 <ins>Morbidity high\-risk ‘hotspot’ maps</ins> were developed from the clinical data collected by CHWs, including those reported via the SMS mHealth tool. Spatial analytical methods were used to identify and map high prevalence ‘hotspot’ areas at district and national levels in 5 countries \[2,4\]. This work was conducted between 2016 and 2019. 

  

1.  **Access and quality of health services** 

 <ins>‘Accessibility to surgery’ maps</ins> were developed in 2014/2015 to identify spatial inequalities in access to essential surgical care for men with hydrocoele in Malawi. Spatial analytical methods were used to identify and map hard\-to\-reach areas that may hinder access \[5\]. 

 <ins>A hospital facility assessment tool</ins> \(the Hydrocoele Surgery Facility Assessment Tool \(HSFAT\) was developed to assess the quality and readiness of hospital services available for hydrocoele surgery across 10 aspects. A scoring method was used to quantify the hospital status. Piloting of this tool began in 2018 in 44 hospitals in 3 countries. 

1.  **Impact on quality of life** 

 <ins>Quality of life surveys</ins> were developed between 2016 and 2019 to quantify changes in both patients’ and caregivers’ lives across 6 key domains, including economic productivity. A scoring method was used to quantify impact before and after the patient receives an intervention, such as surgery for hydrocoele or training/wash kits for lymphoedema, in 4 countries \[5,6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 WHO launched the GPELF in 2000. The strategy had two components but, prior to 2015, the focus had been almost entirely on interrupting transmission via mass drug administration and there was no strategy to address the second component: to alleviate suffering of affected populations. LSTM’s CNTD developed the tools to improve the collation of data on LF morbidity which has led to improved health and economic well\-being for LF patients and their caregivers, efficiencies in the planning and implementation of MMDP by programme managers and district CHWs, and evidence\-based strategies that have strengthened WHOs work to eliminate LF as a public health problem. 

 In addition to developing many of the tools now routinely used in MMDP programmes in LF endemic countries, CNTD conducted extensive implementation research. Our iterative process involves studying factors affecting implementation, quantifying and describing the impact of the implementation on patients and health systems, and evaluating the sustainability of activities. Hence, many of the sources to support impact come from our own ongoing evaluations. 

 <ins>Impact on patients and caregivers</ins> 

 *Patient Estimates and Access to Quality Health Services*: The decision\-making frameworks our research developed led to greater number of patients being identified. These patients benefitted from being identified by local health workers and being trained in home\-based self\-care lymphoedema strategies and/or referred to local hospital for hydrocoele surgery. Through our programme, 36,000 health workers in 7 countries were trained in patient searching and lymphoedema care, and 11,343 hydrocoele surgeries, improving the quality of life of men, were performed between October 2015 and March 2019; the lymphoedema and hydrocoele programme is now being expanded to additional African countries via the ASCEND programme \[1\]. 

 *Impact on quality of life* **:** Quality of life surveys conducted across 4 countries found significant positive changes in patients and their caregiver’s lives after the patient received an intervention. Lymphoedema patients with moderate to severe conditions in Bangladesh and Ethiopia showed improvement in quality of life following the new enhanced care protocol introduced in 2018, resulting in reduction of disability \[2\]. Of the 330 patients surveyed after receiving hydrocoele surgery in Bangladesh, Malawi and Nepal between 2013 and 2019, all reported significantly improved quality of life across many aspects including mobility, self\-care, psychological health, social participation, and economic productivity. In Malawi, all pre\-surgery moderate\-severe problems resolved post\-surgery \[survey of 137 men’s lives following surgery in Malawi between 2015 and 2016\] \[3\]. The average annual economic burden per chronic case of LF has been estimated as USD115, the majority of which resulted from productivity costs \[4\]. Our own research in Malawi has shown that surgery increased the average man's future earning capacity by approximately 24.50 times the cost of surgery \[5\]. Considering the 11,343 surgeries performed across 7 countries between October 2015 and March 2019, this has had significant impact on alleviating poverty. This is illustrated by feedback from patients and caregivers such as the following from: *Before the operation I was feeling very weak but now I am able to work and farm. I am healthy again \(Patient, Malawi 59 years\) \[3\]; ‘I am happy because now my father is able to work and our livelihood has changed \(Daughter, Malawi, 32years\)* 

 Caregivers of hydrocoele patients in Malawi also show improvements in their lives following men’s surgery with economic productivity increased significantly. Pre\-surgery, caregivers were unable to work or attend school for approximately 8.2 days per month, which reduced to 0 days post\-surgery \[6\]. Similar negative socio\-economic impacts on caregivers of lymphoedema patients have also been found in Ethiopia before interventions were implemented \[7\]. 

 <ins>Impact on LF programme managers and district and community health workers</ins> 

 *Patient estimates* **:** The innovative SMS mHealth tool facilitated the real\-time collection of clinical LF data from Malawi, Guinea, Nepal, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Liberia \[8\]. Between October 2014 and September 2018, CHWs searched their communities to identify and report over 17,000 lymphoedema cases and 8,000 hydrocoele cases across the 7 endemic countries, using the SMS mHealth tool \[8,9\]. The SMS mHealth tool provided health workers with a user\-friendly tool which was used to report around one third of the cases, supplementing the traditional paper\-based data collection methods. This helped to ensure that local\-level data reached the LF programme team at the Central level, who also benefitted from having readily collated case estimates to examine and consider the burden on endemic communities and health systems to optimise resource allocation and arrange refresher training where needed. 

 <ins> *CHW quotes re SMS mHealth tool:</ins> “It is fast information, and it is easy to get good data in our catchment area.” \(Male, Malawi, aged between 26 and 35\)* 

 *“I am happy that the burden of my community is now known” \(Female, Ghana aged between 46 and 55\) \[9\]* 

 *Quality of health facilities:* The hotspot maps were used to generate risk maps, identify residual transmission, and target resources appropriately in Nepal, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Malawi. In 2020, predictive models developed from the Malawi risk maps increased the efficiency and cost\-effectiveness of patient searching and reporting in unmapped areas, which helped the national LF programme save approximately 33% of mapping costs, and increase their knowledge of the clinical epidemiology, which facilitated gender\- and condition\-specific care. 

 *‘’The collaborative work between Ministry of Health, Malawi and LSTM on morbidity mapping has helped the Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program understand the clinical epidemiology and distribution of cases. This has helped to save time and resource by targeting essential services to where they are needed most’’ John Chiphwanya, Program Manager* 

 The Hydrocoele Surgery Facility Assessment Tool \(HSFAT\) helped to ensure quality and readiness of services, and was piloted in Malawi, Bangladesh and Nepal. The tool is now used as a standard assessment tool in a large MMDP programme across 13 West and Central African countries \[1\]. The ‘accessibility to surgery’ maps and HSFAT also helped the LF programme identify gaps in their health services leading to improvements to ensure quality of care to patients. 

 <ins>Impact on the Global Elimination of Filariasis</ins> 

 By developing and implementing a framework for morbidity management and disability prevention, we have supported 7 countries to meet two of the key milestones used by WHO to confirm elimination of LF as a public health problem \(defining the burden of disease and implementation of a minimum package of care\); this was key to the declaration that Malawi was free from LF in 2020 \[10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *Misbehaving Bodies* was an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection, sited in the Wellcome Trust \(the UK’s largest charity\), that brought together Ashery’s social practice artwork with that of iconic feminist artist Jo Spence. The exhibition challenged audiences and Wellcome staff to feel and think differently about health and encouraged the acceptance of illness as a part of life. 

 Ashery’s collaborative development – together with curators at the Wellcome – of the exhibition, its design, and an innovative public programme inspired the Wellcome to work in newly collaborative ways with contemporary artists, influencing the Collection’s professional practice to embrace artists’ framing of difficult social issues.  It spurred the Wellcome to think about health diversity in new ways and made senior staff more aware of the need to take care of their own and their team members’ health.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Ashery’s socially engaged art practice involves working with individuals, groups and communities to promote self\-knowledge and encourage minor narratives, resulting in biopolitical fictions. Prior to arriving at the Ruskin, Oreet Ashery’s artworks *Revisiting Genesis* \(2016\) and *No\-Nothing Collaborative Storytelling in the Dark* \(2017 onwards\) questioned how generative storytelling within ‘safe spaces’ might create powerful moments of social agency.  Her reputation for publicly addressing illness and death was recognised by her receipt of the 2017 Jarman Award. 

 Ashery was invited, shortly after arriving at the Ruskin, to exhibit at the Wellcome Collection **\(R1\),** in dialogue with a key figure in the history of feminist art, Jo Spence, who died of breast cancer and documented her illness through her art. For the exhibition, which included a commission from the Collection of GBP45,000, Ashery produced a new film, *Dying Under Your Eyes* **\(R2\)**, that documents her personal process of accepting her own father’s illness and death, including an artistic collaboration with his palliative care nurse. Like *Revisiting Genesis,* this newer film explores the sociopolitical, practical and emotional implications of the processes surrounding death and dying in the digital age.  It seeks new ways to represent illness and death, attempting to break down binaries of health and sickness, and actively, through artistic practice, asking how one might make the ‘abject body’ visible in our present era, which places so much emphasis on wellness. 

 Ashery also created a specific, intimate installation to house her and Spence’s works, including ‘soft architecture’ and immersive seating, allowing a safe space for contemplation of difficult issues. This design – enabled through unique collaborations with Wellcome staff and Kohn Architects – rethinks Michel Foucault’s influential concept of heterotopia, transformative ‘other’ spaces, which reflect and upset dominant structures. Ashery staged a Long Table in the centre of the exhibition – a flexible performance space – where workshops and social practice discussions were held **\(R3\)**, spurring the engagement of audience members with the exhibition’s subject matter, and inviting a sharing of their own lived experiences with illness and health around topics like ‘self\-care and survivance’. Finally, Ashery co\-created with freelance curator Persilla Caton a series of performative public conversations that explored the exhibition’s themes of death and dying in the digital age **\(R4\)**. An artistic monograph made possible through the support of the Arts Council England among others \(total GBP20,000\) was published by Mousse Press to disseminate Ashery’s research **\(R5\).** 

 *Misbehaving Bodies*, the resulting exhibition at the Wellcome, which aimed to effect change by bringing illness and death into open public discourse, was honoured with a Turner Bursary in 2020. An exploration of chronic illness, *Misbehaving Bodies* marked a further step for the Wellcome into the contemporary art space. Shortly after opening it was reviewed widely including in *The* *Guardian*, *art\-agenda,* and *Architectural Digest*.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Challenged Wellcome visitors to confront the social complexities associated with illness and death** 

 *Misbehaving Bodies* \( *Timeout*: ‘absolutely what the Wellcome Collection should be spending its money on. When compared to the sterile, bleached world of medicine – and the sugary pink of cancer charities and “women’s health” – this strange, messy, flawed, incomplete, artistic, female take on sickness is more than welcome’\);  *The Guardian*: ‘an invigorating – if ultimately heartbreaking – experience’\) **\(E1\)** has prompted a large and diverse cross\-section of the public interested in contemporary culture and science – as well as audiences who experience illness – to confront the social complexity of illness and death and to rethink the social dimension of fundamental aspects of existence that are often regarded as private. Former Wellcome Collection Curator \(Curator 1\): ‘The Wellcome Collection is a free venue situated next to University College Hospital and, as such, receives many audiences who have visited the oncology wards and waiting on loved\-ones who may be using the Wellcome as a respite space’. **\(E2\)** 

 *Misbehaving Bodies* was visited by an average of 809 people a day: 166,560 in total **\(E3\)**. Curator 1: ‘It’s exceeded our expectations with regards to footfall’ **\(E4\);** ‘a significant number for an exhibition dealing with such political work’ **\(E2\);** indeed, the first four months of *Misbehaving Bodies* were the most successful ever at the Wellcome, with over 57,000 visitors in September 2019, up 40% from September 2018 and 55% from September 2017.  The exhibition was extended beyond initial planning to an eight\-month run, the longest ever for a contemporary art exhibition at the Wellcome Collection. 

 A Wellcome Curator \(Curator 2\) observed: ‘Something very impactful happens when people encounter this work… when the private and public merge: it makes audiences confront their own vulnerabilities’. **\(E5\)** Visitor Experience Assistant \(VEA\) 1 comments: ‘The visitors I spoke to felt the exhibition stirred something in them, an awareness of death.  For me, the exhibition was an encouragement to live’. **\(E6\)** Another, \(VEA 2\) noted that audience members shared a sense of solidarity around some quite personal experiences. ‘They seemed to feel that this was an acceptable space to feel vulnerable’. **\(E7\)** Curator 1: ‘ *Misbehaving Bodies* was a gallery as a community space, to congregate and ask questions about how to grieve and value vulnerability publicly’ **\(E2\)**. 

 At the exhibition’s exit, Ashery explicitly invited audiences to reflect on the question ’Do you consider yourself healthy?’ and to deposit their responses; hundreds were received.  Wellcome Curator 1: ‘I’m struck by how few of the respondents – of all ages – consider themselves “one hundred per cent” healthy. Themes addressed include mental and physical health, exercise, friendship, diet, disability, feelings of self worth, chronic pain and terminal illness’. **\(E2\)**  Many responses questioned the binary of ‘healthy/ ill’, and evinced resilience: ‘My health isn’t perfect … Seeing an exhibition of people who will soon die makes me realise how healthy I am’.  ‘We are so complex, can all of us be healthy all of the time? Thank you for making me think about my body.’  ‘Am I healthy? Am I not healthy? I am neither. I am alive’. **\(E8\)** 

 Participants in Ashery’s Long Table social artwork described feeling free to express themselves: ‘there aren’t many spaces like this’; ‘this has somehow become a safe space for me’ and shared difficult personal experiences of loneliness due to ill health, as well as positive ones around care for self and others: ‘you’re taking care of yourself \[when you\] take care of your community, and I think we do that in sharing personal difficulties, so thank you’. **\(E9\)** Another participant observed: ‘…chronic illness can be extremely performative, the way we present ourselves as disabled people… it helped me root myself in the art world... it was extremely refreshing to me \[as\] that’s all I’m looking for’. **\(E10\)** Another lauded the discussions’ removal of the taboo of death and has since used *Dying Under Your Eyes* as an educational resource for Health & Social Care practitioners at the Open University. **\(E11\)** 

 **Changed the Wellcome Collection’s long term approach to exhibition planning and encouraged new ways for staff think about health diversity** 

 *Misbehaving Bodies* also encouraged the Wellcome to work in newly collaborative ways with contemporary artists so that they might play an increasingly important role in open debates about public health. Curators and policy\-makers at the Collection have been emboldened by new experiments with Ashery to involve artists in future exhibition\-making in ways they have not done in the past – enabling lasting and growing impact into the future. Curator 1 asserts that it was ‘crucial that the exhibition foregrounded the voice of the artist, creating a space for the public to reflect on how they think and feel about healthcare themselves’. **\(E2\)**  Curator 2: ‘This collaboration with Oreet gives the Wellcome team confidence and pride in working with contemporary artists – something that has not always come naturally in our institution’. **\(E5\)** Similarly, the Wellcome Head of Live Programme observed that the conversations ‘can be quite taboo… \[together with Oreet\], the live programme was always conceived to be about depth of engagement, so that people had truly meaningful opportunities to share… something that we don’t often do in exhibitions programming’. **\(E12\)**The exhibition was a first for the Wellcome in two ways:  Ashery was the first artist to co\-design the exhibition, and she was the first to co\-design the public programme. Positive experiences have encouraged curators at the Collection to repeat the model. Curator 1:  ‘Viewers did not enter a neutral white cube environment but rather a space defined by the artists’ personalities. . .  this was very much *their* space. . . we wanted people to feel immersed in the work and not on the outside looking in . . . a place where people felt like they were being “hugged”’. **\(E2\)** Curator 2 : ‘It was unique to include the artist as part of the design team, and it was a leap of imagination for us. If an architectural firm had designed the show, perhaps it wouldn’t have felt like the “safe space” that Oreet created’. **\(E5\)** They are now thinking about involving an artist in their next process. The Head of Live Programme agreed that Oreet’s artist\-led public programme was ‘…a departure from how we usually work... good practice… has evolved as part of this, that we can learn from and continue to develop in the rest of what we do’. **\(E12\)** 

 Working collaboratively and creatively with Ashery also allowed curators of the Collection to tackle emotionally and socially difficult work which they might not otherwise have embraced.  Curator 2: ‘We've learnt a lot as an institution, going forward, about giving space to an artist, about giving them the freedom to experiment around socially sensitive topics’. **\(E5\)** Wellcome Head of Live Programme: ‘It felt really important, the agility and flexibility to mould how we programme with \[Oreet\] based on where her ideas are taking her, and that’s… an approach we’d like to continue.’ **\(E12\)** Curator 2 continues: ‘The curatorial team had concerns about the fact that Jo Spence publicly refused chemotherapy… which confronts Wellcome Trust science. Oreet’s intergenerational response allowed a framework through which to present a variety of points of view. *’* **\(E5\)** 

 Due to Ashery’s sustained artistic engagement with questions around illness and health, death and life, and because of her dialogue about self\-care –both private and public– *Misbehaving Bodies* spurred the Wellcome to think about health diversity in new ways. Senior staff charged with shaping the direction of the Trust’s public programme noted *Misbehaving Bodies’*s profound impact on their thinking about health. Curator 1: ‘\[Oreet’s\] work feeds into a pressing conversation about who the institution is for, who it represents… intellectually who we are’. **\(E4\)** Curator 2: ‘The concept of diversity in art institutions is normally thought about in terms of gender, race and access, but not health diversity. Our internal curatorial conversations about Oreet’s show have influenced the direction we are marching towards’. **\(E5\)** The Head of Live Programme asserted, ‘\[ *Misbehaving Bodies*\] has taken that ambition for us to think about lived experience… \[and to\] move away from an overtly medicalised understanding of health to a social model of health… \[It\] was a huge building block in how we newly position ourselves, in terms of how we talk about healthcare, how we talk about health diversity, how we talk about individuals within healthcare systems and what we understand by “health”’. **\(E12\)** 

 **Fostered a new understanding and approach for the Wellcome Collection, as a public organisation, to support its own staff** 

 Because *Misbehaving Bodies* addressed sensitivities around health, illness and care, emphasising lived experiences, the Wellcome implemented innovative methods for caring for staff. Curator 2 noted: ‘Being in conversation with Oreet and her work taught me a lot about the responsibilities we have as a public organisation to look after people’.  Curator 1: ‘A budget was allocated for a programme of wellbeing during the project. . . Early on during my involvement we invited the cancer charity Maggie’s to act as consultants on the project . . . Maggie’s undertook a series of workshops with Wellcome Collection staff and became sounding boards throughout the project... a clinical psychologist from the Oncology Care Team at UCLH, was brought in to lead a wellbeing workshop for staff and various stakeholders. \[She\] talked about her experience of working with people recently diagnosed with cancer who were undergoing treatment and proposed a series of self\-care techniques’. **\(E2\)** 

 The Exhibitions Project Manager and Freelance Consultant commented: ‘\[We\] wanted to prepare our visitor experience team to feel as though they could cope with any difficult conversations that might come up… The need for support has \[since\] been really high on our exhibitions team agenda’. **\(E13\)** The VEA team was prepared with conversations about how to cope with the emotional impact of the exhibition on visitors. They received formal training from the Samaritans emphasising listening skills. Curator 1 attests that ‘there was feedback from colleagues that \[these sessions\] were valuable in creating an environment in the institution and a space outside of the delivery schedule for discussion and to air concerns. This often invisible work – caring for stakeholders and colleagues – needs capacity, time and money. Co\-curating this exhibition has highlighted the need for these processes to be embedded at the outset on all projects at all institutions. . . the support opened up a safe space for people to talk on the subject’. **\(E2\).** The VEA team was also given opportunities to reflect, in informal ‘tea and biscuits’ group sessions inspired by Ashery’s social practice, on their experiences with the work, in order to emotionally digest what they had found difficult. **\(E6\)**
