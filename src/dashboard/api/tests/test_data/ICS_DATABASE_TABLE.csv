###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peter Frankopan’s best\-selling *Silk Roads* has captured imaginations and changed ways of thinking around the world. Its extraordinary success has contributed to rectifying a eurocentric imbalance in our understanding of global history, at a time when the Chinese government has sought to create economic and cultural links across the central Asian region through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Drawing on primary evidence including numismatics, sigillography, material culture, art, and newly available scientific data, Frankopan’s historical research has provided the framework for policy development in response to this dramatic initiative. Drawing on *Silk Roads* and related work, he has advised high\-level policy makers in many countries. In addition to the UK, Ireland, Austria and the EU, he has addressed government officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Through his collaboration with museums, television and radio, Frankopan’s research has also increased public understanding of central Asia among Western publics who have had little exposure to the history and culture of this strategically important region.

 Frankopan’s book *The Silk Roads: A New History of the World* \(2015\) **\[R1\]** provides a major re\-assessment of world history from antiquity to the modern day by demonstrating the importance of cultural and economic links through central Asia in global history. His research on the history of the Byzantine empire, the Crusades and the broader central Asian region has highlighted the importance of cultural, medical, economic and human connections across the ancient and early modern world. It draws on a rich series of sources in Greek, Latin, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac and Chinese. 

 *The Silk Roads* was widely and prominently reviewed in the press around the world and has since been translated into more than thirty languages. It was described as ‘magnificent’ \( *Sunday Times*\), ‘dazzling’ \( *Guardian*\), ‘a rare book that makes you question your assumptions about the world’ \( *Wall St Journal*\), ‘a treasure’ \( *Libre Belgique*\), ‘phenomenal’ \( *Die Welt*\), ‘a joy’ \( *Le Point*\) and ‘not just the most important history book in years, but the most important in decades’ \( *Berliner Zeitung*\). It featured in Books of the Year of almost every newspaper, magazine and journal in 2015. In 2018, it was named as one of the 25 most important books translated into Chinese over the last 40 years, along with *The Great Gatsby* and *Pride and Prejudice*. At the end of 2019, it was named one of the *Sunday Times*’ ‘Books of the Decade’ \(2010\-20\). It was a *New York Times* Bestseller, and topped the Non\-Fiction charts in a number of countries, including India, the UAE and China. In 2018 it was also adapted for children as an illustrated edition by Bloomsbury Children’s Books for ages 9 and over. **\[R2\]** 

 Since the publication of *The Silk Roads*, Frankopan has expanded his research to explore connections between the historical development of this region and current geopolitical, cultural and economic challenges, especially China’s Belt and Road Initiative to invest approximately USD 1 trillion in connectivity between Asia, Africa and Europe. **\[R3, R4\]** The BRI was launched by the Chinese government in 2013 and comprises a Silk Road Economic Belt – a trans\-continental passage that links China with south east Asia, south Asia, Central Asia, Russia \(https://www.ebrd.com/russia.html\) and Europe by land – and a 21st century Maritime Silk Road *,* a sea route connecting China’s coastal regions with south east and south Asia, the South Pacific, the Middle East and Eastern Africa, all the way to Europe. This major global initiative is explicitly grounded in an understanding of China’s historic links to its neighbouring regions. **\[R3, R4\]**

 **\(i\) Public Policy Impact** 

 Frankopan’s research has fed into the development of foreign policy and development policy in many different forums. Drawing on his research, he helped shape policy for the **Asian Development Bank** \(ADB\) concerning global change in the 21<sup>st</sup> century when he took part in a forum at the ADB’s Annual Meeting in Manila in May 2018. One of the aims of the forum was 'delve into the past using an unconventional lens to frame one of the biggest global economic shifts’, namely 'Asia’s re\-emergence as a global economic powerhouse’. **\[E1\]** Frankopan’s input into the ADB’s developing policy in Asia was recognised in invitations to their annual meetings in both 2019 and 2020. On the last occasion he wrote and circulated a policy paper on ‘Regional Co\-operation in the Time of CoVid\-19: Lessons Learned and the Way Forward.’ He then chaired a flagship meeting of ministers and senior government officials from the 11 countries involved \( **China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia**\) on the subject of enhancing regional co\-operation. The Regional Cooperation Specialist of the ADB describes the CAREC programme as ‘one of the \[bank’s\] most important initiatives’ and has stated that Frankopan’s policy paper 'provided an excellent overview of the challenges and opportunities currently faced by the member states, especially as we enter a post\-pandemic world’. **\[E2\]** 

 In 2017\-18, Frankopan was also appointed a lead expert to the **World Bank** project on transportation networks in South Asia. His research highlighted the importance of considering the history of these networks, their current development and their future impact, with the aim of advising governments, government agencies, non\-government organisations, multi\-lateral bodies and other stakeholders on developing policies. He was part of the Core Team from the UK Department for International Development \(DfID\) for the project. **\[E3.1\]** The report \(c.260 pages\) was published in August 2018, and has been downloaded over 43,000 times by users in over 100 countries. **\[E3.2\]** Frankopan has also provided advice to the UN’s **Industrial Development Organization** \(UNIDO\) about the future of cities in Asia. **\[E4\]** 

 Based on his historical research, Frankopan advised **UNESCO** on their Silk Roads Programme, which seeks to help preserve the cultural and human heritage of countries spanning the region between the Mediterranean and the Pacific. \[Text removed for publication\] He was subsequently appointed a member of the Scientific Panel of the UNESCO Silk Roads Youth Research Grant programme and is now Vice\-Chair of this group. **\[E5.3\]** 

 The high profile of Frankopan’s research means that his advice has also been sought by European governments. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 Since 2019, Frankopan has been asked to provide advice on political, economic, military and technological policy by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence, the Royal Navy and the Office of the Prime Minister.

 **\(ii\) Transforming Public Understanding** 

 Following the success of *The Silk Roads* **\[R1\]**, Frankopan acted as adviser for Joanna Lumley’s 4\-part ITV series *Silk Roads Adventure*, a major documentary series that was aired in 2018. The four episodes averaged 3,700,000 viewers each **\[E11.1\]** and it remains available on Amazon Prime Video. Frankopan appears in the credits, and Lumley confirms reading *Silk Roads* as part of her research in *The Times.* **\[E11.2\]** Feedback \(Amazon\) included ‘I had never realised how diverse the culture, history and lifestyle was of the communities inhabiting the remote regions.’ **\[E11.3\]** 

 In 2018, Frankopan led a ‘Silk Roads Study Day’ at the **British Museum**, helping to devise a programme that was aimed at non\-specialists and specialists alike. The Head of Adult Programmes at the Museum reported ‘overwhelmingly positive responses’ from those who attended, remarking that ‘hosting a study day with such a prominent expert was enormously helpful for the Museum and for the curators in enabling them to showcase the objects and their own research to a wider audience’. **\[E12\]** In November 2018, he formally opened an exhibition on No Man’s Land at the British Museum which was centred on the history of Mesopotamia from the kingdom of Lagash \(3000 BC\) to the Sykes\-Picot agreement \(1916\). 

 Frankopan’s achievement in rebalancing public understanding of global history has been recognised in many other ways. Since 2018, Frankopan has also had a regular column in the *Evening Standard*, where he uses his research to comment on historical and current events. Between 2017 and 2019, he hosted an audio channel on British Airways In\-Flight Entertainment system, featuring selections of World Music, chosen from countries of the Silk Roads to promote cultural exchange based on his historical understanding of the region. The popular resonance of Frankopan’s work is illustrated by references to the *Silk Roads* in Philip Pullman’s *Belle Sauvage* \(2017\) and his *Secret Commonwealth* \(2019\) and the fact that it inspired the character Astrid in the HBO TV series *Vikings*, watched by millions in the United States and Canada.  The creator of the series explained, ‘I’ve read this great book, called “The Silk Road,” which was showing that in the Dark Ages, it might have been the Dark Ages to the western culture, but to the east, there was trade, cultural exchange.’ **\[E13\]** Pullman has stated that ‘Peter Frankopan’s study of the Silk Roads and their influence on world history had a great impact on me. It clarified and illuminated something that had previously seemed to me part of a background, and revealed its immense importance.’ **\[E14\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lancaster research has played a crucial role in building resilience to extreme flood events, the second largest natural hazard in the UK Government’s National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies is flooding \(after pandemics\). The research of Professor Tawn and his team on extreme value methods has produced a step\-change in the quantification of spatial and multi\-hazards for inland and coastal flood events, and is fundamental to: 

 Government planning: 

-  The **first assessment of the probability of a flood occurring somewhere in the country** in a year for the **UK Government’s 2016 National Flood Resilience Review**. 

-  Developing the widespread flooding scenarios for the **UK’s National Risk Assessment** related to river, coastal and estuarine flooding, with the **improved understanding being estimated to have led to GBP40million of savings** over the 2016 and 2020 flood events. 

 Improved Risk Estimation: 

-  Maximising the efficiency of **all** **new UK coastal flood defences**, with respect to both still water levels and their combined effect with waves **, leading to estimated savings of GBP75million on coastal defences and over GBP1billion for defences at nuclear sites**. 

-  Providing major international reinsurance companies \(including UK and French state backed companies Flood Re and CCR respectively\) with simulated extreme event sets to assess the probability of catastrophic flood losses, for business planning and regulatory requirements. 

-  Publicly available software used by over 100 companies for flood risk assessment.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Overview of Research Area:** Estimating the frequency of events that are more extreme than any previous observation is a key element in environmental risk assessment and prevention. Extreme value theory provides mathematically justified models as the basis for extrapolations from observed large events out to more extreme events. Extreme value theory and its methods and applications, particularly in relation to environmental problems, has been a core research area at Lancaster for over 25 years. Professor Tawn lead on the underpinning research, and Prof Phil Jonathan, Dr Emma Eastoe and Dr Jennifer Wadsworth are also key members of the Extreme Value Statistics group. Co\-authors for the cited papers, below, were predominantly at Lancaster as PhDs or PDRAs when the work was undertaken. This work contributed to Professor Tawn being the inaugural winner of the RSS Barnett Award 2015 for outstanding contributions to environmental statistics. 

 The underpinning research falls into two district sub\-areas of extreme value theory, each of which addresses challenges faced in the statistical analysis of environmental extremes. These are **Conditional Multivariate and Spatial Extremes** and **Extremes for sea\-levels,** with the underpinning research including a landmark paper \[3.1\] in the prestigious RSS discussion paper series in JRSSB as well as papers in Spatial Statistics and Environmetrics. 

 **Conditional Multivariate and Spatial Extremes:** Multivariate extremes involve the joint analysis of multiple hazards, such as sea and river levels in an estuary. Such hazards can cause different levels of failure to infrastructure dependent on which extreme combinations of hazard level occur simultaneously, and thus having estimates of the probabilities of these different occurrences is vital. Here the development of flexible asymptotically justified dependence models and the associated inference methods for the tail region of the joint distribution are of fundamental importance. In many cases these same methods can also be applied for spatial modelling of a single hazard at multiple locations, for example river levels on a network of rivers or sea\-levels along a coastline. 

 Prior to Lancaster’s research, multivariate extreme value methods were restricted to low dimensional cases and relied on the very strong and restrictive underlying asymptotic assumption of multivariate regular variation. Though convenient mathematically, this assumption was rarely found to be consistent with properties of environmental data and, if used, would typically result in an overestimation of the risk, resulting in an over\-conservative design. Research in 2004 by Heffernan and Tawn \[3.1\] addressed the problem through an entirely novel limit theory, conditioning on a component of the vector variable being extreme. This limit result and associated models have produced a step\-change in the methodology for multivariate extremes enabling substantive application for high dimensional analyses and a broad range of dependence structures. It has been applied widely in environmental and financial contexts, with over 500 citations. The model in \[3.1\] has been extended and tailored for application to river flooding \[3.2\], solving problems of large \(>1000\) dimensionality, and simulation of extreme event sets. The first formulation of this model into a fully spatial context, particularly important for environmental applications, was developed \[3.3\]. Important risk measures were derived \[3.4\] and subsequently extended \[3.5\] to address multi\-hazard problems in fully integrated risk assessments. 

 **Extremes for sea\-levels:** For coastal flood defences the key design parameter is still water level, the sum of two components: tide \(deterministic\) and surge \(stochastic\). Standard extreme value methods cannot be applied directly to extreme still water levels due to the substantial variations due to the tide. Research at Lancaster in the 1990s gave the first systematic estimates of extreme still water levels for the entire UK coastline that had no bias and improved confidence interval accuracy over previous methods. In 2013 Tawn provided the statistical expertise in more advanced methods that enabled updated estimates using the extra data \[3.6\]. This was achieved by modelling a feature known as skew surge that, due to physical considerations, removes the need to model the tide\-surge interaction giving a stronger justification for extrapolation. 

 **Partnership with JBA:** JBA, an employee\-owned firm based in the UK and operational on five continents, is an engineering and environmental risk management business specialising in flooding. Since the late 1990s, JBA has been a framework consultant for the Environment Agency \(EA\), the official risk management authority in England. The firm also supplies flood data to the insurance industry in the UK and globally. The partnership includes JBA’s Chief Scientist Professor Rob Lamb \(20% FTE at Lancaster since 2015 as professor in practice and an honorary appointment from 2013\), a number of JBA’s staff participating in Lancaster’s Extreme Value Statistics reading group, 3 funded and co\-supervised PhD students, 3 ex\-Lancaster PhD students appointed by JBA and a joint KTP project. 

 Key to this impact case study is that the Lancaster Extreme Value Statistics group works closely with JBA’s hydrologists, oceanographers and environmental modellers to ensure that research developments address key industry problems, incorporate known science, and that their associated solutions can be implemented. The 12 year\-long strategic research partnership between Lancaster University and JBA provides direct pathways into impacts through influence on Government policy and delivery of flood risk management actions, such as programmes funded by the EA and risk assessments for re/insurers.

#  Overview 

 Historically, flood mitigation has been reactive, but each major flood event is different, as shown by \[3.5\], and this makes preparation and planning a challenge. Government needs to understand the likelihood of widespread flooding so that it can plan the emergency responses that protect people and infrastructure when floods occur. Public and private infrastructure owners need to know about the probability of extreme flood events so they can make optimal investment decisions to ensure their assets are resilient. Insurers and reinsurers need to assess the probability of large\-scale catastrophic financial losses across their portfolios so they can determine premiums and comply with regulatory requirements under the Solvency II directive in the UK and Europe. Lancaster’s research in extreme value methods has been instrumental in developments by JBA and HR Wallingford, the UK’s two leading engineering and environmental risk management businesses specialising in flood management. Our close partnership with JBA provides a pathway into impact, with our underpinning research and collaborative work with JBA directly influencing HR Wallingford’s methodology for coastal flooding. Evidence for this comes through detailed letters of support from JBA’s Executive Chair, who states that “ *Our work … has confirmed that the Heffernan and Tawn \(2004\) methodology is also the most suitable statistical approach to model the joint probability of inter\-related flood hazards*” \[5.1\], and from HR Wallingford’s Chief Technical Director, who reports that the “ *Heffernan and Tawn \(2004\) paper …has produced a step change in our ability to quantify extremes relating to flooding and the design of flood defence infrastructure.”* \[5.2\] 

 Through JBA and HR Wallingford, our research has influenced the UK Government to produce step changes in flood resilience through improved planning and flood risk estimation. Over the census period it has had **substantial impact on GBP2.6billion** **spent** on flood risk **to** better protect **300,000 homes** and to **reduce the annual flooding damages of around GBP 1.6 billion** \[5.9\]. In 2020 the UK Government committed to spend GBP5.2billion on flood risk over the period 2021\-7. The **industry standard for sea walls heights in all new UK coastal flood designs over the period 2014\-20 use our statistical methods** \[5.3\]; and estimated savings to the UK Government over the census period include **GBP8million in consultancy fees** \[5.3\]; **GBP40million on the UK wide flood events since 2016** \[5.2\], and **over GBP1billion due to improved designs \[5.2\] **.** Our methods are now routinely used for all England’s multivariate and spatial flood risk evaluations with work commissioned at JBA and HR Wallingford through the EA \[5.1, 5.2 and 5.3\]. They are also **used worldwide for reinsurance** \[5.1\], via JBA providing software products, with key users including UK and French state backed companies Flood Re and CCR respectively. They have also been of vital importance in forming the UK Government’s strategy and understanding via **the National Flood Resilience Review and The National Risk Assessment/Risk Register of Civil Emergencies** \[5.4 and 5.6\]. Our impact is developed through four pathways below, which reflect the multiple needs of flood management set out above. All share a common requirement for multivariate statistical analysis of flooding that is theoretically rigorous, enabling extrapolation to events more extreme than previously experienced, and that can capture the complex nature of both localised and widespread flooding. 

#  4.1 Government Planning: 

##  Input into UK Government National Flood Resilience Review \(NFRR\) 2016 

 The NFRR was set up by HM Government in 2016 after “ *extreme flood events across wide areas of the country … to assess how the country can be better protected from future flooding*” \[5.4, Ministerial Foreword, p. 1\]. It was chaired by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster \(then the Rt Hon Oliver Letwin\) and included representatives from The Prime Minister’s Office, Cabinet Office and the Treasury. The Executive Summary \[5.4, p.3, 4th para\] said that the first task in the Review was to “ *improve our understanding of … flood risk in England*”, going on to state “ *we have become clear that describing flood risk in traditional terms such as … ‘1 in a 100\-year risk’ is not helpful because … they describe the risk at one location. They do not describe the chance of one of these events happening somewhere in the … country in a given year – which is much greater”.* 

 This improved understanding of risk was entirely informed by the statistical research of Tawn, \[3.1\] and his translatory work with Lamb at JBA \[3.2\-3.5\]. The NFRR \[5.4, p. 12\] cited this analysis as “ *a method developed at Lancaster University and JBA*” showing that “ *while the probability of an extreme river flow that could result in a severe flood at any given location is very small, such flows are not unusual when considering the whole country*”. The work produced for NFRR, reported in \[3.5\] and based on the fundamental results of \[3.1\], shows the estimated probability of getting a marginal 1 in 100\-year flood at some flow gauge in England and Wales in a 1\-year period is as high as 0.88, and it also gives a range of other regional flooding probabilities. This “ *evidence and analysis which informs policy*” and that “ *stands up to challenges of credibility, reliability and objectivity*”, was scrutinised by a “ *Scientific Advisory Group*” \[5.4, p.11\]. The Group was chaired by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government and Head of the Government Office for Science, Sir Mark Walport, and included the Chair of the Defra Science Advisory Council, the Environment Agency \(EA\) Chief Executive as well as Tawn and Lamb. Sir Mark Walport’s personal letter to Tawn thanked him and stated that “ *Communities at risk of flooding were looking for a decisive government response to the severe and high\-profile flooding events, particularly of last December. There was pressure on Government to better understand the risks involved…  **Your contribution to the review was very important.** Ministers were determined to base the review’s conclusions and recommendations on sound evidence and analysis, and our assurance of the quality of science was seen as central. … Our advice had significant influence on both the evidence and the way in which it was communicated. Importantly, you were able to highlight key uncertainties and limitations.*” \[5.5\] 

##  Input into UK Government National Risk Assessment \(NRA\) 2017 

 UK Government makes a biennial national assessment of possible civil emergencies \(such as extreme weather, accidents or disease\). This classified National Risk Assessment, and its public face the National Risk Register \[5.6\], hinges on scenarios that would stretch the emergency services’ capacity to respond, and yet represent plausible, extreme events that could occur over the next five years within specified probability ranges. Statistical models \[3.1, 3.2\] ensured that the proposed scenarios were consistent with observed patterns of extreme events and based on a theoretically sound approach to extrapolate beyond the historical data. **They enabled the probability of widespread flood and coastal extremes to be quantified rigorously, forming the basis for three national scenarios: flooding from rivers, flooding from surface drainage and flooding from the sea** \[5.1, 5.2\]. The research by JBA and Tawn underpinning the NRA scenarios was published in an EA report \[5.7\], with the EA’s web page stating it “ *developed methods and guidance to address the need for realistic planning scenarios that account for the risk of widespread flooding across England and Wales, flooding from multiple sources \(river, surface water\) and the potential impacts.”* HR Wallingford’s associated research, reported in the appendix of \[5.2\], builds upon \[3.1\] and resulted in an improved spatial understanding of flooding which has led to GBP40million of savings over the UK wide 2016 and 2020 flood events \[5.2\]. This work was recognised by the Institution of Civil Engineers, with the award of the 2018 Bill Curtin Medal for Research and Innovation. 

#  4.2 Improved Risk Evaluation 

##  Maximising the efficiency of all UK coastal flood defences 

 Flood defences are the key element of coastal flood management, with their primary design feature being the sea\-wall height. Statistical methods for estimating the sea\-wall height to give the intended level of protection are required, with the estimated height typically larger than any event already observed. Both still water level extremes and overtopping from waves need to be accounted for, so the relevant underpinning research \[3.6\] and \[3.1\] respectively are key. Use of theoretically valid models with optimal inference methods are critical for efficient inference: major economic and societal benefits arise from optimising sea wall height, and the large budgets involved result in considerable implications for inefficient estimation of this wall height. The EA’s Modelling and Forecasting Scientist, points out that: *“… the cost* *sensitivity to over\-design by 1m would therefore be around GBP1.65billion. Under\-design, on the other hand, would result in an increased risk from flooding … over GBP1billion per annum\)”* \[5.3\]. HM Government’s 2018 report on environmental coastal flood boundary conditions for the UK gives a sense of importance of the statistical analysis estimates for still water levels: with new data updates and with method improvement these can differ from earlier values by 20\-30cm \[5.8\]. 

 The EA specified that the industry standard for sea walls heights in all new UK coastal flood designs over the period 2014\-20 were to be the values estimated using the statistical methods developed by Tawn \[5.3\]. HR Wallingford estimate that these methods have led to **over GBP75million of savings for the UK Government and over GBP1billion for the nuclear industry since** \[5.2\]. The EA indicates that these estimates have also saved the UK Government GBP8million from consultant fees since 2014 \(GBP20,000 per scheme for 60 schemes per year\) \[5.3\]. 

 The evolution of statistical methods for these new design levels has been in two stages. First, Tawn provided the sole statistical expertise in a multi\-disciplinary consortium with JBA, the National Oceanography Centre \(NOC\) and Dutch engineering consultancy Royal Haskoning using the novel modelling framework based on skew surges extremes \[3.6,5.3\], with these estimates forming the industry standard from 2014 to 2018. Second, Tawn developed a number of major inferential improvements to this skew surge model \[5.8\] \(reported in \[5.3\]\). The resulting updated estimates have become the new industry standard from 2018. The EA identify this work as “ *internationally pioneering and there has been much interest from other nations in using the codes and science development*”, also noting that with “ *the codes freely available internationally*” this enables broader impact beyond the UK \[5.3\]. 

##  Catastrophic flood insurance losses 

 JBA has developed simulations of extreme flood events globally using extensions of \[3.1\-3.4\] for use by insurers and reinsurers within ‘catastrophe models.’ As reported by the Executive Chair of JBA, these products support industry “ *needs for portfolio risk analysis to meet business planning and regulatory compliance requirements*.” The products have been “ *licensed by more than 30 major re/insurance clients* *internationally. Our data are available in all territories around the world* *through the Oasis Loss Modelling Framework, an open catastrophe modelling platform that brings our data to a community of over 100 partners. Users of our event set data include the UK’s Government\-backed flood reinsurance company, Flood Re, and the French state\-owned reinsurance company, CCR.*” \[5.1\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 183 states around the world are partners to the international treaty prohibiting biological weapons: the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention \(BWC\). Yet, while the treaty signals the will and ambition of the international community, the BWC has always lacked the legal means to ensure states comply with their obligations. Sociologically\-informed research into compliance assessment from King’s College London’s Department of Global Health and Social Medicine has raised awareness and expanded understanding of biosecurity governance and BWC compliance. The research has analysed, advocated and demonstrated new measures states can pursue to enhance transparency and build confidence in the intentions behind biological research and development activities with significant potential to be repurposed to cause harm. Shaping debate at the highest levels across governments and international organisations, the research has contributed to identify concrete ways BWC members can develop new practices to improve transparency, and to engage in confidence\-building that strengthens global efforts to uphold the norm against biological weaponry. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention \(BWC\) unequivocally prohibits the development of biological agents \- whether naturally occurring, genetically modified, or chemically synthesized \- for the purpose of deliberately causing harm. Yet, the BWC permits almost any kind of activities for peaceful or defensive purposes. Article I of the BWC \- through which states ‘agree to never under any circumstances acquire or retain biological weapons’ \- is therefore vague in demarcating the borders of prohibited and legitimate activities. Article I merely refers to biological agents ‘of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes’. An essential part in judging states’ compliance with the BWC is therefore analysis of justifications provided for biological research and development \(R&D\) activities with significant potential to be repurposed to cause harm. 

 Unlike other post\-Second World War weapons treaty regimes, the BWC does not have formal verification mechanisms to ensure compliance. Concerns about biological weapons have therefore endured and are now escalating. Accelerating advances in abilities to manipulate genes, biological systems and delivery systems mean it is now easier than ever to obtain disease\-causing agents in the course of medical and biological research, but also easier to repurpose them for deliberate harm, and barriers to acquiring and using biological weapons have been significantly reduced in recent years. BWC compliance assessment has therefore taken on a new level of urgency. 

 A body of research undertaken by Dr Filippa Lentzos and colleagues at King’s College London has focused on the complex relationship between transparency, evidence\-based judgments and trust in biodefence programmes, where the potential for repurposing R&D is often considered greatest. Engaging with a complex chain of stakeholders, from individual research laboratories, the life sciences and biotech industries, national scientific academies, international organisations, state governments and multinational conventions, this theoretically\-driven, empirically\-informed research has drawn on a range of methods, including participant observation, interviews and documentary analysis. The research has won support of competitive peer\-review funding \[7\] and commissions from governmental agencies \[8,9\], and has yielded advances relating to: 

 Qualitative approaches to compliance assessment 

 ESRC\-funded \[7\] research explored the evolving landscape of biological R&D in relation to compliance assessment, and found that quantitative, Cold War\-era tools of compliance assessment were becoming increasingly outdated and irrelevant to understanding bioscience developments on the ground. To establish the intent of contemporary biological R&D—in academic, private, commercial and defence settings—the research showed that material accountancy\-type verification methodologies were no longer enough. You could not simply count fermenters, measure the sizes of autoclaves, and limit amounts of growth media. Complicating matters was the increasing diffusion of relevant materials, equipment and technical know\-how across multiple and varied scientific disciplines and sectors, as well as an increased concentration of R&D in private, rather than public, hands. The research found that compliance assessment in the biological field was becoming more complex, that there was a need for ‘multi\-level stakeholdership’ in compliance assessment, and that traditional tools needed to be supplemented by a more qualitative approach to enable states to more effectively demonstrate transparency and build trust \[1,2\]. 

 **Sociologically\-informed governance of biological R&D** 

 The ESRC\-funded research also drew attention to the social context of biological threats, emphasising how they are constructed in particular settings, by particular groups of individuals and institutions, using particular pieces of evidence \[3,4\]. In drawing attention to the sociology of biological threats and international efforts to counter them, the research demonstrated that an expanded ‘toolbox’ of measures are needed to manage the potential for certain biological R&D to be repurposed to cause harm. 

 The research promoted the concept of ‘trimodal regulation’ \[5\]. This innovative, sociologically\-informed model of regulation builds on three modes of regulation: i\) *coercive regulation*, based on the authority of states, and including penalties for non\-compliance, statutory regulations and reporting requirements, mandatory licensing, certification and registration; ii\) *normative regulation* based on mores and customs, and including codes of practice, guidelines and transparency measures; and iii\) *mimetic regulation*, based on the emulation of successful examples and models of behaviour, national and international standards, education and awareness\-raising. The research argued that the three modes must all be harnessed to effectively identify, influence and inhibit those who seek to misuse biological R&D. 

 These findings led to further research, commissioned by the former UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office \(FCO\), which sought to expand understandings of what builds confidence in compliance with the BWC. It found that confidence\-building measures must be expanded beyond ‘hard law’ to also include ‘soft law’ and ‘informal measures’ as complimentary means of managing biosecurity risks. The approach emphasised interaction and flexibility, expert\-level exchanges of best practices and a broad conception of ‘relevant’ laboratories and facilities \[1\]. 

 **Informal measures to manage biosecurity risks** 

 Research funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs further explored the role of soft law and informal regulatory measures, such as guidelines, codes of conduct, peer review, professional norms and regular interactions, as part of an incremental and inclusive approach to compliance assessment. The research showed that the knowledge, experience and expertise of civil society can contribute to enhancing transparency between BWC member states in several ways \[6\], including through assisting states to collect and collate information on confidence\-building measures, monitoring states’ biodefence activities, collecting open source data, processing data provided by states to generate more accessible information, and bringing the information into the public sphere.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The community involved in ensuring that the BWC is upheld is made up of stakeholders across governments, civil society, national and international scientific and medical associations, the private sector, and academia. All stakeholders are involved in BWC meetings. These include annual meetings of experts \(MXs\), which feed into annual meetings of states parties \(MSPs\), and five\-yearly treaty review conferences—all held at the United Nations \(UN\) in Geneva. 

 Civil society has long played an important role in the BWC community, promoting new and innovative approaches, holding governments to account and acting as the ‘collective memory’ as governmental representatives come and go. Civil society members have also facilitated contacts between the state\-driven BWC process and other stakeholders such as the scientific community and private industry. Without this important facilitative role, the BWC would not have the necessary level of engagement with such stakeholders at the international and national levels. As described by the UK’s former Disarmament Ambassador in Geneva: “as a long standing, expert member of civil society, of which Dr Lentzos is a prime example… \[she is\] well respected by both the expert and diplomatic communities, having an ability to ‘translate’ between the two” \[A\]. 

 Dr Lentzos’ unique position and body of research has seen her be invited to provide a series of technical background reports commissioned by, among others, the World Health Organization \(2020\), the UN Institute for Disarmament Research \(2019\), the German Federal Foreign Office \(2019\), and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics \(2015\) \[B\]. Her research and expertise have also led to Dr Lentzos being invited to give several high\-profile briefings, including: the WHO strategic & technical advisory group for infectious hazards \(2019\), the Australia Group on export controls \(2019\), the UN Conference of Disarmament \(2018\), the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs \(2018\), the European Commission \(2018\), the UN Secretary\-General’s Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters \(2017\), the UK Cabinet Office \(2017\), the UK Ministry of Defence \(2017\), and the Royal Society \(2016\). 

 By providing a robust evidence base for multilateral international policy discussions, Dr Lentzos’ key position and trusted research has helped shape the agenda of high\-level international discussions, ensuring that formal processes and practices around BWC compliance assessment focus on qualitative approaches, different modes of regulation and multi\-level stakeholdership as ways to increase transparency and trust. 

 **Shaping multilateral policy debates to strengthen the BWC** 

 Dr Lentzos’ sociologically\-informed research has become integral to shaping many BWC conversations. For example, after introducing the concept of ‘trimodal regulation’ \[5\] at an informal side event to the 2013 BWC meeting of experts, Germany said in a statement to the MX meeting that *“Monday’s side event organised by King’s College London…highlighted in particular the need to take into account the diverse group of stakeholders and to also take into consideration approaches other than the traditional top\-down approaches”* \[C1\]. Another statement, from Switzerland, said “King’s College’s policy brief on compliance contains very valuable ideas and recommendations that should be taken forward” \[C2\]. Australia’s presentation to the meeting included a slide elaborating ‘trimodal’ regulation \[C3\]. Australia’s reference to King’s policy brief prompted a spontaneous and unprecedented invitation by the meeting chair to a non\-government organisation \(King’s College London\) to elaborate further on the concept in the formal session of the meeting. 

 After further advocating multi\-level stakeholdership, wherein BWC developments are shaped by multiple state and non\-state actors, Dr Lentzos was nominated as the BWC’s NGO Coordinator in 2017. In this capacity, she initiated and delivered the first ever joint NGO statement to the 2017 meeting of states parties \(with subsequent MX and MSP statements, and statements to the UN General Assembly First Committee in New York, in both 2018 and 2019\). It is widely acknowledged that civil society activities have sustained an influential informal discussion on key issues when politics have blocked a more formal discussion of those matters. As described by the Head of the BWC Implementation Support Unit in the UN’s Office for Disarmament Affairs, Dr Lentzos’ research has been present “at every MX and MSP in the last and the current intersessional process and \[she\] has coordinated and sometimes delivered statements on behalf of the civil society groups. These statements are closely read by States Parties and the ideas contained therein regularly find their way into the formal discourse at BWC meetings” \[D\]. 

 In 2014, commissioned by the former FCO, Dr Lentzos established a multi\-stakeholder forum in collaboration with Defence Science Technology Lab \(dstl\) Porton Down and the UK Mission to the UN in Geneva to focus on BWC compliance and confidence\-building measures. Enabling state representatives, international organisations and other experts to collectively and substantively engage in dialogue on key issues, the forum identified where points of contention and agreement were expected in advance of the BWC’s 2016 review conference. 

 Reflecting on her contributions to this process, the UK’s former Disarmament Ambassador described Dr Lentzos’ research on novel approaches to compliance assessment as making “significant contribution to maintaining a rounded discussion on a polarising issue amongst a broad range of countries, helping ensure that there was a more nuanced discussion on how to strengthen the implementation of the BWC through the 2016 Review Conference” which also “undoubtedly helped ensure the issue was firmly on the agenda for the agreed forward programme of work” \[A\]. In addition, Dr Lentzos’ research and engagement ensured that a range of stakeholders were well\-informed on crucial issues, so that “participating delegations, many with very limited domestic expertise, were better informed” \[A\] and thereby better able to contribute to review conference negotiations. 

 The former FCO invited Dr Lentzos to author a policy paper \[E\] elaborating her assessment of the multi\-stakeholder forum which was submitted by the UK to the 2014 BWC meeting of states parties. This directly informed the agenda of subsequent high\-level meetings designed to formally review and strengthen the operation of the BWC, and ensured that the voices of important actors were present in the wider political process. It has traditionally been unusual to have non\-governmental experts author BWC policy papers, but Dr Lentzos was further “trusted” \[D\] to author policy documents submitted by Germany to the 2016 review conference \[F\] and by Georgia to the 2018 meeting of states parties \[G\], both of which included verbal briefings to BWC delegations. 

 **Informing activities to demonstrate transparency and build trust** 

 In partnership with foreign government ministries, Dr Lentzos’ research on qualitative approaches to compliance assessment \[1,2,3,4\] has led to new activities to promote transparency and build trust. For example, in 2016, with the German Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defence, Dr Lentzos helped develop and action a first\-of\-its\-kind, two\-day international on\-site transparency visit for BWC states to the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology in Munich. Dr Lentzos acted as the sole civil society observer to the visit. The visit’s design reflected and implemented Dr Lentzos’ research recommendations \[1,2,5\] relating to direct multi\-stakeholder engagement to build trust, provide transparency and share best practices \[F\]. A follow\-on transparency visit to the high\-profile Lugar Centre of the National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health in Tbilisi, Georgia in 2018, incorporated additional civil society observers, and Dr Lentzos was invited to act as an active independent, non\-government expert. She represented the group to the media, being interviewed on both Georgian and Russian national television, and substantively contributed to the group’s assessments and final report, as well as producing an independent report \[G\]. 

 **Raising awareness amongst a wider audience** 

 Dr Lentzos’ work on the sociology of biological weaponry and its governance identified that engaging with wider audiences, including the lay public, is crucial to raise fact\-based awareness of biological weapons, and to establish broad levels of trust in the policies and practices governing biological R&D that could be repurposed to cause harm \[4,5\]. In addition, to sustain engagement with national and international media, Dr Lentzos provided conceptual, framing and background input into the 2016 BBC4 documentary ‘Inside Porton Down: Britain’s Secret Weapons Research Facility’. As reported by the BBC, the documentary had record viewing numbers: 1.2 million on first broadcast and an additional one million views on BBC iPlayer \[H\]. It has since been aired in several other countries, resulting in international newspaper and media coverage on the documentary and Dr Lentzos’ wider research. 

 In cooperation with the former FCO, Dr Lentzos convened a screening and panel discussion of the documentary at the UN for BWC delegates. The event provided an innovative and more public way to demonstrate transparency of a national biodefence programme than the formal mechanisms usually employed within the BWC. The UK’s Disarmament Ambassador at the time praised the screening as “a very practical way of demonstrating how transparency could build confidence” \[A\]. He also commented on an unintended benefit from the screening: “when Russia attempted to blame the 2018 Skripal poisonings conducted by Porton Down, states knew that the British Government was transparent about the institute’s work, making it easier to debunk the allegations” \[A\]. This demonstrates the valuable impact of Dr Lentzos’ work and activities: bringing “technical and complex issues to a wider audience” \[D\] and better informing a range of stakeholders about global efforts to uphold the norm against biological weaponry.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research has led to significant reductions in carbon emissions and energy costs via the Grid Edge spinout company. Grid Edge was established in 2016 to develop and commercialise cloud\-based artificial intelligence software tools that were developed from Aston research. Using data analysis\-driven notifications, the tools allow building operators to predict, optimise and control their buildings’ energy profiles, reducing carbon emissions and costs and improving user comfort. The technology has been deployed successfully in ten sites by energy suppliers, housing developers and shopping centres – leading to average annual savings of 10\-15% \(and as much as 30%\) in carbon emissions and costs. It also led to the creation of 15 full\-time and three part\-time jobs in Grid Edge. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Grid Edge’s tools and the machine learning control algorithms behind them were developed from a broad range of Aston research. The research focused on the integration of bioenergy and power storage technologies into grid connected and Localised Renewable Energy Systems \(LRES\). This research includes: 

-  The processing of biomass and waste derived feedstocks for fuel production and heat and power generation **\[R1,R2\]**. 

-  Development of business protocols for third party bi\-flow, and low carbon, district heating network \(DHN\) connections **\[R2,R4\]**. 

-  Advancement and demonstration of the potential of Vehicle to Grid \(V2G\) and battery storage infrastructure to support localised intelligent energy systems **\[R6\]**. 

-  Exploitation of high value demand response balancing markets **\[R3,R4,R5\]**. 

-  Development and demonstration of an intelligent control agent \(ICA\) that can process large amounts of current and predictive data to make autonomous, “intelligent” decisions around how optimally to operate a LRES **\[R3,R4,R5\]**. 

-  Demonstration of the first commercial interoperation of small\-scale bioenergy generation with a citywide heat network **\[R2,R4\]**. 

-  Demonstration of the increasingly important role of LRES in supporting the traditional energy system through demand\-side grid management **\[R3\]**. 

-  Integration of the project innovations into an intelligent control agent that can continuously maximise system efficiency, service and profit **\[R3,R5\]**. 

 Aston integrated these findings into a bioenergy demonstrator. This allowed the researchers to prove the feasibility of the technical and business aspects of the integrated control system and investigate the benefits of the interoperation of complimentary LRES technologies and the associated revenue streams. 

 The demonstrator incorporated multiple, integrated bioenergy technologies – pyrolysis, gasification and combustion – into a \~400kW dual\-fuel, tri\-generation system. This provides cooling, heat and power to a flexible, islanded micro\-grid which supplies power to three mixed\-use campus buildings. The dual\-fuel system can operate using locally\-sourced virgin and bio\-waste solid material as well as liquid recycled oil\-based biodiesel. The demonstrator provided a platform for a number of research studies on local energy usage and supply **\[R4,R5\]**. 

 The research demonstrated how complex energy systems could be intelligently optimised and controlled through innovative machine\-learning methods, leading to the creation of Grid Edge in 2016. Grid Edge’s core AI technology enables building operators to integrate predictive machine\-learning and data science analytics into an energy management strategy that is in harmony with any existing building management systems. It simplifies energy optimisation, harnessing the power of a building's energy and environmental data to create dynamic forecasts for the management of carbon emissions, cost and comfort. 

 The company also worked with Aston to develop and demonstrate a new communication and control platform for Vehicle\-to\-Grid/Building \(V2G/V2B\). This is an off\-vehicle system that controls how, when and at what rate electric vehicle batteries are charged and discharged, and is informed by local substation constraints and building energy requirements. The platform addresses the concerns of District Network Operators \(DNOs\), building managers and electric vehicle \(EV\) owners, leading to increased adoption of V2G and ultimately EVs. It also leads to reduced energy costs and helps enable the creation of low\-carbon networks with a secure electricity supply **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Climate change is a global crisis, and businesses will need to reduce carbon emissions and use energy more efficiently to prevent the global temperature rise exceeding 1.5°C. 

 Grid Edge’s tools enable customers to lower their buildings’ carbon emissions and energy costs by 10\-15% on average, with some registering reductions of over 30% **\[S1\]**. The technology has been deployed successfully in ten sites, demonstrating how a wide range of large energy consumers, such as airports, business districts and shopping centres, can benefit from the tools. 

 Developed from Aston’s research, Grid Edge’s predictive energy management tools use a broad range of data, including weather forecasts and expected occupancy, to enable customers to anticipate their buildings’ energy demands. They can then adapt their energy use – by shifting load, leveraging periods of high renewable power generation, and effectively using their buildings’ energy demand and generation flexibility like a giant battery – to reduce costs and carbon emissions, while optimising the comfort levels of those using the buildings. 

 The company was started by three Aston employees who initially worked for the company on a part\-time basis. Growing interest in the technology and the company’s expanding product portfolio has since driven the creation of 17 full\-time and five part\-time jobs **\[S1\]** to cover related data science and web development tasks. 

 Grid Edge attracted initial equity investment of £360,000. In 2019, it raised £2.5 million at a BP Ventures\-led Series A, pre\-money valuation funding round, reaching a post\-money valuation of £9.7 million **\[S1\]**. To date, the company has generated in excess of £200,000 in customer revenue **\[S1\]**, received a £500,000 loan from a Big Six energy company and has been granted around £1.3 million in R&D funding from various BEIS competitions **\[S1\]**. Family office investment house Goldacre joined BP as a co\-investor in the 2019 funding round, to enhance its smart real estate and future cities technology portfolio. This investment will enable Grid Edge to expand in the UK market, utilising existing partnerships in the real estate sector, and explore further opportunities in Europe **\[S3\]**. 

 Grid Edge has secured commercial contracts with several high\-profile customers, including Birmingham Airport, the Bullring \(Birmingham\) and Intu Trafford Centre \(Manchester\) shopping centres, housing developers BMO and Barkley Group, and Kent County Council. The technology has been deployed in nine sites, with Hammerson Group \(Bullring & Grand Central\) moving to a Software as a Service \(SaaS\) contract for multiple sites **\[S1\]**. 

 In an initial six\-week trial at the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, the technology led to a 140,000kWh reduction in the site’s energy consumption and a more than £23,000 saving in energy costs, leading to an anticipated annual carbon and energy cost saving of 10\-15%. The Bullring still uses the technology **\[S2, S3\]**. 

 Other customers have benefitted from similar savings. Total savings depend on the weather, customers’ energy profiles, building use and multiple other factors considered by the system’s prediction algorithms, as well as the decisions made by building managers based on the information provided by Grid Edge’s tools. But measurements show that energy cost savings and carbon emissions reductions are at least 10\-15%, with the potential to reach 30% or more for some. 

 Working with Kent County Council’s Energy and Estates team they integrated solar power generation data with the trial building energy profile and created a digital twin and predictive model. The system discovered the HVAC system was running sub\-optimally and there was inefficient out\-of\-hours consumption. A new HVAC strategy was deployed along with targeted energy strategies and energy demand management at peak solar levels, which all resulted in approximately 60% energy savings and an annualised cost saving of c.£30k. **\[S5\]** 

 BP states that Grid Edge’s tools are a key development for a low carbon future. Nacho Gimenez, Managing Director for BP Ventures **\[S4\]**, said: “Digital technologies are a critical component to drive the transition to a low\-carbon future. Using data, we can unlock the flexibility in\-built in existing energy systems. This is the most efficient way to reduce the carbon intensity and power consumption required to keep buildings comfortable. Grid Edge’s machine learning and data\-driven approach is what really sets them apart.” 

 Grid Edge is now further developing technologies through BEIS and client\-funded research projects. These include optimising algorithms to integrate Vehicle\-to\-Grid electric vehicle charging technologies and help balance loads, as well as creating tools to decarbonise low\-grade heat networks and manage loads according to energy prices. 

 Grid Edge has won multiple awards **\[**A1\-A10 in **S6**\] including: 2019 KPMG Best British Tech Start Up \(Midlands Winner, UK Finalist\) \[A9\]; 2019 RAC  [Cooling Industry Awards](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%253Ali%253Aactivity%253A6582968749559730176&keywords=%2523coolingindustryawards&originTrackingId=xOOvCz97%252FTqKKUCGOiLMdw%253D%253D) \(Best Innovation\) \[A8\]; 2016: Silicon Canal Tech Awards \(Best Start Up\) \[A3\]. This demonstrates the value to the end user communities of this technology.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Newcastle’s Arjuna transaction system software \(ATSS\) has contributed to international transaction processing standards and to the middleware products market through Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open source software products. Since REF 2014, ATSS \(also known by its new name *Narayana*\) has not only increased the scale of its impact but also increased the breadth by integration into a number of additional Red Hat middleware products. After IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat in 2019, a number of Red Hat products \(with Narayana\) are shipped in IBM’s Cloud Pak for Applications product, increasing the customer base. The impact presented above is on the growing global market for Application Infrastructure and Middleware \(AIM\) Software, estimated at US$30.6bn in 2020 and projected to reach US$45.7bn by 2027. \[ *redacted*\] 

 The underpinning research also continues to have an impact through economic benefit to the UK. Red Hat has continued to invest in its European Middleware HQ based in Newcastle. \[ *redacted*\]

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research on distributed transaction processing middleware carried out by Prof. Shrivastava \(Lecturer, Professor from 1978\-2011, emeritus from 2011\) and his research group led to the development of a toolkit for reliable distributed computing named *Arjuna*. A key design goal of Arjuna was to perform the integration of mechanisms – for locating and invoking operations upon local and remote objects, for concurrency control, for error detection and recovery from failures \- in a manner that makes them not only easy to use but also permits application\-specific enhancements. Arjuna supports a computation model in which applications manipulate objects under the control of *atomic* *transactions* \(also referred to as *atomic actions*\). A transaction is characterised by *ACID* \(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability\) properties. In an ACID transaction, either all of the work conducted within its scope is performed \(no failure case: transaction is said to be *committed*\) or no work is performed, meaning the effects of any partial work are undone \(failure case: transaction is *aborted*\). Typical failures causing a transaction to abort include computer crashes and network related failures causing continued loss of messages. 

 At the heart of the Arjuna system is an *AtomicAction* module \(a transaction manager\) that performs commit/abort of a transaction in a novel application specific manner. This novel structuring concept is highly relevant in an open setting where a transaction manager should be able to control arbitrary types of objects \(including legacy databases\) within a transaction. The group continued the research work on transaction services and middleware, and in collaboration with IBM developed the concept of the *Activity Service* \- a refinement of the AtomicAction module \- for *extended transactions* \(\[P1\], co\-authors Houston and Robinson are from IBM\). 

 It has long been realised that ACID transactions by themselves are not adequate for composing business activities \(that are long running applications\), as aborting a constituent transaction might not be practical or even possible. What is required is non\-ACID transaction model where constituent transactions can be selectively *committed,* *aborted* or *compensated*. Such a model is frequently referred to as an extended transaction or LRA \(long running activity\). The Activity Service is a framework for supporting any transaction model, whether ACID or non\-ACID. 

 Results from the above work were incorporated into a number of open industry standards in transaction processing \[P2\] and laid the foundation for transaction processing middleware products from Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open source software products. \[P2\]. Red Hat middleware with enhanced transaction support provided by Arjuna software proved a key enabler for its widespread adoption in the emerging world of cloud computing.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Arjuna transaction system software, ATSS \(also known by its new name *Narayana* \[E1\]\) plays a central role in enhancing Red Hat middleware products with transactional services \[E1, E2\]. 

 The Activity Service \[P1\], itself an Object Management Group \(OMG\) industry standard \(known as the Additional Structuring Mechanisms for the Object Transaction Service\) formed the basis of a number of ACID and non\-ACID extended transaction standards for Web services produced by OASIS, a global standards consortium \[P2\]. The structure of the AtomicAction module of ATSS/Narayana made it relatively straightforward to incorporate the features required by the Activity Service so that both ACID as well as non\-ACID extended transactions \(LRAs\) can be supported with equal ease \[P2\]. Thus, the ATSS/Narayana software was instrumental in the design of standards conformant Web\-service transaction protocols that are within Red Hat’s Java middleware platform product JBoss EAP \(Enterprise Application Platform\). 

 Since its inception, ATSS/Narayana has continued to be a central part of Red Hat's Middleware offering, providing the transactions engine for the hugely successful Java middleware platform product EAP. ATSS/Narayana has increased the scale of its impact, as EAP sales have continued to grow at around \[ *redacted*\] and increased the breadth of its impact by integration into a number of additional Red Hat middleware products, including Quarkus, Vert.x, Fuse, AMQ, BPM Suite, Thorntail and DataGrid \[E1, E2\]. 

 In July 2019, IBM closed its landmark acquisition of Red Hat for $34bn and Red Hat product sales are now growing faster, by leveraging the deep IBM customer base. Red Hat revenue increased 18% in the first quarter of 2020, sales increased by 50% over the previous year and Red Hat signed the largest deal in its history \[E3\]. Whilst Red Hat has never reported on individual products, it is internally recognised that the Red Hat Enterprise Linux product attracts around 50% of global revenue with Middleware sales accounting \[redacted\] Red Hat reported full fiscal year total revenue of $3.4bn in 2019 \[E4\] and as every EAP sale is a Narayana/ATSS sale, the additional scale of impact is visible. Integrated in EAP, ATSS/Narayana now supports global mission critical business applications attracting sales of \[ *redacted*\]. 

 The additional breadth of ATSS/Narayana impact can be seen through greater market share and a larger developer community for the Red Hat products in which it is integrated. Market share for EAP continues to soar. In 2017, Tomcat was the clear leader with 63.8% of the Application Server market with EAP/WildFly in second place at 13.8% \[E5\]. Red Hat leads the Tomcat project and ATSS/Narayana is also added to the Tomcat distribution. This has created a distribution channel for ATSS \[redacted\] The channel has widened further for ATSS/Narayana recently with Microsoft partnering with Red Hat to enable users to run JBoss EAP on the Azure App Service \[E6\]. 

 The impact period 2013\-2020 has seen enterprises moving their IT services to the cloud. Cloud platforms are increasingly building applications from loosely coupled modular components, termed *microservices.* This move to building applications from loosely coupled microservices has accelerated the interest in non\-ACID extended transactions \(LRAs\) as the composition mechanism. The Microprofile project of the Eclipse Foundation \(that hosts a global community of active open source projects\) is one of the most prominent efforts aimed at optimizing Enterprise Java for the microservices architecture. The Eclipse MicroProfile LRA is based on WS\-LRA extended transaction model developed by the OASIS Web Services Composite Application Framework Technical Committee \[E7\]. WS\-LRA is part of a number of ACID and non\-ACID extended transaction standards for Web services produced by OASIS that \- as stated earlier\- based on the Activity Service \(see also \[E8\]\). 

 Red Hat’s MicroProfile LRA implementation is based on ATSS/Narayana. Red Hat's new Java platform Quarkus now incorporates MicroProfile. In less than a year since it was released, adoption of Red Hat's Quarkus has skyrocketed with 16% of enterprise java developers now using the framework \[E1\]. In September 2019, Red Hat recorded 55,000 new users and 250,000 page views for Quarkus in one month \[E1\]. In addition, customers of IBM's Cloud Pak for Applications product now have access to the full portfolio of Red Hat's Runtimes and associated components. EAP and Quarkus are part of Red Hat Runtimes, which since 2019 is shipped in IBMs Cloud Pak for Applications and pushed to new and existing customers as the suite of software they should use when either migrating from WebSphere or thinking about building new Cloud\-based applications. In this way it is clear that EAP, Quarkus and therefore ATTS/Narayana are becoming the default for IBM customers building new applications \[E9\]. 

 The impact presented above is on the growing global market for Application Infrastructure and Middleware \(AIM\) Software, estimated at US$30.6bn in 2020 and projected to reach US$45.7bn by 2027 \[E10\]. The research also continues to have an impact through economic benefit to the UK. Red Hat has continued to invest in its European Middleware HQ based in Newcastle, moving to Newcastle University's Catalyst building in 2019. \[ *redacted*\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A programme of ethnographic research, co\-led by DMU and funded by the National Institute for Healthcare Research \(NIHR\), identified how care for people living with dementia during an acute hospital admission could be improved. The findings resulted in an increased policy focus in England and Wales on improving the experiences of hospital admissions and hospital\-related health outcomes for people living with dementia; they influenced parliamentary debates and inquiries and supported the rollout of the Welsh Government’s dementia action plan. The research changed clinical practice through the design of specialist online and face\-to\-face training for NHS staff and Dementia UK’s Admiral Nurses. It enabled social inclusion through the creation of a dementia\-friendly film programme and by inspiring a new play that highlighted the experiences of dementia care among under\-represented and vulnerable communities. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 One in four acute hospital beds in the UK are occupied by a person with dementia. However, people living with dementia are a highly vulnerable group within the hospital setting. Following an acute admission, their functional abilities can deteriorate significantly. A previously published longitudinal cohort study of acute emergency admissions found that patients over 70 with cognitive impairment had markedly higher, short\-term mortality, with 24% dying. Collaborative research by DMU’s Northcott and Cardiff University’s Dr Katie Featherstone sought to identify the ways in which the delivery of nursing care could be adapted to improve the quality of care for people living with dementia during an acute hospital admission. 

 The NIHR\-funded research programme \[G1, G2\] used ethnography to examine the care that people living with dementia receive when they are admitted to hospital, and to understand the organisational practices and cultures that inadvertently contribute to poor health outcomes and experiences of this patient group \[R1, R4\]. 

 Researchers observed 360 shifts at eight hospitals in England and Wales \[R1, R4\], providing an original empirical foundation for how people living with dementia are cared for in hospital, and how overlooked everyday aspects of care can have significant consequences for these patients and their families \[R1\-R5\]. The team focused on a common but poorly understood feature of caring for people living with dementia: the refusal and resistance of care. The findings, first published in an NIHR research report in 2018 and later in peer\-reviewed journals \[R1–R5\], described a ward landscape of dehumanisation, staff burnout and a setting that was not meeting patient needs. The key findings were: 

-  High levels of resistance to bedside care among people living with dementia within acute hospital wards: Every patient living with dementia observed during the study resisted care at some point during their admission. This had implications for experiences of care and outcomes, contributing significantly towards delayed discharge, interruptions to transfers within the hospital and institutionalisation at discharge \[R1, R4, R5\]. 

-  Ward staff tended to interpret resistance as a feature of a dementia diagnosis. However, this behaviour was not because they lacked capacity. Resistance to care was typically a response to ward organisation and care delivery \(routinised and compartmentalised care provided by many different people\). These findings were shared with hospital staff so they could recognise these issues and respond appropriately \[R2, R3, R5\]. 

-  All behaviour of people living with dementia could be interpreted as potentially problematic by ward staff in the context of ward routines. Walking or walking unaccompanied within the ward and getting out of bed was typically discouraged and problematised, which has implications for mobility and rehabilitation. The findings helped hospital staff to recognise that by supporting the mobility of patients \(for everyday activities like going to the toilet\) they can minimise resistance to care, benefiting patients, while reducing their own workload and lowering staff burnout \[R1, R4, R5\]. 

-  A key response to people living with dementia in acute wards was the use of containment and restraint, which was largely undocumented. Techniques employed to reduce mobility included the raising of bed siderails, tucking bedsheets tightly around patients, placing walking frames out of reach and sedation \[R1, R4, R5\]. 

-  For ward staff, the restricted repertoire of work and low levels of training and knowledge of dementia contributed to cultures of dehumanisation and staff exhaustion. Outsourcing of dementia care and expertise means it is seen as other people’s work \[R4, R5\]. 

-  Everyday elements of personal care such as continence are deprioritised in hospital and present serious concerns for patient dignity and basic human rights \[R1, R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Ethnographic research co\-led by Northcott has provided a detailed picture of the experiences of care for people living with dementia during an acute hospital admission, and a set of recommendations for how care can be improved for this vulnerable patient group. Through targeted media engagement, the study findings have stimulated high\-profile public debate in the UK, influencing parliamentary deliberations and contributing to policy responses designed to optimise care for older people. The research has shaped new online and face\-to\-face dementia care training and informed a dementia\-specific film programme to support social inclusion. 

##  \(1\) Influencing public debates and policy responses to improve health outcomes for people living with dementia 

 In April 2018, Northcott and Featherstone shared their findings exclusively with *The Observer* and BBC Five Live to maximise their impact. The *Observer* article \[C1\] was viewed 48,718 times online and reached up to 160,000 people in print. It highlighted the key research conclusions: the organisation of wards is unsuitable for both people with dementia and staff, many of whom lack the required skills and training, and the use of containment techniques is frequently the trigger of resistance or cause of patient anxiety. The story was directly shared on social media 232 times and generated 348 comments, featuring the perspectives of carers and health professionals. The article prompted a formal statement from the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) \[C1\] and quoted the president of the British Geriatrics Society: ‘These findings are a huge concern. Sometimes the use of containment techniques is not justified’ \[C1\]. 

 The study formed the basis of a 45\-minute radio piece on *BBC Five Live Investigates* titled ‘Dementia Care’ \[C2a\], in which the research was featured for the entirety of the programme. Its audience reach was up to 5,000,000; it featured interviews with a carer, a person living with dementia, a nurse and a representative from Dementia UK. It prompted another statement from DHSC and a statement from the Royal College of Nursing, who cited the research as evidence for the need to increase hospital staffing levels, saying that unsafe staffing levels were contributing to a culture of dehumanisation \[C2a\]. The Five Live team made an accompanying two\-minute film for the BBC News website about the research. It was the most viewed news item on the BBC News website for the relevant 24\-hour period \[C2b\]. 

 The Five Live piece led to an invitation from care charity The Edith Ellen Foundation to discuss the findings at a panel event on dementia and healthcare at the House of Lords in June 2018 \[C3\]. This led to an invitation to present the evidence at the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia inquiry on Dementia and Disability in November 2018 \[C3\]. The research was cited directly by the Royal College of Nursing \(RCN\) in its formal recommendations on education and training in a NICE review of quality standards and indicators in dementia care in November 2018 \[C4, p112\]. 

 In Wales, the media coverage of the research in April 2018 resulted in it being cited in the Senedd the following month, in a question put by Welsh Assembly Member Lynne Neagle to the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Services. She cited the studies to support her call for the provision of ‘person\-centred care to people with dementia’; the Cabinet Secretary said the Welsh Government would address this \[C5 paragraph 168\]. The findings were presented and discussed at a meeting of the Welsh Assembly Cross\-Party Group on Dementia in October 2018, at the invitation of Neagle \(Group chair\) \[C6\]. This led to the launch of the Group’s inquiry into hospital care, which was due to report in spring 2020 until delayed by the Covid\-19 pandemic \[C6\]. 

 As part of the rollout of the 2018\-2022 Dementia Action Plan for Wales, the Welsh Government and Public Health Cymru related the study findings to Improvement Cymru \(improvement service for NHS Wales\). From November 2019 Improvement Cymru presented the research to health boards in Wales to guide best practice and improve recognition of dementia within acute hospital wards \[C8\]. The BBC and *Observer* coverage also led directly to a request for research data by the team authoring the All Wales Safeguarding Procedures \(measures protecting vulnerable adults\), which were published in April 2020. This data contributed to the sections that provided guidance on professional abuse and protecting the well\-being of patients. 

##  \(2\) Changing clinical practice through specialist online and face\-to\-face staff training 

 As a direct result of the research, Public Health Wales and NHS Cymru invited Northcott and Featherstone, in 2019, to design and deliver a training programme for the leaders of all seven NHS Health Boards in Wales. This was accompanied by training for nursing and ward staff from three NHS Trusts in collaboration with Dementia UK \[C8\]. The aim of the programme was to raise awareness of the needs of people living with dementia at an organisational level, and to provide the tools for these organisations to develop their own low\- or no\-cost strategies to improve care. Initial training took place at Cardiff and the Vale University Health Board in November 2019. Nine further sessions were scheduled to take place from March 2020 onwards were postponed due to Covid\-19. The research also featured as an ‘NIHR Signal’ in the BMJ in 2019 – Signal briefings are aimed at healthcare decision makers \[C7a, b\]. 

 Northcott and Featherstone produced training films based on the research, in collaboration with professional film\-makers, Dementia UK and Open University. They included testimonials from research participants, carers, nurses and people living with dementia themselves. Shortened versions \(under a minute each\) were also produced for dissemination via Facebook and Twitter during annual events like Dementia Awareness Week \[C3\]. These films, together with the project website www.storiesofdementia.com and the media engagement, were recognised by the NIHR as best practice for engaging non\-academic audiences in health research \[C3\]. Parts of these films have been used \(and continue to be used\) by acute hospitals within Aneurin Bevan University Health Board as part of their ongoing CPD provision for nursing and ward staff \[C8\]. The Board’s R&D Director wrote that the research has ‘supported nursing leadership around dementia care within our acute hospital care settings \[which serve a population of 600,000\] and promoted the research culture and capacity within our organisation’ \[C8\]. 

 The same resources were used for training days organised by Dementia UK and attended by its Admiral Nurses. Beginning in October 2017, these sessions enabled Admiral Nurses to design ‘hacks’ or mini\-interventions to implement practice improvements in hospital and community settings \[C9\]. Dementia UK wrote that the research was ‘particularly influential in helping us to refine the Admiral Nurse “offer” in supporting the acute sector to deliver person\-centred care … the numbers of acute care partnerships we have are increasing exponentially as a result’ \[C9\]. The NIHR funded the development \(with the Open University\) of a CPD\-approved FutureLearn online course: Dementia care in hospital: Caring for people living with dementia in acute hospital wards, the launch of which has been postponed to 2021 due to Covid\-19. 

##  \(3\) Enabling social inclusion through the design of dementia\-friendly film screenings and a new play on the experiences of under\-represented communities 

 The studies highlighted the invisibility and precariousness typically experienced by people living with dementia. Northcott and Featherstone created the ‘Tinted Lens’ film initiative, as part of the public engagement strand of the research programme, to support the integration of an often\-excluded audience. Working alongside charities and arts organisations \(including Carers UK, Dementia UK, British Film Institute \(BFI\), Film Hub Wales \(FHW\) and Chapter Arts\), they co\-designed the toolkit: Dementia Friendly Screenings: A Guide for Cinemas. They co\-organised film screenings during Dementia Awareness Week in 2017 and 2018, in collaboration with Chapter Arts and funded by the BFI and FHW. They were attended by 600 people living with dementia and their families. The 2017 event led to monthly dementia\-friendly screenings that were attended by 20–100 members of the public and covered by *The Guardian* \[C10a\] and the BBC \[C10b\]; cinema\-goers had an opportunity to chat with each other and staff and the auditorium was adapted to be as calming and comfortable as possible. FHW reports that the Tinted Lens initiative helped them ‘gain momentum and crucial awareness’ and demonstrate that the model worked and could be replicated on a wider scale. Its Strategic Hub Manager wrote: ‘Dementia friendly cinema is now a staple in many cinema calendars, with cinemas confident in offering this to their customers as part of their core programmes’ \[C11\]. 

 A play exploring the experiences of dementia care among vulnerable or under\-represented communities \(e.g. the D/deaf community, BAME groups\) drew directly on the ethnographic approach of Northcott and Featherstone’s studies \[C12\]. *Next of Kin* was written by Cardiff University Research Fellow Sofia Vougioukalou and directed by Julia Thomas from National Theatre Wales. The play was shown online in December 2020, as part of the 2020 Festival of Social Science, by Y Lab, a Cardiff University and Nesta collaboration. Produced in partnership with Alzheimer’s Society Cymru and Reality Theatre, an accompanying webinar ‘shared insights from a diverse group of people with the aim of creating shared learning, an impactful understanding of diversity in adult dementia care and a more equal care system’ \[C12\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Durham University’s Conservation Ecology Group \(CEG\) identify the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity using ecological models. A wide range of stakeholders, including Conservation NGOs, national government bodies and international organisations have applied the outputs from these models to: \(1\) change conservation management plans for single sites and across national and international networks; \(2\) change national and international policy on biodiversity and \(3\) produce regional and global assessment outputs of the impact of climate change on natural systems. Durham’s research has directed governmental and non\-governmental policy at national and regional scales, stimulating climate change adaptation for biodiversity across the planet. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research undertaken at Durham University by Willis, Huntley and Stephens has been at the forefront of applied conservation research. The work of Durham’s CEG has been fundamental in identifying the potential impacts of future climate change on species and both Willis and Huntley are members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Climate Change Specialist Group. The CEG has convincingly demonstrated the link between climate and contemporary population and range changes for diverse taxa \(R1, R2, R3\). Further work has developed novel approaches to guide changes to protected areas and protected area networks such that many species can persist in the face of future climate change \(R4, R5, R6\). The group have published >80 scientific papers on recent and future climate change impacts, which have been cited 19,940 times. Our recent research has shown that: 

-  **There is a systematic signal of recent climate change having affected populations of both widespread and protected bird species** across Europe and USA \(R1, R2\). Work in 2016 demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a consistent signal of climate change on population trends of all of the common terrestrial bird species across Europe and the USA \(R1, already cited 165 times\). We have also shown that: \(1\) species protected as *Annex 1* species in Europe, under the *EU Birds Directive*, for which EU member states are obliged to implement special conservation measures, have had more positive population trends than non\-Annex 1 species in recent decades \(R2\); \(2\) trends in population changes of common bird species are occurring in directions consistent with projections related to future human\-induced climate change \(R3, cited 309 times\). 

-  Tropical vertebrate species are equally likely to be as highly impacted by climate change as species from higher latitudes, and **projected shifts in tropical species ranges will have profound impacts on their future conservation within protected area networks** \(R4, R5, R6\). This work has highlighted that, despite protected areas globally having been designated with no consideration of ongoing climate change, in many situations the established reserve networks will continue to provide climatically\-suitable habitats for species under future climate change \(R4, R5\). These findings have markedly affected conservation strategies globally. R5, and together with an accompanying companion paper \(Hole et al. 2009. *Ecology Letters* 12, 420\-431\), have been cited 390 times. 

-  **Simulations can guide conservation actions at individual protected areas** and across networks of sites, including changes to network and site configurations \(R5, R6\). This work \(R6\) was the first to apply regional climate models to project climate impacts on vertebrate species at a finer\-scale, and thus produce more realistic simulations. It was one of the first papers to demonstrate the very different potential impacts of climate change across different taxonomic groups, once their dispersal capabilities were considered. 

 The species distribution and abundance models developed at Durham are powerful tools for informing conservation policy on adaptation and mitigation, related to the impacts of climate change on species. These models have identified species that are vulnerable to climate change and which therefore need to be assisted in colonising new areas. Further, they have demonstrated the potential for high turnover of species across global protected area networks, and that such simulations can be used to guide future management at sites.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

###  Durham University \(DU\) research on climatic change and wildlife has had a global impact on conservation policy and environmental management related to biodiversity conservation. They have worked with many non\-academic stakeholders, shaping local, national and international policy and governance. The research has been applied at levels from individual sites to supranational conservation networks has informed decision making in >12 governments and >20 non\-government organisations. Examples of such work include: 

####  Impacts on conservation NGO policy 

1.  \[E1,2\] We have collaborated extensively with BirdLife International, a global conservation body that represents >200 national conservation charities, to estimate the threat of ongoing climatic change to BirdLife’s global *Important Birds and Biodiversity Network \(* [*https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/programme\-additional\-info/important\-bird\-and\-biodiversity\-areas\-ibas*](https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/programme-additional-info/important-bird-and-biodiversity-areas-ibas) *\).* Our research has underpinned the climate adaptation strategy for this global conservation consortium, leading to the development of climate adaptation strategies for conservation globally. For example, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \(RSPB\), the UK BirdLife partner, has used our work for two decades to guide strategies for species introductions and climate\-conscious management priorities across its 200\+ UK nature reserves. An example is RSPB’s strategy on reintroduction sites for the rare Cirl Bunting in the UK, which was guided by suitability simulations from CEG.  BirdLife’s ‘ *BirdLife’s Position on Climate Change’* document \(2008 & subsequently 2015\) \[E1\] is the basis upon which the organisation advises its 200\+ partner organisations working on the ground. Along with grey literature reports and books, the document uses Durham’s *‘Climatic Atlas of European birds’* and three peer\-reviewed papers, two of which were produced by Durham, as the scientific rationale guiding their position. This document has led partner organisations to adapt management plans for individual sites in sub\-Saharan Africa \(e.g. Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi site examples described in E2\). 

1.  \[E2,E3\] We have worked with The National Audubon Society, the USA’s largest conservation NGO, to develop a climate action plan for the whole of the Americas \( [https://www.audubon.org/conservation/climate/actionplan](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/climate/actionplan); see page 7 of E3 acknowledging Durham’s modelling role\), which is now used as the underpinning framework for all their actions and advocacy work on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity across the region. This action plan is driven entirely by the projections of climate\-induced range shifts of birds across the Americas \(North, Central and South America\) undertaken at Durham. 

####  Impact on European Union policy 

 Durham research was instrumental in the retention of the EU Birds Directive, following a 2015 EU review \(E2, E4\), and thus, the conservation policies and strategies of the 28 member states. Research \(R2\), in which Durham climate modelling was key, was used by the RSPB and BirdLife International to demonstrate that the EU Directive was working effectively. A synthesis of the findings was distributed by the EU science policy department as an ‘EC Science for Environmental Policy’ note – 30<sup>th</sup> Sept 2016, to >20,000 governmental policy staff across the EU. The EU commissioned report ‘ *Evaluation study to support the Fitness Check of the Birds and Habitats Directives’* cites, as one of its ‘main sources of evidence’, Sanderson  *et al.* 2016 \(R2\). Thus, the research was critical in keeping this Directive in place, and hence continuing to protect key wildlife across Europe, at a time when ‘the future of the legislation \[was\] in doubt’ \(Mike Clark, RSPB Chief Executive; see foreword in  [http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/images/defendingnature\_tcm9\-406638.pdf](http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/images/defendingnature_tcm9-406638.pdf)\). 

####  Impact on International Climate Change Policy 

1.  \[E5,E6\] *United Nations \(UN\) Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) Aichi Biodiversity Targets.* 

 The Aichi Biodiversity Targets were established in 2010 to protect global biodiversity. ‘Target 10: Vulnerable Ecosystems’, updated in 2016, is directly supported by a primary indicator derived from Durham research \[R3\] “Climatic impacts on European and North American Birds” \[E6\].  The indicators are used globally to monitor the progress of member states against the targets from the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\-2020. Thus, the indicators are used by the 196 member states, plus the EU, to guide their conservation actions. 

1.  \[E7\] *UN Climate Change Conference \(COP21\) meeting in Paris, Dec 2015.* 

 In 2015, The National Audubon Society and Birdlife International published a report ‘ *Messengers: what birds tell us about threats from climate change and solutions for nature and people’* which cites nine Durham publications \(including R3, 4, 5\) and uses case studies based on this work to illustrate the predicted effect of climate change on bird population.  This report formed the major plank of the organisations’ lobbying at COP21 meeting, which resulted in a global agreement to reduce the impact of human\-made climate change on ecosystems and forms the basis of both organisations’ climate change adaptation policies. 

####  Impacts on Conservation Management 

1.  <ins>\[</ins>E8\] *UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\): Impact on transboundary protected area management across West Africa to cope with climate change.* 

 Durham\-led research, funded by UNEP, explored the impacts of climate change on biodiversity across West Africa, specifically focused on Chad, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone and Togo \(e.g. R6\). The findings were used to identify gaps and future threats to the important West African protected area network in this region. The outputs of the modelling illustrate the vulnerability of all bird, mammal, amphibian and reptile species in the region and summaries of these vulnerabilities have been added to the world database on protected areas \(e.g. Figure 1\), made available by the IUCN World Conservation Monitoring Centre \(WCMC\). The modelling has since been used to inform conservation activities across the region \(see e.g. subsection 2 below\). The changes simulated by Durham models also formed the basis of future\-proof site conservation prioritisation strategies for the entire network \( [http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/recommendations\-and\-planning/identification\-of\-priority\-areas\-for\-biodiversity\-conservation](http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/recommendations-and-planning/identification-of-priority-areas-for-biodiversity-conservation)\). 



 Figure 1: An example of summary statistics for a West African protected area based on Durham modelling work. This particular protected area, in Sierra Leone, has now signed a transboundary agreement with adjoining Gola National Park in Liberia \(not shown\) as a result of our work \(see below\). 

1.  \[E8\] *On\-the\-ground activities to enhance climate change resilience of protected areas.* 

 As a result of the research described in \(1\), five West African pilot sites were selected \( [http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/regional\-and\-national\-activities/transboundary\-pilot\-site\-activities](http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/regional-and-national-activities/transboundary-pilot-site-activities)\) where protected areas in neighbouring countries abut each other. Figure 1 shows one such protected area in Sierra Leone, bordering Liberia. In these areas, transboundary protected areas will help species adapt to climate change, i.e. regions where adjacent protected areas in different countries will be more closely managed to facilitate species moving between protected areas in response to changing climate. In all, five transboundary agreements were signed \(most in 2016\) between countries and joint protected areas management plans integrating climate change were established. 

1.  \[E9\] Finally, work from Durham has been influential in the *IUCNs ‘Guidelines for Assessing Species Vulnerability to Climate Change* **’** including contributing 2 of 10 case studies \(pages 71\-73, pages 87\-89\). These guidelines are being used by protected area managers, and local, national and regional conservation managers and planners, to implement changes to management or to priority species on the basis of better\-informed species vulnerabilities to climate.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Vitamin D is essential for health. Setting dietary recommendations enables intake and status to be monitored and improved in populations. 

 **Impact 1**: Our research is used by policymakers and risk managers in setting current dietary vitamin D requirements in the USA, Canada, UK, and the EU member states. 

 **Impact 2**: These guidelines are used globally by health professionals and food manufacturers to improve vitamin D status. 

 The significance of the impact can be appreciated in that optimising vitamin D status is crucial for preventing vitamin D deficiency and associated chronic diseases and health conditions, with resultant health and economic benefits worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Low vitamin D status** 

 Low vitamin D status is linked to osteoporosis and chronic diseases throughout the world, and optimising vitamin D intake can therefore have important consequences in reducing the risk of such conditions. Nutrition and health professionals \(e.g. medical doctors, dietitians, sport nutritionists\) as well as food manufacturers rely on evidence\-based dietary vitamin D requirements, not only to prevent vitamin D deficiency diseases \(e.g. rickets and osteomalacia\), but also to improve the overall health of populations worldwide. 

 **Optimising vitamin D dietary intake to improve status** 

 In 2006, Professors Wallace \(deceased\) and Strain at Ulster secured funding from the UK Food Standards Agency \(FSA\), in collaboration with University College Cork, to investigate the relative contribution of dietary intake and sunlight to vitamin D status in young adults and older individuals. This collaboration produced several high impact papers \(e.g. **R1**, **R2**\). The randomised controlled trial outputs from this research \( **R1**, **R2**\) have had considerable impact during this current REF timeframe in informing policymakers when they were devising dietary guidelines for vitamin D. In 2008, additional funding from the UK FSA, also in collaboration with University College Cork, enabled the Ulster team to assess potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation on bone health, immune function and cardiovascular risk markers. 

 This research built upon a previous collaborative project with University College Cork, also led by Professors Wallace and Strain and which identified the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the Northern Ireland Young Hearts Project. This investigation was the first to highlight low vitamin D status among 12\- and 15\-year olds, particularly in girls, in a representative sample of adolescents in Northern Ireland \( **R3**\). This finding was of concern, as low vitamin D status was also associated with low bone mineral density in these adolescents. Our prior research in this age group showed low vitamin D status among young adults in wintertime but established that 8 weeks’ supplementation in our randomised controlled trial was effective at improving status \( **R4**\). 

 **Vitamin D status in elite sports** 

 Research led by Dr Magee and funded by the Irish Rugby Football Union, Cricket Ireland, and the Irish Amateur Boxing Association demonstrated deficiency of vitamin D in elite athletes and Paralympians in Ireland \(not cited here\). As a result, Sport Ireland has revised its vitamin D supplementation policy and research at Ulster has subsequently demonstrated improved status in athletes some 4\-5 years after the revision of Sport Ireland’s vitamin D supplementation policy \( **R5**\). 

 **Vitamin D status in the COVID\-19 pandemic** 

 Significant research funding was awarded in 2009 by the Department for Employment and Learning for a cross\-border Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance collaboration, led by Professors McNulty and Strain, to set up a ‘Centre of Excellence in Nutrition and Ageing’ \(CENA\). Research emanating from CENA \(not cited here\) supports a role for adequate vitamin D status for optimal immune function, particularly within the older adult population \(≥60yrs\). The importance of optimal vitamin D status for immune function during the COVID\-19 pandemic is highlighted in a recent \(2020\) review \( **R6**\) with invited co\-authors from Ulster. The review highlights the importance of vitamin D for immune health and recommends vitamin D supplementation according to country\-specific government guidelines \(which in turn utilised data from **R1, R2**\) with emphasis on those self\-isolating with limited access to sun exposure.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact 1: Setting current vitamin D requirements for populations by policymakers and risk managers** 

-  *The EU*: In 2016, our studies \( **R1, R2, R4**\) were critical to the European Food Safety Authority’s \(EFSA\) approach \(meta\-regression\) to assess intake\-status for deriving dietary reference values \(DRVs\) for vitamin D for adults under conditions of minimal vitamin D synthesis from sunlight \[ **C1**\]. 

-  *The UK*: The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \(SACN, 2016\) used our data \( **R1\-R3**\) as underpinning evidence \[ **C2**\] to revise the DRVs for vitamin D for the UK population aged 4 years and over. The UK government cascaded this information to all health professionals for dissemination to the public in the UK \[ **C2**\]. 

-  *The German\-speaking countries*: The German\-speaking countries \(D\-A\-C\-H, 2015\) used our data to set a DRV for vitamin D in adults aged <60 years \( **R1**\) and for older adults aged >60 years \( **R2**\) \[ **C3**\]. 

-  *The Nordic countries*: The Nordic Council of Ministers \(2014\) considered a meta\-regression analysis of supplementation studies \(including **R1, R4**\) in setting requirements for adults aged <60 years and supplementation studies \(including **R2**\) for adults aged >60 years \[ **C4**\]. 

 **Impact 2: Use of dietary recommendations by health professionals and food manufacturers** 

-  *Global reach*: The current global reach of the impact is clear in that end users \(e.g. health professionals and food manufacturers\) of the recommendations based on Ulster’s underpinning research \( **R1\-R4**\) reside in more than 35 territories, including the UK, the 27 EU countries, the USA, Canada, Norway and Switzerland \[ **C1\-C4**\]. This impact includes prevailing recommendations set by the The Institute of Medicine \(for the USA and Canada\) and The Health Council of the Netherlands using our research \( **R1, R2**\). The significance and reach of the impact relating to our research is that dietary recommendations are crucial from a public health perspective for the prevention of vitamin D deficiency and low status, with benefits to populations worldwide. The recommendations are essential public health policy instruments developed with the evidence base and data available at that time \(including **R1\-R4**\). 

-  *COVID\-19*: The current COVID\-19 pandemic caused the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in June 2020 to produce a rapid evidence summary, informed by the recent review \( **R6**\), recommending all people to follow Government recommendations \(based on data from **R1\-R3**\) on vitamin D \[ **C5**\]. NICE also published a medicines evidence commentary on vitamin D supplementation for preventing intensive care admission in people with COVID\-19 \[ **C5**\]. The UK National Health Service \(NHS\), Public Health England \(PHE\), the British Dietetics Association \(BDA\) and the Need for Nutrition Education/Innovation Programme \(NNEdPro\) Global Taskforce for COVID\-19 have recently \(April\-June 2020\) emphasised the importance of vitamin D supplementation in advice for the general public \[ **C5**\]. A particular emphasis is given to the importance of following vitamin D dietary recommendations \(based on data from **R1\-R3**\) for those with increased time spent indoors during lockdown, shielding/cocooning and in self\-isolation during the COVID\-19 pandemic \[ **C5**\]. 

-  *Food fortification*: As a consequence of the revised dietary recommendations \( **R1\-R4**\), nationally implemented voluntary food fortification programmes have demonstrated vitamin D status improvements in populations, e.g. the Finnish policy has doubled the vitamin D status of the general population with deficiency rates <1% \[ **C6**\]. Similarly, in response to the revised dietary recommendations \(based on data from **R1\-R4**\), vitamin D food fortification has been introduced or revised in countries such as India \(vitamin D fortified milk and edible oils, 2014\), the USA \(doubling of vitamin D fortification in milk, 2016\) and Sweden \(dairy products and margarine spreads, 2018\), \[ **C6**\]. 

-  *Food industry*: Industry now uses these dietary guidelines on packaging and in promotional literature \[ **C7**\] in response to the revised recommendations as underpinned by Ulster’s research \(based on data from **R1\-R4**\). These industry initiatives have economic benefits in line with addressing global nutritional needs. Revisions to the vitamin D dietary recommendations automatically impact the entire food industry in that every product with a claim relating to vitamin D will always comply with the applicable dietary recommendations \(based on data from **R1\-R4**\) \[ **C1\-C4**\] as set by the authorities in the relevant country or region. 

-  *Elite athletes*: Sport Ireland has revised its policy so that the vitamin D status of all athletes is now routinely monitored, with vitamin D supplementation implemented \(if necessary\) using protocols designed by Sport Ireland \[ **C8**\]. The Sport Ireland Institute, using resources based on our research, now educates athletes on their vitamin D requirements which has improved their status \( **R5**\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through the use of energy visualisation interventions, including thermal imaging and digital games, householders in the UK, Europe and Canada have altered their energy related behaviours and taken action to insulate their homes. The University of Plymouth research methodology for reducing energy use was implemented by: 

 \(i\) UK Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) to train smart meter installers to deliver energy efficiency advice to households. As of March 2020 this equates to advising 17.3 million households through smart meter installations. 

 \(ii\) Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan for a large\-scale thermal imaging programme of 15,000 homes which contributed to the development of the city’s 2019 Deep Emissions Retrofit Strategy and was drawn on by other municipalities in the Province of British Columbia. 

 \(iii\) UK and international business. The research opened new opportunities for business enterprise, including: the development of C3NTINEL™ software; the games EnergyCat and EkoSmart for the energy provider Électricité de France \(EDF\); a UK based spin out consultancy; and a novel arts\-focused social enterprise.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Energy visualisation research at the University of Plymouth \(UoP\) responds to the global necessity to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere by focusing on reducing carbon emissions from homes. Reducing emissions from existing homes has proved a challenge because residents require expert advice to invest in changes to their properties and dynamic information on their home energy if they are to use energy more efficiently. This challenge has been addressed by UoP researchers through two major research projects: 

-  2012\-2016 *Energy Visualisation for Carbon* *Reduction* \( **eViz**\), funded by the EPSRC \(£908,746\), led by UoP Principal Investigators Prof. Pieter de Wilde \(School of Art, Architecture and Design\) and Prof. Sabine Pahl \(School of Psychology\) with Newcastle, Bath and Birmingham universities, and international partners at the University of British Columbia \(UBC\) in Vancouver and the Technical Universities in Eindhoven and Vienna. 

-  2015\-2018 *Energy Games for Awareness of Energy Efficiency in Social Housing Communities* \( **EnerGAware**\) funded by EU Horizon 2020 \(€2,000,000\) led by Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya with UoP research lead Dr Alba Fuertes Casals \(PI\) and UoP researchers Prof Pieter de Wilde, Prof Sabine Pahl and Dr Rory Jones. 

 The research builds on long standing expertise in thermography and building performance in the University with thermal cameras first used in 1998 for defect detection in buildings \[3.1 & 3.2\]. In 2007, in collaboration with the School of Psychology, thermal energy visualisations were successfully used as an intervention to engage households with energy\-saving home retrofits, such as wall insulation and draught proofing, and to encourage energy efficiency. Findings from a series of four studies established a methodology which was unique at that time in using energy visualisation interventions as a catalyst to bring together homeowners, tenants and housing managers with energy providers, low\-carbon materials suppliers and technical expertise. The research was led by Prof Goodhew \(School of Art, Architecture and Design\) and Prof Pahl \(School of Psychology\). Results from the series of four studies are detailed in the table below. 

 In the first three studies \(Table 1\) UoP thermography researchers conducted internal and external imaging surveys of individual homes and discussed practical energy saving solutions with occupants, while in the fourth study the only intervention was a letter sent to each household containing generic thermal images or text. Study 1 tested the effectiveness of a thermal survey versus a non\-visual energy audit and found that the group who received personalised, or tailored, thermal images made a 14% reduction in carbon emissions from energy use in their homes \[3.3\]. Study 2 \(the *21<sup>st</sup> Century Living Project\)* did the same but included a £500 incentive to spend on energy saving products. The households receiving thermal surveys and follow\-up tailored images were nearly five times more likely to draught proof their homes \[3.3\]. Study 3 tested energy saving beliefs, finding households receiving thermal surveys and follow\-up tailored images recalled the communication better, showed further engagement with energy efficiency and were more likely to share the information with others \[3.4\]. In Study 4, the only intervention was a letter sent to each household containing generic thermal images or text. Letters with images elicited lower uptake of energy savings enquiries, indicating the importance of tailored images and talking to householders. 

| Table 1 Details of the four thermal imaging research studies. \[R3,4\] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year | \#Homes | Partners | Findings |
| Study 1  2007 | 43 | Bovey Climate Action Group | The thermal survey group made carbon savings of 14.29%. The control group made no carbon savings and made fewer energy saving actions. |
| Study 2  2008 | 100 | The Eden Project, Homebase, University of Surrey | 26% draught proofed homes compared to 6% in the control group. |
| Study 3  2013 | 980 | eViz, Cornwall Together \(DECC\), The Eden Project, Homebase | 40% of households receiving tailored thermal images made improvements \(compared to 20% and 17% in non\-tailored image groups\) and were twice as likely to share advice. |
| Study 4  2015 | 4736   | eViz, Behavioural Insights Team, Plymouth Energy Community | No observable increase in retrofits from letter communication with no thermal survey. |

 The *Energy Visualisation for Carbon* *Reduction* research project \(2012\-16\), ‘eViz’, fostered a breadth of visualisation experiments, including virtual reality gaming and partnerships with social housing providers, energy providers, tech companies and creative industries. The studies were unique in their scientific approach to measuring energy efficiency behaviour and provided the evidence base and methods to support public investment in the UK and Canada. The eViz research was extended through the Europe\-wide EnerGAware research project \(2015\-18\) for which UoP researchers surveyed 4000 social housing tenants in Plymouth and co\-developed the tablet\-based computer game EnergyCat with Devon and Cornwall Housing Association, the transnational energy supplier EDF and the software development company Fremencorps. EnergyCat guided users to save energy by modelling household energy\-use scenarios linked to actual energy consumption, providing tailored information on how to save energy and reduce heating bills \[3.5 & 3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **i. Influencing UK Government guidance on delivering energy efficiency advice** 

 Energy visualisation interventions developed by eViz informed a Government commissioned pilot conducted December 2015 to February 2016. Its aim was to understand how best to deliver energy efficiency advice to households during smart meter installation visits, and thereby reduce carbon emissions from existing homes. The approach developed for delivering tailored advice is now intrinsic to the roll\-out of smart meters in the UK through the Smart Meter Implementation Programme. The Smart Meter Installation Code of Practice now obliges energy suppliers to provide energy efficiency advice and promote engagement with energy efficiency advice at point of installation. As of March 2020, 17.3 million smart meters had been installed in homes in Great Britain by the trained installers. UoP researchers were consulted and presented their work to the Department of Energy & Climate Change \(now BEIS\) in 2014 for the research phase of the pilot. UoP research is cited in the UK Government’s advisory publications available on the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) webpage of ‘Best practice guidance for the delivery of energy efficiency advice to households during smart meter installation visits’ \[5.1, 5.2\]. The publications comprise a toolkit guide to help energy suppliers develop training with guidance for their installers and ten factsheets covering a range of energy advice that installers can pick from to match customers’ circumstances. UoP provided exemplar thermal images, which are included in two Factsheets: ‘Draught proofing, It’s a Breeze’ and ‘Keeping the heat in: A simple guide to wall insulation’ \[5.2\]. An eViz case study is included in the ‘Review of Energy Efficiency Advice Best Practice’ prepared by Ipsos MORI and the Energy Saving Trust \(2017, p.18\) \[5.1\]. Specific references include: 

-  Review of Energy Efficiency Advice Best Practice \(eViz case study pp.18\-19\) 

-  Toolkit Guidance \(e.g. reference to thermal images as engagement ‘hooks’, pp. 7, 10\)

 **ii. Contribution to the Vancouver City Council’s Greenest City Action Plan** 

 With a longstanding reputation for environmental leadership going back to the founding of Greenpeace in Vancouver in the early 1970s, the city has a reputation as an early adopter and influencer, spurred by the inception in 2011 of the Greenest City 2020 Action Plan and more recently in 2019 by an ambitious Climate Emergency Declaration. In addition, Vancouver is unique in Canada as the only city with the power to set its own building regulations \(‘Lessons from the BC Energy Step Code’, 2019\). In the context of the Greenest City Action Plan, UoP research informed a large\-scale thermal imaging programme involving 15,000 homes \[5.3\] which contributed to the development of the city’s 2019 Deep Emissions Retrofit Strategy \[5.4\] and was drawn on by other municipalities in the Province of British Columbia \(BC\) \[5.5\]. UoP researchers first outlined a thermal imaging approach to household engagement in energy efficiency for the context of BC through a co\-authored invited White Paper with partners at the University of British Columbia \(UBC\) for the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions, which drew on eViz research \[3.1\-3.4\]. Following this, Vancouver City Council commissioned a thermal imaging report ‘Exploring the use of thermal imagery for the promotion of residential energy efficiency’ \(2016\) from UoP and UBC researchers outlining a programme. The report, alongside regular consultations with UoP and UBC researchers, provided a robust methodology that framed the City of Vancouver’s thermal imaging pilot of 15,000 homes in January 2017 \[5.5, 5.6\]. The Council invested over CAD150,000 \(01\-2017\) in the programme and followed up UoP recommendations with a city\-wide media campaign, letter communications tailored to households and neighbourhood engagement. The Green Buildings Manager reported: “ *The energy visualisation research helped us make the problem of carbon emissions from homes much more visible and it raised the issue of thermal insulation for our many historic detached family dwellings much more prominent. The Thermal Imaging Pilot Program was one of the major homeowner engagement projects that has helped us plan how best to tackle GHG from homes in Vancouver. The City voted to invest Can$20M for retrofit programs in 2019 and we now have a Deep Emissions Retrofit Strategy which is part of our ambitious and newly approved Climate Declaration Action Plan”* \[5.5\]. 

 The Thermal Imaging Programme was one of four city\-wide pilots stated in the Council’s Administrative Report \(2019, p.5\) as contributing to the 2019 Deep Emissions Retrofit Strategy \[5.4\], which updates the 2014 policy ‘Energy Retrofit Strategy of Existing Buildings,’ and feeding into the Vancouver Building ByLaw 2019 update. Following the pilot, Vancouver updated its approach for existing housing to provide incentives as well as put in renovation requirements and neighbouring cities have adopted their policies \[5.5\]. The sustainable building consultancy Integral Group \(co\-authors on 2016 thermal imaging report\) state they: “ *drew on this research in making recommendations to a group of municipalities in the Lower Mainland of BC*” and that consequently the Township of Langley has “ *developed a pilot program that draws on a combination of subsidised energy advisors, household engagement and financial support that has drawn interest and support from the Province of BC*” \[5.6\]. 

 **iii. New opportunities for energy\-saving business enterprise** 

 The eViz research project included a number of business collaborators including the Plymouth\-based energy management company C3Resources. As an eViz collaborator, the opportunity to experiment, observe, share and discuss findings with eViz researchers was key to the development of the architecture, design and functionality of the company’s energy data visualisation software tool C3NTINEL™, which monitors energy use in buildings. As a result, C3NTINEL gained industry recognition and in December 2015 the company was acquired by the multinational ENGIE, a global benchmark company in low carbon energy and sustainability for the facilities management sector, employing over 170,000 people across the world. C3NTINEL is now used worldwide to deliver Engie Management and Energy Efficiency \[5.7\]. 

 Two start\-up companies formed following interactions with the eViz project. The consultancy Thermal Imaging IR was established in 2017 by an eViz thermographer and provides unique expertise in the South West in the novel use of thermal imaging for energy efficiency in architecture and construction sectors. The social enterprise Art and Energy was founded in 2013, inspired by meeting with eViz researchers, and has directly engaged over 1500 participants and 114 artists in making energy efficient, awareness\-raising artworks \[5.8\]. 

 The digital game EnergyCat was developed through the EnerGAware research project with energy provider Électricité de France \(EDF\) and the software company Fremencorp to encourage home based energy saving behaviours. EnergyCat led to a 5.34% reduction in energy use in the survey group with 3.46% electricity savings and 7.48% gas savings, which is higher than the 2% saving from the government’s roll\-out of smart meters. Subsequently, Fremencorp went on to develop two further games for household energy saving based on EnergyCat \- Smartn for individual homes and EkoSmart for neighbourhoods, both available as apps and online \[5.9\]. EkoSmart was released as a pilot study by EDF Méditerranée in Montpellier, France in 2017 to 500 households. It attracted investment of EUR180,000 \(04\-2018\) by EDF and EUR65,000 \(04\-2018\) from the French Government’s Investing for the Future Programme \[5.10\]. The pilot was run by EDF in partnership with the Montpellier Institute of Management and social housing landlord ACM Habitat. EDF found that EkoSmart influenced customer’s energy saving habits with the app communicating more effectively with young people and the link to the games’ software developer revitalising the energy supplier’s image. For Fremencorp, the proof of concept for their product opened markets for the app as a training and awareness solution for energy efficiency \[5.10\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Prof. Goldby’s research has informed and significantly shaped key initiatives to provide a governance framework for digitalising trade. Global trade is underpinned by inefficient paper\-based transacting and anachronistic laws that have impeded progress in dispensing with paper in step with the advance of digital technology.  Her research informed the provisions of United Nations Commission on International Trade Law \(UNCITRAL\)’s 2017 Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records \(MLETR\). Her research has also informed the adoption of legislation in Bahrain and is key to the Digital Assets Law Reform project being undertaken by the Law Commission of England and Wales. Her research has been foundational to the adoption of rules and guidance by industry including by Lloyd’s of London, the International Chamber of Commerce and commercially owned trade platforms. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Cross\-border trade has for centuries relied on voluminous paper documentation. Consequently, the information supply chain is riddled with costly inefficiencies and is prone to delays. This creates compelling incentives to go paperless. However, because of the complexity of cross\-border transactions and because the underlying legal framework assumes the use of paper documents, the transition to paperless transactions is extremely challenging. 

 Goldby has, for many years, researched the legal barriers to digitalisation, including whether state action is required to remove such barriers and if so, what action should be taken \[3.1; 3.6\]. 

 Those wishing to replace paper with electronic data must rely on the private contractual frameworks used by commercially\-owned digital trade platforms that bind users to legal outcomes mirroring those in the paper world. Goldby researched the effectiveness of such frameworks and found them imperfect because: 

-  the outcomes might not be recognised in all jurisdictions involved in a transaction 

-  they require each participant in the supply chain to access and use the relevant trade platform to transact within the relevant private contractual framework \[3.6\]. 

 She concluded that only state legislation can provide the legal certainty needed for digitalisation. 

 In the absence of an overarching cross\-jurisdictional framework, the safest option is to continue to use paper. However, this is costly, time\-consuming and leads to delays. Goldby researched how the transport, trade finance and insurance sectors have dealt with the challenges \[3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. The \(partial\) interim solutions adopted include remote printing and the use of non\-transferable documents. However, the former opens the door to fraud and does not achieve complete digitalisation; the latter can severely restrict the financing options of traders down the supply chain \[3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. 

 Goldby researched the emerging digital trade platforms based on blockchain technology and the growing interest in smart contracts \[3.6, 3.8\]. She also examined: 

-  how these new practices interface with the law, and what reforms they might engender or render necessary \[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\] 

-  what options are available in terms of legal development \[3.6\] including through the adoption of terms by non\-governmental bodies \[3.9\] 

-  the potential contribution of digitalisation to fraud\-prevention \[3.7\] 

-  the potential of smart contracts technology for insurance products \[3.8\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Prof. Goldby’s research has informed and significantly shaped key initiatives to provide a legal framework for the digitalisation of international trade. 

#  International impact: shaping the key United Nations instrument 

 The research strongly informed the work done by United Nations Commission on International Trade Law \(UNCITRAL\) to draft Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records \(MLETR\). UNCITRAL was set up to produce legislative texts to harmonise international commercial law across nations. MLETR is designed to enable digitalisation, in that legislation based on MLETR ensures that digital alternatives are legally recognized as functionally equivalent to paper documents of title and negotiable instruments used in cross\-border trade. 

 As a participant in UNCITRAL’s Working Group \(WG\) IV and Experts Group which drafted MLETR, Goldby put forward several drafting proposals, all of which drew from her research. \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\]. Her published research was acknowledged by Luca Castellani of the UNCITRAL Secretariat, as being ‘a valuable starting point for the work of Working Group IV’ and as essential to the drafting of the MLETR’s three key provisions \(Articles 10, 11 and 12\) which underpin the recognition of electronic records as functionally equivalent to paper documents \[5.1\]. As evidenced also by letters provided by another member and an observer within the working group \[5.1a, 5.1b\], UNCITRAL’s work drew directly on Goldby’s key findings \(see section s below\). In the wake of the COVID\-19 pandemic and the attendant restrictions on travel and transport, the inefficiencies of couriering paper documents around the world in order to process international trade transactions became ever more evident. Accordingly, the International Chamber of Commerce \(ICC\) called upon national governments to enable the use of digital alternatives by adopting legislation compliant with MLETR. 

 Goldby is participating as a UK expert in the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business \(UN/CEFACT\) project on transfer of MLETR\-compliant titles, the aim of which is to create clear guidance in the form of a White Paper on how to fulfil the requirements set out in MLETR for issuing and transferring valid electronic transferable records using currently available technologies. Her research \[3.5, 3.6\] forms an essential underpinning to this project \[5.2\]. 

#  State\-level impact: contributing to Bahraini and English law reform 

 In October 2016, the Bahraini government consulted Goldby on its draft legislation to implement MLETR. Her suggested amendments were adopted, resulting in the promulgation of Electronic Communications and Transactions Law 2018 \(Decree No.54 of 2018\). Bahrain’s Economic Development Board commended Goldby’s research and contribution in drafting the law \[5.3\]. 

 More recently, the Law Commission of England and Wales has embarked on a project to review relevant legislation with a view to amending it, in order to recognise that documents of title and negotiable instruments can be digital, so long as they are issued in such a way as to be possessable. Goldby’s research \[3.4, 3.5 3.6\] is essential to this project \[5.4\]. Prof. Sarah Green, Law Commissioner for Commercial Law and the Common Law, attests \[5.4\] that the Digital Assets Project team made ‘extensive use’ of Goldby’s book \[3.6\] to understand better the scope of the necessary reforms and the significance of possession of documents such as bills of lading and insurance certificates in determining who may exercise rights. They also used other key publications to assess the implications of the intended reforms for regulated contracts of carriage \[3.4\] and to assess how blockchain technology may make digital documents possessable \[3.5\]. 

#  Impact on private/business frameworks 

 Goldby’s research has been implemented in two ways. First, it has been used by the private business community in the development of standards for digital transacting. Second, it has been used by industry to develop contractual terms and frameworks to underpin the use of digital platforms designed to replace paper. 

##  Standards for Digital Transacting 

 Two sets of ICC standards for digital transacting draw upon Goldby’s research \[5.5\]: 

1.  The Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits–Supplement on Electronic Presentation, v 2.0 \(2019\), which enables the submission of data in place of documents for documentary credit agreements. 

1.  The ICC Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions \(URDTT\), currently in their fourth revised draft, due to be adopted later in 2021, provide a framework that applies to all parties that participate in a Digital Trade Transaction, defined as the sale and purchase of goods or services evidenced through the use of Electronic Records. 

 As indicated by Chris Southworth, Secretary General of the ICC \[5.5\] Goldby’s research ‘fed into’ both of these standard\-setting exercises. In particular, he notes that the ICC ‘benefitted from \[Goldby’s\] research and publications, in particular \[her\] identification of the barriers and uncertainties arising from the legal framework underpinning digital transformation and \[her\] suggestions for how these may be addressed….’ He makes specific reference to outputs \[3.5\], \[3.6\] and \[3.9\]. 

##  Industry frameworks 

###  1. Lloyd’s of London 

 Goldby has worked with the Innovation Department at Lloyd’s of London in exploring possible implementations of her research findings for real\-world application to improve \(i\) documentation of insurance cover at the time of insurance contract formation, and \(ii\) claims processes. Trevor Maynard, Head of Innovation at Lloyd’s has described her research as ‘very influential’ and ‘invaluable’ to Lloyd’s efforts to implement new technologies, in particular smart contracts, to improve their processes \[5.6\]. Goldby led a joint initiative between the Centre for Commercial Law Studies at Queen Mary and Lloyd's of London to prepare an emerging risks/ innovation report for the Lloyd’s insurance market, which evaluates the potential for smart contracts to support insurance products, including cargo insurance products. The Report draws directly on her key findings relating to legal challenges raised by the digitalisation of cargo insurance certificates \[3.1 chapter 8; 3.6 chapter 8\]. Lloyd’s said that the report ‘is intended as foundational research to guide future market activity in this space’ and that ‘Lloyd’s is considering a number of concrete implementations of the guidance… relevant to the field of digital transformation of international trade’ \[5.6\]. Lloyd’s has indicated that it is considering introducing new products based on Goldby’s findings relating to cargo insurance \[3.6; 5.6\]. 

 Lloyd’s have also partnered with Goldby to submit a successful ESRC studentship application to fund further research supervised by Goldby which ‘has the potential to play a valuable role in the market’s legal preparations for the introduction of this technology’ \[5.6\]. 

###  2. The Digital Container Shipping Association \(DCSA\) 

 Goldby’s research was essential to the drafting of a set of Bylaws to support the use of electronic bills of lading in container transportation, pending the adoption of enabling national laws in key jurisdictions. The DCSA is an international association which brings together nine of the largest liner sea carriers globally \(including Maersk, MSC and CMA\-CGM\). Mr Niels Nuyens, eDocumentation Programme Director has provided a testimonial indicating how the Bylaws drafting exercise has benefitted from output \[3.6\] \[5.7\]. 

###  3. Commercially\-owned blockchain platforms providing digital alternatives to bills of lading 

 Goldby’s research has also been instrumental to the development by two blockchain start\-ups of private contractual frameworks \(by\-laws and standard terms and conditions\) designed to address the uncertainties created by gaps in current law. In both cases Goldby was approached by the legal representatives of these start\-ups after they became aware of her expertise in this field and she was asked to help apply her findings to the drafting of the contractual frameworks in question. Referring to output \[3.1, Chapter 6\], OGY Docs Inc, which recently launched the WAVE blockchain\-based bill of lading system, commented \[5.8\]: ‘… we were pleased and grateful to be able to refer to \[Goldby’s\] research…  which analyses the manner in which electronic records and processes may achieve the same effects at law as the issue and transfer of a paper bill of lading.’ Jonathan Lux, a barrister who drafted the standard terms and conditions underlying the use of a similar blockchain\-based platform called CargoX said Goldby’s research \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\] was ‘extremely helpful’ in drafting rules \[5.9\], in particular her findings on the mandatory application of international conventions \[3.4\], her findings on tender of digital alternatives to bills of lading under trade finance contracts \[3.5\] and her findings on gaps in emerging standards developed by shipping and trade industries \[3.3\]. 

 Both the WAVE system developed by OGY Docs and the CargoX system were approved as suitable alternatives to paper bills of lading by the liability insurers of ship owners and operators \(the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs IGP&I\) in December 2019 and February 2020 respectively. This is of supreme importance as P&I Club cover is lost by carriers if they deliver the goods other than against a paper bill of lading, so carriers would not use electronic alternatives without approval by the IGP&I. An important consideration when assessing systems for approval is the robustness of the legal framework underpinning them. Since then, the WAVE system is being promoted by major liner transportation companies such as ZIM and MSC for use by their customers, especially in view of the added difficulties to the physical movement of paper bills of lading as a consequence of the COVID\-19 restrictions.  The expanding use of pioneer systems such as WAVE and CargoX is testament to the significant impact of Goldby’s work.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Concerns about implicit bias have led many institutions to introduce implicit bias training. But this training is often problematic. Holroyd and Saul's research articulates the pitfalls of focussing solely on individual cognition in implicit bias training. Instead they argue, changing institutional norms, practice, and policy is essential in tackling implicit bias and its effects. They used their research to develop workshops to improve institutional practice in academia, the judicial and legal system, and the Cabinet Office. As a result, organisations developed inclusivity guidelines and made changes to vetting and recruitment processes with concrete changes to their practice. To further the learning and benefits of their research, the team designed ‘train the trainer’ workshops which support those providing training within their own organisations to improve how those organisations work.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Implicit biases – fast automatic cognitions involved in stereotyping social groups – are a likely causal factor in producing patterns of discrimination against and exclusion of stigmatised social groups. Implicit biases have been found to be pervasive, and in recent years many institutions have started to provide so\-called ‘implicit bias training’ with the aim of helping their employees or members understand implicit biases and avoid discrimination. Much research from social psychology has focused on interventions that try to change or reduce individuals’ implicit biases; much research, however, shows that such interventions are not robust. 

 Our research has focused on: 

1.  Developing a better understanding of what implicit biases are and how they operate. This research has made original contributions in emphasising the heterogeneity of implicit biases and the various kinds of influence they may have on behaviour \[R1, R2\]. 

1.  Understanding the causal role of implicit biases in explanations of exclusion and discrimination, in particular of women in philosophy \(76% of professional philosophers are male in the UK\), but also in academia more widely \[R3, R4\]. We have also focused on the explanatory role of implicit bias in other contexts \(such as criminal justice\) \[R2\]. The former research has focused on the role that gender bias may play in hiring, promotion, publication and marking, and in ratings exercises that have been prominent in the discipline. We have also articulated the role that implicit biases may play in perpetuating institutional racism. 

1.  The importance of contextual, institutional, and structural factors that contribute to implicit bias, and the importance of changing those contextual and structural factors in order to combat the effects of implicit bias \[R2, R5, R6\]. This research is original in showing that, contrary to some assumptions made by scholars, change to implicit biases should not be understood individualistically. Rather bias change is part of a process of structural change. Structural change includes changes to norms, practices, and policies that govern these, and is to be contrasted with interventions that try to change individual cognition in isolation. This informs our approaches to combating the effects of implicit bias in workshops \(detailed below\), which focus on changes to practice and policy, rather than on individuals’ biases alone. This supports an innovative approach to bias training. 

1.  How the knowledge developed above should inform both implicit bias training and other strategies to combat implicit biases. This research has been original both in focusing on the kinds of structural and institutional changes needed, and also in demonstrating that these sorts of changes are better placed to address multiple forms of discrimination, including discrimination due to intersectional oppressions. These changes are multiply justified, in that they are supported by other considerations also \- such as avoiding explicit bias, and enhancing perceptions of procedural justice \[R2, R5, R6\]. 

 The key findings of this work, developed through philosophical research and interdisciplinary research with social psychologists, are that: 

-  implicit biases are heterogeneous and may influence behaviour in many ways; 

-  it is plausible that implicit biases have an explanatory role \(alongside other factors\) in producing and sustaining gender and racial biases in a range of contexts; 

-  addressing implicit biases requires changes to structural factors \(norms, practices, policies\) rather than attention to individual cognition alone; 

-  ‘implicit bias training’ workshops should focus on addressing structural factors \(changes to which are multiply justified\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Through the development of training and best practice guidelines, Holroyd and Saul have increased understanding of implicit biases in institutional contexts, and of how to address them through structural changes, to policy and practice. This has resulted in changed workplace practice and improvements in diversity. 

 1\) Impact in academia, nationally and internationally 

 Good practice guidelines for women in philosophy, informed by Saul’s research \[R6\] and co\-authored by her, were adopted by the British Philosophical Association \(BPA\) and the Society for Women in Philosophy UK \(SWIP\-UK\) in 2013. Previously, there were **no discipline\-wide guidelines for making philosophy more inclusive**. Between 2014 and 2018 these guidelines were adopted by 22 UK departments, 3 departments outside the UK, 13 learned societies & journals, and 5 research projects \[S1\]. Reports to the BPA, collated in the BPA/SWIP\-UK Good Practice Guidelines Impact Report, indicate that substantial changes have occurred, with many reporting changes to hiring policies, event organisation, teaching practices and training provision, including mandatory implicit bias training for selection committee members \[S2\]. As a result, five universities adopting the guidelines increased the number of women hired, six increased the number of women speaking at seminars and conferences, and nine reported a change in workplace culture. Six universities now have more women on their reading lists \[S3\]. Staff reported a palpable culture change as a result of the guidelines noting that *“it is now generally accepted that sexist, racist or other discriminatory comments/behaviours are entirely unacceptable”* and that “ *the outcome is a more inclusive and open culture*” \[S3\]. The guidelines have also been reported \(by chairs of the respective associations\) to have informed similar initiatives by the American Philosophical Association, and the Canadian Philosophical Association \[S3\]. 

 By request, we have run **workshops on implicit bias for professional and academic staff at the** Universities **of Bristol, Nottingham, Cambridge and Manchester.** This has included workshops for both professional staff and academic departments, with a view to changing institutional practices. At Bristol, the initial training for the Department of Philosophy was reported by the department to have “ *literally changed things across the whole Uni, not just our department”* \[S3\]. It has led to staff presentations across the University and a commitment from the University to make changes. At Nottingham, changes were reported in hiring practices and to research seminars, leading to a consistently better gender balance in these areas \[S3\]. The training for the University of Cambridge was recorded and is available for staff at Cambridge for future training purposes. 

 2\) Impact on the justice system, legal firms, and professional organisations 

 Holroyd’s work on implicit racial bias and institutional racism, indicating that it must be understood and dealt with structurally \[R2\], was incorporated into training sessions for the judiciary in England and Scotland \(sessions ran from Sept 2015\-Oct 2018\). Training directly reached c.300 individuals and was recorded and made available to all judges in training. Individuals reported that their understanding of implicit bias had increased \(95%\) and that these sessions helped them to think about the ways of combating bias \(92%\) \[S4, S5\]. Structural changes have also been implemented as a result of this training. Implicit bias training workshops are now included as standard in judicial training, with the focus on structural rather than individual change, and the ‘equal treatment benchmark’ \(a guide for judges\) has been rewritten to include information about implicit biases, based on the training \[S4, S5\]. Follow up interviews with the coordinator of training for the judges indicate that “ *there’s definitely been a climate shift towards the understanding of the importance of implicit bias’ and that judges now ‘attempt to employ mitigation strategies \- to help deal with implicit biases*” \[S4, S5\]. 

 Training has also been provided for legal firms Hickman & Rose and Vinson & Elkins; and for the annual conference of the Association of Occupational Physicians \[S2, S3\]. These sessions have resulted in changes to institutional practice: for example, training staff at Hickman & Rose confirmed that following the session from Holroyd, changes were made including trialling anonymous recruitment, to avoid biases in the hiring process \[S4 \- impact on the judiciary report\]. 

 3\) Impact on the Cabinet Office 

 A workshop led by Saul at the Cabinet Office in 2018 led to them commissioning Saul, Holroyd, Stafford and Scaife \(‘the Sheffield team’\) to make recommendations on wider Cabinet Office policy and practice. They worked with the Government Security Group on diversity and inclusion, since that group had particular concerns about inclusion \(with few women working in security, and BAME employees underrepresented\). At the start of this work \(Jan 2018\) the Cabinet Office had little data and few processes for analysing data which would enable them to understand the potential obstacles to diversity and inclusion. Work by the Sheffield team provided them with this data and analysis to inform vetting and recruitment processes, unconscious bias training and their diversity and inclusion strategy. 

 Based on Saul and Holroyd’s approaches to implicit bias and institutional change \[R4, R5, R6\], their research and recommendations have impacted practice and policy in the following ways \[S6, S7\]: 

-  Changes to the information provided about the vetting process \(which was found, in their commissioned research, to deter people from certain groups from applying\). 

-  Changes to how jobs are advertised. 

-  The development of a Diversity and Inclusion strategy. This strategy includes: 

  -  mechanisms to gather data about employees and the working environment, and a new role to gather, analyse data, and revise policy; 

  -  adoption of targets for recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups; 

  -  establishing an outreach program, to recruit from underrepresented groups; 

  -  introduction of guidelines for inclusive meetings; 

-  Development of a recruitment tool kit, including role profiles, selection methods, positive action campaign advice, and information about implicit bias. 

 4\) More effective training 

 ‘Train the trainer’ workshops have been designed by Holroyd and Saul to train workshop leaders to lead implicit bias training focused on structural change within their own organisations. It enables Holroyd and Saul to step back from the process whilst their work reaches more people, and makes the programme more sustainable in the long term. So far, 25 trainers have taken part in this training. 87.5% of participants reported that the workshop had helped them to reflect on and change their practice \[S7, S8\]. All those surveyed reported that they would use the materials provided in their own settings. Follow\-up evaluation indicates that participants are using ideas on structural change provided in the workshop to inform their own workshops. A participant who provides training for the University of Leeds reports: “ *\[I now place\] less focus on individual psychologies and more on IB as a collective phenomenon*” and “\[ *I place\] more emphasis on structural responses*” \[S7, S8\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \(CBT\) for people at high risk of developing first episode psychosis was established through research conducted at the University of Manchester \(UoM\). As a result, it is now possible to deliver an effective treatment to prevent psychosis, which is important since psychosis can cause significant personal, familial, societal and financial costs. This treatment approach was subsequently adopted in the UK in national treatment guidance for children and young people \(NICE, 2013\), as well as adults \(NICE, 2014\), and across the UK’s network of 153 Early Intervention for Psychosis services \(2016\). Consequently, approximately 1,200 cases of psychosis will have been prevented in England alone. It is also being utilised internationally, and delivered at specialist sites across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 **Approximately one in 100 people worldwide have experienced a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. During 2004/5 in the UK, direct costs to the NHS were estimated at GBP**2,000,000,000, with indirect costs to society approaching GBP4,700,000,000. No evidence\-based treatments for prevention of psychosis were available prior to the trials conducted at UoM, and no other evidence\-based treatments have been developed since. 

 The aim of this research was to develop a psychological approach to the prevention of psychosis. Morrison and colleagues conducted a world\-first clinical trial, which demonstrated that **CBT alone seemed to prevent or delay the development of first episode psychosis, compared to regular monitoring \[1\] and this benefit was maintained at three\-year follow\-up \[2\].** 

 **Working with a sample of people at high risk of psychosis, this trial’s delivery of the CBT model developed at UoM \[3\] marked a new and significant step\-change in clinical understanding and treatment of emerging psychosis. This subsequently led to the development of the world’s largest clinical trial of a psychological intervention to prevent psychosis, based at UoM \[4\].** Two additional clinical trials conducted in Canada and the Netherlands replicated this research, using the same treatment protocol. 

 **Morrison and colleagues’ foundational work in the development of these trials, along with three others conducted internationally, informed the development of**  [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/) guidelines for treatment of **people at risk of developing psychosis, with their meta\-analysis suggesting that CBT could halve the risk of developing psychosis \[5\]. These guidelines have subsequently recommended CBT as the first\-line treatment to prevent or delay the onset of psychosis \(NICE, Guidelines CG155 and CG178, 2013, 2016\).** Without the clinical trials conducted by this UoM research group, and the adoption of their treatment manual by other international researchers and clinical services, these NICE recommendations would not have been made.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Pathways to impact 

 Following publication in high profile journals \[1, 2\], Morrison’s research on psychotherapy to prevent psychosis for people with ‘at risk mental states’ \(ARMS\) was presented internationally at leading conferences and disseminated nationally through presentation and teaching to established networks of academic and clinical specialists involved in treatment for psychosis. With the development of the first NICE guideline for the treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people, Morrison’s trial evidence was instrumental in informing national and international guidance for the treatment of people at high risk of psychosis \(ARMS\). This guidance was subsequently implemented in the UK as a standard across relevant specialist NHS services. In the UK especially, training for the majority of staff delivering this NICE\-recommended treatment is also directly informed by teaching resources that are based on the Morrison model, including the treatment manual \[3\]. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  Impact on policy and clinical practice 

 Evidence from Morrison’s clinical trials, and others using their treatment protocol, led to the NICE guideline recommendation for CBT for ARMS. As a direct consequence of this recommendation, the Access and Waiting Time Standard \[A\] for Early Intervention in Psychosis services \(EIP\) was introduced, which includes a requirement that at least 50 per cent of people identified as being at high risk of psychosis are required to be offered, within two weeks of referral, NICE concordant CBT for ARMS to reduce their risk of psychosis. This level of dissemination has undoubtedly led to a major improvement in the clinical practice offered to this patient group: 

 *“The work that’s been done by Tony \(*Morrison\) *and colleagues around using CBT for prevention of psychosis is possibly some of the most important work that’s been done in the area of psychosis and schizophrenia since the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950’s.”*  National Clinical Director for Mental Health \[B\]. 

 *“The research work from Morrison et al. at the University of Manchester, particularly the EDIE* \(Early detection and intervention evaluation\) *trials of CBT intervention \(1\) for young people at high risk of psychosis have been both influential and impactful, influencing thinking and practice in the UK in relation to early detection of and appropriate interventions with people identified as at high risk of making a transition to psychosis.”* National Clinical Advisor to the National Clinical Audit of Psychosis \[C\]. 

###  Impact on young people at risk of psychosis 

 The primary beneficiaries of this approach are young people with ARMS \(approximately 20,000 new cases each year in the UK\), along with their families. A conservative estimate of the direct impact of this work can be seen in recent NHS audit data \[D\], \[E\]. Across the UK during the year 2018/19 CBT was available to 1,243 at risk individuals, and a further 1,170 individuals with suspected psychosis. Extrapolating this data to the full implementation period suggests that up to 6,000 individuals with ARMS, and up to 6,000 with suspected psychosis, could have been helped directly in the UK alone. Given the evidence for the efficacy of this treatment \(i.e. reducing risk of transition to psychosis by 50%\), and the relative rate of transition among at risk cases \(20%\), approximately 1,200 cases of psychosis will have been prevented. 

###  Impact on education and training 

 Treatment manuals and associated training packages have been delivered nationally and internationally. The primary NICE\-concordant treatment for individuals identified as at risk of psychosis is CBT \[F\] and the majority of this formal teaching of CBT is the Morrison model: 

 *“The manual that they’ve written is the primary manual in terms of what to do psychologically with people with ARMS. One of the things we’ve been doing nationally is trying to ensure that people with ARMS get access to CBT, and it’s the work of Morrison and French that people look at in terms of what they should be doing.”* National Advisor for Severe Mental Illness for the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme \[G\]. 

###  International reach 

 This treatment model has also been utilised by clinicians internationally, with multiple trial replications, clinical services established, and local treatment manual translations across specialist sites in Europe, North America, and Asia: 

 *“The studies that Tony \(*Morrison\) *and his team have been leading, the first studies really showing that there must be room to consider the fact that for some people psychological interventions are enough, and may be preferred, have had a big influence on how people think about these type of problems, especially new generations of clinicians. It’s not just an approach that will have a short\-term impact but is very much a reform of how things are done, and the impact is international.”* President of the International Early Intervention in Mental Health Association \(IEPA\) \[H\]. 

 **Use of CBT to prevent psychosis in people at high risk is also recommended in the European Psychiatry Association’s guidelines \[I\] and the** Australian Clinical Guidelines for Early Psychosis **\(p.7, section 3.1.2\), which state that** “ *the individual and their relatives should be assessed and mental state and safety monitored regularly \(every 2 \- 4 weeks\) in a context of ongoing support. CBT is the preferred intervention*” **\[J\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bournemouth University \(BU\) research enabled the creation of Sea Hero Quest \(SHQ\), a mobile gaming app that encourages users to navigate complex virtual seascapes. In the process, they provide data on their own wayfinding ability and learn how it is affected by typical/atypical ageing. One of the most successful citizen science projects ever, SHQ reached more than 4,300,000 users in 194 countries, and: 

-  established the value of BU laboratory research in the real world; 

-  raised awareness of spatial disorientation in atypical ageing and the importance of research in overcoming it; 

-  triggered diagnostic innovation; 

-  provided new commercial domains for gaming developers.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 BU’s Wayfinding Lab is developing a deep understanding of how ageing, both typical and atypical, affects the cognitive processes involved in spatial navigation. We are using this knowledge in part to develop empirically\- based guidelines designed to minimise spatial disorientation in people with dementia. The work has been funded by an ESRC grant of GBP170174 \(‘Dementia Friendly Architecture’\) to Wiener. 

 Research in the Wayfinding Lab uses different methodologies to analyse changes in spatial knowledge and awareness with ageing. From the beginning, we employed three\-dimensional virtual environments to pinpoint how age affects participants’ use of cues as they learn to navigate through complex spaces. For example, we found age\-related deficits in allocentric processing led to shifts in preferred navigation strategies. Older adults showed an unexpected \- and suboptimal \- shift towards using response\-based strategies, and a specific preference for beacon\-seeking \[R1\]. 

 We have further enriched our knowledge of behavioural performance at routing choice points, using eye\-movement analysis and computational modelling to gain a more detailed understanding of wayfinding strategies \[R2\]. Subsequently, we have shown retrospective route\-related recall is also age\-sensitive. We trained young and older participants to a route learning criterion, then \- away from the simulated environment \- tested memory for landmarks, turn sequences, and route identification based on two\-dimensional cues. Older adults showed differentially poorer performance on the latter two tests \[R3\]. 

 More recently, we have focused on individual differences in the performance of older adults, showing that higher verbal and episodic memory abilities were strongly associated with better maintained route learning skills \[R4\]. We have supplemented this detailed quantitative account by conducting qualitative interviews with older adults living in retirement accommodation. These are designed to capture how memory problems affect their experience of wayfinding \[R5\]. Their accounts confirmed the difficulties revealed in laboratory studies and underlined the importance of effective landmark design in reducing difficulties associated with ageing. 

 Laboratory and applied research conducted in the BU Wayfinding group is necessarily limited in terms of external validity because it relies on sampling from relatively small and localised populations. Fortunately, a prestigious team of researchers, including Professor Wiener, came together in 2015 to overcome this constraint on generality. The result was an international project, supported by Deutsche Telephone and Alzheimer’s Research UK, to identify the determinants of navigation ability in the global population. 

 This was achieved through the design of a mobile phone app, Sea Hero Quest \(SHQ\) \[R6\]. SHQ comprises a three\-dimensional, multi\-level game in which users navigate a boat through increasingly complex environments, gaining credits for completing wayfinding tasks. These tasks provide data on the processes that underly spatial navigation. The app also gathers demographic data, allowing researchers to construct a detailed picture of how wayfinding ability is distributed across gender, age, and nationality. 

 Wiener’s expertise in the design of navigation tasks, environments, and experimental levels meant that he played a key role in the research team, ensuring SHQ could track age\-related changes in navigational abilities.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sea Hero Quest \(SHQ\) has been, at heart, a citizen science project, designed to achieve three interdependent goals: 

-  First, it aimed to gain massive quantities of data on how spatial navigation abilities varied with critical demographic factors, thus establishing the external validity of existing research on wayfinding and ageing. 

-  Secondly, it aimed to immediately raise awareness of the problem of spatial disorientation associated with dementia, and highlight the importance of research in overcoming the disabilities associated with it. 

-  Third, in the longer term, it aimed to impact on the wellbeing of people with dementia. 

 These goals could only be achieved by involving the global public, by creating an engaging data\-gathering platform that also conveyed persuasive messages about dementia research and participants’ contribution to it. SHQ is the tool we developed to achieve these aims \(Figure 1\). 

  

 Figure 1: \(A\) Screenshot taken during navigation, highlighting the visual attractiveness of SHQ; \(B\) A map presented before navigation, featuring the order of waypoints to visit; \(C\) Superposition of 1000 trajectories for one level. SHQ requires users to interpret maps, plan and memorize multi\-stop routes, monitor progress along and update route plans, and transform birds\-eye to egocentric perspectives. 

 SHQ is one of the largest “citizen science” projects ever conducted, certainly “the largest dementia study in history” \[E1\], and it has worldwide reach. It has been played by 4,300,000 people, aged 18\-90 years, from 194 countries. In 14 months, 2,500,000 participants downloaded and engaged with the game \- the equivalent of “more than 176 centuries of experimental research in that field” \[E2\]. Of these users, 58% provided detailed demographic data. Analyses in R6 are based on at least 500,000 participants. 

 The unprecedentedly large normative data set, obtained from many diverse nationalities and cultures, is crucial to the longer\-term impact of spatial learning research on understanding dementia. We can now be certain that spatial navigation abilities begin declining from the age of 19, becoming more rapid as ageing continues. This “big data” benchmark is already having a significant impact in geriatric medicine, for example, driving the development of SHQ as a new and sensitive differential diagnostic tool for dementia \[E3\]. 

 SHQ was clearly positively rated by users, with average Apple and Android app store scores of 4.8/5, and 88,694 overwhelmingly positive reviews. To quantify the degree of enhanced cultural understanding of \- and attitudes to \- dementia, we analysed approximately 20,000 comments. The results demonstrate that active collaborative involvement with the research had produced a clear understanding of the link between navigational performance and dementia, and raised public awareness of dementia issues \[E4\]. 

 A Google trends analysis further highlights the widespread public impact of SHQ \[E5\]. It shows a steep increase in searches for “dementia test” coinciding with the release of the app and first results \(Figure 2\). This demonstrates that SHQ’s impact included the triggering of enhanced awareness of diagnostic tools for dementia. 

  

 Figure 2: Google Trends analysis of the relative frequency of the search terms “Alzheimer’s research”, “Sea Hero Quest”, “Dementia Test”. 

 Further evidence of the reach and significance of SHQ in terms of awareness and understanding was provided by media analysts, Proud Robinson. They estimate that, globally, the media value of 2,700 items of SHQ coverage was EUR30,000,000 and, in the UK alone, achieved a total reach of approximately 50,000,000 people \[E6\]. For example, mainstream international tabloid and broadsheet journalists \[E7\] and broadcasters \[E8\] provided extensive coverage. 

 In addition to its impacts on research validity, public awareness, and diagnostic developments, SHQ also had an unexpected but significant commercial impact on the gaming industry. This is marked by the increasing importance of “Games for Good”. GLITCHERS, the company that created the software implementation of SHQ, reports it has greatly enhanced its business. The co\-founder states: “SHQ has been transformative for \[us\] … Its high profile, through widespread media coverage and multiple awards, has opened doors … and given the industry confidence in our abilities to deliver innovative, sector\-leading projects under complex restrictions and through cross\-sector collaborations.” \[E9\] 

 Moreover, other software house representatives see SHQ as “a landmark in citizen science games”, and … “an inspiration for the gaming industry as a whole”. The industry has responded to the success of gaming/research collaborations, “with SHQ as a high\-profile and very influential example … by shift\[ing\] practice towards developing more of these games as policy.” \[E10, E1\] 

 SHQ produced a massive data set that is still being analysed. Once done, the results will inform a new\-generation citizen\-science app.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Globally, landslides kill thousands of people annually and damage critical infrastructure costing billions of pounds. Warnings for vulnerable communities are seldom provided due to the prohibitive costs of traditional monitoring. Research has developed a novel lower cost early warning approach that ‘listens’ for landslides. Three impacts have been produced: **1\)** *Improved public safety and infrastructure protection via affordable and increased landslide knowledge in UK, Italy, and Canada*; **2\)** *enhanced community resilience to landslides in Myanmar and Malaysia*; and **3\)** *the world’s first commercial, acoustic emission slope monitoring system*, developed with a global leading geotechnical instrumentation company. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Affordable landslide early warning solutions are needed globally to protect vulnerable communities and to monitor critical infrastructure. Research undertaken at Loughborough University by Professor Dixon and Dr Smith, funded by three EPSRC grants, a Knowledge Transfer account, and two EPSRC Impact Acceleration Awards \(IAA\), addressed both challenges. We demonstrated that the acoustic emissions \(AE\) \(i.e., high frequency noises\) generated when slopes deform can be detected and interpreted to provide early warning of impending landslides. The owners of critical infrastructure can thus mitigate potential damage and people in harm’s way can be evacuated. 

 Our research established a quantified relationship between AE and displacement rates for deforming slopes. A practical approach was designed, using an *active waveguide* installed in a slope. The guide comprises a steel tube intersecting the failure surface with granular backfill placed to either surround or infill the tube. When the slope starts to fail, straining the active waveguide, AE generated by waveguide deformation is transmitted by the tube to the surface. The AE are then detected and quantified by a sensor that generates and communicates an alarm. Research established that measuring AE can detect landslides before inclinometers, which is the standard approach to monitor slopes. 

 We developed and assessed two AE systems through laboratory experiments and field trials: 1\) since 2010, the Slope ALARMS \(SA\) system was developed to monitor slopes that threaten infrastructure \(i.e., road, rail, properties\), with functionality of remote data access and automatic generation of warnings to decision makers; 2\) since 2016, the Community Slope SAFE \(CSS\) system was developed specifically to provide low\-cost protection to vulnerable communities. Installed and operated as shown in Figure 1, it was designed for low manufacturing cost and to be maintained by the community. CSS delivers a landslide warning directly to the affected community via an audible/visual alarm. 

 The research to create the AE monitoring strategy, SA sensors and undertake field trials of the alarm system, enabled Dixon and Smith to deliver several <ins>world firsts</ins>: 

-  A framework was produced based on 62 laboratory tests \[ **R1**\] and 5 large scale landslide simulations \(accelerating deformations from 3.6 to 360 mm/hr\) \[ **R2**\] to <ins>establish interpretation of AE generated by deform</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>active waveguides and derive landslide velocities</ins>. 


 **Figure 1** 




-  SA sensors were deployed in a moving landslide proving that AE rates can be used to <ins>quantify slope displacement rates continuously and in real\-time</ins>; achieved using analysis of 6 events with 1059 AE/displacement measurements using SA sensors and state\-of\-the\-art inclinometer technology \[ **R3**\]. 

-  Studies of attenuation mechanisms <ins>demonstrated that AE</ins> <ins>could</ins> <ins>propagate tens of metres</ins> <ins>along</ins> <ins>waveguides</ins> \[ **R4**\], proving they can monitor landslides with deep shear surfaces \(e.g., 16 metres \[ **R5**\]\). 

-  An extensive series of field trials <ins>establish</ins><ins>ed</ins> <ins>the efficacy and practicality of the AE monitoring approach</ins>. 21 SA sensors installed at 12 slopes in 4 countries \(UK, Italy, Canada & Austria\) measured AE continuously for 131 years total monitoring \[ **R5**\]. AE rates were proportional to slope displacement rates in all cases. 

 Research on the CSS sensor was designed using knowhow gained from operation of the SA system. Its performance was demonstrated via a series of laboratory simulations employing waveguides with infill to generate AE \[ **R6**\]. A lower cost easier to install driven waveguide was used as it does not require a drilling machine. To test the system, seven CSS sensors were installed at three slopes in Myanmar \(via funder FHI 360\) and Malaysia \(via EPSRC Global Development Funding\), measuring AE continuously for a total of 12 monitoring years. The CSS systems were installed and operated by community groups trained by Dixon and Smith. This research demonstrated comparable performance to the SA system \[ **R6**\] and proved the viability of the community led monitoring approach.

Novelty and world leadership was demonstrated through UK patent GB 2467419, granted May 2011 \[ **S1**\]. Via these **impact pathways**, Dixon and Smith established AE monitoring of landslides as a viable, lower cost, alternative to traditional methods. Since 2014, impacts have been achieved in three areas: 

 **Impact 1: Improved public safety and infrastructure protection via affordable and increased landslide knowledge in UK, Italy and Canada** was achieved by using our novel Slope ALARMS \(SA\) sensors to monitor stability of critical infrastructure \(e.g., flood defences, roads, and properties\), protecting people and delivering improved public service. SA sensors have been selected by infrastructure operators and used at sites with risk of landslides in the UK \(five\), Italy \(two\) and Canada \(one\). In all cases, data from the monitoring systems have been used by engineers and infrastructure owners to understand and manage risks and deliver public safety. Examples include: 

 **a\)** **Flood defence \(UK\)** \- The Environment Agency installed a SA system to monitor stability of a flood embankment on the Humber Estuary that uniquely is threatened by rapid erosion of a deep channel. The embankment protects 144 properties, businesses, and a cement plant. Monitoring was required to help protect the village while a new flood defence was being constructed. Warnings from the sensor were automatically sent to the Flood Incident Duty Officer and integrated into the South Ferriby Site Specific Procedures Manual \[ **S2**\]. 

 “*Monitoring … was a complete success. It was the only affordable continuous monitoring solution with real\-time warning capability that we could find. The significant benefit achieved was having confidence and peace of mind that the embankment was stable and capable of protecting those living and working in South Ferriby. While also knowing that we would receive an early warning if the embankment started to fail so that mitigation measures could be put in place to minimise the risk to residents*.” \[ **S2**\] 

 **b\) Roads and property \(UK\)** \- SA sensors were installed in two unstable slopes in 

 Monmouthshire that threaten local roads and a property, with warnings sent to the Council. 

 “*A key benefit of using Slope ALARMS was that sub\-surface information could be obtained by retro fitting waveguides … hence installation would be rapid and costs would be very low*.” \[ **S3**\] “ *The most significant benefit of the monitoring is that I have been able to reassure the owners, at the site near Skenfrith, about the stability of the slope above their property ….*”, “ *This gives the owners peace of mind*.” \[ **S3**\] 

 **c\) Coastal cliffs \(UK\)** \- Two slopes on the Yorkshire coast, near Filey and in Scarborough, have been monitored using SA sensors to help protect property and people. 

 “*The AE system provides the only continuous measurements of slope deformation behaviour available to us*.” \[ **S4**\] *“…improves the reliability of our understanding of the problem and design recommendations …the scale and resolution of monitoring provided by Slope ALARMS was not previously available at an affordable price*.” \[ **S4**\]. 

 **d\)** **Road tunnels** **\(Italy\)** – Five SA sensors were installed in a rock slope in Northern Italy that threatens the safety of two road tunnels that critically provide access for the local community and the 130,000 annual visitors to the region who rely on the tunnels. 

 *“… the tunnels are the only way of accessing the village to/from the lower part of the valley, where many facilities, such as hospitals and industries, are located*.” \[ **S6**\]. *“…based on our monitoring data, FVG Strade* \[tunnel operator\] *has decided to close the old road tunnel indefinitely due to the risk posed by the rock mass. This decision has been made according to … evidence of the monitoring data. The driving of my way of thinking has been the AE data*.” \[ **S5**\]. *“… our community of 1500 people has benefited from the work that you have done to ensure our safety*” \[ **S6**\]. 

 **e\) Road \(Canada\)** – Working with Thurber Engineering and Queen’s University, Canada, a major road route into Peace River that is threatened by landslides has been monitored using Slope ALARMS to support decision making by Alberta Transportation. 

 **Impact 2: Enhanced community resilience to landslides in Myanmar and Malaysia** was achieved using our CSS early warning approach. Working with not\-for\-profit organisations, FHI 360 and CCERR committee for emergency response, we engaged with local communities to improve understanding and effective use of the CSS system. This delivered improved safety and understanding. In Hakha, the capital of Chin State, we established the first slope monitoring project in Myanmar to protect communities. We trained 20 Landslide Response Volunteer \(LRV\) youths, 60% female, recruited via a radio appeal to install, maintain and operate the CSS system. The LRV in turn acted as trainers for landslide awareness and CSS monitoring for 80\+ people from the community \[ **S7**\]. 

 “*A critical benefit of the work in Hakha has been raising awareness in the community to help improve community resilience to future landslide events*”; “ *I do not think that this would have been achieved without the research, technology and approach provided by LU. A unique impact of this collaboration on landslide monitoring was being able to align engagement of the central government of Myanmar all the way through the state government and CCERR agency to the youth volunteers and ultimately the community*”; “ *In Myanmar, this project has been a catalyst for future landslide monitoring projects and has established the groundwork for government awareness and support*” \[ **S7**\]; “ *We estimate around 15000 – 20000 population in Hakha town benefits from the project*.” \[ **S8**\] 

 A second community application of the CSS landslide monitoring system was delivered in Ampang District, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, working with community group SlopeWatch, Universiti Sains Malaysia, and the government slope agency. Installation, maintenance, and operation of the CSS system was delivered with the community. Two workshops attracting 40\+ participants facilitated increased awareness and understanding of landslide risks, communicated the benefits of monitoring and provided a forum for community engagement with government agencies and politicians. 

 **Impact 3: The world’s first commercial, acoustic emission slope monitoring system, to deliver superior slope monitoring solutions**, has been developed via a licensing agreement between LU and RST Instruments Ltd., a global geotechnical instrumentation company \[ **S9**, **S10**\]. The *Geotechnical Instrumentation News* article generated discussion and resulted in LU entering into an agreement with RST, Canada and UK, in October 2017 for an exclusive world\-wide licence to further develop, manufacture and distribute an AE slope monitoring system. Transfer of IP covered all technical information on Slope ALARMS \[ **R1** to **R5**\] and Community Slope SAFE sensors \[ **R6**\], plus LU associated knowhow on installation and operation of the AE slope monitoring systems. RST are a top five international geotechnical instrumentation specialist. With a global network of 22 distributors, sales result in an annual group turnover of ≈£29 Million \[ **S10**\]. RST produce monitoring systems for applications in mining \(e.g., tailings dams\) and infrastructure \(e.g., slopes\) \[ **S9**\]. Supported by Dixon and Smith, RST developed the world’s first commercial AE sensors, Geo\-Acoustic Aware \(GAA\), for slope monitoring. GAA was marketed globally in 2020 \[ **S9**\]. 

 *“The business case for investing in development of … GAA sensor… was made by discussing the concept of the technology with a number of our high profile clients… The pull through revenue of having this unique product was also taken into account, generating additional sensors and increasing products sales across the board.”* \[ **S10**\] 

 *“RST… have invested considerable time, energy, and finance to develop, test and market the GAA sensor system. …this investment is over £200k and includes the creation of employment, as well as … benefits both within and to our supply chain.”* \[ **S10**\] 

 *“The addition of the product to the RST portfolio has added a unique value proposition… By allowing lower cost reliable measurement of slope stability we can provide a much more comprehensive monitoring solution… for no increase in budget. As no one else has this offering, interest in GAA has opened doors and generated conversations with new clients that otherwise would not have taken place”.* \[ **S10**\] 

 RST report that to November 2020, there has been significant interest in employing GAA from large global mining companies because GAA has been identified as filling a gap in current monitoring options \(e.g., monitoring tailings dams\). In addition, client discussions are on\-going for monitoring rail slopes in Scandinavia and landslides in India, Myanmar, and Indonesia. GAA is being used to monitor slopes by a road authority in China. \[ **S10**\] 

 *“GAA forms an important part of RST’s future strategy.”*  \[ **S10**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hitchmough’s experimental research has pioneered the application of ecological science and environmental psychology to the design and management of urban green infrastructure for more sustainable urban vegetation, biodiversity, and enrichment for people. His collaborations and projects in China have made available hundreds of new species with the resilience to create more sustainable landscapes. These include new woodland demonstration gardens at the 2019 Beijing International Expo and large\-scale gardens in central Beijing; plus the framework strategy for the ecological restoration of a 1,275km<sup>2</sup> Chengdu mountain range as the world’s largest urban forest. This work has increased appreciation of the value of biodiversity leading to changes in landscape approaches in China. His work in Australia has led to the development of novel plant communities – “woody meadows” – used by the City of Melbourne as part of their climate change adaptation plan. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 From 2000, Hitchmough investigated harnessing the most desirable traits of semi\-natural “wild” vegetation \- high species diversity and ability to survive urban conditions without intensive horticultural management \- to test these characteristics in designed plant communities. Hitchmough pioneered the application of rigorous ecological experimentation on these types of urban plant communities. Much of this research has been published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*. 

 The research aimed to produce attractive plant communities and maximise biodiversity, whilst gaining the popular and political support of urban populations for eco\-centric approaches. A range of novel plant communities was conceptualised, and used as ecological models. Standardised protocols were developed, starting at laboratory scale with individual species, moving to multi\-species microcosm experiments \(R1, R2, R3\), then field scale experiments, and finally landscape practice. Environmental psychology research was undertaken in parallel to understand how urban populations viewed this vegetation, from meadows to woodland \(R2\). 

 The initial research examined establishing herbaceous vegetation from seed sown *in situ,* facilitating the creation of large areas of complex vegetation with limited budgets \(R1, R2, R3\). This determined which species that can be successfully and economically established *in situ*, the seedling density of each species to give the desired designed appearance via random broadcast sowing and how competition from weed seedlings could be minimised \(R1, R2\). Subsequent research investigated planted as well as sewn vegetation. The research was supported through collaboration with the RHS \(Royal Horticultural Society\), grants from the Stanley Smith Trust, and PhD studentships. A Marie Curie TOK grant \(2006\-2009, £256K\) with Jelitto Seeds, Germany, provided data on the emergence characteristics of 1,000 species. 

 The research established that it was possible to create successful designed plant communities for urban landscape space \(R1, R2, R3\), and that energy intensive horticultural management involving irrigation and fertilisation was detrimental to community persistence and attractiveness \(R1, R2, R3\). It also proved that designed naturalistic plant communities could be efficiently and sustainably managed, primarily by using more sustainable nature conservation techniques such as cutting \(R2, R3\). Attractiveness to the public was shown to be strongly correlated with the percentage of the vegetation surface area that was covered by coloured flowers/autumnal leaves \(R5\-R6\) and these key findings were applicable to both herbaceous and woody vegetation \(R4\). 

 Key research findings were applied to landscape practice to test how ecological processes at the research plot\-scale worked when transferred to the large\-scale sites such as at the 2012 London Olympic Park.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The 2012 London Olympic Park changed British attitudes toward ecological vegetation in urban areas. Since 2013 Hitchmough has worked to introduce his green infrastructure innovations in China and Australia. 

 China 

 Utilising the worldwide acclaim from the 2012 Olympic Park work, Hitchmough engaged with key stakeholders in China to promote a shift from traditional, development\-led monocultural designs by demonstrating the benefits of biodiverse, ecological design based on his experimental research. Key priorities were to: 

1.  Use Chinese plant communities as models for urban landscapes 

1.  Encourage the identification, cultivation, and commercialisation of indigenous plant species 

1.  Develop understanding of the political, technical, and organisational barriers to implementing an ecological vision in China 

1.  Demonstrate the viability of new sustainable planting design in a Chinese context. 

 This was done through varied collaborations across China, allowing Hitchmough to develop a reputation as an international expert on ecological planting design using native Chinese species. 

 In 2013, Kaixian city contracted Hitchmough to develop sustainable vegetation designs for their city. Kaixian city developed a new research station to investigate the establishment of 200 herbaceous species using Hitchmough’s methodology. Identified species were used to create the first sown perennial meadow vegetation in China **\[S1\]**. Hitchmough’s planting design was then used in major road interchange planting \(3,000m<sup>2</sup>\) in the city **\[S1\].** Hitchmough was subsequently invited to advise on the redevelopment of NanShan mountain ridge \(approximately 100,000m<sup>2</sup>\). The city developed a nursery to grow local native Chinese vegetation to support the project. This nursery was the first in Western China to encourage the use of locally occurring Chinese species. Additionally, from 2014\-15 Hitchmough further developed his expertise in native Chinese plant species through collaboration with Shenyang Jianzu University. Over 100 species new to cultivation were identified and seeds collected to create a new planting palette for designers **\[S2\].** 

 These collaborations positioned Hitchmough as a leading expert in ecological design with Chinese plant species, a political pre\-requisite to be taken seriously by the Chinese government. This, in turn, facilitated his involvement in large\-scale ecological landscape design projects in China. 

 Beijing\-Xiong’an 

 As Visiting Expert to the City of Beijing \(2016\-\), Hitchmough was asked by the Expo Organising Committee to design one of five 1500m<sup>2</sup> permanent “Master Gardens” at the 2019 Beijing International Horticultural Expo. Building on his experimental research, Hitchmough created a sustainable woodland design, mixing native and non\-native species. Hitchmough then worked directly with the Green Garden Group \(Beijing\) to expand their range of species to include those needed for the Expo. This led to the commercial availability of new species that were previously unavailable in China, and which have since been used in further landscape projects **\[S3\]**. 

 The expo was visited by an estimated 16 million visitors. Hitchmough’s research and the garden were featured on peak Chinese National TV ‘CCTV’ \(1.2bn viewers\) **\[S4\],** introducing audiences to biodiverse, sustainable urban plantings and greatly increasing receptivity to these new ideas from those whole experienced them **\[S5\].** 

 This led to a commission to design the first native Woodland Park in China at Lotus Lake \(1ha\) in central Beijing. This biodiverse, native woodland has been used as a model for the green infrastructure of the new urban woodland rings of Beijing: 

 *“James helped us develop a variety of native woodlands, replacing traditional practices with more sustainable design techniques, and successfully applied these concepts to a new urban forest park in Beijing and other projects in the city. We attach great importance to cooperating with him and to help us integrate new ideas into the green space of Beijing”* **\[S6\].** 

 The City of Beijing’s woodland task force of national experts worked with Hitchmough to critique existing policy and practice to promote new types of green infrastructure. They commissioned a demonstration woodland to show how to apply these ideas to create complex, multi\-species, native woodlands that are highly biodiverse, self\-regenerating, and resilient as an alternative to hundreds of km<sup>2</sup> of traditional, short\-term, monoculture forests: 

 *“These areas will involve hundreds of square kilometers of urban forest…These sustainable, low maintenance and naturalized urban forest can benefit the city more than traditional planting style”* **\[S6\]**. 

 Chengdu 

 In 2018 Hitchmough was invited by the city government of Chengdu \(population 16.33 million\) to lead a competition entry \(with LDA Design and Grimshaw Architecture\) to create a vision for the sustainable development of Chengdu’s 1,275km<sup>2</sup> degraded Longquanshan mountain range that is being subsumed in the city. Hitchmough’s team won with a radical strategy to restore indigenous forest vegetation of the mountain and to create woodland corridors from the mountain range into three nearby cities. This is transforming a vast landscape, reintroducing indigenous species to create a sustainable, ecologically\-focused landscape. This new bio\-diverse, incremental development landscape “frame” has now become the official policy of the city of Chengdu. A member of Longquanshan Urban Forest Park Management Committee stated: 

 *“Professor James Hitchmough's team…proposed to restore the local original forest ecosystem by imitating nature...which are beneficial to water, soil conservation, ecological restoration, and the creation of new local economic models…We have begun to integrate these strategies into the overall planning of forest parks…After one year's observation, the model reflects the aesthetic feeling of naturalism, and the maintenance cost is obviously reduced compared with the traditional method”* **\[S7\]**. 

 Australia: Melbourne 

 In 2013 Hitchmough was invited by the City of Melbourne to develop new types of multi\-species drought\-tolerant vegetation as part of their climate change adaptation plan. He proposed using taxonomically diverse communities of post fire re\-sprouting shrubs \(“the woody meadow”\) to create an entirely new, infinitely sustainable urban vegetation, maintained perpetually floral, and optimal for fauna by triennial canopy removal. In collaboration with the University of Melbourne and $100K funding from the City, the designed “woody meadow” planting demonstrations were created in central Melbourne from 2015 **\[S8\]**. “ *The Woody Meadow project in Melbourne is transforming how we consider our native fauna in the urban setting as something that goes beyond a background green, and instead is highly floral and ever\-changing*” **\[S10\]**. 

 This work received widespread recognition for the value of the concept, with nine Australian local and state government agencies signing up to participate in the next pilot phase of the project in practice \(supported by a $800k Australian Research Council Grant in 2020\). In 2019 Hitchmough was also appointed to design biodiverse, drought tolerant, and human wellbeing\-friendly vegetation for the AUD 1.4bn Arts Precinct Project in Central Melbourne \- the most ambitious urban green infrastructure project in the history of Australia **\[S8, S9\].** The start of the project has been delayed due to the pandemic; however, Hitchmough is involved in the developed design stage. Hassel Studio architects state “ *Without his deep, thoughtful and research based planting proposals, the concept would not have held true through the myriad of political twists and turns and remained intact. Once completed the project will be a once in a generational transformation*” **\[S10\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In policing and crime reduction, there is a gap between what is known from research and what is done in practice. Closing this gap can lead to improvements in efficiency and effectiveness whilst also minimising harm and wastage of resources. Research by the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science \(JDI\) has played a major role in the implementation and development of evidence\-based policing and crime reduction. Working closely with policymakers, police services and crime reduction practitioners within the UK and internationally, this research has generated significant global impact through shaping policy and practice and initiating a culture shift towards a more evidence\-based way of working. Changes brought about by JDI research have led directly to demonstrable reductions in crime, including a 24% reduction in crime in West Yorkshire \(UK\), and a 23% reduction in robberies in Montevideo \(Uruguay\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Jill Dando Institute \(JDI\) is a UCL world\-leading department conducting applied research in policing and crime reduction. JDI research takes two forms: \(1\) **generating evidence**, both on the patterns of crime and on the impact of crime reduction interventions, and \(2\) **synthesising and translating evidence,** to inform and improve the decisions of police and crime reduction practitioners and policymakers. Funded by the *Economic and Social Research Council*, *Inter\-American Development Bank* and *UK College of Policing* to a sum of over GBP3,500,000, research has been conducted by Professors Kate Bowers \(UCL 2004\-present\), Shane Johnson \(UCL 2004\-present\), Gloria Laycock \(UCL 2001\-present\) Nick Tilley \(UCL 2008\-present\), and Drs Spencer Chainey \(UCL 2003\-present\), Toby Davies \(UCL 2009\- present\), Aiden Sidebottom \(UCL 2006\-present\) and Lisa Tompson \(UCL 2006\-2020\). 

 **Generating evidence** 

 Over the past twenty years, Bowers, Chainey and Johnson have pioneered **predictive crime mapping** methods, which demonstrate that crime risk spreads in space and time with sufficient regularity to enable prediction, and by extension, more focused and targeted prevention activities. Recent JDI research in this area has advanced methodologically to employ sophisticated mathematics to produce street\-level \(rather than small\-area level\) predictions of space\-time crime concentrations. These predictions are both more accurate \(small\-area level predictions often include low risk street segments; street\-level ones do not\) **\[R1\]** and better aligned with police practice **\[R2\]**. More specifically, while other crime mapping approaches identify hundreds of high\-risk locations dispersed across a given area \(and therefore are impractical to police\), an optimisation algorithm developed through collaborative research between the JDI and **West Yorkshire Police** generates a practical number of micro\-locations better suited for targeted police intervention \(such as police patrols\). Further research has been undertaken internationally, most notably in South America including a five\-year collaboration between the JDI and the **National Police Service of Uruguay** designed to build capacity within Uruguay to undertake detailed crime analysis and improve police effectiveness. This research led to the identification of persistent robbery hot spots in the city of Montevideo, which provided the basis for the development and implementation of the first targeted police patrol programme in Uruguay, which was subsequently evaluated for its impact on crime **\[R3\]**. 

 **Synthesising and translating evidence** 

 Evidence\-based policy and practice is widely advocated both in the UK and internationally. It is generally considered to improve efficiency and effectiveness and reduce harm and wastage of resources. In policing and crime reduction, there is a large volume of research of varying quality that is seldom accessed by practitioners and policy makers. In 2013, the JDI led a 3 year multi\-university project, co\-funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and UK College of Policing in support of the **What Works Centre for Crime Reduction,** itself part of the wider UK What Works Network which together sought to improve the way government and other organisations create, share and use high quality evidence for decision\-making. As part of this research project, Johnson, Tilley and Bowers developed **EMMIE** **\[R4\]**, a framework denoting five categories of evidence that are important to inform policy and practice decision\-making: **E**ffects \(What is known so far about the net effects of the intervention?\); **M**echanisms \(What is known so far about how the intervention’s positive and negative effects are brought about?\); **M**oderators \(What is known so far about the contextual conditions necessary for the activation of mechanisms producing positive and negative effects?\); **I**mplementation \(What is known so far about the practicality of introducing and operating the intervention?\); and **E**conomics \(What is known so far about the costs, cost effectiveness and cost\-benefit outcomes of the intervention?\). EMMIE provided the framework for a series of significant and wide\-reaching research activities which included the systematic identification, appraisal and translation of systematic review evidence in crime reduction \(n = 70\) **\[R5\]**, as well as the production of 12 original systematic reviews of crime reduction interventions **\[R6\]**. Taken together, these two research exercises led to the development in 2015 of the **Crime Reduction Toolkit**, a free online resource hosted by the College of Policing, which summarises both the quality and coverage of the best available research evidence in crime reduction. Chainey has taken this research forward in Latin America with the creation of similar online tools in the Spanish and Portuguese languages.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Working directly with governments, industry and police services both in the UK and internationally, the research of the JDI has delivered significant impact and lasting change in policing and crime reduction. The nature of the impact is organised below into two broad themes: \(1\) initiating a shift towards evidence\-based policy and practice, and \(2\) facilitating reductions in crime. 

 **Initiating a shift towards evidence\-based policy and practice** 

 The Crime Reduction Toolkit, developed as a product of JDI research, was established by the College of Policing in 2015 to address the evidence\-needs of decision\-makers with policing and crime reduction responsibilities. It is an interactive and universally accessible online resource which covers a wide range of crime reduction interventions, including victim offender mediation, mental health courts and criminal sanctions to prevent domestic violence and drink driving \(with over 60 interventions listed in 2020\). The Toolkit summarises in practical terms the best available evidence on what works to reduce crime, how, in what circumstances and at what cost. It is organised around the **EMMIE** framework **\[R4\]** and is populated with information derived from the JDI’s appraisal of 70 systematic reviews in crime reduction **\[R5\]**. In an example of its use in practice, the Toolkit was applied by **West Midlands Police in 2015,** who used evidence on the effective use of sobriety checkpoints \(from within the Toolkit\) to design and target the placement of checkpoints in their area in an effort to reduce drink driving during the Christmas period **\(S1\)**. 

 Between its launch in April 2015 and June 2020, the Crime Reduction Toolkit received over 420,000 hits from policing and crime reduction practitioners, policymakers and researchers in more than 75 countries \(including those in the Global South\) spanning 6 continents **\(S2\)**. The Crime Reduction Toolkit has been the recipient of, or shortlisted, for several important awards. This includes a prestigious Best Practice certificate in the **New solutions to complex challenges – European or national level** category at the **European Public Sector Awards 2017**, being described as “ *a truly innovative project … providing easy access to the best available research evidence on … interventions to reduce crime. The project is highly relevant and gives answers to problematic questions in many countries”* **\(S3\)**. The Crime Reduction Toolkit was shortlisted in 2020 in the **Best Use of Digital in the Public Sector** category in the **Digital Impact Awards** \(receiving the silver prize in 2021\) **\(S4\)**. 

 Beyond the Crime Reduction Toolkit, the EMMIE model developed by Johnson, Tilley and Bowers has effected significant change in the practices of a wide range of organisations both within the UK and internationally. In the UK, the **Office of the** **Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner** now uses EMMIE as the framework through which funding bids \(in the region of GBP600,000 annually\) are assessed for rigour and completeness. As a senior partnership analyst for Lancashire Constabulary indicated, “ *By using your research \[on EMMIE\] we have adapted the \[grant agreement\] forms to provide the right information….This is a first step towards an improved evidence\-based policing approach and hopefully will help us better understand ‘what works’ across numerous projects that are encouraged by OPCC \[Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner\] funding”* **\(S5\)**. EMMIE is also used by the **Department of Justice in Ireland** as the framework for the collection, appraisal and presentation of evidence concerning youth justice in Ireland, who note that “ *we are using the EMMIE protocol to inform evidence informed change in the youth justice practice domain ….The Garda Youth Diversion Project Programme, the focus of our reform efforts involves €18 million taxpayer investment each year in over one hundred local targeted projects for young people across Ireland* ” **\(S6\)**. 

 The influence and use of EMMIE extends beyond the criminal justice sector. For example, the **UK What Works Centre for Children's Social Care**, established in 2017 with the intention of fostering and facilitating evidence\-based practice across the children’s social care sector, selected EMMIE as their chosen evidence appraisal framework over those used by other more established What Works Centres. EMMIE aligns with the vision of the **What Works Centre for Children's Social Care**, and provides a framework with which to “ *produce evidence that children’s social care professionals find useful, and that includes exploring why services make a difference and how to implement them in practice”* **\(S7\)**. 

 **Facilitating reductions in crime** 

 JDI research on crime analysis and predictive policing has had a direct and measurable effect on police practice and crime both in the UK and internationally. For example, building on prior research **\[R1/R2\]**, and in collaboration with the JDI, West Yorkshire Police has introduced a new approach to the deployment of police patrols based on innovative research by Bowers, Davies and Johnson using the ideas and techniques from the mathematical field of graph theory. This approach has been rolled out across the West Yorkshire Police Force area – the fourth largest police force in England and Wales in terms of officer numbers, covering an area just over 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> and a population of around 2,000,000 – via an app \(Patrolwise\), and has been credited by Jayne Sykes, Interim Chief Executive of the **Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire,**  with producing a culture change within the force regarding their adoption of and attitudes towards technology in the service of policing. She writes that “ *adoption of Patrolwise has significantly impacted cultural change within West Yorkshire Police to one that is more likely to draw on the value of evidence based predictive analytics and the role of technology in order to realise both efficiencies and more effective outcomes for our communities*” **\(S8\)**. Importantly, West Yorkshire Police reports that the use of the new approach has led to a **24% reduction in crime** across the police force area – in relation to burglary specifically, this equates to over 800 fewer victims annually. 

 The impact of JDI research extends globally. Researchers at Radford University **\(S9\)** have conducted the only independent randomized controlled trial evaluating the adoption of an approach based on JDI work in Port St. Lucie, Florida. This was shown to produce even larger reductions in crime **\(up to 79%\)** in treatment areas during intervention, with no evidence of crime displacement. In Uruguay, an extended research collaboration between Chainey and the **National Police Service of Uruguay** gave rise in 2016 to **PADO**, the first hot spot policing programme implemented in Latin America. Using a quasi\-experimental evaluation design, it has been shown that **robberies reduced by 23%** in the treatment areas where PADO was implemented \(equating to a reduction of over 1,000 robberies\), with no evidence of crime displacement to control areas. Reflecting on these impacts, the Principal Citizen Security Specialist at the **Inter\-American Development Bank** \(IDB\) who funded this work, describes “ *the transformational impact \[the\] research has made to the field of evidence\-based policing in Uruguay”* citing Chainey’s work as “ *a prime example of what all academic studies should aspire for, helping to move forward both the fields of research and practice at the same time. Not only has it made PADO more sustainable and effective, but it also proved that hot spot policing is a relevant strategy in Latin America.* *At the IDB we have been using this finding… to expand hot spot policing across the Latin America region”* **\(S10\)**. ** 

 PADO has subsequently inspired the development and implementation of hot spot policing projects in over 30 cities in Argentina, six cities in Mexico and six cities in Brazil. Research by Chainey **\[R3\]** indicates that the initial hot spot pilot programme implemented across four cities in Argentina \(La Plata, Morón, Tres de Febrero, and Santa Fe with a combined population of over 2,000,000\) produced a statistically significant **14% reduction in robberies and thefts** in treatment areas compared to control areas, with no evidence of crime displacement. Moreover, the impact of this research goes beyond only reductions in crime. As indicated by a representative of the **Ministry of Security in Buenos Aires**, the successes of the hot spot policing trial “ *were instrumental in the changes implemented on May 2020 by the Ministry of Security’s Resolution 341/201 which put forward the creation of a criminal analysis department and a fundamental change in Police operations revamping of the prevention structure…\[and\]  Hot Spot Policing is now being taught at the Leadership and Strategic Command Course*” **\(S11\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our empirical research on defendants’, witnesses’ and victims’ experiences of the Crown Court identified causes of frustration, anxiety and distress, and factors impeding court users’ effective participation in proceedings. Subsequent projects were commissioned by the legal regulators to examine the quality of advocacy in the criminal courts. Together our court studies have stimulated debate, analysis and campaigns on the part of justice reform NGOs. They have also informed policy and regulatory changes; and the development of practitioner guidance and training, aimed at enhancing efficiency of court proceedings, supporting court users’ effective participation, and improving legal representation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 From 2011\-14, we undertook ESRC\-funded research on defendants’, witnesses’ and victims’ experiences of the Crown Court. Through qualitative interviews and court observations, the study explored the essential features of the Crown Court process, as experienced by court users, and the interplay between the different players in the courtroom. 

 As we describe in the book *Inside Crown Court* *\(i\)* and associated publications *Out of the Shadows* *\(ii\)* and *Structured Mayhem* *\(iii\),* the study identified multiple distressing, stressful and perplexing aspects of the Crown Court experience for defendants, witnesses and victims alike. For many court users, a great deal is at stake when they attend court; and the court environment often feels alienating and daunting. Court processes are complex, ritualised and elaborate, while also chaotic and inefficient. Nevertheless, most court users appear to have an implicit belief in the legitimacy of the court process. 

 On the basis of our expertise in courts research, in 2014\-15 we were commissioned by legal regulators the Bar Standards Board \(BSB\) and Chartered Institute of Legal Executives \(CILEx\) to review the quality of criminal advocacy in the Youth Court and in Crown Court cases involving young defendants. This research which aimed to inform potential regulatory interventions for improving the quality of youth advocacy had various elements including a survey and interviews with advocates and young defendants, and court observations. 

 As reported in the *Youth Proceedings Advocacy Review* \(YPAR\) *\(iv\),* we found wide variability in the quality of youth advocacy. Effective advocacy was found to be dependent on advocates’ specialist knowledge of youth justice law; their capacity to communicate effectively and build relationships with young defendants; and professionalism. Factors identified as barriers to advocates’ development of these attributes and skills included lack of training and limited opportunities to learn from peers’ practice. 

 Following the successful completion of YPAR *\(iv\),* in 2017 we were again commissioned by the BSB, this time in conjunction with the Solicitors Regulation Authority, to interview judges about their perceptions of advocacy in the Crown Court; more specifically, to explore judges’ definitions of ‘good’ advocacy and views on the extent of good or poor practice in their courts. Our research aimed to support the regulators’ efforts to improve the quality of criminal advocacy, including by identifying issues of regulatory concern that might require further investigation. 

 Our resulting publication *Judicial Perceptions of the Quality of Criminal Advocacy* *\(v\)* presents a mixed picture of standards of advocacy which emerged from our judicial interviews. While the interviewees deemed most advocates to be competent or adequate, overall standards were largely perceived to be declining. However, advocates were praised for their growing skilfulness and sensitivity in handling vulnerable court users. 

 The studies outlined above form part of an ongoing programme of courts research which is bringing into ever clearer focus the multiple facets to the legal principle of ‘effective participation’ in court proceedings, and the critical part this plays in achieving access to justice. We continue to explore these themes through research extending to non\-criminal parts of the justice system: namely, tribunals and the Family Court \(in recent Nuffield\-funded research\) and the coroners’ courts \(in a forthcoming ESRC study\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 We engaged with judicial, statutory, regulatory and non\-governmental bodies throughout the period we conducted our research, and since, for the purpose of stimulating and informing policy, procedural and practice reform. Key impacts thereby achieved are detailed below. 

 **4.1 Impact on the Leveson Review of Efficiency in Criminal Proceedings \(2015\)** 

 Jacobson was consulted as part of Leveson’s *Review of Efficiency in Court Proceedings* \(2015\) for the Lord Chief Justice. Leveson’s review cited evidence from *Out of the Shadows* *\(ii\)* about the stress caused to court users arising from delays to hearings and associated uncertainties. Leveson incorporated one of our recommendations into his recommendation 30 to improve scheduling of hearings \[ *Sources to corroborate the impact:1a*\]. The Government in March 2015 responded by accepting all Leveson’s recommendations in principle \[ *Sources:1b*\]. 

 **4.2 Impact on judicial training** 

 Judges are trained by their peers at the Judicial College. *Inside Crown Court* *\(i\)* is used in Judicial College training by two course leaders \[redacted\]. They also ensured *Structured Mayhem \(iii\)* was added to the College’s learning management system, and arranged for Jacobson to deliver a lecture on her research to around 50 judges at a Judicial College training course on case and trial management in December 2018 \[ *Sources:2a,2b*\]. Approvingly quoting a fellow judge who described it as \[redacted\] advised that the book has influenced training \[redacted\] specifically with reference to what it reveals about judicial interactions with court users \[ *Sources:2c*\]. \[redacted\] has repeatedly encouraged attendees at the Judicial College to read the *Inside Crown Court*.  \[redacted\] The Foreword to the book’s paperback edition, issued in 2016, \[redacted\] says it ‘ *makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of this critical component of the criminal justice system, and provides a great deal of food for thought for all with a professional or general interest in the subject*.' \[ *Sources:2d*\]. 

 **4.3 Impact on advocacy: enhancing training and standards** 

 The Bar Standards Board accepted *all* the recommendations in our Youth Proceedings Advocacy Review, committing not only to taking regulatory action to improve youth advocacy, but also ‘ *to work with other agencies … to address the systemic issues that the report identifies’* \[ *Sources:3a*\] 

 One example of this was the BSB’s work with the Ministry of Justice in relation to the Taylor *Review of Youth Justice,* the object of which was to consider possible reforms to the youth justice system. The BSB met several times with the Ministry of Justice and Charlie Taylor \[ *Sources:3b*\] and when the Taylor review was published in 2016 the BSB noted ‘ *The recommendations that the report makes in this regard chime with our own work in this area, following the publication of research we commissioned in November 2015*’ \[i.e. YPAR *\(iv\)*\] \[Sources:3c\]. Specifically, YPAR findings informed the Taylor recommendation 22 for mandatory training for all lawyers appearing in the Youth Court \[ *Sources:3d*\]. The Government’s response to the Taylor review confirmed that it shared Taylor’s concerns about legal representation in the youth court and welcomed the actions of both the BSB and SRA to improve such training; and advised it would consider if further measures were necessary \[ *Sources:3d*\]. 

 The BSB fulfilled its commitment to take regulatory action in light of YPAR’s findings by developing the *Youth Proceedings Competences* \(2017\). These detail what is required of barristers working with young defendants and highlight the importance of specialist training. *YPAR \(iv\)* is described as ‘ *the baseline for the competences’* and recommended ‘ *as a further point of reference when engaging with the competences’* \[ *Sources:4a*\]. Rule s59.6 of the BSB Handbook now requires barristers to register their competence to undertake youth advocacy; and advises that the BSB may refuse to issue a practising certificate if the required declarations are not made \[ *Sources:4b*\]. 

 The Solicitors Regulation Authority issued a consultation *Assuring Advocacy Standard* in August 2019 which cited findings of *Judicial Perceptions of the Quality of Criminal Advocacy* *\(v\)* amongst the ‘Evidence of standards falling short’ which motivated the review \[ *Sources:5a*\]. In its response to the consultation, and reflecting a key finding of *Judicial Perceptions \(v\)*, the SRA committed to working with the judiciary to support reporting of poor advocacy \[ *Sources:5b*\]. 

 The SRA consultation also encompassed a review of youth practitioners’ training needs: citing *YPAR*’s finding ‘ *that advocates were lacking in training in specialist procedures and sentencing powers in the youth courts’*, and the associated Taylor Review proposal for mandatory training for youth court advocacy \[ *Sources:3d*\]. In its consultation response, the SRA identified a number of measures for enhancing youth advocacy standards, including the monitoring of training records of solicitors practising in the Youth Court \[ *Sources:5b*\]. 

 **4.4 Informing the activities of NGOs** 

 A number of NGOs have used our courts research to inform policy and practice development, and have built on this research, often in collaboration with us, to advance and promote their law reform agendas. 

 *Out of the Shadows* \(ii\) was the outcome of collaboration with charity **Victim Support,** who published the report in 2013. As stated on their website, Victim Support use their reports to ‘ *make a strong evidence\-based case for particular public policy stances’*. By highlighting the challenges associated with giving evidence at court, this report has furthered Victim Support’s work to support crime victims and witnesses and campaign for improved provision. 

 The **Criminal Justice Alliance** – a coalition of 160 organisations working together and campaigning to create a fairer, more effective criminal justice system – approached us with a request to publish key findings from our Crown Court research, in what became *Structured Mayhem* \(iii\). Their motivation in publishing the research was that it addressed a number of themes the organisation had focused on in the past \[ *Sources:6a*\]. 

 Our research, including *Structured Mayhem* *\(iii\)* and *YPAR \(iv\)*, is cited in multiple outputs from research and development NGO the **Centre for Justice Innovation**, including their written evidence to the 2019 Justice Select Committee inquiry on *Court and Tribunal reform* \[ *Sources: 6b*\]. \[redacted\] describes the research as \[redacted\]. He mentions specifically that the research underpins dialogue he and others have had with the courts service regarding court reforms \[ *Sources:6c*\]. 

 Jacobson and Kirby made a significant contribution to the work of **JUSTICE** – the all\-party law reform organisation – both through *Inside Crown Court* *\(i\)* and more directly as members of a JUSTICE working party established to identify ways of enhancing court users’ participation. This working party’s report *Understanding Courts* \(2019\) describes *Inside Crown Court \(i\)* as the ‘starting point’ of its work, citing the book extensively throughout \[ *Sources:6d*\]. *Understanding Courts* presents wide\-ranging policy and practice\-focused recommendations, and has informed JUSTICE’s submissions to consultations and inquiries. These include the Civil Justice Council consultation on *Vulnerable Witnesses and Parties within Civil Proceedings* \(2019\), several recommendations of which are said by JUSTICE to ‘mirror’ those of *Understanding Courts* \[ *Sources:6e*\] and which directly references *Understanding Courts* to support the claim that many “ *vulnerable court users within civil proceedings … would benefit from assistance or protection”* \[ *Sources:6e*\]. 

 Our collaborations with NGOs have continued through and beyond the current REF period, and have included work as research partner on two separate projects with NGOs. The first, with the **Centre for Justice Innovation,** was a Nuffield\-funded study of problem\-solving approaches in the Youth Court, which in late 2020 is already \[redacted\].The second, with charity **Just for Kids Law** and funded by the Dawes Trust **,** will consider the need for interventions to improve the quality of representation and advocacy by criminal solicitors in youth proceedings, building on the work of *YPAR* *\(iv\).* 

 **4.5 Impact on the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee \(2015\) including production of materials for lay court users** 

 *Structured Mayhem* *\(iii\)* was the basis of a presentation in 2015 by Jacobson to the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee, chaired by the Lord Chief Justice and responsible for the rules governing the management of criminal cases \[ *Sources:7a*\]. \[redacted\] was particularly keen to consider recommendations to amend the Criminal Procedure Rules to reflect concerns raised in S *tructured Mayhem \(iii\)*; for example whether changes should be made to the time limits which apply when making applications for special measures \[ *Sources:7b*\]. 

 \[redacted\] later cited *Structured Mayhem \(iii\)* as demonstrating the need for more accessible written materials for court users. Addressing concerns identified in *Structured Mayhem* about the complexity of legal language, the Committee, in tandem with Ministry of Justice\-based consultative group the Defendant Voice Engagement Panel \(of which Jacobson is a member\), produced ‘easy\-read’ forms for lay people attending the criminal courts.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSE research among Acholi people in northern Uganda, during and after the conflict with the Lord’s Resistance Army, has made significant contributions to understanding justice and security issues, direct benefitting the International Criminal Court. The researchers’ expert testimony has aided the successful prosecution of Dominic Ongwen, helped to protect the welfare of witnesses, and contributed to an important judicial precedent for the prosecution of sexual crimes. The research has also highlighted the importance of ongoing monitoring and long\-term support for people returning or recovering from war. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2003, Jan Egeland, then Under\-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator of the United Nations, described the northern Uganda situation as a “moral outrage”. He was referring to consequences of the war between the Uganda government and the Lord’s Resistance Army \(LRA\). From 2004, this became the focus of the International Criminal Court’s historic first significant case, and warrants were issued for five LRA commanders in 2005, including Dominic Ongwen. In research underpinning the impacts described here, Professor Tim Allen and colleagues examined the conflict, its participants and victims, international criminal justice, traditional justice, and everyday efforts for post\-conflict social repair and reintegration. Impacts described here are underpinned by research and fieldwork undertaken throughout the eligibility period, which built upon Allen’s earlier research in the region in the 1980s and 1990s. 

 Allen described in detail the background to the war, rooted in the politics and history of Uganda and its neighbours. He analysed both the atrocities of the LRA \(which included massacres and mutilations, and forcible recruitment of thousands of people, with large numbers of children forced to train as fighters or given to LRA commanders for sexual purposes\), and the brutal anti\-insurgency operations of the government \(including the internment of over one million people in appalling conditions\). Allen and, more recently, Dr Holly Porter interviewed LRA combatants and formerly abducted persons, and edited and contributed to the most authoritative, comprehensive analysis of the group available **\[1\]**. 

 Following the referral of the LRA case to the ICC in 2004, Allen’s research became more focused on post\-conflict accountability and debates about international criminal justice. Working closely with Ugandan colleagues, notably Jackeline Atingo \(who was herself abducted by the LRA in 2006, but was rescued before being forced into sexual relations with an LRA commander\), Allen took issue with the prevailing analysis of the time, which criticised the court as imperialist, ignorant of the realities on the ground, and counter\-productive to reconciliation efforts. Allen and Atingo found that many affected people were enthusiastic about criminal prosecution, and much of activists’ and aid agencies’ antipathy towards the court's intervention was misplaced **\[2\]**. Allen was sceptical about the promotion of a blanket amnesty with no time limit, and was critical about the funding and promotion of purported traditional justice mechanisms by international organisations and some local actors as a viable alternative to the ICC. He also highlighted problems with the process of re\-establishing traditional chiefs to implement externally\-funded rituals. He argued that promotion of this kind of patriarchal ethno\-justice contributed to an impression that northern Ugandans require their own special measures, perpetuating a damaging historical caricature of the population as innately violent and primitive, as well as reinforcing potentially oppressive gender norms. Allen also drew attention to the inadequate support and lack of monitoring associated with people returning from the LRA at the time, including thousands of children. This work was written up in widely circulated reports, and discussed in detail with relevant organisations in Uganda, as well as international actors based in Europe and elsewhere – notably, USAID, DFID, Save the Children, UNICEF, and the ICC. 

 Subsequently, Allen and his team, which included a growing number of Ugandan and international graduate researchers, studied a wide range of themes in the region, including aspects of land settlement, conflict mediation, peace talks with the LRA, aspects of accountability, vigilantes, witchcraft, sexuality and gender relations, and the return of LRA combatants, 30,000 of whom were children \(e.g. **\[3\]**\). From 2011, fieldwork intensified, with new funding from DFID, and later ESRC, AHRC, and GCRF. Atingo took a leading role coordinating research in Uganda. Among other projects was a detailed, long\-term, follow\-up study of former child combatants and girls forced into sexual unions with LRA commanders **\[4\] \[5\]**. This is one of very few long\-term studies of children returning from war in Africa. 

 Among the most striking insights is that those who spent longest with the LRA are least likely to be stigmatised and most likely to receive official aid. Most of these held rank in the LRA and still exert authority over other returnees. In contrast, a majority of returnees live in rural locations, on ancestral land and in impoverished circumstances, commonly feared or abused by relatives and neighbours. Many were vulnerable children, returned from the LRA with the support of humanitarian organisations, only to have been largely abandoned. Unsurprisingly, it was also found that aspects of life for the Acholi population were affected by legacies of the war and mass forced displacement, such as land conflicts and high incidence of sexual violence. 

 With respect to the latter, drawing on in\-depth interviews with almost 200 women **\[6\] \[7\]**, Porter’s doctoral research provided extensive evidence and a nuanced understanding of widespread rape and its aftermath, arguing that conventional understandings of what is appropriate are dependent on consent, a concept that does not exist in the same way in the Acholi context in northern Uganda. Instead, what is permissible depends on other conditions, such as whether sex contributes to the establishment of a ""home"", whether it provides children, and whether certain customary exchanges have happened beforehand. None of these conditions, Porter showed, were present in LRA forced “marriages”. Through this analysis of the Acholi\-specific context, she was able to demonstrate that LRA sex was transgressive in ways that outsiders had not appreciated. 

 The research described above was undertaken in close collaboration with Uganda\-based researchers, some of whom have worked with the team for more than ten years and have been supported to complete postgraduate degrees \(in addition to Atingo, they include Charles Ogweno, Dorothy Atim, James Ocitti, and Julian Hopwood\). Through their cumulative fieldwork experiences, and by being embedded in the northern Uganda context, they have provided a critical voice to continuing debates of post\-war reconstruction and, when possible, practical support to specific individuals in acute need **\[3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has had significant impacts on the justice and reconciliation process in post\-conflict Uganda. It will likely have much larger, global impacts by pioneering methods for the collection of evidence of rape crimes in war that are efficient, sensitive, and acceptable to victims, and through the establishment of a highly visible legal precedent for the successful prosecution of such crimes. The former set of impacts includes shaping the work of the ICC, as well as initiatives to better protect the welfare of those being reintegrated after war. Beneficiaries include the ICC prosecution team, victims of wartime violence, NGOs and others involved in supporting reintegration, and more than 300 individuals and their families who have returned from the LRA or have been affected by the violence. The latter set of impacts involve justice for victims of wartime rape worldwide, and are likely to be invoked in ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 

 **Impacts on the ICC trial of Dominic Ongwen** 

 LRA commander Dominic Ongwen was handed over to the ICC in 2015. He was charged with 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. His trial began in The Hague in December 2016, and ended in March 2020. The judges then deliberated under Covid\-19 constraints, finally announcing their guilty verdict in February 2021. From May 2015, Allen’s team made sustained contributions to the ICC’s work on the trial, as described below. 

 *Provision of expert witness testimony and reports* 

 In May 2015, Allen, Porter, and their LSE colleague Dr Anna Macdonald were invited to The Hague to brief the prosecutorial team and meet with the Trust Fund for Victims and the Victims’ Participation Unit. Following this meeting, Allen was invited to act as “Witness 1” \(i.e. the prosecution’s expert witness\) in Ongwen’s trial. Ahead of the trial, he was asked by the Office of the Prosecutor to provide an independent report **\[A\]** for the court covering the environment in which key wartime events took place. 

 Once the trial began, Allen returned to The Hague in January 2017 to give testimony in court for two days, including cross\-examination by the defence counsel. His testimony provided further information about the organisational relationships within the LRA, its training and use of child soldiers, allocation of abducted girls to LRA commanders as “wives”, and also the spiritual beliefs that informed the actions of LRA members, particularly how a spiritual inspiration came to be ascribed to its founder and leader, Kony. With respect to the latter, Allen explained the ways in which spiritual engagement is not in itself unusual in the region, and that association with spiritual forces, both inside and outside of Christianity, did not mean that people did not have a capacity to make choices **\[B\]**. 

 Allen’s report and court testimony were directly informed by the underpinning research **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]** **\[6\] \[7\]** and helped to highlight and explain layers of meaning necessary for the prosecution and defence to understand the context of spiritually\-influenced warfare. A trial lawyer of the Office of the Prosecutor at the ICC subsequently attested to the value of Allen’s witness contributions: "" *His testimony will undoubtedly feature in the final trial judgment expected in early 2021, as an important contextual reference for the judges on conflict in northern Uganda*"" **\[C\]**. 

 *Provision of information contributing to the expansion of charges against Ongwen* 

 An additional, confidential report was submitted to the ICC by Porter, drawing on her research on sexuality and violence **\[6\] \[7\]**. This report helped the prosecution team understand typical modes of distribution of girls and women within the LRA, and the nature of these relationships. Crucially, the research team was able to provide detailed information about notions of consent, marriage, and sexual norms in the Acholi context. The report and oral briefings described dynamics amongst women who spent time in forced LRA marriages upon their return, and particularly the experiences of so\-called “junior wives”, who were often more willing to describe appalling incidents of abuse **\[4\]**. 

 The contributions of Porter, Allen, and other team members provided information \(including access to witnesses\) that helped prosecutors expand the charge sheet against Ongwen to include sexual and gender\-based crimes, such as forced marriage, rape, sexual slavery, and enslavement. This brought to 70 the number of charges against Ongwen, up from seven when warrants were first issued. Based substantially on information and advice Porter, Allen, and the team were able to provide, Ongwen has become the first person prosecuted and convicted by an international court or tribunal for sexual and gender\-based crimes. Crucially, the trial's interpretation of the ICC Rome Statute defined rape as sexual penetration in a context of coercion, rather than specifically in the context of absent consent. A prosecution trial lawyer subsequently confirmed Porter’s report’s value and influence: "" *Rich in anthropological and contextual analysis, Dr Porter’s report directly informed litigation decisions by the Office of the Prosecutor*"" **\[C\]**. 

 *Enhanced understanding of victims’ needs and protected welfare of trial witnesses* 

 Allen, Porter, and their colleagues’ work demonstrated the vulnerability of junior wives in northern Uganda, and the pressures being exerted by “senior wives” opposed to Ongwen’s prosecution. As a result, the ICC accepted that it would reduce the risks both to the potential witnesses and to the veracity of their testimony if they were able to participate in the trial as quickly and with as little exposure as possible. Porter’s report was used as one of the key submissions in a proposal to allow victims of sexual violence to provide witness testimony and be cross\-examined from Uganda before the trial commenced. Pre\-trial judges made a ruling in favour of this proposal **\[C\]**. Subsequently, seven women were able to testify that they were forced to become wives of Ongwen, and that he had raped them. Rather than suffering the long ordeal of a trial and the exposure of travelling to the Netherlands \(with the risk of hostile reactions from Ongwen supporters\), it was accepted that they could testify early, and confidentially, from Uganda. 

 *Improvements to the lives of returnees* 

 The team’s detailed, long\-term fieldwork provided evidence to the ICC’s Trust Fund for Victims, and to various other international and national actors. Research on LRA child returnees **\[4\]** has highlighted the plight of those people attempting to reintegrate in northern Uganda, identifying widespread poverty, stigmatisation, and abuse, in some cases triggering assistance from aid agencies **\[D\]**. The research also underpinned landmark policy interventions promoted by Gulu MP Lyandro Komakech. Drawing on information provided by the team in late\-2018, Komakech tabled a motion for a resolution of Parliament requiring the government to introduce appropriate special assistance programmes that will effectively enhance the welfare of former female abductees and their children born during the LRA insurgency. This motion, which closely follows the team’s findings **\[4\]**, was formally approved by legislators on 13 February 2019 **\[E\] \[F\]**. In addition, the team has been instrumental in establishing the Trust for Child Soldiers, a registered UK charity set up to work primarily with those who were abducted and who fought as children. In 2019\-20 alone, the Trust directly supported more than 300 war\-affected people \(covering costs of education, medical treatment, small business grants, and emergency assistance\) **\[G\]**. 

 **Impact on international judicial practice** 

 In addition to having greatly eased the burden on those testifying as victims of sexual crimes, the Ongwen case set a ground\-breaking international precedent in the ability to prosecute crimes of a sexual nature, with potentially significant implications for the prosecution of rape more broadly. The Ongwen case removed legal impediments that have long been criticised by feminist anti\-rape scholarship and activism \(e.g. MacKinnon; Boesten; Halley; Chinkin\). Article 56 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court allows for consideration of ""a unique opportunity to take testimony or statement from a witness...which may not be available subsequently for the purposes of a trial"". It was this provision that was invoked to record victims’ testimonies. Should this precedent be applied more broadly, as it likely will once it becomes a matter of public record following completion of the trial, it will aid the prosecution of crimes of sexual violence in both domestic and international jurisdictions. Addressing this point, the prosecution trial lawyer has said: "" *Dr Porter’s report \[...\] played a key role in the preservation of vulnerable evidence of sexual and gender\-based crimes in the pre\-trial phase of the case. The novel preservation of this evidence, which occurred before the trial commenced, itself amounts to an important and historic judicial precedent at the ICC, because it amounted to, in essence, judicial intervention to protect vulnerable persons by preserving their evidence quickly, while safeguarding their well\-being*"" **\[C\]**. This view has already been advanced in the *International Criminal Law Review*, which has hailed this aspect of the Ongwen case as “ *a milestone precedent for future cases, not just in terms of circumventing situations of witness interference, but more importantly, in safeguarding vulnerable victims and witnesses, and preserving their evidence for any eventual trial*” **\[H\]**. 

 *The verdict and publication of the judgment* 

 After the defence and the prosecution teams delivered their closing statements in March 2020, judges spent several months considering their verdict. Writing prior to the verdict being reached, the trial lawyer of the Office of the Prosecutor attested to the importance of the researchers’ contributions: "" *The role of Prof Allen and Dr Porter in the Ongwen trial has been significant, their expertise enriching and influencing decision\-making that has positively impacted and furthered the process of international criminal justice*"" **\[C\]**. 

 The final verdict was announced on 4 February 2021, with Ongwen convicted on 61 of the 70 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes he faced. He was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison. The ICC has published the full trial judgment **\[I\]**, with the judges noting: 

 *“The Chamber…deems it necessary to include in this judgment a brief background to the case, with a view to placing the case in a historical context and establishing the point of departure for the factual findings which are made as part of the adjudication of the case. In this regard, the Chamber notes the evidence provided by Professor Tim Allen, who prepared a report submitted into evidence and testified before the Chamber as an expert witness. The basic lines of this historical background were not disputed between the parties in the course of the trial. Thus, the following overview is derived from Professor Allen’s report as well as his testimony”* **\[I**, p. 9 **\]**. 

 The first 14 numbered paragraphs of the judgment were explicitly based on Allen’s independent report and testimony. Allen’s was the only testimony given by any of the expert witnesses in court that was considered credible and relevant by the judges, and his responses to questions in court are directly cited on five occasions. The judgment specifically describes how Allen’s testimony was important in two key aspects: firstly, in underpinning the court’s decision to reject the argument that the LRA had acted in service to a credible political project, expressed in a manifesto submitted as documentary evidence **\[I**, pp. 373\-374 **\]**; and secondly, by informing the court’s judgement that Ongwen did not act under duress **\[I**, p. 29 **\]**. In a communication to Allen on the day the judgment was made public, the main trial prosecutor wrote to Allen highlighting the importance of his team’s influence, noting that: “ *the sexual and gender\-based crimes convictions were particularly important. But actually it was the rejection of \[Ongwen’s\] excuses \(mental health and duress\) by which I was most pleased”* **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lancaster University’s pioneering tradition of regional history is embedded in, and nurtured by, the region’s communities. Long\-lasting collaborations and innovative projects with organisations from the Victoria County History to the National Trust have enabled Lancaster’s historians to transform learning, participation and wellbeing in Cumbria, Lancashire and northern England more widely. Volunteer\-based research programmes have offered deep and sustained benefits for over 120 individual volunteers, in addition to major regional and national organisations. Lancaster’s heritage collaborations have also enriched prominent cultural initiatives such as the Lake District’s World Heritage Site Partnership. An award\-winning Massive Open Online Course \(MOOC\) has extended the reach of the impact by directly engaging 8,479 learners from 127 countries with the research; exhibitions, talks and media coverage have reached more than     6.5 million people. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Lancaster University historians have longstanding expertise in the study of northern England, especially the extensive region from Lancashire to the Anglo\-Scottish border. Since 2014, the Regional Heritage Centre \(RHC\) has been a hub for this work, linking regional research with expertise in Digital Humanities. The RHC has facilitated collaborative publications and projects by 3 scholars, whose combined research ranges across more than a millennium. Edmonds has explored the period from sub\-Roman times to the central medieval era; Winchester has focused on late\-medieval and early modern history; and Donaldson has studied the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Their research has yielded 3 broad insights into the region’s pivotal place in the history of Britain and beyond. 

 **The significance of regional identity:** Northern identity is a topical theme, but contemporary discussions often neglect to ask how the region’s distinctive characteristics emerged. Winchester and Edmonds have explored how the predominantly upland landscape influenced the inhabitants’ livelihoods and culture. Winchester’s work is exemplified by his pioneering monograph *The Harvest of the Hills* \(2000\), which deployed manorial documents and place\-names to provide a richly textured account of rural northern England and southern Scotland c.1400‒1700 \[R1\]. He revealed that dispersed communities were bound together by long\-standing structures such as manor courts, which survived alongside emerging parish and county authorities. His 2005 article on regional identity further demonstrated how land tenure lent coherence to ‘Lakeland’ long before its Romantic\-era popularity \[R2\]. Winchester has greatly developed this work through the Victoria County History \(VCH\) of Cumbria project, which he founded as the regional element of the VCH of England in 2010; Edmonds became Director in 2016 \[G1\]. Edmonds has also built on Winchester’s place\-name research to provide vital information about medieval communities that are poorly recorded, including an extensive co\-authored chapter concerning languages and names in northern England and southern Scotland \[R3\]. Lancaster’s place\-name studies have supported further projects such as *Mapped Histories*, which collected the names of fields and landscape features within the area covered by the Rusland Horizons Landscape Partnership \(2016–17\) \[G3\]. 

 **The region as destination:** Turning from the region’s communities to tourists, Donaldson and Winchester have asked how, from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the Lake District came to be revered for its beauty, rather than feared for its remoteness. Between 2015 and 2018 Donaldson pursued this topic as Co\-investigator on a Leverhulme\-funded project. He examined an extensive textual corpus \(1.5million words\) using the department’s innovative digital methodologies to identify place\-names and their descriptors. He thereby demonstrated how 18<sup>th</sup>\-century aesthetic theory transformed writers’ perceptions of the Lake District \[R4, G2\]. In collaboration with Winchester, he deepened this study by editing Henry Hobhouse’s travel journal \(1774\), which reveals how the region’s landscape assimilated its industries \[R5\]. The research resonates with current debates about the Lake District’s character. 

 **The role of the Anglo\-Scottish border:** Lancaster’s historians have moved beyond Anglocentric approaches to the region, viewing the north\-west as integrally linked with the Scottish borders and other parts of northern England \[R1\]. Edmonds has focused on the early medieval Northumbrian kingdom, which spanned the modern border. Her groundbreaking monograph revealed that the kingdom experienced intense cultural influence from the Gaelic\-speaking areas to the north and west \[R6\]. She also contributed to the agenda\-setting volume *Northern England and Southern Scotland*, co\-edited by Winchester \[R3\]. Donaldson has shown how changing appreciation of Lakeland affected perceptions of southern Scotland, and vice versa \[R4\]. The 3 historians have revealed common features of, and contrasts between, northern England and southern Scotland, as well as the border’s enduring significance for northern English identity.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Lancaster’s exemplary work on regional history has achieved extensive and sustained impact within northern England. The research collaborations have boosted the participation, learning and wellbeing of over 120 volunteers and enriched the cultural engagement of heritage organisations. The research has also reached widely into national and international audiences, engaging millions more through an online course, exhibitions and the media. 

 **Intensifying the public’s participation in regional heritage** 

 The earliest and most enduring impact was achieved through the VCH Cumbria project, based in the RHC and funded by Cumbria County History Trust. This project has galvanised participation and learning amongst individuals and organisations, training volunteer researchers to work with Winchester, Edmonds and Rose \(Research Associate\). The project is inextricably linked with Lancaster’s research into regional identity, archives and place\-names \[R1, R2, R6\], which provided a basis for the volunteers’ research guidelines and training. 

 The project’s first achievement was to produce short histories of Cumbria’s 348 townships, co\-written by Winchester and approximately 100 volunteers. The volunteers were drawn from history societies and the community across the county; some had training in historical research, whereas others had no prior experience but wished to pursue historical interests in retirement. The short histories were published in *Cumbria: An Historical Gazetteer* \(Lancaster, 2016\) and are freely available on the Trust’s website, which now attracts approximately 60,000 visits per year \[S1\]. The beneficiaries include a high proportion of interested groups in Cumbria \(over twenty organisations\) who contributed to the endeavour either as associated groups, funders or trustees. One example is the Cumberland & Westmorland Antiquarian & Archaeological Society: by providing resources for training new participants, the project has enhanced this society’s charitable purpose of fostering the study of Cumbria’s history. In the case of Cumbria Archives Service, the research has shaped discussions about access to archival resources, leading to improvements in the system for consulting documents in 2020 \[S2i\]. The beneficiaries also include around 100 volunteers, whose learning and participation has been transformed. Since 2016, Edmonds and Rose have worked intensively with 50 of the volunteers, who are drafting full histories of parishes ranging from Waberthwaite in the west to Kirkby Lonsdale in the east. In this way, the volunteers have benefited from Lancaster’s research expertise, while providing valuable local knowledge \[S3, S4\]. The quality of the resulting research is seen in the project’s first published parish history, *Kirkoswald and Renwick* \(London, 2019\), by Brockington with Rose. In *Landscape History* \(2019\) a reviewer noted that it *“contributes directly to the mission of the national VCH of providing ‘authoritative, encyclopaedic histories’ of every parish in the country”*. 

 On a national level, other VCH county teams have drawn inspiration from Cumbria’s volunteer participation; for example, the Cumbria model proved influential in the refoundation of VCH Shropshire in 2015. The Cumbria volunteers’ handbook was, furthermore, used to redraft the revised national parish history template, issued in 2017. The concept of the Cumbrian ‘short histories’ has also shaped the VCH strategy for digital engagement, which aims for comprehensive coverage at a basic level. This strategy has so far led to the creation of an app that maps the histories of every place in England. The Director of the national VCH states: *“VCH Cumbria has been instrumental in developing the present\-day VCH as a community and public history project, providing a replicable and extensible model for volunteer engagement”* \[S2ii\]. 

 **Enriching individuals’ wellbeing through learning** 

 The VCH Cumbria project has created a county\-wide community of volunteers with the skills and motivation to undertake further research. They have received guidance through one\-to\-one sessions and quarterly meetings, drawing on Lancaster’s interdisciplinary research tradition. Recent training sessions between 2017 and 2019 derive from Edmonds’s research into Roman and medieval material culture \[R6\], Donaldson’s work on early tourism \[R5\] and the recurring theme of the Anglo\-Scottish border \[R3, S4\]. The meetings have enhanced wellbeing by forming social ties across this dispersed county and deploying the varied talents and expertise of volunteers. An experienced volunteer comments: *“My own experience has been one of great and growing enjoyment … I have no way of adequately describing what it means to have my name on the front cover of a VCH short \(history\). The collaboration has had other very significant consequences … More than 50 individual residents contributed to* Kirkoswald and Renwick *… The impact on these communities was positive and enriching.”* \[S3\]. 

 This model of collaborative working has had wider impact still by generating new volunteer\- based research projects. In 2016 and 2017, Winchester drew on his place\-name research \[R1\] when training 15 volunteers in Rusland, Cumbria, to gather and interpret field names for the *Mapped Histories* project. The project has since taken on a life of its own, yielding an interactive website and 2 books produced by the volunteers themselves \(2019\). The end\-of\-project report notes: *“The sense of belonging, not only to a group and common cause, but also to the heritage and landscape of their local area, has been a core part of the project ... In terms of their \[the volunteers'\] well\-being, the project has had a huge impact.”* \[S5iii‒v\]. According to the wider Rusland Horizons volunteer survey, 89% of participants felt that the project had increased their sense of identity with, and pride in, the area \[S5ii\]. In 2019 and 2020, Edmonds and Rose used their knowledge of medieval documents to assist 9 volunteers on the Heritage Lottery\-funded Kentmere Heritage project. This was a collaborative research project that aimed to uncover the history of the parish prior to 1600 and produce an exhibition in the parish church, fostering the sense of community in this remote valley \[S6\]. 

 **Enhancing cultural engagement in partnership with heritage organisations** 

 The Regional Heritage Centre is a focal point for over 75 organisations, including museums, historic houses and the National Trust. Lancaster’s regional research has transformed the way in which such organisations embed research in their outreach, exhibitions and funding applications. The community engagement uses the same methods as the VCH Cumbria project, such as training events, but this time for beneficiaries in the heritage sector. 

 Donaldson and Winchester’s research into the origins of tourism in the region \[R5\], helped to inform the National Trust’s activities to mark the Lake District’s dedication as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2017. Donaldson’s participation in the community engagement project *The Tables Turned* facilitated learning about the contributions that people from Cumbria, including Lakeland writers and artists, have made to world heritage. The project attracted at least 200 participants, including 150 Year 7 pupils from Keswick School, retired miners from Whitehaven and adults with special needs from Carlisle \[S7i\]. As a result of the project’s success, the organisation changed the way it uses university research to engage with the community, as seen in 3 Lake District properties \(Allan Bank, Wordsworth House, Townend\). The National Trust’s Participation Officer states: *“The project has enabled us to develop a method for engagement from communities with World Heritage OUVs \[Outstanding Universal Values\] … our collaboration with Chris \[Donaldson\] has ensured that working in partnership with Universities is now central to our practice … Having research\-led activities at the heart of this project was essential to its success.”* \[S7ii\]. 

 Donaldson’s research into Wordsworth’s perceptions of the Lake District \[R4\] also underpinned a collaboration with The Wordsworth Trust on 2 major exhibitions: *Wordsworth Country* \(April 2016 to June 2017\) and *By Duddon’s Side* \(April to June 2017\). *Wordsworth Country* attracted 89,985 visitors and *By Duddon’s Side* received 11,580 visitors, as well as an online audience of 25,000 \(17% from outside the UK\) \[S8i/ii\]. Visitors said that the research *“made me see Wordsworth differently”* and *“definitely made me want to know more”* \[S9i\]. The exhibitions informed the Trust’s planning and preparation for the redevelopment of its museum\-visitor experience as part of their successful £4.1million Heritage Lottery Fund project *Re\-imagining Wordsworth*. As well as describing Donaldson’s contribution as ‘invaluable’, the Curator and Head of Learning noted that it *“helped us towards how we might display manuscripts in the future … This will feed into the Trust’s activity and interpretation plan for the stage 2 \(HLF\) application”* \[S9ii\]. 

 **From the region to the world: revealing northern history to international audiences** 

 The activities described so far demonstrated an international interest in, and demand for, up\-to\-date information about regional history research. Edmonds and Donaldson responded to this need by creating a free MOOC hosted by the FutureLearn platform, entitled *Lancaster Castle and Northern English History: The View from the Stronghold*. The RHC produced the course in partnership with the Duchy of Lancaster, also involving 6 other regional and national organisations, such as The National Archives. The MOOC draws on Lancaster’s tradition of regional research by using the castle as a microcosm of northern English history, showcasing Edmonds’s research into the Northumbrian kingdom \[R3, R6\] and Donaldson’s work on tourism \(Lancaster was a key staging post en route to Lakeland in the 19<sup>th</sup> century\) \[R4\]. 

 Across 3 runs \(October to November 2018, 2019, 2020\), the course attracted 8,479 participants from 127 countries. In 2019, it won a Customer Service Excellence award and the British Universities Film & Video Council nominated it for a prestigious national ‘Learning on Screen’ award. The course is in the top quartile of History MOOCs for learner retention and completion. In 2018, learners made 10,882 comments, demonstrating that the course had transformed their appreciation of regional history. One commented *“you have an exceptionally wonderful asset, the castle of Lancaster. Using it as a means of illustrating not only its own history, \(but also\) the history of northern territory and neighbouring lands, has proved a most refreshing experience”*. 92% of the 389 participants in the end of course survey \(first run\) felt that they had gained new knowledge. 50% of these participants were inspired to find out more, and so Edmonds created an extra week of medieval resources, including an exercise on the Scottish raid of 1322. One learner commented *“it was very much a surprise about the Scottish involvement, hope to learn more”* \[S10\]. Across the 3 years, 48% of learners were located internationally. 308 learners stated that they would now visit Lancashire; in 2020 one learner commented *“My first priority once I can do so is to come and see this wonderful castle for myself after spending the last 7 weeks walking its history”* \[S10\]. This indicates an impact on tourism, which Edmonds is now developing in partnership with Marketing Lancashire, supported by ESRC Impact Acceleration funding. 

 Lancaster’s projects have generated further impact through talks and media coverage. Since 2017, the RHC has hosted 5 sold\-out study days on related topics for 610 learners; 93% of those surveyed said they learnt something new \[S11i\]. Donaldson, Edmonds and Rose have presented talks to 57 history societies across northern England and southern Scotland, reaching approximately 3,250 adult learners \[S11ii\]. Their research has received significant attention in the regional press and radio \(combined reach of 161,369 people\). Edmonds’s work also gained international coverage through Dan Snow’s *History Hit* \(3million listeners per month\), while Donaldson’s research featured on BBC Radio 4’s ‘Making History’ in 2017 \(3.28million listeners\) \[S12\]. Such coverage ensures that the next generation benefit from, and join us, in our research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Professor Mark De Ste Croix, Dr Jonathan Hughes, Dr Francisco Ayala, Dr Paul Read, and Mr Will Roberts** research around the development of movement competency and physical literacy in young children has had a significant impact on people, practice and policy since 2012. The significance and reach of the impact are evidenced by the range of organisations who have adopted youth movement competency and physical literacy strategies into their education programmes for sport coaches, as well as the direct impact on players and staff at specific teams.  The impact has dramatically changed how coach education is delivered in a number of countries, culminating in a range of interventions, training resources and introduction into formal coach education awards. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research for this Impact Case study was designed around a RE\-AIM \(Research, Educate, Adopt, Implement and Maintain\) framework and is in three related areas. Each area has informed the design, development, delivery, evaluation and impact of two coach education programmes. 

  

###  1.     Using artificial intelligence to understand injury risk in paediatric populations and development of a Physical Literacy framework 

 **De Ste Croix, Hughes, Read and Ayala’s** work in this area is underpinned by a number of highly competitive research grants from FIFA and UEFA which has resulted in the most comprehensive set of published research in the area of injury risk screening in youth. In order to develop appropriate intervention programmes and subsequently influence coach education the team has conducted extensive world leading research using Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) to understand the causal link in injury risk and movement competency \(REF 3\). The research underpinning this case study demonstrated that the detrimental effects on physiological and neuromuscular function is both age and maturation specific. This research has informed the design and development of a movement competency programme based on innovative statistical approaches compared to previous programmes which are designed on flawed prediction methods to identify risk factors. In Physical Literacy \(PL\), establishing an appropriate framework is essential in designing appropriate PL programmes. **Roberts** was one of the world\-leading experts commissioned by the Australian Sports Commission to develop a PL framework \(REF 1\). 

  

###  2.     Developing and evaluating the effectiveness of movement competency and physical literacy programmes in youth 

 The AI research into risk factors allowed **De Ste Croix** and **Hughes** to design and evaluate a movement competency programme commissioned by the English Football Association \(Reducing Injury in Sport with Kids – RISK\). The efficacy of the intervention programme was high, showing significant improvements in movement competency and reduced injury risk in female football players \(REF 4\). BOING was developed in 2014, and was built on the development of the PL framework and the research of **Roberts**, demonstrating significant impact on children engaged in BOING. This evidence\-based research led to Sport England and UK Coaching adopting BOING as a key driver for workforce development and impacting children’s physical literacy. Given the efficacy of these programmes in developing movement competency, reducing injury risk and enhancing PL in youth and in order to enhance the reach of the impact on children, two coach education programmes were developed and their impact on coaches and children evaluated via commissioned research. 

  

###  3.     Coaching the coaches: Development, delivery and impact of coach education for youth sport 

 RISK and BOING have focused on developing coaches and PE teacher’s knowledge, attitude and confidence to deliver movement competency and physical literacy to children in clubs, schools and community settings. Employing a RE\-AIM framework, the impact of the programmes have been evaluated in terms of adoption, implementation and maintenance of new knowledge and confidence. RISK secured competitive ERASMUS funding to evaluate the impact of the workshop on 300 coaches’ \(delivering to 4,500 children\) knowledge, attitude towards and confidence to adopt, implement and maintain movement competency training in their coaching, across 3 European countries \(REF 6\). Subsequently the England and Wales Cricket board \(ECB\) commissioned the research group to deliver and evaluate RISK to its coach educators and roll out as a compulsory element of the coach education provision to all level 1 and 2 ECB coaches. In 2019 BOING developed a coach education programme to share the games and pedagogical principals related to PL to 63 partners including 50% of all active partnerships in England. Sport England commissioned **Roberts** to deliver and evaluate the effectiveness of this programme to 1600 coaches \(delivering to over 70,000 children\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research undertaken by this group has demonstrated a clear impact on children’s injury risk, levels of physical activity and building social and emotional confidence by introducing these skills to children. In order to develop the reach of the impact on the end\-user \(children\) a strategic direction of the research since the 2014 REF was to develop coach education workshops \(for all coaches and PE teachers, from grassroots through the elite pathway\) and evaluate their effectiveness, whilst impacting on a range of workforces beyond football \(which was the focus in 2014\). Ongoing work with individual clubs has led to enhanced impact and reach beyond those clubs. A good example of this is how Bristol Bears Rugby club have upskilled their own coaching workforce but have also modelled the injury prevention programme for rugby in and around Bristol within their feeder schools, clubs and coaches \(see **Van Klaveren** Testimonial\). National and International organisation buy\-in was central to the success of the impact on workforces, and is evident in the wide range of sports and community organisations who have adopted these practices \(e.g UK Coaching, Sport England, English FA, England and Wales Cricket Board, GB Hockey, Czech Football Federation, Czech Handball Federation, Murcia Football Federation and Australian Sports Commission. 

 **Impact on Children:** 

 The extent of the reach of the impact of BOING on children is the development of 63 strategic partners, including 50% of all active partnerships in the UK, community projects \(e.g., the Change Foundation, Street games, LEAP\) with over 3200 members and 29,000 unique visits to the website means that over **70,000** children are ‘BOINGing’. An example of effective partnership working is with the Girl Guides in the UK, where BOING games and pedagogical principles have been embedded in packs for over 500 Girl Guide centres, with over 50,000 young girls receiving access to BOING. Both RISK and BOING have been delivered to over **3000** coaches, PE teachers and community volunteers in a number of European countries. This additionally equates to around **45,000** children being newly exposed to movement competency training and physical literacy. During the recent pandemic BOING was one of the promoted programmes \(Join the Movement Campaign\) by Sport England to enhance children’s physical activity and social and emotional well\-being. The impact of BOING on schools and teachers: “I would recommend all Physical Educators in schools to check the program out to see how it could benefit their pupils, staff and school as a whole”; parents “Boing is an exciting and simple way of getting children active, whilst learning transferable skills without them realising they are doing it as they are having so much fun”; and coaches “Boing..has challenged and inspired us as a group of coaches”, across the UK is evident. However, the impact of BOING on children is most striking: ‘At the end of Boing I feel like congratulating myself for joining in’ \(child 1\); ‘I have learnt how to trust people. At the end of Boing I feel energised \(child 2\)’ \(see **BOING website**\) 

 Since developing and evaluating the effectiveness of a football movement competency training programme for the FA in 2014, \(REF 1\) the research has continued to impact female youth players. Over **600** girls in the FA advanced coaching centers \(ACCs\) have received movement competency training, some for 6 years, and the FA have seen a reduction in injury incidence ‘I’m seeing the difference that it can make to injury rates in the girls. The impact of the programme is proven..’ **\(Lawler\-Edwards\)**. In terms of reach, upskilling coaches beyond the Impact case study \(REF3\) Page 4 ACC into county clubs in the south west of England, has meant circa **1,800** youth female players are receiving movement competency training that has been shown to reduce injury rates. 

 RISK has also had an impact on physical education in schools, on both the workforce and children. After being approached by a Director of Sport to develop a movement competency aspect to a gifted and talented programme, the upskilling of the PE workforce in the school meant staff developed confidence and competence to integrate the programme into all PE lessons and extra\-curricular sport. The impact this has had on children across the school is evident in the testimonial of **Phillips**: “What we have found is there's no question that there's been less injuries within the groups that are part of the programme and there's certainly evidence that they are more proficient in their movement” 

 **Impact on Coaches and their practice:** 

 Both BOING and RISK have significantly impacted on coaches in terms of knowledge, attitude towards and confidence to deliver movement competency and physical literacy to children. In evaluating the impact of the RISK workshop on 300 coaches in 3 European countries, coaches were adopting and implementing their newly gained knowledge. Establishing adoption is crucial in evidencing that the impact of the workshops go beyond knowledge gain and is evidence of coaches changing their practice. The impact of the change in coach practice is also evidence of an impact on the children receiving the movement competency training and reducing their injury risk. The impact of the adoption of BOING continues to be evaluated via commissioned research from Sport England, with 1600 coaches, and has already indicated a significant impact in increasing knowledge, attitude and confidence to delivery physical literacy through play. The reach of the impact of BOING via partnership with Sport England is evident: “opening up the minds of coach educators and coach developers and system builders within some of our partner organisations..it’s having a growing impact from the individual up to the coaches, the coaching system and then obviously the wider sector.” **\(Kitson and Armstrong\)**. A strategic partnership with UK Coaching is further evidence of the reach of the workforce impact of both BOING and RISK. The work with UK Coaching is based on organizational influence in terms of the strategy of developing youth sport coaches to positively impact on youth sport: “It’s influencing and shaping what we do...to support the wider coach development workforce.” The impact that UK Coaching workshop delivery of BOING has had on coaches is extensive: “had a huge impact on the coaching craft and coaching practice of many coaches…People engaging in it and finding confidence and passion.” **\(Hartley and Davies\)**. The reach of the impact from the workshops is evident in the range of organisations noting the development in their workforce, including GBHockey “By providing access to this support for coaches..we are seeing real change in the way coaches approach the support of young people.” **\(Guise\)** 

 RISK has developed the FA workforce in the SW of England and here has been impact beyond the ACCs with grassroot coaches at local clubs being upskilled by ACC coaches. The growing reach of this programme means that circa **120** clubs and coaches have been directly impacted by gaining new knowledge and changing/enhancing their practice. **Lawler\-Edwards** notes: ‘upskilling the staff....what is important is that the staff continue to coach those techniques....that’s something that’s impacted on the staff”. After being commissioned by the ECB to evaluate the impact of the workshops on circa 60 coaches the ECB invited all registered coaches \(n= **7000\)** to attend an online version of the workshop in early 2021: “The impact of Mark running a number of workshops for us to spread out through the country has just increased coaches knowledge, attitudes and beliefs around how their own coaching impacts on players physical movements” \( **Ahmun**\). **Ahmun** notes the impact on the ECB workforce in terms of enhanced knowledge, confidence and adoption of the programme: “coaches are now more aware that they can have an impact on a young athletes ability to move...” 

 **Impact on Organisations:** 

 The physical literacy research of **Roberts** was used to develop the Australian Physical Literacy Framework, commissioned by the Australian sports commission. The impact of this framework across the Australian sports sector has been extensive, by influencing all National Impact case study \(REF3\) Page 5 Sports Organisations participation programmes/planning and the products they develop. This includes the national sports plan ‘Sport2030’, national funding of a new school programme ‘Sporting schools plus’, and a change in the national physical activity policy ‘MoveitAUS’ to a physical literacy model. **Comis** notes the extensive impact on the workforce across Australia’s sport and PE sector based on the adoption of the framework by organizations: “workforce development both in the sports sector with coaches and coach development, but also in the education sector with teacher training, in physical education.” The reach of the impact of this framework is evident in its adoption in framing a physical literacy evaluation project in 8 European countries and its adoption by Sport New Zealand. 

 The RISK research also impacted on the FA in enhancing and developing the workforce by creating new roles at each ACC: “it has impacted as all ACC’s now have their own Sports therapist and or S&C coach. This is not part of the criteria but the research made them see a gap in the provision and wanted to offer this” **\(Lawler\-Edwards\)**. The impact of this programme led to **De Ste Croix** being a founder member of the FAs Research in Women’s Football group, with the strategic remit to impact on the FAs new four\-year strategy, **titled ‘Inspiring Positive Change’.** 

 In order to establish the recognised impact of RISK on coaches and children the intention was to influence policy change in the coach education content of coaching awards/pathways to incorporate movement competency training and physical literacy. The clear impact on coaches in the commissioned research of the ECB has led to the development of changes in the compulsory elements of cricket coach education in England and Wales with a youth movement competency module being introduced into the compulsory level 1 and 2 cricket coaching awards: “embedding that in policy, definitely....it is a massive step forward in moving the whole process forward.” **Ahmun** summaries the impact of the RISK project by stating: “it’s had a real big impact...a key driver to improve the physical literacy of the young players..” 

 Another example of embedding BOING into NGB coach education strategies is with GB Hockey. As a governing body, they are embedding BOING in the coach education pathway as a central tenet of all coaches exploring contemporary pedagogical principles. **Guise** states “We are excited to explore how we integrate Boing into our coach development offer through our formal governing body awards because we are seeing real change in our coaching workforce and the communities they work with.”

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton \(UoS\) research has made seminal contributions to understanding the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Investigating the structure and function of the tumour B\-cell receptor provided the mechanistic rationale for the first tumour\-eradicating cures in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and the development of targeted therapies that have achieved annual sales of more than GBP5 billion following regulatory approval during the impact period. Research into sequencing immunoglobulin genes resulted in new prognostic tools that were adopted as a standard of care by the NHS and in international guidelines for informing treatment selection. Leadership of large\-scale clinical trials applying molecular phenotyping and functional imaging led to adoption of response\-adapted therapy as the international standard of care in Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal lymphoma. It defined the optimum approach for antibody therapy in follicular lymphoma, resulting in further GBP billions of drug sales. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 University of Southampton research has provided novel insights into the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of two blood cancers: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \(CLL\), the most common leukaemia with 3,700 new cases in the UK each year, and lymphoma, the fifth most prevalent cancer in the UK, with more than 14,000 new diagnoses annually. The new knowledge has been used to shape new standards of care internationally, develop new therapeutic drugs and optimise these treatments through clinical trials. 

 **Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia** 

 Stevenson and Hamblin were the first to identify two distinct immunogenetic subsets of CLL: Unmutated CLL \( **U\-CLL**\) and Mutated CLL \( **M\-CLL**\). U\-CLL derives from B cells prior to entry to the germinal centre and carries no somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin \(Ig\) variable region genes. M\-CLL derives from B cells that have traversed this site and accumulated mutations. U\-CLL is the more aggressive subset, affecting 40% of CLL patients and having a mean survival of 8 years, compared to 25 years for M\-CLL. Research \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] into biological processes underlying disease behaviour showed that the subsets differ in conformational structure and function of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region \(IGHV\) genes of the surface B\-cell receptor \(BCR\). Patients with the more aggressive U\-CLL were found to have higher levels of surface BCR engagement, and therefore responded preferentially to BCR\-mediated signals. The discovery of this prognostic marker generated widespread interest in CLL among biologists and made possible new therapeutic strategies specifically targeting these signalling pathways. 

 Studies from 2011 \[including under **G1**\], led by Forconi and Packham, demonstrated that BCR signalling is vital to malignant B cells: CLL with high signal strength show more rapid disease progression \[ **3.3**\]. Studies led by Steele between 2010 and 2020 explored the efficacy of different therapeutic treatments in interrupting this signalling. These included **ibrutinib**, a cell signal blocker that targets the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase \(BTK\) protein \[ **3.4**\], the dual Syk/JAK inhibitor cerdulatinib and PI3\-kinase inhibitor idelalisib. Recognition of the link between BCR signalling and apoptosis provided the rationale for clinical trials such as CLARITY \(with Forconi as a leading contributor\), which studied the efficacy of ibrutinib and venetoclax, a B\-cell lymphoma 2 \(BCL\-2\) inhibitor, when used in combination \(details of the results in section 4\). 

 **Hodgkin and Non\-Hodgkin Lymphoma \(NHL\)** 

 Johnson has led international trials of new treatments for lymphoma over the last two decades. Beginning in 2008, the phase 3 RATHL trial \[ **G2**\] in advanced Hodgkin lymphoma used FDG\-PET imaging to modulate therapy and demonstrated the value of interim PET\-CT scanning in guiding the intensification or de\-escalation of chemotherapy to optimise the balance between efficacy and toxicity. The results were published in 2016 \[ **3.5**\] \(further details in section 4\). Similar studies targeted primary mediastinal large B\-cell lymphoma, a fast\-growing type of NHL. Johnson and Davies led sequential phase 2 and 3 trials with the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group – IELSG 26 and IELSG 37 \[ **G3**\] – to test the utility of PET imaging to guide the need for consolidation radiotherapy \(details of the results in section 4\). 

 Since 2015 Johnson and Davies have led a national collaborative group to apply molecular phenotyping in aggressive lymphomas \[ **G4**\]. The phase 3 REMoDL\-B trial \[ **G5**\] was the first to demonstrate the value of real\-time gene expression profiling to stratify treatment for diffuse large B\-cell lymphoma \[ **3.6**; details in section 4\]. The translation of biological insights in B\-cell\-directed antibody therapy from the Southampton group led to the international phase 3 GALLIUM trial to assess the efficacy of anti\-CD20 antibody **obinutuzumab** in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma, a type of NHL. Davies led the correlative laboratory studies and identified that obinutuzumab\-based therapy resulted in longer progression\-free survival than the previous standard of **rituximab**\-based therapy \[ **3.7**; details in section 4\]. In SABRINA, another phase 3 trial in follicular lymphoma, a team led by Davies showed that rituximab given subcutaneously was as effective and safe as intravenous rituximab \(the existing standard\), thereby increasing patient convenience and reducing healthcare costs \(details in section 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research at Southampton has developed new understanding around the molecular classification and pathogenetic processes of lymphoid malignancies. This led to the development of new prognostic tools to inform the timing of early\-stage treatment, regulatory approval of ‘blockbuster’ targeted therapies and changes to standards of care via large\-scale, international clinical trials. 

 **New prognostic tools and approaches to optimise early\-stage CLL/lymphoma treatment** 

 Patients with U\-CLL have a worse prognosis than those with M\-CLL in all studies investigating the significance of IGHV mutational status, and this classification, first described and elucidated by Southampton \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\], is the dominant prognostic factor out of all those studied. This was confirmed in a 2016 meta\-analysis of data from 4,933 patients with early\-stage CLL, leading to the publication of an international prognostic index for CLL patients: CLL\-IPI \[ **5.1**\]. This tool stratifies CLL patients into four risk categories \(ensuring high\-risk patients are identified early\) and provides a score to estimate prognosis and time to first treatment. It was published on MDCalc \[ **5.2**\], the most broadly used medical reference for clinical decision tools \(including by 65% of US physicians\). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) updated its clinical practice guidelines in 2020 \[ **5.2**\]; it recommended IGHV mutational status analysis for CLL prior to treatment if not done at diagnosis, and repetition of the test when considering treatment with chemoimmunotherapy instead of novel BCR inhibitors. In 2018 IGHV analysis was listed as a standard in NHS England’s Genomic Test Directory for cancer \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Evidence from the UoS\-led, phase 3 REMoDL\-B trial \[ **3.6**, **G5**\] identified a subgroup of diffuse large B\-cell lymphoma \(DLBL\), *molecular high\-grade \(MHG\) lymphoma*, determined by gene expression profiling, with a clearly inferior prognosis \(progression\-free survival of 37% compared to 72% from a study of 928 patients\) \[ **5.3**\]. Published in 2019, the results identified a new patient group that can benefit from intensified chemotherapy or novel targeted therapies \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Development and approval of novel therapies targeting BCR signalling pathways** 

 A significant translational impact arising from Southampton’s insights into the centrality of BCR signalling as a prognostic marker \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] is the development and regulatory approval of new targeted therapies for CLL. The first\-in\-class ibrutinib, marketed as Imbruvica \(AbbVie and Janssen\), and the second generation acalabrutinib, marketed as Calquence \(Astrazeneca and Acerta\), specifically target BCR signalling pathways. Ibrutinib was first approved for CLL by the US FDA in 2014 and by NICE in 2017 for use on the NHS. Acalabrutinib received FDA approval in 2017 and EU approval in 2020. The clinical/patient benefits and economic impact of these BCR\-inhibitor therapies, initially derived from Southampton’s observations, has been vast, transforming CLL treatment by challenging the prior dominance of chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Annual sales revenues of ibrutinib alone reached USD7.24bn \(GBP5,460,000,000\) in 2019, with CLL the most profitable indication, while sales of acalabrutinib were USD522m \(GBP382,000,000\) in 2020 \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Clinical trials have demonstrated the significant clinical benefit of targeting BCR signalling using ibrutinib\-based regimens over immunochemotherapy, particularly for the U\-CLL group. In a phase 3 trial of previously untreated CLL receiving either ibrutinib\-based therapy or standard chemoimmunotherapy, ibrutinib\-based therapy resulted in much better progression\-free survival: 90.7% vs. 62.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death at 3 years, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14\-0.50 \[ **5.5**\]. Southampton was the leading centre in the phase 2 CLARITY trial, reporting the remarkable efficacy and low toxicity of ibrutinib in combination with BH3\-mimetic venetoclax in patients with recurrent CLL. This combination has shown unprecedented efficacy, with eradication of the disease in more than 60% of patients. The study marked the first demonstration that combining BCR targeting with BH3 mimetics can result in molecular eradication of CLL \[ **5.6**\]. In Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, Acerta invested GBP800,000 for Southampton to carry out the phase 1/2 ACCEPT trial of acalabrutinib in combination with standard chemoimmunotherapy \(2018\) and Astrazeneca invested GBP3,200,000 in Southampton\-led phase 2 trial REMoDL\-A to to establish whether this combined approach may become the new standard of care \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Changing standards of care and validating new treatments through large\-scale trials** 

 Southampton has led practice\-changing trials that have demonstrated the value of FDG\-PET imaging in lymphoma therapy. The phase 3 RATHL trial \[ **3.5**, **G2**\] showed that negative PET imaging after the first 2 months of treatment in **advanced Hodgkin lymphoma** could predict 5\-year progression\-free survival of 82%. For this group, the RATHL findings demonstrated that incidence of lung toxicity could be reduced without compromising cure rates by omitting the drug bleomycin, a treatment that had been used in chemotherapy for 30 years but which can cause long\-term lung damage. This finding translated into changes to clinical practice, as recommended in NHS guidelines, the 2018 European Society for Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) Guidelines and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) guidelines \[ **5.8**\]. The overall RATHL results showed 5 year survival of 95%, leading to adoption of treatment modulated according to PET results in the UK, wider Europe and US \[ **5.8**\]. 

 In **primary mediastinal lymphoma**, the international IELSG 26 trial of PET imaging led by Southampton showed 95% 5 year survival. This defined the response criteria to be used in this illness \(cited in 2016 ESMO guidelines \[ **5.9**\]\). In **follicular lymphoma**, the GALLIUM study \[ **3.7**\], for which Southampton led the correlative laboratory studies, demonstrated that progression\-free survival for patients treated with the novel anti\-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab \(80%\) was superior to that seen with the previous standard rituximab \(73%\) when given with chemotherapy. This changed practice internationally. Citing the Gallium results, the US FDA and the EU approved obinutuzumab \(tradename: Gazyva in US; Gazyvaro in Europe; Roche\) as a treatment, in combination with chemotherapy, for follicular lymphoma in 2017. In March 2018 NICE recommended obinutuzumab ‘ *as an option for untreated advanced follicular lymphoma in patients at higher risk*’ \[ **5.10**\]. This led to significant commercial impact too. As an indication, when obinutuzumab was approved with bendamustine for follicular lymphoma in 2016, the media reported a likely sales uplift for Roche of USD500m to USD1bn \[ **5.11**\]. In phase 3 UoS\-led trial SABRINA, the maintenance antibody therapy for follicular lymphoma – rituximab \(marketed by Roche as MabThera in Europe and Rituxan in US\) – was shown to be equally effective and safe when given subcutaneously as intravenously \(published in *Lancet Haematology*, 2017 \[ **5.12**\]\). This was shown to increase convenience for patients and reduce healthcare costs by 25%, from EUR1,956 per cycle to EUR1,460, or a total of EUR6,000 for the full course of treatment \[ **5.13**\]. As a direct result of SABRINA, the subcutaneous version of rituximab received approval for common forms of NHL from the EU in 2014 and the US in 2017. In 2014 NICE cited SABRINA as providing key evidence for its use \[ **5.14**\]. The commercial impact was significant; as an indication, rituximab has been one of Roche’s best\-selling drugs, with USD7.39bn \(GBP5,010,000,000\) in global sales in 2015 \[ **5.15**\] and in 2016 Roche said the subcutaneous version of MabThera had secured an average 35% market share \[ **5.16**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at Bournemouth University \(BU\) used digital analysis to confirm the presence of human fossil footprints at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. This discovery, and the ensuing media attention: 

-  Led to stronger site conservation and management, using bespoke freeware developed by BU to digitally preserve the footprints. 

-  Contributed to the upgrading of the US National Monument to National Park in December 2019, with the crucial inclusion of ‘palaeontology’ and ‘archaeology’ in its founding legislation. 

-  Contributed to, via re\-designation, an additional USD6,000,000 \(an increase of 16%\) for the local economy. 

-  Helped increase visitor numbers – by 18% in February 2020 and by 12% in September/October 2020 – despite the impact of Covid\-19.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Fossil footprints are an important, but neglected, part of the palaeontological and archaeological record. Bennett is a recognised authority on human footprints, having published widely on the subject and authored the only research text on the subject \[R1\], a reputation built on his work on the second oldest footprints in the world published in *Science* 2009 \[R2\]. His work was supported by a GBP316,599 Natural Environment Research Council \(NERC\) grant \(2010\-13\), which developed analytical approaches for the capture and analysis of human footprints. This work was translated into the freeware DigTrace, via a GBP97,487 NERC Innovation grant \[R3\].  DigTrace and similar ‘Structure from Motion’ photogrammetry approaches have revolutionised vertebrate ichnology, providing data for advanced biomechanical analysis, enhanced visualisation, and the preservation of fragile fossil footprints. 

 DigTrace was essential to this research and to track preservation. One of the key publications \[R4\] was 35th out of the top 200 palaeontological papers in 2018, and casts of the fossil tracks described are on display in the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. In December 2020, PLOS SciComm listed the findings as number one in its ‘Top 9 discoveries in human evolution, 2020 edition’. 

 The research is ongoing including the discovery and analysis of the longest known human trackway so far reported \[R5\].  Significantly the team have also pioneered the geo\-prospection of human tracks using geophysical methods \[R6, R7\]. Three popular articles linked to this research in *The Conversation* have a combined number of reads in excess of 410,000, and the work has featured in: *National Geographic*, *New York Times*, *Daily Telegraph*, *The Times*, *Atlantic*, BBC Radio, *Gizmodo*, *Live Science*, *New Scientist* and many more. The team exhibited at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition in 2018 and New Scientist Live in 2019. A Leverhulme Research grant was awarded in 2020 to one of the team at the Royal Veterinary College for ongoing work at WHSA.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In January 2017, the US National Park Service \(NPS\) was not sure how to proceed: they knew they had tracks of Ice Age animals at WHSA such as giant ground sloth and mammoth, but did they have human tracks? If they did, how old were they, what stories could they tell that would inspire visitors, and how should they be conserved? The last point was critical since the NPS has a legal responsibility to preserve natural heritage in designated areas. The problem is the tracks are located on an eroding gypsum lake\-bed in co\-use with the US Military. The White Sands Missile Range surrounds the WHSA. The Missile Range is famous as the site of the first nuclear test \(Trinity Site\), the historical home of NASA, numerous missile tests and now the landing site for the NASA/Boeing Starliner. 

 The tracks, known locally as ‘ghost tracks’, only appear under certain moisture conditions, making the management of this resource difficult. The NPS had no protocol for managing this resource; moreover, they had no money to do so. Federal funding within the NPS is dependent on the founding legislation for each Monument/Park and funds are only awarded for designated conservation interests. In this case, the only identified interest was the ‘largest gypsum dunes in the world’. Added to which, they had just started to negotiate a land swap with their military neighbours and, at the instigation of the local US Senator \(Martin Heinrich\), begun to explore a switch from Monument to Park. The NPS reached out to Bennett in June 2016 for advice based on \[R1\]. Bennett attended White Sands National Monument \(WHSA\) for the first time in January 2017. He has visited a further 10 times both for fieldwork and to help NPS staff revise their visitor experience. 

 Research collaboration ensued between Bennett and David Bustos, Resource Manager at WHSA, with the support of the Park’s Superintendent Marie Sauter and the head office in Washington DC. Human footprints were quickly confirmed and their interaction with Ice Age animals explored. Through this research \[R4, R5\], and the use of DigTrace, Bennett helped the NPS develop conservation management methods and approaches, enabling them to conserve digitally this eroding resource. Methods for mapping hidden tracks using geophysics were developed \[R6, R7\]. As a consequence, NPS staff had the tools to map the tracks and interact with their military neighbours from a position of knowledge for the first time. 

 The first big publication \[R4\], which was led, written, and co\-ordinated by Bennett as corresponding author, not only confirmed the presence of fossil human tracks, but described how those humans were actively hunting giant ground sloth. This work attracted a significant media profile, including a feature in a French/German documentary in 2019 \( *Terra X*\). It is also due to feature in an episode of *Ancient Mysteries Decoded* \( *Discovery*, 2021\) and a *Nova* *Documentary* for PBS America in 2021. NPS statistics indicate that the Advertising Value Equivalency \(AVE\) of the media coverage was USD762,923, with the story covered in 136 US news publications. Trending themes were words such as: “footprints”, “Bennett”, and “Ice Age”, with “White Sands National Monument” mentioned 121 times. 

 This platform of public interest was used in May 2018 by Heinrich and US Representative Xochitl Torres Small to launch draft legislation to re\-designate the Monument as a Park and include the words palaeontology and archaeology in the founding legislation \[E1\]. Independent research undertaken by the non\-profit research group Headwaters Economics at the time suggested that the economic impact to the local economy of Alamogordo \(Otero County\) was likely to be worth USD6,000,000 per annum due to an enhanced number of visitors \[E2\]. 

 The legislative process was slow, with a number of false starts. A letter from Heinrich to Bustos \(4 June 2018\) shows awareness of the research \[E3\], however, the influence became clearer when, in June 2019, Heinrich appeared before a crucial Senate Sub\-Committee \(19 June 2019\). In this he describes the hunting scene from the key paper \[R4; E4\]. In fact, it is the *only* evidence that he provides at this hearing for how important this site is. 

 In December 2019 President Trump signed the name change, new founding legislation, and associated land swap into law, and White Sands became the 62nd National Park in America. 

 On the 23 December 2019 Bustos wrote to Bennett \[E5\], confirming the importance of the track research to the legislative success, a fact acknowledged further by the NPS’s Chief of Science and Research, and Senior Palaeontologist \[E6, E7\]. A letter from the Sant \[sic\] Director of the Smithsonian National Museum confirms just how important the site is within the Americas \[E8\]. 

 Due to Covid\-19, evidencing the increase in visitor numbers, and therefore direct economic benefit, following re\-designation is difficult at the time of writing since the Park was closed for much of 2020. However, visitor numbers in February 2020 were up by approximately 18%, by 15% in September 2020 and 12% in October 2020, with resulting benefits to the local economy \[E9\]. 

 The role of DigTrace in helping the NPS develop its conservation management and visitor plans at WHSA is evidenced in a letter from the Chief of Science and Research at NPS \[E10\]. Research into the tracks at White Sands continues, with enhanced federal funding due in the 2020/21 fiscal year and a re\-design of their visitor experience underway.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Ongoing research in structural materials characterisation at Swansea University has enhanced the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of proprietary gas turbine engine components. Internationally recognised expertise has allowed for progression of new materials towards service and extended safe operation of in\-service components. Swansea research has attracted GBP4,600,000 of direct investment from Rolls\-Royce and has delivered critical technological solutions towards the manufacture of efficient and robust engines. Significant savings exceeding GBP3,500,000,000 has been achieved by Rolls\-Royce through reduction of component costs and safe life extension of critical rotating components.  Research performed by our team at Swansea University, as part of a larger collaborative effort, contributed to a 1% reduction in specific fuel consumption of Rolls\-Royce engines, leading to significant reduction in aerospace CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and enabling Rolls\-Royce to maintain a minimum 50% share in the global civil aviation market. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Reduction of carbon emissions from gas turbine engines is mainly achieved through reduction in weight or increases in operating temperature that increase thermal efficiency. Development of materials for these arduous operating conditions can only be validated through mechanical characterisation which allows for the declaration of safe operating lives of components. Swansea University is a University Technology Partner \(UTP\) within the framework of Rolls\-Royce University Technology Centres \(UTC\) that aims to support the company through a network of leading institutions. Examples of Swansea University’s ongoing expertise in this area, which contribute to impact for Rolls\-Royce are detailed below. 

 i\) **Titanium alloys** 

 Swansea University is a leader in the study of “cold dwell sensitivity” in near\-α titanium alloys, where extended periods under stress at low temperatures can cause premature fatigue failures. Cold dwell sensitivity was first acknowledged from the in\-service failure of Rolls\-Royce RB211 fan discs in the 1970s. Research undertaken at Swansea \(Prof Bache\) determined that the combination of anisotropic crystal plasticity and stress redistribution was attributed as the pre\-requisite for quasi\-cleavage facet formation and dwell\-induced failures. A series of seminal academic papers **\[R1\]** and keynote presentations at international conferences resulted. 

 The application of electron backscattered diffraction for measuring fracture surface crystal orientation and facet inclination was pioneered at Swansea and further developed for industry in 2010. The “Evans\-Bache” model which describes quasi\-cleavage facet formation, has been applied since 2000 to a range of alloys and has underpinned the exchange of coarse\-grained alloys \(e.g. Ti685, Ti829\) as compressor disc materials for alternatives \(Ti6\-4, Ti834, Ti6246\). As Swansea’s University Technology Partnership \(UTP\) Director, both Prof Bache and Prof Evans have provided independent, confidential scrutiny for titanium technologies including fan blade manufacture, stress concentration features in compressor discs and interpretation of fatigue crack initiation and growth in titanium metal matrix composites. 

 Research conducted under an EPSRC grant **\[G1\]** along with private venture \(PV\) funding **\[G2\]** married fundamental materials knowledge to non\-linear, strain\-based life prediction modelling procedures applied to Ti6\-4 fan disc material and Ti6246 compressor disc material. Similar PV\-funded studies, led by Prof Bache, focused on the Ti6246 compressor disc alloy **\[G3\]**. Two major collaborative EPSRC projects **\[G4, G5\]** assessed the processing/texture/property relationship and benefits of laser shock peening, respectively for the titanium alloy Ti6\-4. Parallel postgraduate programmes in 2011 characterised the fatigue behaviour of novel titanium alloys \(Ti\-639, Ti575\) for civil engine fan systems **\[R2\]**. 

 ii\) **Component design and safety** 

 Unrivalled testing facilities, in terms of scale and capability, to characterise constitutive behaviour and damage tolerance have underpinned advanced algorithms used to declare safe operational lives for Class “A” safety critical components. Such life prediction techniques encompassed intimate knowledge of creep\-fatigue\-environmental interactions. 

 Longstanding expertise in creep has been extended, superseding the “Theta” creep models with the “Wilshire Equations” after 2005. Prof Whittaker has applied the latter to various titanium, nickel, steel and intermetallic alloys, improving predictive capability in each case, specifically through extrapolation of limited data sets to extended conditions **\[R3\]**. As core partners in the EPSRC Strategic Partnership in Structural Metals for Gas Turbine Applications **\[G6\]**, Prof Whittaker, Dr Lancaster and Prof Bache extended modelling of creep behaviour to include thermo\-mechanical fatigue regimes and high\-temperature dwell crack growth **\[R4\]**, also incorporating novel work on thermo\-mechanical fatigue crack growth **\[R5\]**. Additionally, a suite of unique experimental facilities for the characterisation of hot corrosion informed compressor and turbine disc life prediction methodologies after in\-service sulphidation pitting \(Dr Perkins\). Parallel research \(between 2005 and 2020\) into a range of service critical issues was funded by Department of Trade and Industry \(DTI\)/Technology Strategy Board \(TSB\)/Innovate UK \(IUK\)/Aerospace Technology Institute \(ATI\) contracts exceeding GBP6,000,000 in value. Much of this research was directed towards nickel superalloys, especially RR1000 **\[R5\]**, feeding proprietary codes used to design recent engine variants, such as Rolls\-Royce’s Trent 1000/XWB. 

 iii\) **Novel materials** 

 Early creep and fatigue research \(Prof Bache\) into ceramic matrix composites \(CMCs\), encompassing silicon nitride, silicon carbide and alumina\-based systems, has been conducted with the aim to develop commercially viable CMC aero\-engine components. Notable projects include a study to establish a UK processing capability for oxide\-oxide CMCs **\[G7\]**, evaluation of fatigue and thermo\-mechanical fatigue of silicon carbide fibre/silicon carbide matrix CMCs **\[G8\]**. Additionally, influential research on the processing and properties of additive structures \(titanium, steel and nickel variants\) spawned international expertise in the field of miniaturized test techniques and joining of high\-performance materials. More specifically research into solid state welding processes for bladed disk \(blisk\) applications through has been implemented for titanium\-based alloys for compressor disc applications \(Dr Jeffs\) **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As one of three major international manufacturers with an underlying revenue exceeding GBP15,000,000,000 \(as of 2018\), Rolls\-Royce supplies approximately 50% of the global large civil aeroengine market. Over 4,000 Trent engines are currently in service \(including the 900/1000/7000/XWB engines\) and this number is projected to increase to around 7,500 by 2030. Swansea’s research into the mechanical characterisation of metallic alloys and ceramics provided significant and tangible impact, enabling the definition of safe operational envelopes for various titanium and nickel alloys utilised in fan, compressor and turbine applications across the Trent fleet. 

 Swansea academics contribute to confidential, non\-advocate company reviews. ‘Red\-Top’ investigations are used to assess issues relating to the processing and safe operation of engine components. Within the REF period \(between 2014 and 2020\), as an expert non\-advocate reviewer Prof Bache supported a major review between 2016 and 2019 into cold dwell related in\-service experience, life prediction models and laboratory validations and scrutinised the implementation of academic understanding of hot corrosion into company protocols. In particular, the review of cold dwell led to a revised processing route for the disc alloy Ti834 in 2014, which had commercial impact through the increased competitiveness of disc components. The work by Bache was also referenced in the 2020 Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses \(BEA\) Accident Report of an AIRBUS A380\-861 \(https://www.bea.aero/fileadmin/uploads/tx\_elydbrapports/BEA2017\-0568.en.pdf\) **\[C1\]**. 

 Swansea’s expertise has led to Rolls\-Royce’s direct investment between 2014 and 2020 exceeding GBP4,600,000 and involvement as a core member in the second phase of the EPSRC Rolls\-Royce Strategic Partnership in Structural Metallic Systems for Gas Turbines \(between 2014 and 2019\). This programme was set up with the clear aim that, through fundamental research, it would provide the foundation for next\-generation aero\-engines that, running hotter or faster than current designs, deliver significant improvements in engine efficiency and environmental impact  Furthermore, Swansea’s research has led to a spin out company, Swansea Materials Research & Testing Ltd \(SMaRT\), incorporated in 2009 **\[C2\]**, which greatly increased experimental capacity \(approximately three fold in terms of test frames\) for the research team at Swansea. This expansion proved to be a major factor in facilitating much of the impact described below. 

 Through the development of this unique partnership between Swansea University and Rolls\-Royce, Swansea’s research has been transferred to Rolls\-Royce and their key supply chain companies. Critical research undertaken at Swansea has led to technological contributions to the manufacture of efficient and safe gas turbines, which include the following examples: 

-  Swansea’s research into thermo\-mechanical fatigue crack growth **\[R5\]**, contributed to the safe life extension of disc materials. As described by the Project Manager for Universities within Rolls\-Royce: 

 “*Life extension has allowed for revision of disc service intervals from 3,600 cycles to 4,000 cycles. Over the lifetime of the engine this leads to a reduction in overhauls from 10 to 9 \(around £1M in spares and labour costs per overhaul\). The number of Trent 900/1000/XWB engines delivered in the REF period \(since 2013\) exceeds 3,500, therefore providing an approximate £3.5b ongoing cost avoidance over the lifetime of these engines.*” **\[C3\]**. 

-  Swansea has also worked closely with Rolls\-Royce strategic suppliers on the fundamental understanding of new titanium alloys **\[R2\]**. The research supports the wider application of titanium alloys for life cycle cost reduction and component optimisation. To quote a Rolls\-Royce titanium specialist: 

 “*A new alloy has been implemented in 2017 as part of an improved fan system, realising a cost reduction of \~£25k per engine.*” **\[C4\]**. 

-  Investigations into solid\-state welding processes for bladed disks \(blisks\) **\[R6\]** led to a cost avoidance of GBP250,000 per blisk component from 2014 due to refined safety tolerances in assessing weld process data concessions **\[C5\]**. 

 It is recognised that the combined University Technology Centre \(UTC\) portfolio has had significant impact on gas turbine emissions *.* 

 *“The research conducted directly by Swansea on industrially related programmes combined with the UTC UK portfolio has enabled Rolls\-Royce to deliver over 1% reduction in specific fuel consumption \(SFC\). This 1% reduction has translated into reductions in the millions of tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> being emitted into the atmosphere.”* Head of Capability Acquisition – Materials, Rolls Royce **\[C6\]**. 

 This represents significant environmental and economic impact given that the aviation sector accounts for 9% of UK energy consumption and Rolls\-Royce supplies approximately 50% of the global large civil engine market. Since the ongoing goals of the industry are to improve efficiency and reduce emissions through higher operating temperatures, Swansea’s input through all stages of the engine manufacturing process has contributed to the volumes of sulphur\- and nitrogen\-based emissions being progressively reduced, meeting objectives set by international government agencies \(such as ACARE 2020/FLIGHTPATH 2050\). 

 The Trent 7000 model features a decrease of 10% in SFC compared to the Trent 700. However, the increased temperatures required to improve thermal efficiency places significant demands on existing alloys, as they are expected to operate beyond their original design limits. A detailed understanding of the role of microstructure on fatigue has allowed rationalisation amongst modelling procedures allowing for safe life extension through reduction of overly conservative safety factors.  Swansea has underpinned novel alloy development \(i.e., RR1000\) **\[R4\]** by characterising mechanical behaviour at continually increasing temperatures and subsequently evaluating in\-service findings, both of which allow the company to manufacture fuel efficient engines and remain competitive in terms of engine sales, by using this alloy, which is currently employed in over 4,000 in\-service Trent engines **\[C6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2013 Durham University research on the urban dimension of climate change governance has directly shaped the conceptual development and practical application of UN\-Habitat’s approach to urban climate governance, principally through Bulkeley’s role in the development of their Guiding Principles for City Climate Action Planning and associated toolkit. Endorsed by 45 of the key transnational organisations working to support urban action on climate change, the Guiding Principles represent a step change in the global policy arena by articulating for the first time the fundamental basis upon which cities should take action. As well as advancing the position of cities and climate change in the UN system and amongst partner organisations, the Guiding Principles have been used to develop and evaluate strategies at the city scale. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at Durham University, led by Bulkeley, has played a pioneering role in the field of urban climate change, and built sustained partnerships with UN\-Habitat and other key actors in the international policy arena. Bulkeley’s research has established that climate governance has an important urban dimension that is critical to achieving long\-term global goals, including ensuring that climate action is sufficient to meet the 1.5°C Paris target and is compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\). In particular, this work has identified the multiple ways in which cities govern climate change \(reference **R1**\), revealed the growth of ‘experimentation’ as a means through which climate change action is undertaken \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\), and demonstrated the critical importance of issues of social and environmental justice for designing effective policy and ensuring that the consequences of urban climate action are taken into account \( **R2**, **R3**, **R5**\). 

 Bulkeley’s research initially established that urban climate governance is a multilevel and multifaceted process *,* challenging the orthodox focus on the national or international scales as the most important arenas for climate action \( **R1**\). Because it involves multiple actors undertaking diverse actions, urban climate governance has significant potential for achieving the changes necessary to address global climate challenges. Having gained wide recognition for this perspective, further research led by Bulkeley during an ESRC Fellowship in 2008\-2012 collected and analysed evidence of how climate governance happens in cities, identifying innovation at the urban scale as well as the conditions and constraints that shape urban climate action. This evidence base included a database of 627 climate experiments in 100 cities worldwide \( **R2**\). The evidence was supplemented by in\-depth case\-study research in five cities \(Bangalore, Monterrey, Hong Kong, Philadelphia, Berlin\). Additional case\-study work was undertaken by Durham PhD students in Cape Town and São Paulo \( **R2**, **R6**\). A further report commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation undertaken by Bulkeley and PDRA Fuller \(2011\) addressed climate justice as it related to urban climate governance \( **R5**\). 

 By building an evidence base and advancing new frameworks through which that evidence can be interpreted, the research has systematically demonstrated that a new form of governance through ‘experimentation’ has become central to urban responses to climate change \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\). Experimentation involves purposive interventions in urban socio\-technical systems designed to respond to the imperatives of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the city \( **R3**, **R4**\). The research demonstrated that in order to develop more effective strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change, city governments, nation states and transnational organisations need to engage with the diversity of experimentation in different urban contexts, how these experiments are conducted, and their implications for urban governance and urban life. Rather than relying on existing models of urban planning, harnessing the power of experimentation means fostering new governance arrangements that involve a wide range of urban private and civil society actors \( **R2**, **R3**, **R6**\). The research found that this shift raises profound questions of justice \( **R2**, **R6**\), demonstrating that existing concepts of climate justice fail to properly consider its urban dimensions and that the explicit inclusion of justice principles is imperative for the long\-term success of urban climate governance \( **R2**, **R5**\). Crucially, the research revealed that the existing multilevel governance frameworks used by transnational networks and international organisations to deliver urban action were unable to support this new mode of experimentation. Existing approaches assume that knowledge precedes policy design and that implementation follows a highly structured planning process, in which public authorities can be held to account for ensuring just outcomes. Experimentation, in contrast, proceeds through an iterative process where implementation, learning, and contestation are simultaneous, and where there are multiple actors involved in securing just outcomes. The research found that new mechanisms capable of supporting experimentation alongside traditional planning approaches would be needed if their potential to deliver long\-term, transformational change was to be realised, including ways of enabling coordinated action by different actors while promoting justice \( **R2**, **R5**, **R4**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Impact of the Durham research on international climate change policy and practice has occurred through Bulkeley’s lead role in co\-authoring the UN\-Habitat's Guiding Principles for City Climate Action Planning \(evidence sources **E1, E2**\). UN\-Habitat directly supports capacity building for urban governance and is the UN agency responsible for implementing the UN’s 2016 New Urban Agenda, which is focused on climate change and the SDGs. It is the central international institution responsible for bringing together urban and climate change agendas, with a recognised mandate to do so by all UN member states. 

 Before the REF2021 period, Bulkeley was commissioned to write on the mitigation of climate change for UN\-Habitat’s 2011 Cities and Climate Change: Global Report on Human Settlements \(Chapter 5\). Her research was also used by the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development, International Energy Agency, the World Bank, and other international organisations to support and substantiate the position that climate change was a multilevel governance issue with an important urban dimension. In addition, Bulkeley provided the evidence base for the Strategic Review of International City Climate Networks commissioned by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, the key funder for the influential C40 Cities Leadership network, and published in March 2013 \( **E3**\). That impact pre\-dates the REF2021 period and we do not claim it here, but it provides an important pathway to impact during the period because it resulted in direct participation with a range of organisations working to design, implement, and finance urban climate action. Bulkeley was subsequently invited to be Contributing Lead Author on the relationship between cities and climate change for the 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) \(2014; WG III Chapters 12 and 14\). This culminated in the co\-production of the Global Research and Action Agenda on Cities and Climate Change Science at the inaugural CitiesIPCC meeting in Edmonton, Canada, in March 2018 \( **E4**\). In the words of the Head of Programmes for the Coalition for Urban Transitions, a transnational initiative supporting national governments to tackle climate change through urban action, *‘Harriet’s research continues to set and shape the global agenda*’ \( **E5**\) **.** 

 As a member of the Advisory Group of the UN\-Habitat Cities and Climate Change Initiative, Bulkeley has played a key role in the development of the UN\-Habitat Guiding Principles for City Climate Action Planning \(UNHGP\) from their inception and through their ongoing 2020 revision **.** Bulkeley was one of three academics on the eight\-person drafting committee for the UNHGP \( **E1**\) and was a lead research academic contributor to the accompanying toolkit, published in 2017 \( **E2**\) **.** The UNHGP provided the focus of UN\-Habitat’s involvement in the 2015 Paris Climate COP and were launched at that event, with Bulkeley as part of the delegation **.** 

 The UNHGP are a series of eight principles developed to underpin a step change in how urban policymakers plan and deliver action for climate change. Their aim is to provide a global benchmark of the fundamental building blocks needed for effective and socially just climate action that could be used by the wide array of organisations now working on urban climate action. While many different tools and frameworks had been developed to support cities in implementing climate plans, the UNHGP responded to three important imperatives. First, most existing frameworks were built for cities with high levels of capacity and resources. The UNHGP were intended to be a flexible framework that would support cities at all levels of development. Second, by focusing on the underlying principles of good climate action planning, the UNHGP were designed to be capable of supporting more traditional plan\-based action as well as the growing mode of governing through experimentation. Third, the UNHGP provided the first framework that explicitly identified climate justice as a critical dimension of effective urban action. 

 According to the UNHGP, city climate action plans should be ambitious, inclusive, fair, comprehensive and integrated, relevant, actionable, evidence\-based, and transparent and verifiable. The accompanying toolkit was developed to allow UN\-Habitat and other actors \(including city governments and other transnational organisations\) to operationalise the principles. Based on her research, Bulkeley proposed several of the principles \(ambitious, fair, inclusive and relevant\) and supported the formulation of the other principles through corroborating their significance with the evidence base of climate change experiments summarised in section 2. In particular, Bulkeley ensured that principles of justice were explicitly written into the UNHGP in ways that captured the importance of fairness and inclusivity \( **E1**, Paragraphs 18 and 46\). As UN\-Habitat states, *‘Issues of social justice are particularly important to UN\-Habitat’s mandate, and Professor Bulkeley’s research helped us to formulate principles that place these issues as central to effective climate action at the city scale*’ \( **E6**\). In addition, her research was used to support the idea that climate action at the urban level should be relevant to its context and the multiple actors engaged \( **E1**, Paragraph 29\), and that such action must first and foremost be ambitious, building on the potential for innovation shown in the evidence base on experimentation \( **E1**, Paragraph 38\). Bulkeley developed explicit recognition in the UNHGP of the multiple modes of governing climate action, drawing on the key research conclusion that planning frameworks need to be opened up to accommodate the new mode of experimentation \( **E1**, Paragraphs 39\-41 and Figure 3\). UN\-Habitat state that Bulkeley’s *‘research has been an invaluable resource and she has played a key role in the development of the guiding principles’* \( **E6**\). 

 UN\-Habitat have described the publication of the UNHGP as *‘a landmark moment for UN\-Habitat, representing the culmination of several months of intense work with our partners to produce guidance that could be used by the wide variety of cities with whom we work to advance their work on climate change and the flagship report that we presented as an agency to the 2015 Paris Climate COP’* \( **E6**\). The UNHGP have come to serve as a key vehicle through which \(a\) UN\-Habitat has advanced the cities and climate change agenda within the UN system, and \(b\) networks and individual city governments seeking to enhance climate action on the ground have been able to both set the agenda and ensure that action is pinpointed at the most critical issues. We describe these further impacts in turn. 

####  Advancing the position of the cities and climate agenda within the UN system 

 The UNHGP are central to how UN\-Habitat advocate globally for the role of cities and urban action in addressing climate change. They provided an important step for the organisation in developing their niche position as the only UN agency capable of working between international and local levels to advance climate action through the use of strategic frameworks and technical advice. Within UN\-Habitat’s Climate Change Unit, they helped *‘crystallise*’ what their *‘priorities for working with cities on climate action should entail’* \( **E6**\). Crucially, the UNHGP have allowed UN\-Habitat to bring the overall weight and importance of urban climate action to the fore within the UN system and with partner organisations; the Lead Programme Officer of the unit says that 

 *‘The Guiding Principles also served to cement the importance of climate change as an agenda within the organisation more broadly, by demonstrating how climate action is central to UN\-Habitat’s core mission of enhancing urban sustainability through the New Urban Agenda and the sustainable development goals. They have proven an important means through which to demonstrate to external actors that UN\-Habitat sees the climate change agenda as a critical issue, whilst also helping to translate this agenda internally \[within the UN\] by showing its relevance to wider goals and principles of urban planning and development*’ \( **E6**\). 

 Subsequently, UN\-Habitat has identified strengthened climate action and improved urban environment as one of its four strategic goals for 2020\-2023, and a new version of the UNHGP is being developed in order to underpin this mandate. By invitation, Bulkeley has taken a leading role in the early stages of the revision process, sitting on UN\-Habitat’s review and drafting committees. Due to COVID\-19, the process of developing the UNHGP was put on hold in March 2020 but is expected to resume in early 2021 \( **E6**\). 

####  Enhancing climate strategy and evaluation at the city scale 

 The UNHGP have informed the support, policy advice, and training that UN\-Habitat provides to individual cities in order to advance climate action \( **E6**\), including Glasgow \(UK\), Vilankulo \(Mozambique\), Rajkot \(India\), and Legazpi \(the Philippines\). For example, in Glasgow the UNHGP and toolkit were used by UN\-Habitat to conduct an evaluation of the city’s climate action plan. The assessment concluded that the city’s adaptation plans were not transformative in the sense of addressing and improving the underlying structural vulnerabilities of communities. Moreover, UN\-Habitat found that Glasgow’s *Resilient Strategy*, while representing an advanced state of planning that considers the needs of a range of communities, could be improved in relation to the principle of fairness \( **E7**\). The UNGHP have also been used by UN\-Habitat to design the second phase of their Urban Low Emissions Development Strategies Programme \( **E6**\). Funded by the EU and undertaken with Local Governments for Sustainability, the programme supports low emission and resilient development in more than 60 cities in 8 countries. 

 Beyond the direct work of UN\-Habitat, the UNGHP have provided an important resource for partner organisations that advance city climate action planning. For example, they have been integrated into the indicators used by the World Wildlife Fund in its One Planet City Challenge \( **E8,** p.11\) which seeks to evaluate and support urban climate change planning and has involved over 400 cities in 5 continents to date. The Challenge is used annually to identify national and international finalists who meet UNGHP\-based criteria for advancing transformative climate action planning. The World Wildlife Fund then works with finalists to further develop action on the ground and best practice for other cities to follow. The UNGHP have thus formed a benchmark against which international performance on climate action planning is evaluated, recognised, and promoted, supporting city\-level action around the world. 

 It is also notable that Metro Vancouver, a region that led on climate action by developing its first strategy in 1990, has adopted the UNHGP for its Climate 2050 Strategic Framework \( **E9**\). The framework seeks to further the ambition of the region to carbon neutral by 2050 and to ensure resilience to the impact of climate change. The city has highlighted the benefit of using the UNHGP in encouraging *‘consistent and comparable approaches*’ to effective climate action planning around the world \( **E9**, p.11\). Given that Metro Vancouver has been at the forefront of climate action, their use of the UNHGP is an important measure of their utility and capacity for framing and motivating climate action at the city level.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Department of Journalism research into gender representation in the six flagship UK news programmes revealed significant under\-representation of women as experts \(i.e. specialists in their field\), who were outnumbered by men by a ratio of 4.4:1 in 2013. The Expert Women survey research and subsequent campaign \(2012\-2020\) for better representation held the industry to account and changed the faces and voices of British broadcasting by the late 2010s. Twice as many women interviewees now appear on radio and TV flagship news broadcasts in the UK compared to 2014; hence, broadcast news better reflects the expertise and authority that women contribute to UK society. Moreover, the Expert Women project is credited with inspiring the BBC’s 50:50 Equality Scheme, BBC Training Academy’s Expert Women days, a training initiative for women medical scientists at the Academy of Medical Sciences \(UK\) and Australia’s world\-first Superstars of STEM programme, as well as influencing the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research, which draws on ongoing work by Franks on the roles, experiences and visibility of women in UK news \[3.1\], specifically explores how women feature as on\-air experts in broadcast news reports. It rests on multiple data sets including analysis of the gender representation of expert interviewees on flagship UK broadcast news, focused interviews with broadcast journalists, questionnaire surveys and responses of expert women in various fields \[3.2, 3.3\]. 

 Baseline data collection began in 2012, with Howell examining the role and prominence of women experts on UK broadcast news programmes. Preliminary findings were disseminated in regular articles for *Broadcast* magazine, a UK trade publication read and respected by industry practitioners. 

  

 Systematic monthly data collection was then undertaken from 2013, with a focus on collecting data from four leading UK news programmes that reach total audiences of approximately 6 million per day: BBC News at Ten, ITV News at Ten, Sky News at randomised times, and the ‘Today’ programme on BBC Radio 4. Data from 2013 revealed an overall ratio of 4.4:1 male to female experts on these flagship UK news shows. This compares with a ratio of 2.5:1 of men to women experts overall in the UK public sphere, for instance at senior levels in law, academia and politics, along with expert court witnesses. 

 In 2014, the study was widened to include Channel 4 News and Channel 5 News. Three further sets of data also were gathered to complement the counting of on\-air experts \[3.3\].  An email questionnaire was distributed to a subset of British broadcast journalists/producers holding junior positions in their news organisation; such people frequently serve as “bookers” for external contributors. In addition, 25 in\-person interviews were conducted with British broadcast journalists of diverse newsroom ranks. A further email questionnaire asking mainly open\-ended questions was distributed to 164 women experts across the UK. All the experts had attended the BBC Academy’s Expert Women training days – an initiative which itself was a direct response to the work undertaken by Howell assisted by colleagues in the Journalism Department. Obtaining the views of women experts themselves and the content producers who booked them provided insights into the reasons for the wide gender disparity in on\-air contributors; notably the reluctance of female experts to put themselves forward and the exasperation of time\-pressed producers who felt they had to work hard to persuade qualified women to participate, frequently to be turned down after a lengthy conversation with the response that “they somehow felt unqualified to appear.” <ins>Findings were published in</ins> <ins> *Journalism Practice*</ins> <ins>in</ins> <ins>2017 \[</ins><ins>3.</ins><ins>2a</ins><ins>\]</ins><ins>, an article selected by the editors for adaptation and re\-publication in a form intended to speak d</ins><ins>irectly to media practitioners \[</ins><ins>3.</ins><ins>2</ins><ins>b</ins><ins>\]</ins><ins>, and</ins> <ins>subsequently in a book chapter \[</ins><ins>3.</ins><ins>2c</ins><ins>\]</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 In addition to informing the research outputs in section 3, both the quantitative data analysing the proportion of experts and the qualitative data providing the views of producers and expert participants were disseminated widely via parliamentary testimony, conferences, media appearances and press commentary \[3.4\]. This public dissemination commanded attention to the disparity between genders in the use of experts on broadcast news programmes and provided an impetus for industry initiatives to address this problem.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2012, Howell began counting the number of women experts on six flagship news programmes for one week each month. Findings were regularly disseminated, first in *Broadcast* magazine and then through academic articles, press releases and media appearances, notably on the BBC Radio 4 Media Show, which devoted a programme to City’s research in January 2013. Three ‘Women on Air’ conferences in 2014, 2016, and 2018 were attended by politicians, academics, and, crucially, the editors of the programmes monitored. At the first Women on Air conference in April 2014, the figures showed 4.4 men to every woman interviewed across leading UK news programmes. By the second conference in 2016, this was just over 3:1, and by 2018 it was 2:1 – much more reflective of the prevalence of women experts in UK society. 

 Industry professionals, academics and politicians all attributed this improvement to City research and the pressure on broadcasters that resulted from it. Participants discussed the figures produced by City, seeking to explain them or account for the disparity and, importantly, publicly committing to improvement. In 2018, for example, the Editor of BBC News at Six and Ten pledged additional steps to increase the proportion of women used as experts after the City survey showed his programme had made progress but still trailed its rivals. Reacting to the figures, the Editor stated: “ *I’m frustrated, disappointed … and I’m going to have to work harder to make sure that doesn’t happen again*” \[5.1\]. He was as good as his word. In February 2020, BBC News at Ten had a ratio of just 1.5 male experts to 1 female expert – compared with 3.7:1 in 2012\-2013. Also on the panel was Ofcom’s Director of Standards and Audience Protection who said tackling diversity concerns in the media was a gradual process. “ *I think there’s a frustration that no\-one has fixed the problem yet, and I don’t think you can with diversity*,” she said. “ *A bit like your report, Lis, you have to keep shining a spotlight on the same issues over and over and over again*” \[5.1\]. The Minister of State for the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport at the time remarked at the event how supporting women across the whole workforce was *‘a top priority for the government’* and how “ *increasing our representation in the media is especially critical because \[those of you in the media\] really do have the power to have a big influence on the changes in society*” \[5.1\]. 

 Institutional change within the BBC was affected as a result of publicising the research findings \[3.4\] which were widely disseminated, e.g. Radio 4 Media Show \[5.2\] and at various City conferences \[5.1\]. The BBC Academy \(the training arm of the BBC\) started Expert Women days in 2013. To date, these dedicated training days, which the organiser described as “ *a direct result of Lis Howell’s research*” \[5.3\], have recruited nearly 500 women subject specialists, who between them have made more than a thousand media appearances \[5.3\]. The BBC further committed to change by way of the 50:50 Initiative, which was described by the Academy’s training organiser as “ *the biggest BBC project to result from Lis’s research*” \[5.3\]. Under this grassroots project, BBC producers seek to achieve gender equality across the range of BBC programmes. The originator of the 50:50 Initiative also attributed the momentum behind this initiative to Howell’s work: “ *Thanks Lis\! As you know, you were and are a huge inspiration for what we do*” \[5.4\]. 

 In 2014, the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications held an inquiry into “Women in News and Current Affairs Broadcasting”, bringing in Howell as Specialist Adviser and Franks as a witness; the then\-Committee Chair said the resulting report “ *spelled out the slow progress in achieving proportionate representation of women in broadcasting and has proved influential. Much of the success of this Inquiry is attributable to the guidance and support by Professor Howell … and has had an enduring impact, as witnessed by the substantial improvement in the representation of women in news and current affairs broadcasting which is now evident*” \[5.5\]. 

 Further support for the impact of this research comes from news editors themselves: “ *You have motivated an industry – and held it to account*” stated BBC’s Editor of BBC News at Six and Ten \[5.6\]. Channel 4’s News Editor, said of the research: “ *I think the authority that you bring to it – to hold us all to account – it is a scary process. … When you first started it, there was a massive spurt of shock, the figures were so bad*” \[5.1\]. The Channel 5 News Editor said: “ *It’s a brilliant achievement – I think Ben \(de Pear\) put it best when he said how ‘nervous’ newsrooms feel when \(your\) data is due to be released*\!” \[5.7a\]. 

 This work also had impact beyond broadcasting and government. When the Academy of Medical Sciences won the Royal Society Athena Prize 2018 for a training initiative aimed at women medical scientists, credit was attributed to Howell from the Academy of Medical Sciences’ Communications Director: “ *The judges’ comments flagged that we had been awarded the prize for ‘developing an evidence based approach to addressing the issue \[the shortage of women experts commenting in the media\]’ and \[that\] Lis’s research was very much at the heart of that evidence base*.” \[5.9\] The indiviudal who led the Academy of Medical Sciences’ training programme, wrote: “ *Lis Howell has in my view had a transformational impact on the media in the UK, and its attitude towards gender imbalance. The forensic nature of Lis’s research in showing exactly which programmes were performing the worst in terms of female representation meant that this attitude was no longer tenable. I feel Lis has made a very real and important contribution towards shaping the role of women in the UK media – and beyond*.” \[5.8\]. The Communications Director, in describing the Academy’s proactive approach, wrote: “ *As a result of Lis’s research in 2014, the Academy of Medical Sciences began developing and implementing initiatives…not just to ensure journalists have access to the best experts available, but also to provide highly visible role models of senior scientists to inspire the next generation of women researchers and scientific leaders to say ‘yes, I can do that too’ … \[It has\] also supported nearly 200 women to sign up to the Science Media Centre’s database of experts*” \[5.9\]. 

 This contribution also is evidenced in other countries. The former CEO of Science & Technology Australia, wrote: “ *Lis Howell’s research was one of the key factors in influencing my decision to establish the world\-first Superstars of STEM program, in 2016/17. The program works with a small group of competitively selected women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics \(STEM\) over 24 months, equipping them with the skills, networks and opportunities to become public figures. It has won respect and acclaim from senior leaders in the sector, the media, business and government, in Australia and internationally … The first pilot program of 30 women clocked up more than 2,500 news clips between them*” \[5.10\]. 

 <ins>It is worth noting the success of several years’ worth of</ins> <ins>applied pres</ins><ins>sure on the broadcasting sector</ins> <ins>to increase the visibility of women on air</ins> <ins>does not imply</ins> <ins>present or future</ins> <ins>success of</ins> <ins>showcasing women as specialists in their field</ins><ins>.</ins>  <ins>Monitoring during the early months of the Covid\-19 pandemic</ins> <ins>revealed</ins> <ins>the ratio of male to female experts bucked the progressive trend and regressed in March and May 2020.</ins> However, even at its worst ratio of 2.7 male experts to each female expert in March 2020, the much wider disparity of 2014 has not returned. As Channel 5’s News Editor describes the expert gender situation: Commitment “ *is crucial in making sure we don’t lose focus and reverse the progress that has been made*” \[<ins>5.7b\].</ins>

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research and innovation at UCL’s Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory has led to the first commercially available wearable brain imaging devices \(LUMO\). The high\-density optical brain imaging system developed at UCL has been commercialised via a UCL spin\-out company – Gowerlabs. The LUMO system, which allows brain activity to be measured under almost any conditions for the first time, is used by tech giants \(Facebook, Apple\), the healthcare technology sector \(Philips\) and medical research institutions \(Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden\). The technology is opening up new avenues for studying brain activity which have been widely publicised in the media. Gowerlabs, which employs 5.0 FTE, has achieved worldwide sales exceeding \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] since August 2013.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Diffuse Optical Tomography \(DOT\), also known as functional near\-infrared spectroscopy \(fNIRS\), measures brain activity using low levels of near\-infrared light that travels through the brain cortex via the scalp and skull. It is delivered using an array of sources and detectors that are placed on the head. DOT devices measure the intensity of the light that is diffusely reflected back from the brain cortex and which is sensitive to localised changes in blood volume and oxygenation that result from neurological activity. Recorded data can be presented as maps of changes that result from sensory stimuli and cognitive activity, as well as from certain neurological disorders and brain trauma. The near\-infrared light used for DOT is non\-ionizing, so repeated exposure is completely safe. Whilst DOT and functional MRI both use haemoglobin as the source of biological contrast, DOT devices are a fraction of the cost and size of a conventional MRI scanner. The small form factor of these systems also makes them ideal for portable and wearable applications. 

 Dr Nick Everdell and his multidisciplinary group at the UCL Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory \(BORL\) have made significant improvements to this technology. The original benchtop device – the Near\-Infrared Tomography System \(NTS\) – was developed by Dr Nick Everdell, Professor David Delpy and Professor Jem Hebden, in the BORL – at UCL for the development of optical and photoacoustic technology in medical imaging – with support from a Wellcome Trust grant in 2005 \( **R1**\). This project established the efficacy of their chosen multiplexing technology – frequency encoding. This type of encoding facilitates rapid imaging rates \(up to 10Hz\) by allowing all the light sources to be illuminated simultaneously, while allowing the detectors to discriminate between them. This higher rate is important as it prevents the possibility of interference from the cardiac pulsation of blood vessels. 

 Their novel encoding system meant that the optical sources and detectors could be flexibly placed wherever was convenient on the head, unlike most competitor systems at that time. This enabled EEG electrodes to be easily interleaved with the sources and detectors, allowing straightforward integration of the two technologies to give a multimodal imaging system. Singh *et al*. \( **R2**\) were the first to demonstrate an association between neonatal seizures and large, localised changes in haemoglobin concentration within the cortex of the infant brain. This was one of several clinical research findings that were made possible by this system. 

 In 2013 the group was awarded a Healthcare Technology Challenge grant by EPSRC \(EP/K020315/1\) and GBP400,000 was committed to the development of a next\-generation imaging system. The aim was to develop a high\-density, wearable and wireless device that would significantly increase imaging resolution and be applicable in a real\-world setting. The system developed \(microNTS\) was the first ever miniaturized, fibreless DOT system, able to generate high quality images with a flexible array configuration. This world\-leading device dispensed with the heavy optical fibres of the benchtop design and placed the light sources and detectors directly on the scalp \( **R3**\). This improves signal quality as well as providing a wearable system that greatly expands the potential range of applications of the technology. As part of this grant, a multi\-wavelength wearable device was also developed, specifically measuring changes in cytochrome oxygenation in addition to the haemoglobin changes that the first device measured. Cytochrome oxidase is a biomarker of cell metabolism and, unlike haemoglobin, its measurement can give valuable information about the internal environment of the cell. Chitnis *et al*. \( **R4**\) describes the first ever multiwavelength wearable system designed for this purpose. 

 Brain imaging systems, including DOT, are calibrated using phantoms – materials that have similar properties to human tissue and can be designed to mimic brain activation. Dr Everdell’s research group pioneered development of tissue\-equivalent optical phantoms. The group developed the first multimodal phantom to allow simultaneous EEG and near\-infrared measurements \( **R5**\). They also developed the first electrically activated dynamic phantom for near\-infrared measurements \( **R6**\). 

 This underpinning research led to successful knowledge transfer via the founding of Gowerlabs as a spin\-out company from BORL. Dr Everdell was recognised as an exceptional innovator by the Royal Academy of Engineering and was awarded an Enterprise Fellowship in 2015. 

 As well as Dr Everdell, the following people have significant input into Gowerlabs: 

-  Professor Jeremy Hebden – former Head of Department \- joined UCL in 1992 

-  Dr Robert Cooper – EPSRC Research Fellow \- joined UCL in 2007 

-  Dr Samuel Powell – RAEng Research Fellow \- at UCL between 2009 and 2018, currently employed by the University of Nottingham.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Human brain imaging is critical for both clinical practice and neuroscience research. The technologies currently in use, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging \(fMRI\) and positron emission tomography \(PET\) are expensive, immobile and require designated hospital space or research facilities. For example, the systems cannot be used to monitor the brain at the hospital bedside, at home, or in an ambulance. Also, they are unsuitable for studying the brain during a task involving movement, or during human interactions. These systems also require the subject to remain motionless for several minutes during the procedure, inhibiting studies of the developing brain in babies and toddlers. Through UCL\-led innovations and commercialisation via a UCL spin\-out company, Gowerlabs, the DOT system has been adapted and developed to provide high\-quality, real\-time images of human brain function in a truly wearable package that is now in use worldwide, both for research and development and by large corporations such Facebook and Apple. The products have generated revenues of GBP2,762,000 to date and are providing new ways to explore brain activity in real time. 

 **Product innovation and application** 

 Building on UCL\-led research, Gowerlabs has developed three key product lines: 

-  The benchtop NTS brain mapping system \( **R1**\) 

-  The patented, wearable and fibreless fNIRS brain imaging system LUMO \( **R3**\) 

-  A range of optical phantoms that mimic human tissues \( **R5, R6**\). 

 The NTS benchtop imaging system has had significant clinical impact and is considered to have “ *paved the road towards a new understanding of neuroplasticity mechanisms following reconstructive surgery”* \( **S1**\). However, in common with most existing DOT devices, it requires a large number of bulky optical fibres to carry light to and from the head, which limits its possible applications. To address these limitations, Gowerlabs built on the early microNTS work \( **R3**\) to develop the world’s first commercial, high\-density, fibreless DOT system, LUMO, which provides significantly higher resolution imaging than any other commercially available DOT device. The system’s novel design enables high\-quality images of the brain to be obtained in almost any environment and the products have been used by companies and research institutions in Africa, Australia, China, Europe, UK and the US. 

 To help DOT device users validate new array designs and assess system performance, Gowerlabs has also developed the world’s first anatomically correct head phantoms. These have proven useful for both companies and clinicians. Vilber Lourmat, a Gowerlabs client, considers Gowerlabs to be “ *the only company that can supply optical phantoms of the types we need for our application*” \( **S2**\). 

 Gowerlabs DOT systems are being used in clinical settings \(eg Medlink, Australia\) R&D settings \(eg McMaster University Canada and Vilber Lourmat for cancer research\), and by technology companies such as Facebook Reality Labs and Apple for their computer\-brain interface research; and other technology companies such as Philips and Kingfar International Inc., China. 

 Gowerlabs systems has enabled “ *modern machine learning techniques to accelerate brain computer interface \(BCI\) development for many different applications”* \( **S3**\) with improved accuracy when measuring brain activity in real time. For example, the application of the LUMO system allowed Facebook Reality Labs research on translating neural activity into text to achieve “ *average error rates as low as 3% when tested with vocabularies of up to 300 words”* compared to the previously “ *limited error rates north of 60% for 100\-word vocabularies*” \( **S3**\). 

 The Gowerlabs brain imaging systems have also enabled novel research on new\-born babies’ brains, revealing new insights into infant malnutrition and autism, and have been featured in films on social media including *Seeing Signs of Autism in Infrared* by UCL Engineering \(2013\) and *Brain Imaging Tool Seeks Signs Of Infant Malnutrition* by SciDevNet \(2015\), engaging over 4,000 viewers in the process \( **S4**\). Other coverage of how Gowerlabs DOT systems have been used in cutting edge research include: *Brain Imaging Technology Designed for Babies – \(November 2020\), BBC News website; The Wonderful World of Babies – Episode 2* \(2018; \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]\); *BBC World News Horizons 4, Episode 16 – The Brain* \(2014\); *BBC World Service Health Check – Babies’ Minds: The Truth about Life and Death* \(2014\); *BBC Horizon – Living with Autism* \(2014; \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]\) \( **S4**\). 

 **Economic impact and sector development** 

 Gowerlabs brain imaging systems have been purchased by technology industry leaders, such as Philips, Apple and Kingfar Int. and by academic institutions, such as Magdeburg University, Germany and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden, reaching an annual turnover of approximately \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] \( **S5**\). Since August 2013, total sales of the NTS benchtop imaging system have reached \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\], with more than two\-thirds of products sold outside the UK. Total sales of the LUMO system since its launch in April 2019, have reached \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] to date and sales of tissue equivalent phantoms have reached \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] since December 2016. 

 The DOT imaging systems \(NTS benchtop system and LUMO\) have had a worldwide reach with units being sold in the UK \(14 units\), North America \(8 units\), China \(6 units\) Europe \(9 units\), Australia \(3 units\), Gambia \(1 unit\) and Bangladesh \(1 unit\). One of Gowerlabs’ Chinese distributors reports that “ *The Lumo system has generated a great deal of interest throughout China*” \( **S6**\). 

 Gowerlabs has grown steadily since 2013 and currently employs full\-time and part\-time personnel equivalent to 5.0 FTE. Since 2013, interns and employees have joined the product development process “ *from the first design concepts through to mass manufacturing*” \( **S7**\), through which “ *invaluable skills and experiences*” \( **S8**\) were gained and transferred across the engineering industry as these personnel progressed on from Gowerlabs. A former employee with a consumer\-focused design background stated: “ *…\(At Gowerlabs\) I was exposed to several new engineering fields, including flexible printed circuit design, embedded system electronics and near\-infrared optics… I have gained many important new skills and experiences from being immersed in the full range of their activities*” \( **S8**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Hodder has been instrumental in revitalising a range of trade unions in the UK and internationally through shaping strategies of renewal, structural change, communications and membership. Specifically: 

1.  Unions involved have **changed their self\-understanding, priorities** **and strategies**, including revising strategic priorities and internal organisation. 

1.  **Implementing structural change** through new organisational practices to enhance membership, including the development of advocates which has contributed to cultural change, and increased membership internationally and amongst less well represented groups.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Given the substantial membership decline facing unions across the globe, there has been significant academic and practitioner interest in understanding and developing strategies for effective union renewal, and an awareness of the pressing need to involve young people in trade unions and union activism. Across Europe, membership decline since 2000 has been occurring at a rate of 0.7% per year, dropping from 40.2 million to 36.1 million members in 2016 \(Vandaele, 2019:10\). Despite this decline, it is widely accepted that union members experience a wage premium over non\-members \(Bryson and Forth, 2017\), and there is agreement that despite the potential negatives of union membership, unions are “on net, good for the economy and society” \(Bennett and Kaufman, 2007: 4\). Research undertaken by Dr Hodder at the University of Birmingham’s Business School directly addresses these issues. Hodder has developed a theoretical framework for understanding the complex interactions between a union’s identity, ideology and purpose, and how this ‘essence’ relates to strategies for renewal. Based on this theoretical framework, Hodder has investigated union activism, young workers’ engagements with unions and unions’ use of social media. Findings from this qualitative and quantitative work have shaped strategies for renewal in several UK unions. 

 **Key Findings \(KF\)** 

1.  Strategies for renewal and organising efforts must be connected with a union’s identity, ideology and purpose. The purpose of a union is to pursue objectives that reflect its identity and its ideology gives meaning to that purpose. Strategies arise from these connections and from the complex interactions between union leadership and members \(R1\). 

1.  Unions engage in internal processes of debate as well as external bargaining with employers and interactions with the state. Both these elements lead to the production of strategies for action, which generate outcomes. These outcomes also have repercussions for union strategies \(R1\). 

1.  External factors, like government recruitment freezes, average membership age and a hostile industrial relations climate constrain union organising and growth \(R1, R3\). 

1.  Social media strategies can increase engagement with unions but they remain under\-utilised \(R5\). Online presence and social media are particularly relevant for young workers and can help combat both negative portrayals and lack of knowledge about unions \(R4, R6\). 

1.  Local and national strike action is associated with significant increases in membership growth, with perceived injustice and union effectiveness motivating decisions to join. Vigorous union campaigning that includes strike action is likely to bring positive membership gains for unions, as well as helping to retain existing members \(R2\). 

1.  Initiatives aimed at encouraging unionism, particularly among young people, are often hampered by constraints on time \(R3, R4\) and on facilities, as young members may experience difficulties in getting advice and mentoring on union issues from older representatives \(R4\). 

1.  Training for existing members and activists is required as to how to best communicate, engage with and retain \(young\) members \(R4, R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Hodder has driven a renewal agenda and structural change across the Public and Commercial Services Union \(PCS\) and the British Dietetic Association Union \(BDA\), and helped shape the renewal strategies of umbrella organisations such as the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) and Danish Confederation of Trade Unions. Specifically, these organisations have \(1\) changed their priorities and strategies and \(2\) implemented structural change. 

 **1.** <ins> **Adopting new strategic frameworks which reflect the organisations’ identities,</ins> <ins>priorities</ins> <ins>and purposes to enable them to improve participation, engagement and communication**</ins> 

1.  Trade Unions, both in the UK and Canada, have long recognised they need to revise their organising and strategic priorities to enable them to articulate their value, and relevance, to their membership. Hodder’s research and advice has supported them to do that in line with their identity and purpose. For example, the Public and Commercial Service Union \(PCS\), co\-designed with Hodder, a set of organising principles and objectives. This was underpinned by a recognition that these should “clearly reflect an individual union’s identity, ideology and purpose, and that clear message should reflect members’ priorities” \(S1\). This process began in 2015, and, in a new departure for the Union, were designed around the fulfilment of strategic objectives: building \(greater participation\), growing \(more members\) and winning \(issues\). 

1.  The PCS’s 2017 Organising Strategy recognised that “it is important to have a common and consistent understanding of what organising means in PCS, grounded in ongoing academic research and best practice” \(S2\) which acknowledged Hodder’s input and, for the 2018 and 2019 strategies \(S3, S4\), the General Secretary credits Hodder’s “support as a critical friend to the union” \(S3\). Hodder’s contribution is further recognised by the National Organiser of the PCS Union who confirms that “Dr Hodder has worked with us to help us revitalise our union strategy and through this build a stronger union identity.” \(S1\) 

 In 2015, the PCS revised its communications strategy aiming to improve participation amongst its existing membership through greater direct messaging. This improved recruitment and retention by demonstrating the value of union membership, as part of its building and winning objectives. This recognised the challenges of communication with workers in a hostile environment, but was also motivated by a desire to improve provision of access to services for members, and improving user experience. \(S1, S5\). This drive to improve direct messaging and the use of social media for its membership was based upon Hodder’s research \(KF4, KF6\). By 2018, the Union recorded the personal email addresses of 72% \(up from 38% in 2014\) and 59% mobile contact details \(compared to 33% in 2014\) of its membership and had a social media strategy \(S1, S5\). Adopting a strategic use of social media following Hodder’s research \(KF4\) has also spread to a Canadian Union, the University of the Fraser Valley Faculty and Staff Association \(S6\). 

1.  Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) strategies and policy to engage young people were influenced by Hodder. In 2015, in his role as advisor to the Midlands Trade Union Congress Young Workers Committee, Hodder organised national events as part of the TUC’s young worker month, increasing the profile of union engagement with young workers within this organisation, and increasing public interest and engagement in research through organisation of these events. Impressed by this work, the TUC approached Hodder in 2016 to help them “develop a strategy to improve young worker engagement at the national level” \(S7\). Hodder contributed to a TUC Executive Committee Report, in which he identified key barriers to younger workers engaging with unions \(KF4–KF7\) and proposed a number of solutions \(KF6, KF7\). According to the Deputy General Secretary, Hodder’s work and this report “shaped discussions at the TUC and raised understanding of issues relating to young people and trade unionism” and, as a direct result of these recommendations, they have “made real changes to how the TUC engages younger workers” \(S7\). These changes included the introduction of a larger range of “‘pull’ factors to entice young people into trade unions” \(S7\). 

 Outside of the UK, young workers have been put on the policy agenda and specific union policy has been influenced through the delivery of training sessions for a delegation of senior trade union officials from the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions \(FH\) led by Hodder at the University of Birmingham in 2017, as well as designing and conducting training for the Youth Committee on the European Trade Union Confederation \(KF4, KF6–KF7\). In the Danish case, it enabled FH delegates to learn from the experiences of UK unions and confirmed existing policy direction of the FH and the ETUC \(S8\). “These interactions have allowed us \[FH\] to learn from the experiences of UK unions and have both confirmed our decision to increase our focus on young worker engagement and shaped our thinking as to how we can do this” \(S8\). 

 **2.** <ins> **Unions are adopting organisational structural changes to help reflect their changed strategic objectives**</ins> 

 Through adopting new organisation practices, Unions \(PCS and BDA\) have been able to fulfil their ambitions to improve participation, representation, inclusivity and membership. The PCS sought to address this in 2016 by creating the new role of Union Advocate. To date, the PCS has recruited 4,000 Advocates who act as voices for the PCS within the workplace, in an informal, flexible role without requiring people to take on the full role and responsibilities of Union Representative \(R2–R4; KF6–KF7\). The Union has found that recruits to this new role are more involved in actively supporting the union by raising visibility, acting in workplace campaigns, mobilising members to use their votes and promoting the union to non\-members \(S5\). According to the PCS National Organiser: “Dr Hodder has been central to implementing this strategic approach and consequent organisational structure of the union” \(S1\). The PCS considers itself to be a stronger and more active PCS union with increased representation and levels of membership. Witnessing the success of this role, the BDA introduced a similar position the ‘Workplace Contact’. According to the BDA Communications and Organising Officer, “Hodder was responsible for the creation of this role and the accompanying standards, guidelines and training for this position \[. . .\] These roles will play a critical part in the delivery of the BDA Trade Union Organising Strategy” \(S9\). 

 The benefits of this organisational change affect both the individual member and the Unions, and produce a\) a more open culture by making engagements easier between the grassroots and organisation, and b\) increasing membership numbers. 

1.  The changes have resulted in a more engaged union membership and opened avenues for members to shape their union. One PCS advocate stated, “I’d like to be a part of those changes and have my opinions heard, that’s why I’m now advocating for the union” \(S5\). One member reported “I can make a difference as an advocate”, and another noted “you feel you are doing something worthwhile” \(S5\). The flexibility of the role \(KF6–KF7\) is particularly valued, one member reporting that “I can give as much or as little of my time as I can” \(S5\). Union Advocates have also allowed branches to be proactive in addressing succession planning and member participation amongst currently under\-represented groups of members: “The advocates have done an incredible job, and a few of them have become reps.” \(S5\) The PCS Union has also increased levels of female activists, growing the percentage of female activists from 43.4% in 2016 to 45% \(there are now 3,154 female activists\) in 2019 \(S1\). This is in a context when many other UK unions are still in decline \(R2\). 

 The BDA increased engagement and union activism through training of 40 BDA reps by Hodder at the BDA conference. As a result of this training, “reps have expressed an enhanced interest in the role and direction of the union” \(S9\). Further, through the above structural changes and training, the BDA reported “increased levels of engagement within the union” \(S9\). Further shift in union practice is exemplified by the BDA hosting their first ever reps conference in October 2019. According to the BDA Communications and Organising Officer, this was due to Hodder’s influence and “This was an important milestone for the BDA \(the BDA became a union in 1983\) and reflected a significant shift in practice in order to become a more inclusive, democratic and participatory organisation” \(S9, S10\). 

1.  In PCS, membership has increased, particularly amongst under\-represented groups. For example, a union member at Department for International Development mentioned the advocate approach as being “key to their branch signing up hundreds of new members” and documented “a recruitment bounce \[. . .\] we now have a couple of people in our overseas departments who are creating a network of overseas reps. All of this work is through the advocates, because they are in the teams and in their networks and they are having the conversations. They are a very mixed group — younger people, a married couple, new people, long\-servers, parents” \(S5\). Overall, PCS has both reduced and slowed its membership decline, whilst also improving its recruitment. In 2015, PCS lost 36,051 members \(S11\). After adopting the revised strategy, this figure reduced to 9,956 in 2016, 3,408 in 2017 and 1,371 in 2018. At the same time, the new strategy resulted in the highest level of monthly recruitment of any non\-strike month, recruiting on average 1,000 new members a month. In 2016–18, this rate of recruitment increased to 1,200 members per month, a significant achievement in the current public sector context \(S3; KF3\). Growth has also resulted in the recruitment of significant numbers of young members, who are frequently more vulnerable to workplace exploitation, increasing from 3.7% in 2016 to 5% in 2019 \(S1\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mitter’s research has transformed public and policy understanding of modern China and Chinese nationalism by linking China’s long\-term political history to its current geopolitical relations with other states, including the United Kingdom. His work has enhanced understanding of China’s significance to the UK through broadcast and print media in the UK and beyond. His radio documentaries have reached hundreds of thousands of listeners. Mitter’s work has also shaped future strategies for UK and international policy think tanks, and benefitted UK government policy\-making including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) and the No 10 Policy Unit. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mitter’s research has had a transformative impact upon understanding of the emergence of nationalism in modern China, both in the early twentieth century and in the present era **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. In particular he has addressed China’s role in World War II \(1937\- 45\) and its significance to the shaping of contemporary Chinese nationalism. His research has explored the way that Britain, the USA and China functioned as allies in the Second World War during the Nationalist era. The ensuing Civil War and victory of the Chinese Communist Party meant that the legacy of that conflict, and interpretations of China’s role in it, are expressed and contested in a variety of ways in China today. These range from Chinese claims to territory in Asia, based on the settlement of 1945, to nationalistic cultural and media products \(books, TV, games, films\). Mitter’s award\-winning book *China’s War with Japan* **\[R2\]** provided a comprehensive history, largely through Chinese sources, of China’s experience of fighting Japan during World War II. His most recent book is based on several years of research that underpins the impact described in this case study. *China's Good War: How World War II is Shaping a New Nationalism* **\[R3\]** argues that China’s reassessment of the World War II years is central to its newfound confidence abroad and to mounting nationalism at home. This project has also resulted in several journal publications and chapters in edited collections **\[R4, R5, R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **\(i\) Transforming public understanding of China’s History: Radio and Film** 

 In 2018, Mitter presented his research in a 20\-part series on Chinese history, *Chinese Characters*, on **BBC Radio 4**. The series drew on his books *China’s War with Japan* **\[R2\]** and *A Bitter Revolution* **\[R1\]**, in particular the episodes relating to figures such as Chiang Kai\-shek, Deng Xiaoping, Wang Jingwei, Mao Zedong, the writers Ding Ling and Lu Xun, and the authors of the controversial television series River Elegy which was shown a year before the Tiananmen Square killings of 1989. The BBC’s Head of Radio Current Affairs notes that Mitter ‘pursued an engaging and accessible approach to draw in a large, mainstream audience for a deeper understanding of the forces that have shaped China – translating his academic expertise into vivid broadcasting in a flagship slot on the nation’s biggest speech and news radio network, alongside further listening offline on BBC Sounds’. **\[E1.1\]** Mitter was subsequently named Best Presenter at the 2019 Eastern Eye ACTA \(Arts, Culture and Theatre\) awards for the series. The series contributed to a wider understanding of Chinese history for a general audience, as demonstrated by comments submitted to BBC audience feedback, including: ‘exceptional content’, ‘wonderful programme’, ‘superb radio’. \[ **E1.2**\] Since Chinese history is rarely addressed in British public media, this feedback demonstrates a genuine appreciation of the way that public understanding was deepened by exposure over an extended time to the history of an immensely important country that is little understood in the UK. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 Mitter has also presented his research for wider audiences in a series of further documentaries for BBC radio, including *Shanghai: World City Redux* \(Radio  3, 2014; selected for *Pick of the Week* on Radio 4\), *Japan’s Never\-Ending War* \(Radio 3 and BBC World TV, 2018\), and *Meanwhile in Beijing* \(Radio 4, 2020; rated 5 stars by the *Times* radio critic\); these all drew on work from *A Bitter Revolution* and *China’s War with Japan* to explain to the public the importance of the recent past \(early 20<sup>th</sup> century\) in explaining China’s current trajectory. All were presented and co\-written by Mitter. The producer notes the improvement to listeners’ understanding of China: ‘As a documentary\-maker at BBC Radio, I have made several programmes in recent years which have relied heavily on Professor Mitter's research in modern Chinese history… These programmes drew on his research and expertise, including his work with Mandarin archival sources, and his first\-hand knowledge of Chinese intellectual life and culture, as shaped by its modern history. This has provided our listeners with the opportunity to access deeper and more nuanced perspectives on China than are possible in the absence of this level of expertise.’ \[ **E2.1**\] The Producer has also supplied the following rounded listener figures for Mitter’s documentaries: \[ **E2.2**\] 

 *Shanghai World City Redux* \(2014, duration 44 mins\). Reach: 97,300; \(repeat\) 102,300. 

 *Japan’s Never\-Ending War* \(2018, duration 44 mins\). Reach: 61,300. 

 *Meanwhile in Beijing* \(2020, duration 28 mins\). Reach: 318,700. 

 Mitter’s two\-part television documentary *China’s Forgotten War* \(2015\), produced by **InFocus Asia**, explored the significance of World War II in shaping contemporary Chinese nationalism. The show drew heavily on **R2**, including on\-screen readings by Mitter as presenter, who also edited and adapted the shooting script. In 2019, the popular site *History Hit* made it the ‘standout documentary’ of their East Meets West season and recorded an interview with Mitter, now available online. **\[E3.1\]** 

 The significance of the Impact can be demonstrated by reactions online, which include this statement: 

 I would consider myself a WWII educated person … But why have I never explored this aspect? It's not talked about as much and that is a shame. What happened in Nanjing by the Japanese was every bit as horrifying and history needs to be explained in full disclosure not bits and pieces. … WWII started in China in 1937 not in Poland 1939, I am going to have to ingrain that in my head from now on. 

 Amazon Reviewer, United States, 3 May 2018. \[ **E3.2**\] 

 Another viewer, this time on IMDB, recorded: 

 you would have thunked \[that\] an American who … really thought they knew most of WWII history has seen it all. Nope\! … You cannot help but feel the pain suffered by the Chinese from this film. ... It fills in the missing pieces\[.\] 

 IDMB reviewer, 6 May 2019. \[ **E3.2**\] 

 The documentary has now been distributed through Amazon, HistoryHit TV, PBS America and has 284,000 downloads on YouTube. **\[E3.1\]** 

 **\(ii\) Transforming public understanding of China’s History: influencing curatorial decisions in the museum sector** 

 Mitter’s research findings have benefitted curatorial practice in prominent international museums. In 2021 the **Imperial War Museum** \(IWM\) will open a new Second World War gallery with the aim of positioning Britain and its Empire within a broader, global context, appropriate for twenty\-first century visitors. A significant part of this broader international narrative concerns China’s contribution to the Second World War, which will be a major feature of the museum for the first time. As an Associate of the Imperial War Museum, Mitter’s research was used in the labelling and procurement of materials for the new China element of the World War II galleries. This work has included close liaison via email as well as visits to each other’s institutions, providing links with the historical archives in Chongqing, China, which sourced artefacts and memorabilia from China during World War II. The Curator explains how the reframing of the war as a global struggle has been underpinned by Mitter’s research: 

 Professor Mitter’s book \[ *China’s War with Japan*\] … and his research in modern Chinese history has been an essential resource … \[and\] key events in the book … influenced the narrative structure and content of the galleries. Most significantly, that the gallery narrative should begin in 1937 … In addition …we will emphasise that China had been fighting Japan for several years before Britain and America declared war against Japan, a fact which is not universally known by our audiences. 

 The Curator adds that Mitter’s text reviews of the gallery have ensured that ‘visitors will receive an authoritative and rigorous explanation of historical events’. \[ **E4**\] 

 The American equivalent of the IWM is the **National World War II Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana**; here, too, Mitter’s book, *China’s War with Japan* \(US title: *Forgotten Ally: China’s World War II, 1937\-1945*\), was used directly to underpin the text accompanying the displays and descriptions. The Director of Conferences and Symposia at the museum’s Institute for the Study of War and Democracy discovered Mitter’s work while organising an international conference in 2013, and invited Mitter to address the attendees \(almost 500\). This event proved to be the springboard for Mitter’s involvement in the redesigning of the museum’s displays to include China’s contribution to the war: 

 His book, *Forgotten Ally: China’s World War II, 1937\-1945* was published right as the Museum began to work on designing and constructing its ‘Road to Tokyo’ permanent exhibition. Professor Mitter’s research in modern Chinese history was influential in our putting America’s WWII role in a much broader, and better, global context, which had not previously been a major feature of the museum, and has helped us enlighten our nearly 800,000 annual visitors. **\[E5\]** 

 The museum subsequently invited Mitter to serve as an Instructor for their Summer Teacher Institute, which brings 30 history teachers from US high schools – chosen in competition – to study new findings in historical research. These Institute participants are then designated ‘master teachers’ who return to their respective districts and share what they have learned with another 30 additional teachers each. **\[E5\]** 

 **\(iii\) Contributing to policy debate** 

 Mitter’s research on Chinese nationalism has led to numerous invitations to speak at major UK think tanks, including Ditchley Park, Wilton Park, Chatham House, and the Royal United Services Institute: \[Text removed for publication\].  In all of these settings, he has stressed the importance of bringing historical understanding to interpreting contemporary China and has had an impact on the development of their policy frameworks. \[Text removed for publication\].  In summer 2020, Mitter drew on his historical research when he co\-authored the report ‘Strategic Approach to UK\-China relations’ \(approximately 60,000 words\) with the Director of the British Foreign Policy Group \(BFPG\) **\[E12\]**. The latter notes that the Group’s partnership with Mitter ‘undoubtedly elevated the reach and influence of the report’s conclusions. …It was a highly productive collaboration, which was able to reach into the heart of government, the media, and other institutions.’ \[ **E7**\] There has been well\-attended follow\-up on the report in public online meetings, including one hosted by the BFPG itself with commentary from Tom Tugendhat MP, Chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee \(8 September 2020\) and one hosted by the FCO\-linked Great Britain China Centre \(23 September 2020\), attended by parliamentarians and policymakers. 

 The contributions in section 2 have led to further direct input into discussions in government. Mitter’s historical research on Chinese nationalism has contributed to UK government thinking and policy on China over the entire period of assessment. His research for *China’s War with Japan* was specifically recognized in terms of its relevance to the UK government as the joint winner of the ‘Frontiers of Knowledge’ competition organized by HEFCE/All\-Party Parliamentary University Group in 2013. There were 185 submissions in total, and Mitter was the only academic from the humanities to be invited to lecture in the House of Lords.  The call for proposals stated that ‘The lectures will give researchers a unique opportunity to present their ideas to key policymakers and engage directly with a large number of parliamentarians, and so influence public policy debates’; research was sought which was ‘Relevant to understanding a topical policy issue.’ **\[E8\]** 

 **\(iv\) Influencing UK government policy and advising government staff** 

 Mitter contributed to discussions on China for the Integrated Review of British foreign and defence policy conducted in 2020.

 1. **Summary of the impact** 

 The Colour & Imaging Lab at UEA developed revolutionary algorithms for image fusion with applications in multiple domains including photography, security and accessibility \(for colour deficient observers\). This research was vested in **Spectral Edge Ltd.** which was spun out of UEA in 2011. **Spectral Edge Ltd.** attracted a total of GBP6,124,000 investment including, investment from the Iceni and Rainbow Seed corn funds and two rounds of venture capital funding. 

 In November 2019, **Spectral Edge Ltd.** was acquired by Apple Inc. and the Spectral Edge technology is now being incorporated into the Apple product pipeline. 
","
 2. **Underpinning research** 

 In the EPSRC grant \[A\] “Colour to Greyscale and Related Transforms” \(with Professor Bloj, University of Bradford\), **Professor Finlayson’s** research group at UEA explored image fusion in humans and, inspired by this work, developed new fusion algorithms for computer vision. At the same moment, the imaging industry started to manufacture devices \(e.g. smart phones\) equipped with multiple cameras which resulted in a sudden interest in, and need for, effective image fusion algorithms. 

 For intuitive reasons, most inquiry into image fusion operates in the edge or derivative domain, since edges are proxies for the detail we wish to fuse. In a standard methodology, for image fusion we are given N images from which we then calculate derivatives \(or edges\). The edges are fused together to create a composite edge\-map which is reintegrated to solve for the final output image. Almost all the prior art treats image fusion as a N to 1 problem. Moreover, because the fused gradient field is, necessarily, non\-integrable the fused images must both have artifacts and hallucinated detail. Spectral Edge theory teaches how to solve the more general N to M \(where M is typically 3 for colour images\) gradient fusion problem. In Spectral Edge image fusion \[1\], the available extra edge information is first be determined and is then used to accentuate the gradient field of a guide image \(e.g. the original colour image\). As before, the gradient field must then be re\-integrated. To avoid the problems of artifacts and hallucinated detail, a new theory of integration was developed \[2\] which, provably, could not suffer from these problems. Spectral Edge theory was applied directly to many problems including, fusing the Near\-Infra Red and visible images and bringing out more detail in diffusion tensor imaging \[1\]. 

 Subsequently, the researchers at UEA, funded through an EPSRC follow\-on award \[B\], re\-imagined the Spectral Edge fusion theory as a tool for general image processing.  In a first step a colour image is processed so that a specific property is enhanced. Then this property image is fused – using the spectral edge theory \- with the original. As an example, the extra information that is available to observers with normal colour vision \(the property image\) is fused with the image available to colour deficient observers. The resulting fused image conveys dramatically more detail to colour deficient observers. In other research, a sharpened image was fused with the original to make a new and pleasing output image that had much greater local contrast \(but no artefacts\). In \[3\], colour and thermal images were fused together as part of a solution to pedestrian detection that was both simpler and faster to execute than the prior art. 

 Research was a key part of Spectral Edge’s mission, and UEA researchers continued to collaborate with the spin\-out company up to the point of acquisition, at which time the focus was on both developing an extended theory of fusion based on a new definition of edges in images \(inspired by operator theory from Physics\), and  \[\*redactedtext\*redacted text\*redacted text\*\]. Both of these research areas are part of the current “Future Colour Imaging” project \[C\], a 5\-year EPSRC established career fellowship awarded to Professor Finlayson.

 4. **Details of the impact** 

 **Company creation and growth** 

 Following the initial research within Finlayson's Colour and Imaging Lab in the School of Computing Sciences at UEA **Spectral Edge Ltd.** was incorporated in **2011 \[corroborating source A\]**. The Intellectual Property which formed the core of the patent portfolio underpinning **Spectral Edge Ltd.** included more than 10 patents covering image fusion, the integration of gradient fields, targeting images for different observers \(e.g. to help colour deficient observers to see more\) and in content\-based image processing **\[corroborating source B\]**. 

 Early funding for **Spectral Edge Ltd.** came from a Technology Strategy Board Proof of Concept grant \(2012\-2013 GBP35,798\) and an Innovate UK grant \(2014\-2015, GBP110,000\), for developing and validating using image fusion to help colour deficient observers see more **\[corroborating source C\]**, together with Seedcorn funding from the ICENI and Rainbow funds \(GBP538,000\) **\[corroborating source D\]**. In 2016 and 2018 respectively, Spectral Edge attracted venture capital investment of GBP1,500,000 and GBP4,000,000 where IQ capital and Parkwalk were the lead investors **\[corroborating source E\]**. 

 The company was initially based in Norwich before moving to Cambridge in 2014. Starting in the IdeaSpace \(an incubation hub for early stage innovation\), the company soon grew to a scale \(6\+ employees\) where commercial offices were required. On acquisition at the end of 2019, **Spectral Edge Ltd.** was based in the Bradfield Centre on the Cambridge Science Park and employed 15 staff \(headcount = 15; FTE = 15\) of which 12 were software and hardware engineers. 

 **Spectral Edge technology** 

 Spectral Edge is a platform technology in the area of image fusion. In contradistinction to the prior art which focussed on fusing N images to 1, in the Spectral Edge approach all the detail is made available in a fused colour image \(N to 3\). Moreover, uniquely, the Spectral Edge algorithms produce images without artifacts or hallucinated detail, a major step forward. 

 **Spectral Edge Ltd.** first developed an algorithm called **Eyeteq** where the detail that a colour\-blind observer can see is fused with the extra detail available to observers with normal colour vision. An empirical evaluation of Eyeteq processed TV and video content by the independent company *i2 media research* in 2015 showed that the resulting fused colour images convey much more information to colour deficient observers whilst simultaneously preserving colour fidelity for everyone else **\[corroborating source F\]**. 

 **Nighteq** followed in 2016, providing blue light reduction technology for night\-time viewing and in 2017 **Vividteq** was launched, in which contrast enhanced images are fused with a colour original to deliver a pleasing more detailed and artefact free image. Vividteq was licenced to NTT Data Italia in 2018 for inclusion in their broadcast infrastructure, which allowed their broadcast customers \(including Sky Italia\) to deliver high\-dynamic range \(HDR\) like images irrespective of the limitations of the end\-user hardware **\[corroborating source G\]**. A major focus of the company was the fusion of IR and visible images, which resulted in the Spectral Edge Fusion technology being launched in 2019. **Spectral Edge Ltd.** built its own cameras and processing pipeline which could fuse video streams in real time. This technology was being deployed commercially shortly before acquisition **\[corroborating source H\]**. 

 Throughout development the Spectral Edge Technology proceeded with help and advice from industry experts, including the CEO of Agile Analog: 

 “I was very impressed with the core technology, and leapt at the chance to join the Spectral Edge Advisory Board, to enhance and assist in the future technology direction. 

 Given the quality of the underlying technology it is no surprise that Spectral Edge was acquired by such a global technology leader.” 

 **\[corroborating source I\]** 

 **Acquisition of Spectral Edge Ltd. by Apple Inc.** 

 In November 2019 **Spectral Edge Ltd.** was acquired by Apple Inc. with the Spectral Edge technology now being incorporated into Apple’s product pipeline. The Director, Cameras and Photos Software Engineering at Apple has confirmed that: 

 “Through Apple’s relationship with Professor Finlayson and University of East Anglia we were able to monitor the steady progress of Spectral Edge as they built their core technologies and talented team of engineers \- several of which were a product of UEA’s Colour & Imaging Lab. The development of fundamental Spectral Edge algorithms into practical engineering deliverables gave us the confidence that these could quickly make an impact on Apple products and improve experiences for our customers. This team has also helped us attract new talent to grow our expertise at a new Apple facility in Cambridge.” 

 **\[corroborating source J\]** 

 An additional benefit of the acquisition is that the initial investments made in **Spectral Edge Ltd.**  returned a significant profit to the investors, including the University of East Anglia, with the investment returns to both the ICENI Seedcorn Fund and IQ Capital now being invested in new ventures **\[corroborating sources D and E\]**. The acquisition was also significant for a number of **Spectral Edge Ltd.**  employees, with 10 of the engineers being hired by Apple Inc. and the core Spectral Edge team being at the heart of Apple’s major expansion of its business in Cambridge.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Manchester research, in collaboration with Electricity Northwest Ltd \(ENWL\), has developed and implemented a suite of control options across the electricity network of the North West of the UK. This avoided substantial cost\-intensive upgrades, whilst enabling the integration of a growing number of renewable technologies into the network. ENWL are now able to provide “fast\-reserve” services to the National Grid. Collectively, this research has: 

-  Fundamentally changed ENWL’s policy making and investment process to assess network upgrade options; 

-  Provided evidence enabling ENWL to secure GBP18,000,000 funding for the UK’s first actively optimised network; 

-  Since 2016, generated \[text removed for publication\] savings \(to ENWL and customers\) across the network; 

-  Since 2019, generated \[text removed for publication\] “fast\-reserve” revenue for ENWL; 

-  Supported trials \(Smart Streets\) that could save up to 17 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in the North West of England by 2060. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2012, research in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change at The University of Manchester \(UoM\) has addressed three key areas relating to improved electricity network provision. Firstly, design of smart distribution networks and the subsequent decision\-making processes that inform investment in the network \[1\]; secondly, new methods to actively manage the increasing levels of voltage and thermal \(power flow\) fluctuations across a network \[2\]\-\[5\]; and thirdly, assessing the carbon impact of different network investment options \[6\]. 

 Fluctuations in voltage and power flow detrimentally affect the overall stability of the network, impacting the security of electricity supply to both residential and commercial customers. These fluctuations result from the increasing number of renewable electricity technologies that are being connected to the network. 

 UoM research has explored the potential to use existing network assets \(e.g., transformers and customers demand\) to increase network capacity and flexibility. This sought to identify whether cheaper alternatives \(compared to investing in new assets\) could be used to manage voltage and power fluctuations. This involved a series of research projects funded through the UK Government’s Ofgem Low Carbon Network \(LCN\) fund competitions \(value to UoM, GBP1,554,716\) that aimed to increase the capability and flexibility of the demand response in the ENWL network, balancing high power fluctuations between renewable generation and load demand of the electricity grid: 

 \(i\) **Capacity to Customers** project \(C<sub>2</sub>C; 2012 – 2015\) explored smart distribution networks, and developed network investment planning models \[1\]. 

 \(ii\) **Customer Load Active System Services** project \(CLASS; 2013 – 2016\) explored flexible and stagger controls of transformer tap changers at primary substations \[2\]\-\[5\]. 

 \(iii\) **Smart Street** project \(2015\-2019\) explored flexible voltage optimisation between high\-voltage \(HV\) and low\-voltage \(LV\) networks, in order to improve the management of connections. 

 Specific key findings that resulted from these projects include: 

-  For the first time, the economic and social value of ‘smart’ demand\-side response \(DSR\) solutions \(managed connections\) compared to traditional asset\-heavy investments was quantified. The novel probabilistic tool developed by UoM \- Real Options Cost Benefit Analysis \(RO\-CBA\) \- enabled modelling and comparison of multiple investment strategies. This demonstrated that DSR can reduce overall costs for both networks and end customers \[1\]; 

-  Through the C<sub>2</sub>C and CLASS projects, data were obtained to develop a novel time\-varying voltage\-demand model analysis tool; establish a voltage\-load relationship matrix; and characterise different voltage load profiles \[2\]. Precise, real\-time information is fundamental in actively managing voltage and demand fluctuations in the network; 

-  A method of flexible controls of primary substation tap changers to unlock time\-varying load demand was proposed. By exploiting the positive correlation between supplied voltage and demand, flexible load management is possible, without needing to directly involve the customer \[3\]; 

-  The level of load demand reduction flexibility that can be unlocked through voltage\-led load management \(a reduction in active power during normal operating conditions\) to provide valuable balancing services was quantified \[4\]. Few previous studies explored the varying load management capabilities that result at different times \(both daily and seasonally\). The UoM methodology \[4\] was trialled in CLASS to quantify the aggregated demand reduction available at times when flexible load management services were required; 

-  The flexible control of primary substation transformer tap staggers was demonstrated as a method for unlocking reactive power absorption capabilities in power networks. Tap stagger techniques were more economically viable than other reactive power absorption methods, such as using inductive element/reactors, and can also reduce voltage damping and power overshoots during transient states \[5\]; 

-  The carbon emissions savings that would result from different network asset investment strategies were quantified. The UoM carbon assessment methodology \[6\] combined for the first time, life cycle assessment \(LCA\) and network impact analysis, and was applied in Smart Streets to quantify the potential carbon benefits that different scenarios would provide.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 ENWL supply electricity to over 5,000,000 customers in the North West of England, and are the largest electrical distribution network operator \(DNO\) in the UK. To help meet the UK government’s 2050 net zero carbon emissions target, an increasing number of low\-carbon and renewable technologies are being connected to the network. However, renewable energies can cause fluctuations in voltage and power flow, which affect the overall stability and security of the network. The regulator Ofgem will also require DNOs to take a more active role in carbon reduction in the next price control period \(RIIO\-ED2\) beginning in 2023. ENWL identified that they needed to significantly invest in and enhance their network capacity \(e.g., bigger lines, substations, and other infrastructures\) in order to manage the voltage and thermal fluctuations that result from these additional connections. However, new investments are costly and have a significant carbon and material consumption penalty. Actively managing these voltage and power fluctuations can avoid specific costly infrastructure investments whilst improving and enhancing existing infrastructure assets. UoM collaborated with ENWL to support a strategic approach to enhancing network performance and minimising investment needs. 

##  Pathways to impact 

 In 2012, ENWL commissioned UoM to undertake a series of research projects to inform more effective network investment. The C<sub>2</sub>C project assessed the capability of ENWL’s distribution networks to cope with both an increasing number of customers as well as integrating renewable power generation. Building on the subsequent project reports, ENWL identified the need to explore new ideas to further increase network capacity, which led to the CLASS \(2014\-2016\) and Smart Street \(2015\-2019\) projects. 

 As part of these projects, UoM developed a range of models and planning tools that facilitated ENWL to implement flexible demand\-side response controls to increasing network capacity. Trials run by ENWL identified the success of these projects to provide improved network capacity and flexibility, whilst substantially reducing the financial investment \(and embedded carbon\) in new assets. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

##  Improved network capacity through connection management 

 Spare capacity in the distribution network is vital to ensure a reliable electricity supply to customers. As we transition to a net\-zero economy, the demands placed upon local electricity networks are changing \(e.g., solar photovoltaics feeding in, increased demand due to electric vehicles and heating\): in some areas any previous spare capacity will no longer be sufficient to ensure reliability of supply. Given investments to add capacity are costly, UoM research developed a planning tool – RO\-CBA – to demonstrate where investment savings can be made across a network \[1\]. 

 Using RO\-CBA, this research \[1\] identified that ‘managed connections’ reduce the need for new infrastructure by effectively obtaining spare capacity from customers who reduce their consumption when contingencies occur \(such as the failure of a line\). In 2016, as a result of the UoM research \[1\], ENWL fundamentally changed their policy making and investment process, and rolled out managed connections across their entire network. This approach, and the RO\-CBA tool, are now integrated into their business\-as\-usual assessment of network upgrade options. \[Text removed for publication\]. This tool \[1\] has led to improved management of network connections for an increasing number of customers whilst maximising the integration of renewable power generation \[1\]: through maximising spare capacity in the existing network, the network is better able to cope with increased demands from renewable technology. Overall this has increased the confidence in which ENWL can safely connect a greater level of \(intermittent\) renewables to the network.  \[Text removed for publication\]. 

##  Flexible demand response management techniques improve network stability 

###  i\) CLASS 

 Responding to the power and voltage fluctuations described above, ENWL applied the learnings from the CLASS and Smart Streets projects to improve network stability. Following CLASS, ENWL installed new monitoring equipment and ‘voltage controllers’ on over 60 primary substations at tactical points on the distribution network, as recommended through the UoM research \[2\-5\]. Evaluation by ENWL has confirmed this can save its customers around GBP100,000,000 over the next 25 years \[B\]. The CLASS method can be implemented at a primary substation 57 times faster and 12 times more cheaply than traditional network reinforcement \[C\]. 

 The CLASS research \[2\-5\], successfully applied in the North\-West, has also been approved for national use. The National Grid Electricity System Operator \(NGESO\) is responsible for managing the electricity system across the UK. NGESO has confirmed that the ENWL CLASS passed testing for the low frequency static response service in 2018, and the fast reserve service in 2019 \[D\]. This allows CLASS to participate in the Firm Frequency Response \(FFR\) and Fast Reserve \(FR\) tendered markets – essentially enabling the National Grid to ‘buy’ load from DNOs. CLASS provides a more cost\-effective service than previously available: according to NGESO \[E\]\[F\], the accepted ENWL2 method \(i.e. ENWL CLASS\), offers the lowest firm energy fee \(GBP80 per MWh\) in the tendered market. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 Since March 2019, the CLASS method has been successfully activated \[G\] \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 The CLASS programme has allowed DNO/DSOs to optimise the effectiveness of their infrastructure investment by taking a strategic approach to the assessment of managed connections and flexible demand response. These approaches have made significant savings for both the network operators and consumers and allow the decarbonisation of electricity networks to be delivered more rapidly and with lower levels of investment and disruption. 

###  ii\) Smart Streets 

 Smart Streets was the first UK demonstration of a fully centralised low voltage network management and automation system \[H\]. Smart Streets stabilises voltage by using new controllable switching devices integrated into the ENWL network management system. Subsequently, the supply voltage to customers is reduced to an optimum level – known as conservation voltage reduction – enabling both the network and customer appliances to work more efficiently \[I\]. 

 Smart Streets uses assets deployed as part of the CLASS and C<sub>2</sub>C projects, and additional HV and LV network models developed by UoM, to analyse the impact and benefits of the Smart Streets trials, as well as undertaking a carbon impact assessment \(based on the methodologies in \[6\]\) \[G\]. ENWL used these findings to support their application for GBP18,000,000 as part of the Innovation Rollout Mechanism \(IRM\) from Ofgem and the UK Government Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), to roll out voltage optimisation across the LV networks. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 The Smart Streets method enables customer appliances to operate more efficiently which can extend the life of the equipment as well as the more immediate benefit in reduced operating cost \[J\]. Further, the carbon impact assessment demonstrated Smart Street could provide carbon savings of up to 17 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in the North West by 2060 \[K\].  By controlling voltage on ENWL’s LV network, Smart Streets can reduce customer electricity bills by up to GBP60 to GBP70 a year, reduce carbon emissions and provide more flexible solutions to connect low\-carbon technologies into the network, all without reducing power quality \[G\]\[H\]. Given the direct financial benefit to customers, ENWL have prioritised the selection of substations that overlap with customers identified as living in fuel poverty. Once fully integrated into ENWL’s network management system, this will create the UK’s first actively optimised network \[H\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSHTM researchers brought newborn deaths and stillbirths onto the global agenda, publishing the first national estimates of the causes of newborn deaths and the numbers of stillbirths around the world. Nearly all \(99%\) of the 5 million neonatal deaths each year were in low\- and middle\-income countries \(LMICs\), yet were invisible on the global health and political agenda. LSHTM research made them visible, leading to targets for preventing these deaths being included in the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, and innovations in communities and hospitals saving babies’ lives daily. The Every Newborn Action Plan, informed by LSHTM research, has been integrated into the national health strategies of 78 countries with high newborn mortality and stillbirth rates. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There was remarkable progress in maternal and child survival between 1990 and 2015 \(the Millennium Development Goal era\), but reductions in newborn deaths progressed about 30% more slowly. Deaths in the neonatal period \(the first 28 days after birth\) and stillbirths \(from 28 weeks gestation\) were unmeasured, with no global reduction targets, and considered too complex to prevent. To address this huge problem, counting births and deaths around the time of birth was crucial, as well as more research into the determinants of newborn deaths in low\- and middle\-income settings where the majority of deaths happen. 

 Cousens was part of a team led by Lawn \(before Lawn joined LSHTM in 2013\) that defined the burden and causes of newborn deaths worldwide for the first time. The team analysed data from 194 countries and multiple data types \(vital registration, perinatal audits, and verbal autopsy\) to produce nationally representative estimates. Epidemiological analyses described when deaths occur \(1 million on their birth day\), where \(which regions and increasingly in hospitals\), and why \(causes of mortality\). These findings were published in The Lancet series on Neonatal Survival in 2005 \(3.1\) and provided the first national and worldwide estimates for neonatal causes of death, estimating that 4 million babies died per year in the first four weeks of life. Few neonatal deaths were found to occur in countries with high coverage of healthcare facilities and vital registration. Further analysis highlighted there was a lack of reliable data on cause of death in settings with the highest volume of neonatal deaths \(3.2\). 

 Lawn joined LSHTM as a professor in 2013 and led a wider team on the 2014 Every Newborn Lancet series. ‘Every Newborn: progress, priorities and potential beyond survival’ reviewed the status of newborn health and progress since the 2005 Neonatal Survival series to inform accelerated action in countries and globally \(3.3\). The 2014 series presented an updated picture of newborn survival and trends, including analyses of 60 countries, to inform the first global target for neonatal deaths and stillbirths. Globally in 2012, the main causes of newborn mortality were found to be: complications from preterm birth \(1.03 million, 36%\), intrapartum\-related conditions \(previously called birth asphyxia; 0.66 million, 23%\), and infections \(notably sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia; 0.66 million, 23%\). Intrapartum\-related conditions \(27%\) and preterm birth \(41%\) dominated in the early neonatal period, and infections \(48%\) were common in the later period. This 2014 series also analysed data from the 12 countries accounting for over 60% of neonatal deaths, to understand bottlenecks in health systems and inform more rapid prevention of mortality. 

 To identify the effectiveness of interventions in preventing these newborn deaths, and support prioritisation of resource allocation, LSHTM staff contributed to systematic reviews and modelling of lives that might be saved through essential interventions. In 2010, they published the first meta\-analysis showing the mortality effect of kangaroo mother care \(KMC\), a method of care for preterm infants with low birth weight involving skin\-to\-skin contact, usually with the mother \(3.4\). This work showed that KMC reduced deaths among preterm babies in hospital by approximately 40%, and is highly effective in reducing severe morbidity. 

 To improve the evidence base on stillbirths, Cousens and Blencowe in 2011 \(3.5\) and Lawn, Blencowe, and Cousens in 2016 \(3.6\) and co\-authors produced two series on stillbirths in The Lancet. They provided the first World Health Organization\-approved estimates of stillbirth rates per country. 2.65 million stillbirths were estimated to occur worldwide in 2008. These series included evidence for how to include stillbirth prevention in existing health systems in LMICs. Using WHO estimates and Demographic Health Survey data, the team analysed data from approximately 200 countries and found that 98% of stillbirths occurred in LMICs, with the majority occurring in south\-central Asian and sub\-Saharan Africa countries.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This programme of research provided high\-quality, multi\-country data which was crucial for accountability, programme implementation and allocation of resources to prevent newborn deaths and stillbirths. Developing and analysing databases on births and deaths around the time of birth resulted in high\-quality evidence to inform what should be prioritised. Systematic review of evidence on interventions enabled actions to be recommended for policy guidelines and programme implementation. This meant that mothers and babies had improved access to services, and led to better health outcomes for newborns. 

 **Informing international targets for newborn mortality and stillbirths** 

 The Lancet Every Newborn Series was published in 2014 and led directly to the development of the United Nations Every Newborn Action Plan \(ENAP\). Led by UNICEF and the World Health Organization \(WHO\), ENAP presented evidence\-based solutions to prevent newborn deaths and stillbirths, and set out a path to 2020 with global milestones \(5.1\). The ENAP strategic objectives for ending preventable maternal and neonatal mortality and stillbirths included strengthening and investing in care around the time of birth, strengthening health systems to optimise organisation and delivery of care, minimising inequities to reach every woman and newborn, harnessing the power of communities and societal input, and improving data for decision making and accountability. The plan, based on evidence presented by LSHTM and co\-authors in the Every Newborn Series, was endorsed by all 194 member states of the WHO at the 67<sup>th</sup> World Health Assembly \(WHA\) in May 2014. It led to a WHA resolution requesting that the WHO Director\-General monitor progress and report periodically to the WHA until 2030 \(5.2\). 

 The Lancet series and linked action plan was supported by more than 80 partners and donors and proposed national targets as follows: 

 *•* 12 or fewer neonatal deaths per 1000 live births in every country by 2030. 

 • 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 total births in every country by 2030. 

 The WHA resolution resulted in the Sustainable Development Goal framework including the first global target for neonatal mortality reduction \(specifically target 3.2, for all countries to aim to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 deaths per 1,000 live births\). Targets for both newborn deaths and stillbirths were also included in the United Nations Secretary\-General’s Every Women Every Child Strategy and monitoring framework. 

 **Progress towards reducing stillbirth and newborn deaths** 

 In 2014, a global ENAP partnership was established, focused on country implementation, advocacy and metrics to help achieve the targets and milestones in the plan. The country implementation group developed the Every Newborn Tracking Tool in 2014, which was piloted in 10 countries between October and December 2014. It was revised in 2015 and shared with 28 focus countries for their input, chosen on the basis of their high burden of neonatal mortality. The tool was designed to track ENAP implementation and progress towards national milestones, as a standard tracking tool for use in all countries. The essential care elements embedded in the tool, which drew on evidence produced by LSHTM, are now mainstream in many national newborn programmes in LMICs. 

  

 90 countries completed the Every Newborn Tracking Tool in 2018. As of 2019, 87% of those countries \(78 countries\) have completed a newborn action plan and defined newborn mortality reduction targets. 10 countries had a reduction of between 3.7 and 4.8 newborn deaths per 1000 live births since 2013. These countries, termed ‘fast\-progressors’, demonstrated how sustainable progress can be realised by leadership for newborn health at the national level, undertaking essential planning and investment, and through focused implementation of inputs which improve quality of care. Improvements based on the ENAP guidance included policies supporting free maternal and newborn care, audits of stillbirth and neonatal deaths, strengthening midwifery education, inpatient care for sick newborns, and inclusion of lifesaving medical products and technology in national essential medicines lists \(such as antenatal corticosteroids, chlorhexidine for cord care, and newborn resuscitation devices\) \(5.3\). The tracking tool specifically mapped the ability of countries to monitor the implementation of four high\-impact interventions of neonatal resuscitation, treatment of infection, kangaroo mother care, and antenatal corticosteroid use, which were being used in 75 countries as of 2018 \(5.4\). 

 As a result of LSHTM and partners’ research demonstrating the effectiveness of kangaroo mother care \(KMC\) for survival of low\-birth\-weight infants, WHO published their first guidelines in 2015 on care of preterm labour and of preterm infants to include KMC as an intervention \(5.5\). As part of the Healthy Newborn Network, a KMC Acceleration Partnership addressed barriers to effective implementation of KMC globally, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The partnership included approximately 70 KMC stakeholders including researchers, clinicians, government officials, programme managers, international organisations and non\-governmental organisations \(5.6\). 

 **Innovation to give babies a better chance of survival wherever they are born** 

 The Every Newborn Plan and Tracking Tool also crucially shone a light on gaps and areas where national governments were doing too little to reduce newborn deaths and low birth weight. LSHTM\-led analyses demonstrated that at current rates of progress, it will be more than a century before African newborns have the same chance of survival as a baby born in the UK, yet most newborn deaths could be prevented by effective use of medical technology. In October 2019, a new GBP50 million partnership to reduce preventable newborn deaths in Africa was announced. The NEST360 partnership, co\-founded by Lawn, includes LSHTM, Rice University's Institute for Global Health in the US, and 16 other institutions \(12 based in Africa\), as well as the governments of Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. NEST \(Newborn Essential Solutions and Technologies\) is a bundle of affordable and innovative medical devices and diagnostics selected to address the major causes of death for small and sick newborns. The partnership aims to roll out, test and implement NEST in a sustainable, evidence\-based way, with LSHTM leading on implementation research and evaluation, supporting the UN target of halving newborn deaths by 2030 \(5.7\). 

 **Open access education 

 Lawn and others developed two Massive Open Online Courses \(MOOCs\). ‘The Lancet Maternal Health Series’ course ran 11 times from 2017 to 2020, with over 9,000 participants, hosted on the online platform FutureLearn. The course presented material from a range of maternal health experts and evidence across disciplines and was designed for those considering or undertaking postgraduate study in maternal or neonatal health. A second online course, ‘Improving the Health of Women, Children and Adolescents’, presented the latest data, priorities and debates about the health of adolescents, mothers, newborns and children worldwide. The course has run 9 times to between 2015 and 2020, with over 33,000 learners consisting of healthcare professionals or those working in a health organisation, and those interested in the health of women, children and adolescents \(5.8\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Menopause symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats are experienced by millions of women worldwide, and their effect can often be debilitating and life altering. Hormone therapy is used by many women, but an effective non\-medical alternative was needed. Researchers at King’s were the first to develop and evaluate a specific cognitive behavioural therapy \(CBT\) intervention to meet the need for safe and effective non\-hormonal treatments for women with problematic menopausal symptoms. King’s CBT produced significant reductions in the impact of hot flushes and night sweats in randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\), with additional benefits to sleep, mood and quality of life. It is now recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in the UK, and a position statement from the North American Menopause Society considers it one of the most effective non\-medical treatments available. The therapy is implemented in a variety of ways: via a manual and trained health professionals, a self\-help book, and freely available online resources in partnership with charities and organisations supporting women and their workplaces.  King’s CBT is therefore easily accessible to women who need it, bringing relief to many thousands of women worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The most common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor \(hot flushes and night sweats\), which affect about 80% of mid\-aged women. Around 25% report these symptoms affect the quality of their daily lives, including working capacity and even the intention to remain in work. Symptoms typically last between four and eight years, although may persist for ten, and may differ between ethnic groups. There are over 7,200,000 women in the UK aged between 45\-60 \(ONS 2020\), the ages when menopause most commonly occurs, so around 1,800,000 women could be experiencing problematic symptoms at any one time. For women who experience premature menopause brought about by chemotherapy, ovary removal surgery or anti\-oestrogen treatments, symptoms tend to be even more severe. Hormone Therapy \(HT\) is an effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, but is contraindicated for women who have had, or are at increased risk for breast cancer, and avoided by those who are uncertain about health risks and benefits, or who prefer a non\-medical option. Medical alternatives to HT, such as anti\-depressants, are moderately effective but have side effects, and non\-medical options, such as vitamins and complementary therapies, generally lack evidence of effectiveness. 

 **King’s researchers established the prevalence of problematic symptoms, and that an alternative was needed to HT to manage these for many women.** In a UK study of over 10,000 women King’s researchers found that 54% experienced hot flushes and night sweats up to ten years post menopause, with an average of 33 per week, and varying degrees of severity **\(1\)**, therefore establishing a need for safe, acceptable and effective non\-hormonal treatments for moderate to severe menopausal symptoms. 

 **King’s researchers developed a cognitive behavioural model for women with problematic menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats.** King’s researchers demonstrated that psychological factors including stress, social embarrassment, disgust, feeling out of control and frustration can exacerbate hot flushes; that negative expectations and beliefs and low self\-esteem are associated with more problematic symptoms; and that behavioural reactions \(such as avoiding social situations\) are also associated with more troubling flushes and sweats. Based on these findings, King’s researchers designed a model built on the possible relationships between biological, cognitive, behavioural and environmental factors affecting problematic menopausal symptoms, drawing on theories of symptom perception, self\-regulation theory, and cognitive behavioural models. King’s model describes interactions between psychological and physical factors and proposes that mood might influence the experience and the reporting of symptoms. It recommends psychoeducation and behavioural strategies to manage hot flushes and night sweats **\(2\)**. 

 **King’s researchers then carried out the “MENOS” clinical RCTs.** King’s researchers showed that both group and self\-help CBT reduce the impact of problematic hot flushes and night sweats by an average of 50%, both for breast cancer patients **\(3\)** and for women in the general population **\(4\)**, at 6 weeks and 6 months. CBT also significantly improved aspects of quality of life and measures of mood and memory problems. 

 **King’s researchers collaborated internationally to adapt and test the MENOS protocol in multicentre RCTs in the Netherlands.** For breast cancer patients who were premenopausal on diagnosis of their breast cancer, but whose treatment had put them into menopause, the delivery of CBT supported by a therapist, and in online self\-help formats, effectively reduced the impact of hot flushes and night sweats **\(5\)**. 

#  King’s researchers carried out a multicentre MENOS UK RCT in eight public and private organisations, the first time such an intervention had been tested in the workplace. 

 King’s CBT self\-help model had significant and positive impact on hot flushes, night sweats, wellbeing, sleep, work and social adjustment and presenteeism – women being at work without impairment from symptoms **\(6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 King’s research brings an innovative treatment option to women for a problem which has been historically overlooked or trivialised. Women need non\-pharmacological treatment options to manage not only the impact of vasomotor symptoms, but also to alleviate depression and anxiety that so often accompany and exacerbate night sweats and hot flushes. 

 **King’s research into the use of CBT for the treatment of menopausal symptoms has shaped national and international policy and guidelines.** King’s CBT research **\(3\)** was the only work of this kind cited to support the inclusion of CBT as an effective treatment for anxiety and depressed mood during menopause, in the first menopause NICE Guideline in 2015, NG23: Menopause: Diagnosis and Management **\[A1\]**. This work also influenced NICE guidance in recommending that GPs and health professionals should provide menopausal women with information and advice about CBT **\[A2\]**. Based on her body of research, King’s researcher Professor Myra Hunter was appointed Expert Advisor on the NICE Guideline **\[A3\]**. Moreover, based on King’s research the Chief Medical Officer’s 2015 report recommended CBT for symptoms in working women: ‘Non\-pharmaceutical treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy are helpful in reducing the impact of menopausal symptoms *.*' **\[A4\].** 

 The North American Menopause Society \(2015\) is the authoritative US source advising healthcare workers and patients. In their position statement \(2015\) it recommends CBT as one of the few effective non\-hormonal treatments available for menopausal women, referencing King’s research. This is a level 1 recommendation, i.e. the strongest possible **\[A5\]**. 

 **King’s research on CBT for menopausal symptoms has been recommended to healthcare professionals in the UK and is being implemented.** In a partnership with the British Menopause Society \(BMS\), King’s academics produced a factsheet for healthcare professionals **\[B1\]**, which was endorsed by NICE in 2017. This has changed practice by providing high quality evidence supporting drug free treatment. It has been on the BMS website since 2017, but download figures are only available for February 2019 – November 2020, during which it had 7,162 page views and 565 downloads **\[B2\]**. Furthermore, an annual two\-day course set\-up in collaboration with the British Menopause Society has been run four times since 2018 and has trained 86 health professionals such as GPs, clinical psychologists, CBT therapists, counsellors, and breast cancer nurses to run CBT groups for women, and there has been further training of breast care teams in hospitals **\[B2, B3\]**.  A treatment manual published by Routledge in 2015 **\[B4\]** has been bought by over 300 health professionals to date as part of their training, to enable them to use the treatment in their practice **\[B5\]**. A BMJ Practice paper on non\-hormonal treatments for menopausal symptoms recommends CBT for menopause, based on King’s research **\[B6\]**. 

 **King’s research has supported tens of thousands of women with affordable and easy to access CBT treatments.** Healthcare workers who have taken the BMS two\-day course **\[B2\]** have successfully reached thousands of women both directly and through other healthcare workers, for example one practitioner in Scotland estimates she has reached 1,850 people **\[C1\]**.  In partnership with the BMS King’s researchers produced an easily accessible fact sheet for women, hosted on the patient arm of its website, Women’s Health Concern \(WHC\) **\[C2\]**.  Between November 2017 and November 2020 this had 59,184 page views, and 1,291 downloads **\[B2\]**, being used beyond the UK: *“*For many women who utilise our service, Myra, your work has changed their lives. We have a wait of approximately 4 months for a new patient appointment… I routinely send out your Women’s Health Concern factsheet prior to their appointment to assist with managing their symptoms *”* **\[C3, C4\]**. In 2014 King’s researchers launched a self\-help book ‘Managing Hot Flushes and Night Sweats’ **\[C5\]** to empower women to use the treatments themselves, and in their practices. Now in its second edition, almost 2,000 copies of the book have been sold **\[B5\].** 

 CBT for menopause has also captured the imagination of the media with in\-depth coverage by several national outlets **\[C6\]**. A 2018 BBC1 documentary The Truth about the Menopause presented by Mariella Frostrup featured King’s research, with feedback from those who used CBT during this programme including comments such as “transformational,” “very useful” and “I’m just Miss Chill now” **\[C7\]**. 

 The Australasian Menopause Society also recommends and links to the resources hosted by the WHC **\[C8\]**. 

 **King’s CBT for menopause has been used in marginalised communities.** King’s researchers worked with Handsinc charity in Hackney to develop the “Reclaim the menopause” group sessions for BAME women in the community who might not otherwise easily access services.  Around 200 women have attended sessions **\[D1\]** and they report:  *‘*Strategies that we learn here, we pass on to other women who are interested. I’m telling my sisters, who are all over 50 and going through it’ **\[D2\]**. 

#  King’s research has helped women in the workplace manage their menopausal symptoms. 

 The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development \(CIPD\) now recommends CBT treatment in their 2019 report ‘The menopause at work: a practical guide for people managers’ **\[E1\]** based on NICE recommendations and King’s research in the workplace **\(3,4,6\)**. The BMS also have a factsheet for employers **\[E2\]**. The charity Henpicked is one of the UK's largest, fastest growing communities for women over 40, and has created online resources **\[E3\]** based on King’s research. It also runs seminars in the workplace on menopause, and King’s CBT and research is an important element in their training. Over the past four years hundreds of employers have attended their training sessions, most recently 120 in the three months from September \- November 2020 **\[E4\]**.  Feedback from the Department of Education after a seminar included “never seen such positive feedback after any session” **\[E5\]**. TUC Wales has produced a toolkit for trade unionists ‘The menopause in the workplace’ **\[E6\]** which also draws on many of the resources King’s research has informed **\[e.g. A1, A4, E2\]**. 

 **King’s researchers partnered with Turning Point, a UK charity that delivers mental health care to over 100,000 people with addictions and severe mental health problems.** Its Rightsteps initiative supports over 7,000 people in a workplace health and wellbeing programme that benefitted from King’s research. King’s academics were contracted to develop and launch an online version of CBT for menopause. This was launched on World Menopause Day, 18 October 2020 **\[E7\]**, and is already available to all Turning Point staff. It is currently being rolled out to service users who wish to know more about menopause, as well as being incorporated in Rightsteps wellbeing packages. 

 **King’s research has underpinned partnerships with cancer charities.** Breast Cancer Care \(the main UK charity for breast cancer patients\), has run 12 CBT group workshops since 2014 in NHS facilities across the UK, attended by 150 women \(2019\) **\[B3\]**. 

 Maggie's is a charity providing free cancer support and information in centres across the UK and online and has partnered with King’s to make King’s CBT for menopause available to women accessing their services. King’s staff are currently training clinical staff to deliver online CBT in 6 centres, with a further 18 centres planned **\[F1\]**. 

 **Women report life\-changing impact from King’s CBT.** Women report King’s CBT brings a restored sense of control: “I've found it to be a godsend \- hot flushes don't last for as long as you think, you can learn what triggers a hot flush and … at least be prepared that it's likely to happen”, with some reporting benefits that extended beyond their menopausal symptoms: “I've found it to be a very interesting, useful read, and some of the skills I've learnt I'm now using in other areas of my life .... with my stressful job for example. Thank you Professor Hunter and Ms Smith \- just wish I had been told about these coping skills sooner” **\[G1\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cybercrime is a growing national problem, and the ‘human factor’ is a key cybersecurity vulnerability. Northumbria Cyber Security Research Group \(NCSRG\), recognised as an ‘Academic Centre of Excellence in Cybersecurity’ in 2019, is a cross\-faculty, multi\-disciplinary group investigating human\-centred approaches to cybersecurity. NCSRG’s research has informed key cybersecurity policy documents in the UK and was used by the National Cyber Security Centre for campaigns raising public awareness of cybercrime. Through collaboration with industry \(Think Cyber\), the NCSRG contributed to the development of an award\-winning cybersecurity training product that has been used to train staff at Tesco Bank and the London Borough of Camden Council. Cybersecurity awareness of over 1,000 older people \(a group considered amongst the most vulnerable to cybercrime\) in the North East of England has been increased through the work of the NCSRG with the University of the Third Age. \[text removed for publication\]

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cybercrime costs the UK economy billions of pounds per year. Northumbria Cyber Security Research Group \(NCSRG\) is a cross\-faculty, multi\-disciplinary group which aims to understand security vulnerabilities which exist at the intersection of people, technology, and place. The group includes Dr James Nicholson from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, as well as Professor Pamela Briggs and Professor Lynne Coventry from the Department of Psychology, and others. The group combines technical computer science expertise on such topics as web security protocols and image recognition, with human\-centred work on security, privacy, and trust. Nicholson contributes the technical knowledge of digital security mechanisms and countermeasures while investigating the opportunities to improve user\-facing technologies. 

 Most common cybersecurity measures rely on simple authentication mechanisms, such as password or face recognition, that are not always effective in stopping cybercrime. In 2013, NCSRG’s research explored the experiences of older users with text passwords \[ **R1**\], showing that knowledge\-based authentication methods \(passwords and PINs\) were problematic for older people, due to such factors as memory decline. This work demonstrated the importance of tailoring technology to distinct population groups. As a result, the NCSRG team developed more inclusive authentication systems that could benefit both older and younger users by improving the practical entropy of codes without compromising their memorability \[ **R1**\]. 

 With the objective of creating secure online systems that account for human behaviour, NCSRG also looked into the design of user interfaces during the EPRSC\-funded Choice Architecture for Information Security \(ChAISe\) project. The team investigated a choice architecture \(an approach to retaining a user’s right to choose while ‘nudging’ them to make certain choices\) as a mechanism for bridging the technical security countermeasures of organisations and human limitations, by carefully designing user\-facing security interfaces \[ **R2**\]. The effectiveness of ‘nudges’ in helping users to identify social engineering attacks was evaluated, showing that users were more successful in identifying phishing emails when their attention was drawn to the sender’s details \(name and originating email address\). This work highlighted the fact that interfaces hiding sender information in emails \(e.g., full originating email address\) is problematic and potentially hinders users’ efforts to evaluate the authenticity of emails in their everyday lives. 

 While investigating methods to improve cybersecurity, the NCSRG showed that a simple ‘nudge’ towards protective actions \(e.g., a message reminding a user to create a stronger password\) can significantly improve security protections \[ **R3**\]. Refining their work on ‘nudges’, NCSRG researched cybersecurity in the workplace by creating a gamified method of detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This work revealed tensions between corporate approaches to cybersecurity compliance and the attitudes and behaviours of employees \[ **R4**\]. This research showed how online tools can inform the design of successful campaigns and training events that can improve the socio\-technical security of organisations. 

 The common thread running through NCSRG’s research has established that systems designed with diverse communities of users in mind, lead to more secure interactions and better cybersecurity protection. In 2017, in collaboration with the Universities of Bath, Cranfield, and Portsmouth, Northumbria’s team started working on the Cybersecurity Across the Lifespan \(cSALSA\) project, which focused on age\-related vulnerabilities. This work built on NCSRG’s earlier research into difficulties that older adults \(and other communities\) experience when trying to authenticate their identity \(e.g., using passwords and PINs\) \[ **R1**\]. The research found that older people are amongst the most vulnerable to cybercrime, yet they are also the least likely to use online learning sources to increase cybersecurity literacy \[ **R5**\]. The cSALSA project examined the most effective methods of communicating cybersecurity information to older adults, identifying training opportunities and technologies that could facilitate better understanding of these technical concepts \[ **R5**\]. In 2019, NCSRG used this research to develop an EPSRC NetworkPlus funded CyberGuardians project, designed to create community\-based cybersecurity courses in the North East of England, as an intervention to increase cybersecurity awareness. 

 Acknowledging NCSRG’s innovative work in human\-centred cybersecurity, in 2019 the National Cyber Security Centre \(NCSC, the UK’s technical authority for cyber threats\) designated Northumbria University as an ‘Academic Centre of Excellence in Cybersecurity’.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Northumbria Cyber Security Research Group \(NCSRG\) achieved impact in three spheres: informed national cybersecurity policy documents and national campaigns; contributed to the development of the commercial cybersecurity training tools that were utilised with private and public organisations; and raised awareness of cybercrime among over 1,000 older people \(vulnerable to cybercrime group\) in the North East of England, through novel peer\-to\-peer training courses. 

 **4.1. Contribution to cybersecurity policy development and national campaigns in the UK** 

 NCSRG directly informed the government’s approach to cybersecurity in the UK. In 2014, NCSRG members were invited to contribute to a report by the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser on ‘The Internet of Things: making the most of the Second Digital Revolution’ \[ **E1**, Northumbria’s contribution is acknowledged on p38\]. The report set out a vision for the Government’s regulation of data flows created by Internet of Things \(IoT\) technologies, and the research agenda outlined in that report led directly to the establishment of the GBP14,000,000 PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity in 2018. PETRAS considers issues of privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security \[i.e., human\-centred aspects of cybersecurity analysed in **R1**, **R4**, **R5**\] as they relate to IoT devices, systems, and networks. The centre is comprised of a consortium of 16 research institutions, including Northumbria University \[ **E2**\]. Through collaboration with industry and government partners, PETRAS ensures that research is directly applied to benefit society, business, and the economy. 

 NCSRG also shaped national guideline recommendations on the IoT. In 2018, NCSRG joined an academic and industry panel created by the UK Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\), to assess how best to ensure that consumer internet\-connected products and associated services are secure. The DCMS report ‘Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things’ explicitly acknowledged the influence of the cSALSA \[ **R5**\] project as the source of findings that helps Government *‘to design more effective cyber security advice and educational materials that are tailored for different audiences’* \[ **E3**, p27\]. 

 While informing key UK policy documents on cybersecurity, Northumbria’s work also shaped cybersecurity campaigns run by the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the Government Communications Headquarters, responsible for improving the security of the UK’s online activity through technological improvements and advice to citizens and organisations. National campaigns run since 2015, including ‘People are the strongest link’, ‘You shape security’, and ‘Cyber Aware Campaign’, embedded NCSRG’s findings on how to make cybersecurity available to various groups \[ **R1**, **R5**\], such as senior citizens and employees of private and public organisations \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.2. Development of novel cybersecurity training products** 

 NCSRG’s work became a key part of award\-winning cybersecurity training products developed by an external company, Think Cyber, which were used by customers including Tesco Bank and the London Borough of Camden Council. In 2018, NCSRG’s research \[ **R2**, **R4**, **R5**\] was used to improve Think Cyber’s Redflags™ product. Tim Ward, CEO and Co\-founder of the Think Cyber, stated: 

 *‘\[Collaboration with Northumbria\] highlighted some key do's and do not's for delivering security awareness that have formed a significant part of our marketing and the narrative behind our unique approach to security awareness: little and often, easy to access, simple and actionable, context driven/real time.* *Redflags™, the product* *that incorporates this work has recently \[2020\] won the SC Award for Best Professional Training Programme’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 Following the refinement of the existing Redflags™ product, Think Cyber and NCSRG secured GBP40,000 Innovate UK funding to create novel cybersecurity awareness training. The need to increase cybersecurity awareness is partly driven by regulations \(e.g., ISO027001, EU NIS Directive\) requiring companies to include cybersecurity courses in their programmes of staff training. The new training product developed in collaboration with Northumbria \(built on **R2** and **R4**\) \[ **E5**\] recognised both the needs and behaviours of the staff who receive such training, and the requirements of enterprise practitioners who are responsible for delivering the training to staff. Tim Ward, CEO and Co\-founder of the Think Cyber, stated: 

 *‘\[We\] established problems with existing training and how it could be improved. We also evaluated the design of four potential approaches that we considered developing in the future. Two particular ideas from this – Security Bulletins and Real\-time tips have evolved into key parts of our product. We are now marketing a NCSC certified set of Security Bulletins \(now named “Stories”\) and have deployed a bespoke version of this to Tesco Bank and Camden Council* \[text removed for publication\] *’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 NCSRG helped the company to develop a strategic vision for their products and to secure an excellent reputation in the field of cybersecurity training \[ **E5**\]. The company was selected for the first cohort of the technology innovation accelerator ‘London Office for Rapid Cybersecurity Advancement’ and was one of only seven \(and only two outside the US\) finalists in the New York City Mayor’s Cyber Moonshot Challenge \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.3. Reducing the risk of cybercrime targeting older people** 

 Older people form a population group that is amongst the most vulnerable to cybercrime. Many senior citizens are aware of online risks but are often not sure how to protect themselves, which sometimes impedes their use of online tools altogether. In the North East of England, the NCSRG team enhanced the cybersecurity awareness of over 1,000 older people \[ **E6**, **E7**\]. 

 Working with University of Third Age \(U3A\) in the North East of England, in 2017 the NCSRG team organised practical workshops that focused on password management, social engineering, online privacy, social media, privacy implications of GDPR, and online shopping and banking for older people \[based on research on older people’s use of passwords and other authentication methods **R1**, **R5**\]. As a result of these workshops, over 240 older people increased their awareness of cybersecurity \[ **E6**\]. Following the workshops, due to positive feedback and high demand, the team decided to create a peer\-to\-peer programme that would allow members of the community to train their peers in cybersecurity. The innovative CyberGuardians project was launched in 2019 by the NCSRG team in collaboration with the U3A and the Old Low Light Heritage Centre. During the project, NCSRG designed and delivered training to 14 CyberGuardians from across the region \(Whitley Bay, Prudhoe, Newcastle, Gateshead, Northallerton, Teesside, Tynemouth\) – older people who disseminated cybersecurity messages within their communities. The U3A report stated: 

 *‘Up until the end of September 2020, the CyberGuardians helped approximately 820 people with cybersecurity advice and help… This is an amazing achievement for the 14 CyberGuardians, but even more people can still benefit from their knowledge. The CyberGuardians have been particularly active organising training sessions during the current UK Covid\-19 lockdown, given the 400% increase in Coronavirus scams during this period, but are looking to continue helping as many people as possible’* \[ **E7**\]. 

 Counting the initial cybersecurity workshops and the CyberGuardians’ training, over 1,000 hard to reach and vulnerable \(to cybercrime\) older people in the North East benefitted from NCSRG’s work. Mike Martin, former U3A Northumbria Regional Committee Member and a CyberGuardian, stated: 

 *‘The message of good security practices is better received when it comes from people that they \[older people\] trust, and it is incredible to see the positive impact that a few individuals have had on the general online protection of older adults in the North East of England. This improved protection and awareness would not have been possible without Northumbria University’* \[ **E6**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Development Engagement Lab, previously the Aid Attitudes Tracker, has **radically altered how policy makers and development organisations present aid**. It has enabled them to **defend aid to the sceptical ‘marginally engaged’** demographic through a shift in focus from ‘pity based’ campaigns, which focus on negative portrayals of need, to an emphasis on more positive campaigns. That this has been effective is shown by the ‘Aid Works’ campaign, which was championed by the Secretary of State for International Development and led to a **15% increase in people’s understanding of how aid works**. The programme has gone on to **shape ‘The Campaign to Defend Aid and Development’, a sector\-wide aid** campaign involving 25 of the largest international NGOs and accounting for £5.6billions \(7%\) of total UK charity spending annually. This approach has now been adopted across the sector, leading to **collective, joined up, and positive campaigns as the norm**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Aid Attitudes Tracker \(AAT\) has been a vital source of research\-based evidence about changing public attitudes toward support for government aid and charitable giving to international development NGOs. Initially funded by the Gates Foundation, the AAT, now the Development Engagement Lab \(DEL\), is a collaborative project between the University of Birmingham \(UoB\), University College London, and the University of Texas at Dallas. The AAT collects large\-N, panel, and experimental survey data across the UK, France, Germany, and the US, in order to track changing public attitudes to overseas aid. 

 Since joining UoB in 2017, Professor David Hudson, an expert in the politics of development, has led the UoB strand of the AAT project. He has designed survey questionnaires and experiments, and run segmentation analysis, as well as writing up and presenting the findings in a series of academic publications. The AAT’s segmentation is unique in that it tracks 18 behaviours or actions related to supporting overseas aid; for example, donating money, contacting their MP, or volunteering. 

 The AAT has over 30 official partner organisations across the UK, US, France, and Germany \(e.g., ONE, Save the Children, Water Aid, Oxfam, Welthungerhilfe, Coordination SUD, Agence Française de Développement, and DFID\), with impact reaching across the entire UK development sector, from small NGOs, to large NGOs, to the government \(DFID\). The project uses specialised country consultants to work in a hands\-on way with partner organisations to increase the take\-up and application of AAT insights into communications, advocacy, and fundraising campaigns. The research has developed in tandem with the AAT’s impact: in addition to the survey questionnaire’s core tracking questions, 25 questions were set aside at each wave for partner input, which has enabled the systematic co\-production of research to reflect a combination of best academic practice and partner needs. 

 Three key **research findings** underpin the AAT’s impact: 

 **F1.** Data from the AAT have identified 5 sub\-groups of the public with respect to how they engage with international development and global poverty: Totally Disengaged \(32% of British public\), Marginally Engaged \(35%\), Informationally Engaged \(17%\), Behaviourally Engaged \(13%\), and Fully Engaged \(3%\). The AAT has revealed — contrary to what many in the sector had assumed — that the **third of the public who are ‘marginally engaged’ can and do change their minds**. The findings show that an individual’s engagement *does* change over time. Although engagement levels can be ‘sticky’ \(i.e., respondents typically stay within the same segment over time\) and engagement isn’t a linear ‘journey’, people are not immoveable and can be ‘won over’ or ‘lost’. **Moreover, the AAT has revealed which factors make them more engaged: a sense of duty and a belief that they can make a difference** \[R1\]. 

 **F2. Pity\-based fundraising appeals undermine cosmopolitan sentiments.** NGOs tend to use ‘pity\-based’ fundraising appeals; for example, images of starving children shown as ‘grateful receivers’, without context or agency \[R2\]. The AAT team has shown that such pity\-based appeals \(1\) are no more likely to get people to donate money compared to a more positive or empathy\-based appeal; \(2\) are more likely to undermine people’s sense of being able to make a difference to global poverty; and \(3\) are mediated or translated into behaviour by an individual’s emotional response. When people feel increased hope, they are more likely to donate and feel a sense of cosmopolitanism, but pity\-based appeals undermine people’s hopefulness and belief that they can make a difference \[R3\]. 

 **F3. NGOs should not use celebrities to endorse development campaigns, but rather should use volunteers or frontline workers.** The AAT team found that effective aid messengers \(i.e., advocates or spokespeople\) are those that are perceived as both warm *and* competent — one without the other does not work. With respect to donations, members of the public are more likely to respond to messengers that are perceived as relatable. When asked to sign a petition, being seen to care for others is important. AAT data show that frontline workers and volunteers are the most effective categories of messenger for donations and signing petitions, whereas celebrities, business people, and philanthropists have a negative impact \[R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Aid Attitudes Tracker \(AAT\) has improved how aid is viewed in the UK and made an influential contribution to international aid campaigns across a number of civil society organisations. This has manifested through changing the practices of several NGOs, policymakers, and charitable organisations engaged in international aid work. 

1.  <ins> **Transforming how policy makers and NGOs engage with, and present aid campaigns to, the public**</ins> 

 **Policy makers have changed the way that they communicate with the public to present international aid** as a result of AAT data. Specifically, the Department for International Development \(DFID\) and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \(FCDO\) have changed how they track and monitor their public perception KPIs \[F1–F3; C1\]. An integral element of DFID’s mission is to garner support for international aid through explaining aid impact to the general public and defending the Government commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on development aid. AAT has provided more effective ways to do this, moving from a victim narrative to a narratives that tell “positive stories of change” \[C2\]. This enables stronger support for international aid, including from the marginally engaged, a previously ignored segment of the population \[F1\]. **AAT has enabled** **policy makers and key stakeholders in the development sector to** **improve public support for development and aid**, which is attested to by an FCDO \(formerly DFID\) Deputy Director, who states “AAT/DEL evidence is embedded in the communications approach of the department” and “A pillar of the former DFID Communication Division strategy was to showcase how UK aid works, and is making the world a safer, healthier place, and AAT/DEL insight is key to how this is delivered” \[C3\]. As consequence **the public’s understanding of how aid works has changed**, particularly for the marginally engaged, whose engagement with aid campaigns was improved by a concerted communications effort \[F1; C4\]. For example, DFID used AAT evidence to target the marginally engaged in their ‘Aid Works’ campaign, which was championed by the Secretary of State for International Development and led to a **15% increase in people’s understanding of how aid works** over the campaign period, compared to no change in the control region. 

 **A sector\-wide aid campaign involving 25 of the largest international NGOs**, The Campaign to Defend Aid and Development, which accounts for £5.6billions \(7%\) of total UK charity spending annually, has been shaped by AAT data. This has influenced a move from campaigns which focus on the needs of overseas beneficiaries to campaigns which start from the perspective of citizens in the UK and makes the case in the context of their own lives \[F2\]. The aim of the campaign is to change the view of marginally engaged populations, such that they see aid as positive and right for the UK to provide and thus support it, and has been successful in that it “has influenced change in campaign design throughout the sector and transformed the way that organisations make the case for aid” \[C5a\]. For example, CARE International removed their pity\-based advertising in response to the campaign’s innovations and learnings, and World Vision are now using radio advertising to target the marginally engaged based on the campaign’s appeal for NGOs to “grow the market” \[F1, F2, C5a\]. That the campaign is underpinned by AAT data is attested to by the campaign’s Director, who stated that “the depth of the collaboration that UK NGOs have achieved \[…\] could not have been possible without AAT” \[C5a\]. The campaign was initiated in 2017, with AAT findings \[F3\] underpinning its theory of change \[C5b\] and enabling organisations to work in a coordinated and evidence\-based way. The campaign’s target audience was defined by an AAT segment \[C1\], collectively targeting marginally engaged members of the public \[F1\]. 

 Other AAT partners have **taken a** **more proactive and joined\-up approach to engage the public in aid campaigns** as a result of AAT’s segmentation and profiling \[F1–F3\]. Whereas previously organisations’ insights and campaign teams worked in silos, key organisations including the Disasters Emergency Committee, DFID, UNICEF, Comic Relief, and the Gates Foundation are now using AAT segmentation and profiling to align communications strategies and to define their measures of success and KPIs \[F1; C3\]. This particularly has benefitted smaller NGOs, for whom there was “nothing comparable to access in terms of data, evidence and rigour”, and who “would not have the resources to carry out audience segmentation or opinion polling themselves” \[C1\]. 

1.  <ins> **Improving NGO partners’ aid campaigns**</ins> 

 **Practices have changed within non\-governmental organisations** as a result of AAT research findings. AAT has **improved the effectiveness of the messages NGOs include in their public\-facing campaigns** by influencing the types of people they use as messengers \[F3\], making them “more rigorous \[…\] than they otherwise would have been” \[C1\]. Multiple international development NGOs, including Plan International, WaterAid, CARE International, and Save the Children UK, have **fundamentally changed the design and content of their appeals** **as a result of engagement with AAT evidence** \[F2\], with an evaluation report acknowledging that “in some cases the analysis would not have taken place without the building blocks from AAT” \[C1\]. **NGOs are now moving away from pity\-based campaign appeals and images towards sharing more positive stories** \[C1, C2\], with AAT evidence having moved this “from being a hypothesis to a business consideration” \(Executive Director of Policy, Advocacy and Campaigns, Save the Children UK \[C1\]\). This influence, developed through the AAT team’s 6\-monthly partner meetings that were attended by representatives from DFID/FCDO and over 20 development NGOs, is best demonstrated in the following areas: 

1.  Organisations are now more likely to use volunteers and frontline workers to communicate their messages instead of celebrities and aid recipients, which has **led to increased public interaction with appeals**. DFID/FCDO in particular have adopted this as best practice, stating that “FCDO now uses different messengers \[…\] to deliver communications or endorse campaigns, improving the effectiveness of the messages they’re trying to get across. DFID \[…\] moved to using with volunteers and frontline workers” \[C3\]. This has been shown to **improve the effectiveness of the work of NGOs**: Facebook testing showed that a campaign ad featuring relatable local people as messengers \[F3\] was more effective in making people take action towards the issue than using existing DFID content \[C5b\]. 

1.  AAT has **shaped campaigning organisations’ approaches to using messengers**. Purpose ran 10 large campaigns in Germany, France, and the UK directly using AAT’s evidence base, acknowledging that “AAT research contributed towards the definition of our campaign hypotheses” \[C6a\]. Some of their most prioritised insights for campaigns, including relatable/knowledgeable messengers \[F3\] and speaking in positive terms and emphasising the solution \[F2\] were “shaped by AAT insights” \[C6b\]. One key example of this was their ‘Project Period’ campaign which reached over 2 million people, of which many “went on to take higher barrier actions, raising funds or awareness of Global period poverty to their own networks” \[C6c\] *.* The campaign also surpassed its target of $30,000, which was the amount needed to start a hub for sanitary pads production in rural Kenya. Purpose’s Strategy Manager stated that “the campaign activated a wide range of audiences that were not necessarily behaviourally engaged with global development but might develop affinity based on menstruation”, demonstrating that employing period poverty activists in their communications led to greater engagement from more diverse networks than they would have otherwise had \[C6a\]. 

1.  WaterAid have **reinvented their campaigns**, moving away from the traditional pity\-based appeals to emphasise different emotions and give their audience a lot more hope \[F2\], as well as changing their focus to “ *draw people closer*, bringing faraway people who lacked clean water and decent toilets as close to our supporters as their own friends and family” \[F3; C7\]. WaterAid’s Head of Performance and Insight has reported **that AAT/DEL are “catalys\[ing\] real change in the wider sector’s approach to public communication”** and that this is having a “hugely positive effect on public perceptions of aid and development” \[C7\]. Their new communications direction, which was reported to be testament to AAT/DEL insight \[C7\], was implemented through their award\-winning ‘Untapped’ campaign, which showed many markers of success, including increased awareness of WaterAid by 2% and consideration of the NGO by 2.6% over the course of the campaign. This campaign also performed well in fundraising terms, significantly exceeding its £4million target and ensuring a full DfID Aid Match was secured. 

 Additionally, AAT insights have **influenced the funding guidance for Aid Match and AAT findings have assisted NGOs in their successful applications**. Aid Match, a scheme whereby donations of up to £3million are match\-funded by DFID, has enabled 61 organisations across the UK to run projects that have helped approximately 23.4 million people across 37 countries. AAT findings around pity\-based appeals and messengers \[F2, F3\] are featured prominently in the communications and appeal guidance. For example, for Aid Match campaigns in 2020, it stated that “strong messaging \[…\] avoids making people feel guilty, blamed, helpless or pitying” \[F2; C8, p.21\]. Multiple organisations found that their knowledge of **AAT contributed to the success of their applications**, as the alignment of Aid Match guidance with AAT findings meant that groups were able translate key concepts around audience and campaigning to the requirements of the funding \[C1\]. 

 AAT’s segmentation \[F1\] has also resulted in **organisations changing their approach to monitoring and evaluation**, with UNICEF’s Soccer Aid being a high\-profile example of this. As a result of Aid Match and the funding conditions influenced by AAT, **UNICEF have changed their messages around Soccer Aid** to be more hopeful and joyful rather than pity\-based, with their Strategic Communications Lead stating that AAT “has helped us develop our Soccer Aid for Unicef campaign over the past three years and **has played a part in increas\[ing\] income by £2.6 million**.” \[C1, C2\]. By increasing their understanding of their audience, in that many who engage in the event are marginally engaged \[F1\], the organisation were better able to target their adverts to ensure those audiences were made aware of donations being doubled \[C1, C2\]. UNICEF reported that SoccerAid 2020 was their most successful campaign yet \[C2\], raising £9.3million in 2020 compared to £6.7million in 2018 \(before engaging with AAT evidence\), which they attribute in part to a change of messaging \[F2; C2\]. This change in tone has also **led to a change in donor behaviour**, with UNICEF reporting that “not only has the shift in tone increased the overall amount raised on the night of TV, it has also increased the value of individual donations with more viewers donating the higher price point of £30 than ever before” \[C2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Community history projects on urban trees and parks promote mutual understandings of shared heritage, improve the wellbeing of participants and promote the conservation agenda for the preservation of nature in towns and cities. This case study describes the impacts of Professor Paul Elliott’s research into the history of urban trees and parks. The work has had impacts on **public awareness and engagement** through community history projects on urban green spaces, particularly in relation to the First World War centenary; **pedagogy** through student placements and **management of the urban environment** by informing English Heritage’s preservation, restoration and management of public parks. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impacts on culture and society described here are rooted in Elliott’s longstanding research interests and pedigree, exploring ways in which historical analysis of place and future environmental sustainability are substantially informed by approaches from cultural and historical geography, landscape and environmental history, the history of science and urban history. The research approaches have been intertwined with public engagement methodologies which also support the impact described below. 

 Part of this work focused on the cultural and historical geographies of trees including an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) funded project on arboreta in collaboration with Professor Charles Watkins and Professor Stephen Daniels at the University of Nottingham \(2003\-7\) and a study of urban trees completed at the University of Derby \[3.2\]. Elliott explored the science and culture of arboriculture and demonstrated how the development of this was fostered by a variety of factors including global trade and exploration, the popularity of collecting, changes in landscape gardening aesthetics and agricultural and horticultural improvement. Tree collections were idealised as microcosms of nature, miniature encapsulations of the globe and as living museums. His work critically examines the contexts for tree nurturing and planting in order to understand the changing practical, scientific, aesthetic and pedagogical principals that underpinned the design, display and perception of tree collections. Elliott’s research into arboricultural history has also had an important international dimension and compares the development of British and Irish arboretums and tree planting with that in Europe, the USA and other countries, whilst the ecological impact of growing trees and the interface between heritage, conservation, restoration and the management of tree collections has also been addressed in a series of publications listed below. 

 Elliott has taken his research on trees and urban green spaces forward in various studies. In the *British Arboretum* \[3.1\], *British Urban Trees* \[3.2\] and articles on gardening, landscape gardening and public parks \[3.3, 3.4 and 3.5\] he has explored the relationship between landscape, place and scientific culture with case studies of urban private and botanical gardens, arboretums, public parks and street trees. The research has also been developed in AHRC\-funded community history projects on urban green spaces between 2011 and 2016 \(see below\). As *“one of the country’s leading historians of British gardens”* \( *The Independent*, 2015\), Elliott has advanced the argument that studies of the histories and cultures of arboriculture and green spaces can inform future planning for environmental sustainability in a series of blogs arguing that as public awareness concern over the environmental emergency grows and the political climate is changing, the time is now ripe for ambitious culturally and historically\-informed re\-forestation and re\-wilding schemes to be undertaken \[5.1\]. These would increase the proportion of British forest cover, help to counter the adverse effects of industrialisation, urban expansion, pollution, disease and modern urban living and also reconnect urban communities with the natural world. These measures would provide major social, cultural and economic benefits and more diverse interconnected ecological communities with thriving habitats for flora and fauna, rich with insects, birds and harbouring numerous fungi and plants.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impact has occurred in three main ways. Firstly, by **influencing the management and preservation of the UK’s urban green spaces** by informing English Heritage’s preservation, restoration and management of public parks and also their Local Authority management **.** Most significantly, Elliott’s research into urban green space history and previous outputs including *The British Arboretum* \(2011\) \[3.1\] was utilised by Dr Katy Layton Jones to inform her report on historic urban green spaces for English Heritage specifically concerning the philosophical, aesthetic, horticultural and educational theories underlying the planning, layout, organisation, and management of parks, the links with botanic gardens and scientific developments in the study of forestry and horticulture and the role of parks as recreational spaces, which made the research, *“particularly relevant to current interpretations of the evolution of both the form and function of public green space”* \[5.6\]. The results of Elliott’s research have been disseminated nationally in various media formats between 2014 and 2020 including articles and blogs \[5.7, 5.8\] on the history of urban green spaces and interviews about historic urban parks in *The* *Independent* and *The Daily Telegraph* \[5.4\]. Elliott has been interviewed by *The Guardian* about the special community role of historic urban parks and arboretums during the COVID\-19 Lockdown \( *The Guardian*, 27 October 2020\) and produced a recorded tour of the Derby Arboretum for BBC Radio Derby \(broadcast 13 June 2020\) \[5.4\]. 

 Elliott has forged close working relationships with organisations including Derby and Nottingham City councils, community arts groups and the Friends of Derby Arboretum. For example, in May 2019, Elliott led a co\-designed walk around Elvaston Castle Park, Derbyshire with colleague the poet, Adrian Buckner \[5.10\]. This featured historical talks and readings of poetry about trees specially composed by Buckner as part of Derby Walking Festival in collaboration with Derby City Council’s Parks and Active Living Service to provide practical and physical activities with learning opportunities built into walking experiences for public health and educational benefits. Likewise, the research for the Derby World War 1 \(WW1\) Parks project \(2016\) was displayed in Derby Library and Council House, helping the successful campaign by Derby Museums, Pauline Latham MP and others to bring the celebrated ‘Weeping Window’ of ceramic poppies from Paul Cummins’ ‘Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red’ installation at the Tower of London in 2014–15 to Derby for display at the Silk Mill in June and July 2017 \[5.9\]. Secondly, through **public awareness and engagement** developed from two AHRC funded community history projects on urban green spaces. Elliott was Co\-I of the Nottingham Green Spaces Community History project directed by Professor John Beckett of Nottingham University in two stages in 2013–14 and 2016. The project was co\-produced and co\-researched with the partners Nottingham City Council, Nottingham Women’s History Group, Friends of the Forest, Friends of the Arboretum, the Nottingham Women’s Centre WoLAN Project, and the Mapperley and Sherwood History group. The 2016 stage focused on imaginative dissemination and community\-focused activities designed to engage a wider range of audiences in this history. 

 The main events included a specially commissioned play called *Breathing Spaces* composed by playwright Andy Barrett utilising historical materials produced by Elliott and project team members, tracing the history, development and use of Nottingham’s parks and open spaces and performed during national ‘Love Parks Week’ in July 2016 in four Nottingham parks by Excavate theatre group to a total audience of c.400. The script, illustrated with performance photographs, was placed on the project website with a downloadable public version as a resource \[5.2\]. Project talks were given by team members including Elliott along with ten short videos prepared by Barrett and Excavate. After the month\-long exhibition in Nottingham Central Library, the panels were installed in the public Pavilion on the Forest in Nottingham and the Nottingham Arboretum with digital versions on the project website. Information was disseminated in other ways including leaflets, websites, television and newspaper interviews, lectures, children’s activities and workshops. Elliott and members of the ‘Friends’ organisation re\-designed illustrated historical information panels for the Nottingham Arboretum, deciding upon the content together, going through a process of critical evaluation, sharing and comparing information. 

 Additional **public awareness and engagement** impact was achieved by Elliott as Co\-I of the AHRC\-funded Centre for Hidden Histories of the First World War \(2014–2016\). Elliott led a ‘Derby Parks in Wartime’ community history collaborative project funded by this in 2016 with Spiral Arts, a Derby\-based community\-arts collective, Mark Knight, a doctoral researcher and community activist and a group of volunteers including members of GoldsQUAD \(which improves the happiness and wellbeing of those aged over 50 through increased arts participation\). Project results were presented artistically through a specially\-designed banner, an exhibition with banners and information boards and WW1 themed well dressings. The professional visual artists and project partners at Spiral Arts emphasised that the project gave them new creative skill\-sets \(e.g. archival research skills\) and enhanced their organisation’s profile \(e.g. Derby’s Mayor and government officials came to the public exhibition of the tapestry\) \[5.3, p. 81\]. Building on the research of Keri Facer and Bryony Enright, Larissa Allwork, Impact Fellow at the Centre for Hidden Histories \(University of Nottingham, June 2016–September 2017\), and now Impact Researcher at the University of Derby \(September 2018–present\) has emphasised the significant ‘embodied legacies’ provided by the First World War Engagement Centre Projects, citing the example of a ‘Derby Parks in Wartime’ participant. In a reflection workshop led by Allwork \(25 August 2016\), the retired lecturer with a professional background in community work commented: *“This sort of activity can be so therapeutic, as I have experienced, but there isn’t enough recognition given to this sort of activity in regards to...people’s well\-being…\[Its value for\] The coming together of community...and people recognising the past*” \[5.3, p.80\]. 

 Thirdly, **pedagogy through student placements**. As part of the AHRC\-funded Derby WW1 Green Spaces Community History project, two Derby University undergraduate students won university\-funded research bursaries of GBP2,163 to create their own projects. They presented their research findings at the Learning and Teaching Conference \(4 July 2016\) and displayed their information boards at the public launch event at Derby Arboretum on 21 August 2016 during the ‘Lark in the Park’ event supported by the Health Lottery and Healthcalm backed by the People’s Health Trust \[5.5\]. One student gave a speech at the event and there were talks from Spiral Arts and Derby Councillor Jangir Khan.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Westminster’s Communication and Media Research Institute \(CAMRI\) is renowned for international research that takes a public interest approach, as reflected in the work of Prof Naomi Sakr and Dr Winston Mano, specialists in Arab and African media respectively, whose research has generated the following impacts: 

-  Prof Sakr wrote a commissioned UNESCO report used in developing a new public service television channel in Jordan; helped Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee win funding to produce educational media for displaced children in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq; facilitated Arab\-European knowledge exchange on children’s media that has influenced creative practice in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. 

-  Dr Mano wrote a commissioned Media Institute of Southern Africa \(MISA\) policy framework document that has demonstrably aided Zimbabwean media stakeholders in their pursuit of a democratised media space; and contributed to an influential Call to Action on media reform issued by the Pan\-African Parliament and adopted by 33 media organisations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 International attention began to focus on media deficiencies in the Arab and African regions from 2001, following the 9/11 attacks by Egyptian and Saudi hijackers, political change in post\-apartheid Southern Africa, and the intensification of the crisis in Zimbabwe from 2002 onwards. Much mainstream non\-academic commentary on media shortcomings in Arab and African countries has focused on the media themselves, overlooking the wider political, economic and social dimensions which Sakr and Mano highlight in their research. Sakr and Mano’s research has contributed towards a shift in discourse that recognises the multi\-faceted and often structural constraints which affect Arab and African media similarly, despite concrete social and political differences between countries. 

 In 2007, Prof Sakr, author of the prize\-winning book *Satellite Realms* \(2001\) *,* became founding director of the CAMRI Arab Media Centre, launched after CAMRI hosted a two\-year series of ESRC\-funded international seminars on the notion of an Arab public sphere. Sakr’s research across this period, including her monograph *Arab Television Today* \[1\], showed how Arab media censorship remained entrenched across the region despite the rise of cross\-border media and supposedly new media players. Her associated work on media reform, frequently sought after the Arab uprisings of 2011, has included a focus on openings for public service media. For instance, in a 2013 book chapter on Jordan \[2\], which built on her previous research on Jordan’s ‘stop\-go’ media transition \(2002\) and ‘thwarted aspirations’ \(2012\), Sakr showed how reform of its state broadcaster in the public interest was impeded by regional conflicts, geopolitical pressures, the power of the monarchy and elite alliances straddling business and the state bureaucracy. 

 Sakr’s research on Arab children’s media, advanced by contacts developed at an Arab Media Centre conference on the topic in 2010 and facilitated by an AHRC\-funded 3\-year project on pan\-Arab children’s TV \(2013\-16\), led by Sakr and undertaken by a five\-person CAMRI team, has identified constraints on production and distribution of locally relevant screen media for Arab children alongside outcomes of these constraints for supply chains and intercultural collaboration. Her outputs from the project include two books \(2017, 2019\) and three solo journal articles published so far. Sakr’s sole\-authored chapter in the first book \[3\], a collection she co\-edited, unpicks causal processes and transnational interactions behind public initiatives adopted in the field of children’s media in Egypt and Qatar and reveals the unstable role played in them by privileged individuals. Her co\-authored chapter in the same volume examines the interweaving of commercial and political considerations behind the branding and rebranding of Al\-Jazeera Children's Channel, showing how underlying brand values shifted in favour of a depoliticised form of nation branding which downplayed an earlier commitment to local creativity. 

 In 2009, Dr Mano founded the CAMRI African Media Centre and the *Journal of African Media Studies*, which provides a forum for debate on the historical and contemporary aspects of media and communication in Africa. Dr Mano gained prominence through his work on African journalism, which included editing a special 2005 issue of the peer\-reviewed open access journal *Westminster Papers in Communication and Culture* that critically evaluated and investigated the ways in which local and global mass media were depicting the troubling events in Zimbabwe across the previous six years \[4\]. Mano’s own contribution focused on the interplay between press freedom, professionalism and proprietorship in Zimbabwe and showed that far from being docile victims of the country’s hostile media environment, most Zimbabwean journalists have ‘resisted’ or ‘rebelled’ and are developing sophisticated ways of negotiating the pressures exerted on them by private and public media proprietors. 

 In the period before Mugabe’s 37\-year presidency ended in Zimbabwe in 2017, Mano identified and elucidated the structural forces that can make journalists susceptible to undue influence, including poor terms and conditions of employment, obstacles to the creation of autonomous professional unions, and ethical codes dictated by authoritarian regimes. To ensure the kind of independence and impartiality required by public service media, Mano has used his research to provide Africa\-based media creatives with strategies for redressing these structural problems \[5\]. This work led to Mano’s involvement in African regional deliberations on media reform and other policy reform initiatives, including organising the 2013 interlinked CAMRI events, New Thinking on Public Service Broadcasting for the Next Generation and Public Service Broadcasting in Africa – Continuity and Change in the 21st Century, both with support from UNESCO and BBC Media Action. He also participates in the DFID\-funded and BBC\-led Protecting Independent Media for Effective Development \(PRIMED\) Research Technical Advisory Group \(2020\). 

 Having directly engaged with civil society organisations in Southern Africa for over a decade, Mano’s 2020 article \[6\] posits that a more proactive network of civil society across Southern Africa can produce an impact on public service broadcasting \(PSB\) institutions in these countries by enhancing reform and accountability to the public. Mano identifies pathways towards increased cooperation among public service broadcasters, civil society coalitions and other stakeholders in South Africa and Zimbabwe, and, through a focus on two specific case studies, how such collaborative networks can engender a context within which a collaboratively defined PSB mission, institutional structure and programme outcomes are constantly foregrounded in the operations and performance of the broadcasters.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  Impact of Sakr’s Input to the ‘Support to Media in Jordan’ Programme 

 The Danish NGO International Media Support \(IMS\), active in the Middle East and North Africa \(MENA\) since 2004, has worked with Sakr since 2008. In 2014, having won a contract from UNESCO to implement an EU\-funded programme called ‘Support to Media in Jordan’, IMS commissioned Sakr to write a report on *Good Practice in EU Public Service Media and Contemporary Practice in Jordan* \[A\]. The report’s purpose, combined with UNESCO’s *Assessment of Media Development in Jordan* report, was to inform Jordanian government decision\-making vis\-à\-vis the provision of public service TV. UNESCO’s then Senior Project Manager for Support to Media in Jordan, writes in the report’s preface that Sakr’s research ‘contribute\[s\] to the on\-going discussion on how to expand media freedom, independence and professionalism in Jordan’ and ’provides lessons learnt that could serve as an inspiration’ for Jordan’s ‘state broadcaster JRTV in its ambition to transform itself to a public service media company’ \[A, p. 3\]. In this connection, Prof Sakr was asked to present the report to Jordanian TV executives at a closed retreat in April 2015 \[B, p.238\]. 

 Publication of the report in September 2015 was followed by plans for a new Jordan public service television channel, launched under the name Al\-Mamlaka in July 2018. This reflected the report’s recommendations ‘in many respects’, according to the lead International Expert on the Assessment of Media Development in Jordan project \[C\], who writes in a corroborating letter that ‘the design and structure of the new station reflected the report’s recommendations for public service media provision’ \[C\]. He adds: ‘As such, I believe that Professor Sakr’s work as part of the Support to Media in Jordan Project contributed to the EU\-UNESCO mandate to encourage development and reform of Jordan’s media landscape’ \[C\]. 

#  Mano’s Impact on Zimbabwean Media Reform 

 Having identified a 2013 amendment to the Zimbabwe constitution as an opening for media reform, the Media Institute of Southern Africa \(MISA\) commissioned Mano to lead a team of consultants to produce a document entitled *Media Policy Framework for Zimbabwe: A Model By MISA\-Zimbabwe* \[D\]. This is an up\-to\-date policy framework that draws from the 2013 constitution and corresponds with regional and international standards on media freedom, access to information, freedom of expression, privacy and related rights. MISA states that ‘Dr Mano's insights \[…\] directly influenced MISA's thinking on the key issues and had an impact on how the new media policy principles were operationalised for stakeholders in a language and format that was more acceptable to our stakeholders’ \[E\]. 

 One such stakeholder is Radio Voice of the People \(VOP\), whose Executive Director is a trainer at the Zimbabwe Association of Community Radio Stations \(ZACRAS\), which lobbies for informed and participatory citizenry through the establishment of vibrant community radio stations. Mano’s contribution to strategy adjustments adopted by the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe, of which these organisations are members, was recognised after the elections of July 2018, when incoming information minister Monica Mutsvangwa invited media advocacy groups to put forward media reform policies. As a document that gives clear policy direction on the steps / measures that Zimbabwe should put in place in order to democratise its media space, the VOP’s director writes: ‘In our engagements with the Ministry of Information in Zimbabwe during discussions on media policy reforms we frequently consult *Media Policy Framework for Zimbabwe: A Model By MISA\-Zimbabwe* as a key resource’ \[F\]. 

#  Mano’s Impact on Broader African Media Reform 

 Mano has contributed to initiatives such as the Pan\-African Parliament, the legislative body of the African Union, who invited Mano to contribute as a Drafting Committee Member to the *Midrand Call to Action: Media Freedom and Public Broadcasting in Africa*. The Call to Action was issued by the December 2013 Continental Conference on Media Legislative Reforms and Transforming State Broadcasters into Public Broadcasters that was hosted by the Pan\-African Parliament \[G, H\]. In a corroborating letter, the Chair of the Conference’s organising committee confirms: ‘Dr Mano’s insights, drawn from his academic research, helped create a Call to Action that demanded legislative reforms to transform state broadcasters into public broadcasters. Mano’s contributions, informed by his work on public service broadcasting, specifically helped draft the final Call to Action’ \[H\]. 

 As MISA writes, ‘over 33 civil society organisations representing more than 200 advocacy, research, human rights, democracy and good governance networks in Africa have endorsed the Call’ \[I, p.35\], and the Chair of the Conference ‘believe\[s\] this adoption was of significant benefit to the agenda of reforming media legislation in Africa’ \[H\]. This belief is shared by PEN South Africa, who in 2017 referred to the Call to Action as a key action in the ‘growing movement in Africa  towards the decriminalisation of defamation supported by associations of journalists and other media professionals, press freedom groups, human rights organisations and others’; such defamation or ‘insult laws’ are highlighted by PEN as a major constraint on press freedom \[J, p.10\]. 

 The Chair of the Pan\-African Conference’s organising committee adds that: ‘we believe the work of Dr Mano \[…\] provided crucial expertise and knowledge to advance PanAfrican media reform initiatives. It has benefitted the Pan African Parliament, the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa and other organisations involved in media reform. Such expertise is drawn upon for strategising around the democratisation of media in this region and devising initiatives aimed at meeting this goal’ \[H\]. 

#  Sakr’s Impact on Media Provision for Arab Children 

 During 2017 Sesame Workshop \(SW\), makers of the preschool show *Sesame Street*, and the International Rescue Committee \(IRC\) applied for $100m from the MacArthur Foundation to produce educational media for displaced children in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Following publication of her research in *Children’s TV and Digital Media in the Arab World* \(output \[3\]\), SW sought Sakr’s advice on networking with Arab broadcasters and regional contacts and solicited a letter from her in support of their semi\-finalist application to the MacArthur Foundation’s  [100&Change](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/) Prize; a prize for a proposal that ‘promises real and measurable progress in solving a critical problem of our time’. In December 2017, SW and IRC  [won](https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/sesame-workshop-and-international-rescue-committee-awarded-100-million-early-childhood-education-syrian-refugees/) this large prize that enables them to make a difference in the world. The heads of SW and IRC thanked Sakr ‘for lending your powerful voice through the letter you issued in support’ \[K\]. Among other things, SW and IRC are using the funding for  [addressing](https://www.rescue.org/article/sesame-street-and-irc-are-helping-refugee-children-overcome-trauma) ‘toxic stress’ among 9 million children refugee children and their caregivers through culturally relevant multimedia content. 

 In 2017\-18, Sakr used her research to enable Arab experts to share and refresh their practice vis\-à\-vis children’s screen media. As co\-organiser of a series of AHRC\-supported Arab\-European dialogues in Manchester, Copenhagen, Munich and London in 2017\-18 on the media needs of Arab children living in Europe through forced migration, Sakr steered industry discussions that challenged preconceptions about Arab childhoods and fostered deeper awareness of cultural sensitivities, as evidenced by participants from Egypt and the UAE \[L\]. 

 For instance, Nathalie Habib, speaking for Blink Studios in the UAE, states that ‘collaboration’ with Prof. Sakr ‘caused Blink Studios to raise awareness in Dubai and Abu Dhabi of trends in children’s screen media in Europe with the aim of setting up further opportunities for Arab\-European knowledge exchange in this specialised but crucial field’ \[L1\]. It also empowered her to challenge ‘issues of stereotyping and cultural misunderstanding’ beyond the dialogue workshops, for instance among attendees at the biennial Prix Jeunesse international children’s TV festival in Germany \[L1\]. 

  

 The Egyptian Arts & Culture Programme Manager at the intergovernmental Danish\-Egyptian Dialogue Initiative \(DEDI\), Cairo, whose activities include training creative practitioners, also attests to having benefitted from his participation in the project co\-led by Professor Sakr \[L1\], because it helped him gain ‘a better understanding of production problems’, ‘enriched’ his ‘ability to recognise desirable and suitable qualities of children’s media’, and put him ‘in a better position to carry out projects with regards to optimising the design of our collaborations and selecting suitable partners’ \[L2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Pabst’s research on postliberalism has generated new thinking within centre\-left parties and think tanks. His ideas on the common good and virtue have changed the understanding of both parties and think tanks about why socio\-economic liberalism is in crisis and what constructive alternatives are available. 

 Pabst’s work focuses on ‘operationalising’ the common good and virtue in policy terms to help provide an ethical framework for politicians and policy\-makers beyond individual rights or collective utility. His widely published proposals about strengthening mutual arrangements based on reciprocal obligations have been adopted nationally and internationally – including sustained collaborations with the Labour Party \(UK, Australia\), the new French party *Refondation*, and London\-based think tanks \(St Paul’s Institute; Common Good Foundation\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since **2014**, Pabst’s research has helped to provide centre\-left parties and think tanks with a new narrative and fresh policy proposals in a radically changed context dominated by the opposition between liberalism and populism. The work charts a path beyond this and other binaries by showing that postliberalism offers resources for novel policy ideas in times when ideologies are in question and events such as the 2016 Brexit vote or the COVID\-19 pandemic expose deep flaws in the dominant economic model. Far from being anti\-liberal, postliberal politics seeks to complement liberalism and correct its extreme effects: growing wealth inequality, a sense of powerlessness, and the devaluation of certain professions and identities. 

 Pabst developed a novel critique of the limits of liberalism and outlined available alternatives focused on virtue and the common good. The works was published in three monographs **\[R1, R5, R6\]** in **2016** and **2019**, seven journal articles \(e.g. **\[R3\]** in **2017**\) and an edited collection **\[R1\]** in **2015**. Pabst also transposed the main ideas into media essays and policy reports \(e.g. **\[R4\]** in **2018**\). The research has put the terms ‘postliberalism’ and ‘politics of virtue’ in the common lexicon of politicians and policy\-makers, including Jon Cruddas MP, Lisa Nandy MP, and Rachel Reeves MP. As demonstrated in section 4, Pabst’s research has influenced their thinking about why the excesses of socio\-economic liberalism leave people without decent jobs, a political voice, and a sense of belonging. 

 The key findings of Pabst’s research are threefold. First, Pabst established a new critique of contemporary liberalism, showing that many liberal policies such as financial liberalisation and austerity brought about a concentration of wealth, a centralisation of power, and, crucially, a commodification of everyday existence **\[R2, R3\]**. Contemporary liberalism offers more opportunities and freedoms for individuals, but the benefits accrue disproportionately to what Pabst terms a novel ‘oligarchy’ composed of ‘old elites’ and ‘new classes’ – global finance, tech platforms, and a managerial class clustered in metropolitan hubs. A key insight of Pabst’s work is that economic and social liberalism reinforce each other by promoting individualism, which privileges transactions and private autonomy over relationships and attachment to people and place **\[R4, R5\]**. Pabst’s critique has helped to change think\-tank and political party understandings of the limits of liberalism and postliberal alternatives, including post–COVID\-19. 

 Secondly, the postliberal politics developed by Pabst combines freedom with security by pursuing economic justice and social cohesion **\[R4, R5\]** underpinned by the common good and virtue. One way to foster economic justice is through a better balance of the interests of capital, labour, and the communities within which they are embedded. An example Pabst focused on is greater economic democracy anchored in workers’ representation on company boards or new worker organisations in the ‘gig economy’. Greater social cohesion involves tackling loneliness and isolation by rebuilding civic ties – for instance, by creating mutuals that provide adult social care rather than the impersonal mechanisms of the central state or the free market. Pabst identified that this promotes the common good, which combines individual fulfilment with mutual flourishing; for example, being recognised for one’s role, talents, and contribution to society through paid or unpaid work **\[R2, R4\]**. The common good is a richer conception of justice than individual rights or collective utility alone – it seeks to re\-value citizenship and dignity, both of which are vital to a healthy democracy **\[R5\]**. 

 Thirdly, the conception of the common good developed by Pabst has established a new postliberal political and policy platform, including concrete policy ideas concerning the free movement of capital and people **\[R4\]**. Examples include: 

-  Focusing capital allocation on regional and social funding needs, by establishing regional banks and building civic institutions \(e.g. stronger professional associations and trade unions\); 

-  Reconnecting financial and commercial activity with a social and ecological purpose, by rewriting company law and strengthening the social license of businesses; 

-  Creating a national civic service for people of all ages to strengthen the meaning of citizenship.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Pabst’s research has challenged established norms in centre\-left thinking through his sustained cooperation with Labour politicians \(UK, Australia\) and *Refondation*, a new political movement in France. The work has also generated new projects with two think tanks: St Paul’s Institute \(London\) and the Common Good Foundation \(London\). 

 **Informing UK Labour Politicians’ Thinking, Policy Ideas, and Resources** 

 The work with politicians from the UK Labour Party \(membership of about 500,000\) has been the most extensive example of impact. Since 2015, Pabst’s research **\[R1, R2\]** has informed the thinking of Blue Labour, a group of politicians and advisers within the Party. Lord Glasman, a co\-founder, writes: 

 ‘His 2016 book *The Politics of Virtue: Post\-liberalism and the Human Future* \(co\-written with John Milbank\) has shaped Blue Labour’s work in two respects. One is the understanding of the liberal consensus at the heart of British politics for over forty years. \[…\] Pabst’s specific contribution has been to analyse liberalism’s fusion of market with state power at the expense of intermediary institutions such as burial societies, cooperatives, guilds, universities and faith communities.’ **\[a\]** 

 Since **2015**, Pabst’s research has also underpinned Blue Labour policy ideas on how to strengthen vocational training by transforming certain universities into vocational colleges and how to establish a National Civic Service aimed at nurturing a stronger sense of civic obligations. Glasman writes: 

 ‘The other impact \[Pabst’s\] research has generated is in terms of Blue Labour’s constructive alternative to liberalism. Adrian’s work on post\-liberal politics has helped to put the common good and virtue at the heart of Blue Labour’s political and policy platform. \[…\] Virtue is as central to human beings as vice, and politics can encourage more virtuous behaviour through incentives and rewards, as Adrian’s work also shows – including a civic service to learn a sense of mutual obligations.’ **\[a\]** 

 In addition, since early **2017**, Pabst has worked closely with Labour politicians as part of a new initiative called ‘Labour Together’, whose vice\-chairs include Lisa Nandy MP and Jon Cruddas MP. 

 Pabst’s research on economic justice **\[R4, R5\]** has informed the work of Jonathan Rutherford, a Labour Together adviser who was speechwriter to Rachel Reeves MP and Lisa Nandy MP. Rutherford drew on Pabst’s ideas for Reeves’ 2018 essay ‘Everyday Economy’. Furthermore, Nandy’s 2019 Clement Attlee Lecture on regulating tech platforms directly references Pabst’s research on how to bring about greater economic democracy **\[b\]**. Both texts help to shape the Labour Party’s economic policy platform. As Rutherford writes: 

 ‘Adrian’s research has played a significant role in shaping a new kind of politics for Labour in response to the new political period we are now in. Based on his book, *The Politics of Virtue: Post\-liberalism and the Human Future* \(2016\), he has been one of the foremost exponents of the idea of Post\-Liberalism which is influencing political debates on both the centre left and the centre right. He has also been a pioneer of new ways of thinking about geopolitics and of a fusion of political philosophy and virtue ethics. Adrian’s influence in the field of political ethics, political economy and geopolitics draws on his research and scholarship such that he presents a consistent intellectual approach and is one of the few people able to articulate a consistent and rounded understanding of the state of our politics, economy and society and how the country might find a way through its current predicament \[…\]. Adrian is currently contributing his research to Labour’s programme of Resources for National Renewal.’ **\[c\]** 

 On postliberal politics, Pabst’s work contributed to a series of policy seminars \( **2017**\- **19**\) organised by Labour Together and hosted by Jon Cruddas MP, who said that the research ‘stands as a signature contribution in the emerging debates around post\-liberalism’ **\[d\].** These seminars influenced Labour MPs, Peers, and policy advisers on how to develop a common good politics and economics. As Cruddas writes: 

 ‘It is Pabst’s focus on virtue and the common that is so distinctive – showing how practices of virtue offer exciting ideas about how to moralise the market and reclaim democracy. His work has made an important contribution to the activities of Labour Together, an initiative I was the Vice\-Chair of – including regular discussions with MPs and the publication of pamphlets such as my colleague Rachel Reeves’ *Everyday Economy*. Pabst has continued to develop some compelling policy ideas. They are making their way into speeches by Labour politicians \(such as my colleague Lisa Nandy, the other Vice\-Chair of Labour Together who referenced Pabst in her 2019 Attlee Lecture\) and will continue to be a resource for new thinking.’ **\[e\]** 

 **Influencing **Refondation**’s Political Outlook and Policy Ideas** 

 Pabst’s research has also influenced *Refondation*, a new centre\-left postliberal movement in France with thousands of members. Published in **April 2018**, the French translation of *The Politics of Virtue* **\[R2\]** is credited by the party leadership as a major influence on the party’s political outlook **\[f\]**. Pabst contributed to the party’s programme launched in **October 2018**, especially on virtue and the common good as the ethical ends of politics. His ideas are referenced in party documents and speeches. According to Refondation’s President Patrick Tivollier and the party’s General Secretary Dominique Mounier: 

 ‘Adrian’s work has helped Refondation to understand how economic liberalism and social liberalism reinforce each other and leave society more fragmented. One key aspect that Refondation has learned from his 2016 book *The Politics of Virtue: Postliberalism and the Human Future* \(French translation published in 2018\) is that virtue and the common good offer resources for concrete policy proposals: more compassion in health and social care, more wisdom in education, more social purpose in business and more solidarity in the delivery of public services. Adrian’s intervention at a Refondation seminar in November 2018 in Lens on social reforms set out these ideas and they have contributed to Refondation's policy platform.’ **\[f\]** 

 **Contributing to Australian Labor’s Analysis about Its Electoral Defeat and Future Direction** 

 Pabst has also worked with senior members of the Australian Labor Party \(membership of about 55,000\). They have cited his book *Story of Our Country: Labor’s Vision for Australia* as a source for better understanding the reasons for the party’s defeat in the May 2019 elections. The Party’s president Wayne Swan said that ‘there are a wealth of ideas in this book’ **\[g\],** and Mark Butler MP, the Shadow Minister for Climate Change, has described it as making an important contribution to ‘a full\-throated discussion’ about Labor’s direction after the election and a ‘policy and campaign review \[that\] must be ruthless and unsparing’ **\[g\]**. 

 **Shaping UK Think Tanks’ Strategy and Policy Development** 

 Since 2017, the work has also generated impact in close cooperation with two think\-tanks. First, in **2017\-18**, Pabst’s research gave rise to a new programme entitled Democracy and the Common Good, which Pabst established together with the St Paul’s Institute, an independent think tank linked to St Paul’s Cathedral. According to the chair of the Advisory Council: 

 ‘In the case of St Paul’s Institute, together with the former Director Barbara Ridpath, I worked closely with Pabst on a new programme entitled “Democracy and the Common Good”. A key insight from Pabst that had a significant influence on the development of this novel series was that the common good and virtue are practices, not abstract theories, and that as such they are resources for new policy proposals. Drawing directly on his research, Pabst wrote a report for the Institute that not only formulated new policy ideas but also allowed the Institute to have traction with politicians \(2 Labour and 2 Conservative MPs\), policy makers \(senior people from regulators and businesses\) and the media \(an edition of the BBC’s global philosopher programme led by Michael Sandel\). Since then the series has led to more work with a variety of stakeholders, including public debates hosted by the Bishop of London.’ **\[h\]** 

 Pabst’s pamphlet **\[R4\]**, with a foreword by Rachel Reeves MP, was launched at a private roundtable with politicians and policy\-makers and at a public event in St Paul’s Cathedral by the BBC’s global philosopher Michael Sandel **\[i\]**. The *New Statesman*’s editor, Jason Cowley, has linked this work to the postliberal turn in British politics and the importance of an ethical framework for political decisions and policymaking: 

 ‘Pabst, in association with the institute and others, is seeking nothing less than to remoralise politics. A New Statesman contributor, he is interested in questions of virtue and justice, and in how we might achieve personal fulfilment while meeting our obligations to one another and wider society.’ **\[j\]** 

 Pabst’s ideas have also shaped the work of the Common Good Foundation and led to his appointment as Trustee in **2017**. In **2018\-20**, his research underpinned a series of seminars on Common Good Economics co\-hosted by Lord Glasman and Andy Haldane \(chief economist, Bank of England\). Pabst’s ideas on strengthening vocational colleges and building a national development bank are cited in a policy programme co\-written by them **\[a\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton has enhanced the European Space Agency \(ESA\) and European Commission’s \(EC\) capability to monitor global vegetation from space. Specifically, Southampton’s algorithm underpinned ESA’s development of the only global satellite data product estimating terrestrial chlorophyll content in vegetation in near real\-time. Distribution of this data through the ESA and EC’s flagship Copernicus programme has generated major benefits for agricultural and environmental service providers, including timely and targeted response to poor harvests or plant disease outbreaks. Southampton have also developed validation data and protocols that are essential to support quality assurance of satellite\-derived vegetation products and ensure their suitability for numerous operational applications, ranging from monitoring biodiversity to drought surveillance. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Chlorophyll content and concentration within a vegetation canopy control the condition and productivity of vegetation. Reliable estimation of vegetation chlorophyll content is vital for those forest and agricultural service providers who monitor crop yields, plant health, seasonality, carbon fluxes and carbon sequestration. Therefore, accurate and near\-real\-time vegetation chlorophyll content estimation enables timely response to poor harvests or plant disease outbreaks, whilst global chlorophyll content estimates enable improvements in carbon flux modelling and evaluation of vegetation response to climate change. 

 The European Space Agency’s \(ESA’s\) Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer \(MERIS\) satellite sensor was launched in March 2002, aiming primarily at improving our understanding of ocean productivity via measurement of water colour. In 2004, **Curran** led the development of the **algorithm** \[ **3.1**\] to exploit MERIS imagery for the estimation of vegetation chlorophyll content. The algorithm uses a specific feature called the ‘red edge’, which is proportional to the vegetation chlorophyll content and can be detected by MERIS. The resultant index, the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index \(MTCI\), can be derived automatically from MERIS imagery and this led to establishment of **MTCI as a** **dedicated ‘land’ product** from the MERIS sensor. 

 MERIS sensor operation ended suddenly in 2012 following unexpected loss of satellite contact, ending generation of the MTCI product. ESA identified a continued need to provide similar quantitative information on vegetation canopy chlorophyll content to the user community through subsequent satellite missions. Based on the foundation of the MTCI algorithm and requirements from many users, **Dash** led research \(Grant B\) to develop and validate a **second vegetation chlorophyll content product, OTCI** \[ **3.2**\] from ESA’s Sentinel\-3A optical sensor, launched in 2016. Sentinel\-3A is an ocean and land observation satellite that forms part of the European Union’s Copernicus programme, one of the largest and most ambitious space programmes globally. This is the first time the ESA has produced a dedicated operational global vegetation product. 

 Subsequent research at Southampton and elsewhere demonstrated the superiority of MTCI over alternative satellite\-derived products in estimating vegetation chlorophyll content and monitoring vegetation condition. For example, **Dash** and **Ogutu** developed a new **MTCI\-GPP** model to estimate terrestrial vegetation primary productivity using estimates of vegetation chlorophyll content derived from the MERIS sensor’s MTCI product \[ **3.3**\]. Further independent research demonstrated the MTCI’s suitability in quantifying vegetation processes such as phenology and productivity. For example, among over **700** papers citing Southampton’s algorithm \[ **3.1**\] is the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, which used MTCI to map forest canopy nitrogen across the Mediterranean region \(Loozen *et al.*, 2018\). 

 To be fit for purpose for specific applications, it is essential for satellite\-derived products to undergo rigorous validation to assess data accuracy and measurement uncertainty. Through research funded by ESA in 2009 \(Grant A\), **Dash** established a new procedure for validation of satellite\-derived vegetation chlorophyll content products at various sites \[ **3.4**\]. This procedure is crucial to measuring the accuracy of ESA’s operational vegetation chlorophyll content products, and is delivered to users through the Copernicus programme. Building upon the validation work, **Dash, Ogutu** and PhD student Luke Brown developed new techniques to analyse time series data and assess the accuracy of satellite\-derived land products \[ **3.5**\]. This included: \(i\) systematic estimation and propagation of **uncertainty of in\-situ measurements** \(Grant C\) and \(ii\) establishing for the first time a framework for operational validation of Copernicus land products \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton made a key contribution to the European Copernicus programme’s capability to monitor global vegetation by \(i\) providing near real\-time data on global vegetation chlorophyll content that are routinely distributed to users by the ESA, and \(ii\) establishing an operational validation procedure for vegetation monitoring products. Both of these contributions are vital to meeting the objectives of the Copernicus land monitoring services programme to provide geographical information on the status of vegetation cover to a broad range of users in the field of terrestrial environmental applications, including those in agriculture, food security and forest management. 

 ESA used Dash’s algorithm to develop a new vegetation data product, the **OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index \(OTCI\)**. OTCI is based on the Sentinel\-3 satellite’s Ocean and Land Imaging spectrometer \(OLCI\) instrument, and replaced MTCI after MERIS ceased operation in 2012. User demand for a replacement product, coupled with evidence of the Southampton algorithm’s robustness, led ESA to include the ‘red edge’ detection capability offered by OTCI within the mission requirements document for the Copernicus Sentinel\-3 satellite programme. Since Sentinel 3 was launched in October 2016, ESA has used OTCI as a near real\-time, global data product on vegetation chlorophyll content. Dash’s group authored the user guide and algorithm description \[ **5.2**\]. The OTCI is currently \(February 2021\) the only near\-real time, global operational product estimating terrestrial vegetation chlorophyll content. An operational data product is one that ESA has committed to deliver long\-term and in near\-real time, guaranteeing users its continued and timely production. It is distributed to users free of charge through the Copernicus programme. As ESA states *‘the unique capability of the OTCI algorithm to exploit the red edge position, thus providing accurate information on very high level of chlorophyll contents which cannot be performed by other sensors, put Europe and the European Space Agency and Copernicus Programme in a unique and leading position for monitoring the state of vegetation all over the world*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 During 2017 alone, 2.44 pebibytes \(> 1000 terabytes\) of Sentinel 3 OTCI data were downloaded from Copernicus’ dissemination system \[ **5.3**\]. Copernicus programme users have deployed OTCI to monitor and manage terrestrial ecosystems, including estimating forest and crop health. As ESA stated “ *The innovative product \(OTCI\) that was developed by Dash’s team now contributes to an overall observation system that allows us to better understand how our planet is evolving and how it is responding to climate change and at the same time allows us to better understand climate change itself*” \[ **5.1**\] *.* 

 To ensure the quality of their operational data products meets the expected user requirements, in 2016 the European Commission established a new service called the Ground\-Based Observations for Validation \(GBOV\). Southampton’s research on the ground\-based validation of satellite\-derived vegetation data products \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\] led to **Dash**’s group writing an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for the European Commission specifying validation procedures for three other vegetation products – leaf area index, **LAI**; fraction of vegetation cover, **FVC**; and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, **FAPAR** \[ **5.4**\]. **Dash**’s group led the validation of the vegetation component \[ **5.5**\] and from 2017, conducted one of the largest and most comprehensive ground validation exercises globally, processing ground data across the world to determine the products’ accuracy as part of ESA’s Sentinel\-3 Validation Team. In 2017, ESA noted *‘Feedback from the Sentinel\-3 Validation Team meeting provided essential information to ESA and EUMETSAT to progress with the evolution and improvement of Sentinel\-3's core data products’* \[ **5.5**\]. The validation data are now being routinely used by the European Commission \(EC\) to ensure the operational products meet user requirements. The EC has noted that they ‘… *reproduce well the changes due to drought and wet conditions in Europe, as well as the realism of the temporal variation over specific events around the globe’* \[ **5.6**\]. Since 2017, the EC has delivered these three products – LAI, FVC, FAPAR – through the Copernicus programme to users worldwide. They are used by more than 6,000 organisations and users worldwide for a wide range of applications ranging from monitoring biodiversity to drought surveillance \[ **5.7**\]. For example, the EC’s Joint Research Centre uses Copernicus FAPAR and LAI product as key inputs to the Europe\-wide Monitoring Agriculture ResourceS \(MARS\) crop early warning programme \[ **5.8**\], which supports the Common Agricultural Policy and food security assessments worldwide. 

 In addition to ensuring the quality of the three satellite\-based vegetation products \[ **5.4**\], the Copernicus programme has distributed the ground\-based GBOV validation data set produced by **Dash**’s group since October 2018. The GBOV data are the largest ground data set for in\-depth quality assessment of any satellite\-derived vegetation product. Since their release in 2019, they have been downloaded by more than 300 users worldwide \[ **5.9**\]. Through such downloads, users have applied Southampton’s ground data to accuracy assessment of other satellite\-derived vegetation data products \(e.g. those from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer \(MODIS\) sensor\) alongside the data products distributed through the Copernicus programme \[ **5.10**\]. 

 Meanwhile, users have also benefitted significantly from implementing Dash’s chlorophyll algorithms independently of ESA. For example, in 2018 the World Bank reviewed the performance of algorithms for their prediction of crop yields from satellite data and recommend use of MTCI for countrywide maize crop yield estimates in Uganda, noting *‘the superior performance of MTCI is noteworthy’* \[p. 17\] and *‘The large boost in performance when using MTCI with Sentinel2 therefore more than outweighed any loss in accuracy from using coarser resolution’* \[ **5.11**\]. 

 The MTCI and OTCI algorithms developed at the University of Southampton thus formed the basis for innovative and robust data products for global vegetation monitoring which help the European Commission to deliver part of its flagship Copernicus programme. These data products provide accurate and timely information for users to monitor and manage both crops and our terrestrial biosphere.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Synthetic bone graft materials stimulate natural bone healing and regeneration when the body’s ability to heal itself is impaired due to disease or injury. Research by Prof. Sullivan and Dr. Hing at Queen Mary has led to the creation of a new\-generation synthetic bone graft material that is more reliable and effective than previous generations. The new material, developed in collaboration with Baxter International, launched in the UK as Inductigraft™ in 2013 and in the US as AltaPore™ in 2017. The material was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2017 and posterolateral spine fusion in 2018. With an estimated 24,000 procedures taking place every year using Baxter products, Inductigraft™ and AltaPore™ have led to safer and more reliable surgery, improved outcomes and quality\-of\-life for patients after surgery, with 98.9% fusion rates. This has generated significant cost savings for healthcare providers. In 2019, Inductigraft™ was selected as one of seven innovations to be presented on Royal Mail Stamps celebrating 50 years of British engineering achievement.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Synthetic bone grafts \(SBGs\) are highly porous materials \(>60% porous\) often consisting of a ceramic with a calcium\-phosphate\-based chemistry and an open foam\-like porous structure, which mimics cancellous bone \(the internal tissue of skeletal bone\). The purpose of an SBG is to stimulate bone healing or regeneration where the skeleton’s natural regenerative abilities are impaired or insufficient. Early SBGs were variable in both effectiveness and reliability due to a lack of understanding of the body’s biological response to these materials and their characteristics. 

 Research at Queen Mary led by Prof. Sullivan \(Department of Chemistry\) and Dr. Hing \(School of Engineering and Materials Science\) has led to the development of synthetic bone grafts that can stimulate natural bone healing and regeneration when the body’s regenerative abilities are impaired or insufficient due to disease or injury. 

 Sullivan’s research group described the first examples of silica and polysilsesquioxane materials having covalently attached phosphonate and phosphonic acid groups \[3.1\] and the synthesis of mesoporous phosphonic acid\-modified silicas that show a clear relationship between loading and porosity \[3.2\]. This work underpinned a close collaboration with Hing, whose research group specialise in novel biomaterials. This resulted in the development of a highly porous phosphate\-based ceramic foam for use in bone grafts \[EQR.1\] *.* This ceramic bone replacement material was launched in 2001 as ApaPore™, under the umbrella of ApaTech™, a Queen Mary spin\-out company. In 2010, ApaTech™ was bought by the US medical products company Baxter International. 

 Building on this success, further research led by Sullivan and Hing in collaboration with Baxter International, demonstrated that silicate was essential for early bone development. As a result, silicate\-substituted hydroxyapatite was employed in a new material. Hing’s team established that an optimal level of silicate substitution was 0.8% silicon by weight \[3.3\]. This led to the initial launch of the synthetic bone graft product Actifuse™ in 2005. An optimally silicate\-substituted synthetic bone graft with 80% porosity was subsequently developed into the Actifuse\-ABX™ and Actifuse\-Shape™ formats, released to market in 2008 and 2009 \[3.4\]. 

 In 2013, Sullivan and Hing published the results of their five\-year study on the adsorption and de\-adsorption of proteins to silicate\-substituted ceramics, using benchmarked fluorescently\-labelled proteins \[3.5\]. In 2017, they demonstrated that silicate substitution results in greater adsorption of bone morphogenic protein \(rh\-BMP\-2\) under physiologically relevant conditions \[3.6\]. This advance was important in providing a mode of action and optimising the silicate\-substituted hydroxyapatite in promoting the induction of bone remodelling, showing efficacy of SBGs in a challenging spine fusion model \[3.5, 3.6\]. It is this new understanding of the chemistry of the inorganic substrate and its adsorption of bone morphogenic proteins and osteoblast cells that led to the development of a new improved bone graft ceramic material, with enhanced porosity and protein adsorption properties. This new product was launched in the UK as Inductigraft™ in 2013 and in the US as AltaPore™ in 2017. 

 These next generation synthetic bone graft materials have proven osteoinductivity, which arises from a combination of hierarchical porosity, silicon doping, protein adsorption, cell capturing and cell activating properties. It is these properties that have led to more reliable bone regeneration needed for treating patients with impaired bone biology, multi\-level spinal fusions, or complicated trauma injuries.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research led by Queen Mary has resulted in the development of a synthetic bone graft \(SBG\) material with enhanced bone\-forming capacity compared to previous\-generation materials, being significantly greater at de\-novo bone regeneration. The improved bone graft material is typically used in spinal surgery in the US and UK as a treatment for patients with debilitating degenerative diseases, traumatic injuries or scoliosis. This product more reliably and rapidly supports bone regeneration in these patients than previous generations of synthetic bone graft materials such as Actifuse™ \(launched 2005\). It is also safer and more cost\-effective than autograft treatments, which use a patient’s own bone, or growth factors. The new material was initially launched by ApaTech/Baxter in the UK in 2013 as Inductigraft™ \[5.1\]. After gaining FDA approval for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2017, the material was launched in the US as AltaPore™. Its use in posterolateral spine fusion was approved by the FDA in 2018 \[5.2\]. Approximately 24,000 procedures per year are undertaken using Baxter bone graft products \[5.3\]. 

#  Enhancing patient wellbeing and improving clinical outcomes 

 Recent clinical publications demonstrate that Inductigraft™ is a more effective and reliable synthetic bone graft than other treatments, with: 

-  86.3% fusion rates in posterolateral fusion surgery \[5.4\] 

-  98.9% fusion rates in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and lateral lumbar interbody fusion surgery \[5.5\]. 

 This leads to improved health outcomes and wellbeing for patients. Robert Lee, a consultant orthopaedic and spinal surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital \(RNOH\) NHS Trust, one of the leading hospitals for orthopaedic healthcare in the UK, says: “I am able to reliably use Inductigraft™ without the need to harvest iliac crest bone to achieve excellent fusion rates, so eliminating the need for a second donor site with associated risks of infection, pain and complications associated with donor site morbidity. Moreover, we believe that the excellent fusion rates significantly contribute to the improvement in patient\-reported outcomes” \[5.6\]. 

 In a clinical trial, the team at RNOH achieved a 99% successful fusion rate at 12 months post\-surgery with Inductigraft™ \[5.6\]. Michael Mokawem, also a consultant orthopaedic and spinal surgeon at RNOH, explains how Inductigraft™ is superior to other SBGs \[5.3\]: “For Inductigraft, we have an excellent fusion rate – at 12 months, CT scans suggest close to 100% fusion \(1 out of 150 failed\), whereas for other SBGs it would be 80-92%” \[5.3\]. 

 In addition, the use of Inductigraft™/AltaPore™ reduces the need for anaesthesia and thus reduces surgical risks to the patient as they no longer require autograft bone \(from the iliac crest\). The operative procedure is shorter as a result, so patients are anaesthetised for a reduced length of time. 

 This has significant benefits for patient outcomes and quality of life. In clinical trials, at 12 months post\-surgery, researchers observed clinically significant decreases in disability in patients. Patients also reported reductions in pain and an improved quality\-of\-life post\-surgery. In more than half of the patients, motor and sensory functions, reflexes, straight leg raises and femoral stretches were maintained or improved \[5.4\]. Additionally, in contrast to growth factor\-based treatments, Inductigraft™/AltaPore™ is not contraindicated in people who are skeletally immature and therefore enables successful treatment of children and adolescents \[5.3\]. 

#  Improved health economics \[5.3\] 

-  Use of autograft involves two surgeries \(harvesting of the bone followed by implantation\). 

-  The operation itself is prolonged. 

-  Autograft harvesting procedures routinely experience complications. 

-  For allograft and autograft, the risk of infection or immune rejection is significant vs SBGs where it is virtually zero. The percentage of patients returning with complications and requiring further surgery is therefore higher for allo/autograft. 

-  In the case of allografts, the bone has to be treated and sterilised before it is used 

-  The faster bone growth associated with Baxter products also means that there is a reduced need for hardware, for example metal supports. 

 The associated cost implications of the above are detailed in the table below: 

| **Baxter vs Autograft and Growth Factor Therapy** |
| --- |
| **Reduced material and procedure costs** -  **–GBP400\-600\*/operation** compared to autograft\-based procedures -  **–GBP3,000\-6,000\*/operation** compared to growth factor therapy procedures |
| **Reduced surgery time** -  20% compared to autograft\-based procedures \(3 hours on average\) **–GBP800/operation** |
| **Reduced recovery time** -  Patients are released from hospital 2\-3 days earlier compared to autograft\-based procedures **–GBP700/operation \(GBP210\*\*/day\)** |
| **Reduced complications** -  21% less complications compared to autograft\-based procedures **–GBP5,000/operation** -  Potential for complication in 50% of the cases of growth factor therapy procedures |
| **Estimated savings\*\* -  **GBP21,000,000/year** when compared to autograft\-based procedures -  **GBP50,000,000/year** when compared to growth factor\-based procedures |

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Global maritime safety has been influenced by a range of collaborative research projects led by researchers in Naval Architecture Ocean and Marine Engineering at Strathclyde. Key findings were applied directly in the regulation\-making process in the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\) from January 2014 onwards; these regulations affect all commercial shipping operating up to December 2019, with important amendments informed by Strathclyde research introduced from January 2020. IMO regulations ensure a safety level is maintained, using a ‘risk\-based’ approach to foster innovation in design and operation of over 12,000 commercial vessels since August 2013. IMO regulations have directly led to reduction in loss of and damage to ships, reduction in injuries and loss of lives at sea, and supported economic benefits to the global maritime and insurance sectors. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 The International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\) is the United Nations agency responsible for safety, security and pollution prevention in international shipping and promotes standards, which influence the whole life cycle of maritime assets. These standards are in the form of International Conventions, such as the Safety of Life at Sea \(SOLAS\) regulations, which govern the design and operation of the merchant fleet with around 60,000 large merchant vessels \(over 500 gross tonnes\) transporting around 11 billion tons of goods and millions of crew and passengers around the world each year. Since 2000, a sustained programme of research involving six key academics noted above and over 50 other researchers in Naval Architecture Ocean and Marine Engineering at the University of Strathclyde has directly influenced the content and nature of SOLAS regulations, and hence the safety culture in the maritime industry. Key contributions to maritime safety are based on a significant body of research including: 

 **Introduction of the ‘Design for Safety’ approach**, leading to a paradigm shift in maritime safety regulations. This body of research established safety as a quantifiable design objective, using the principle of Goal Based Standards \(GBS\) to identify/quantify risks and achieve safety goals, as opposed to safety achieved by rule compliance. Over the past 20 years, the pace of technological development in the maritime industry led to unprecedented changes and safety challenges that could only be met by risk\-based approaches, rather than frequent prescriptive rule changes. In 2000 Strathclyde researchers instigated and established a large\-scale EU Thematic Network in maritime safety to promote the ‘design for safety’ philosophy, to implement Risk\-Based Design in industry and then to develop and take this risk\-centric regulatory framework to IMO \[ **R1**\]. 

 Vassalos and his research group proposed a methodological treatment of the dynamics of damaged ships while addressing the ensuing risk of flooding and offering solutions to the industry \[ **R4**\]. They developed and introduced techniques to measure safety and assess the performance of ships following incidents such as collision and grounding, leading to large scale flooding. The methodology enabled causal chains of events to be studied systematically to understand what happened, when, how and why, leading to better\-informed prevention, mitigation and control strategies and measures. A substantial body of research over 20 years examined target risk contributors and barriers, which included intact stability \[ **R3**\], damage stability \[ **R4**\], fire \[ **R1**\], efficiency in ship systems through energy flows \[ **R2**\], passenger evacuation \[ **R3**\], health monitoring of marine systems and structures \[ **R5**\], quantification of the human factors contribution to maritime safety, safety culture and awareness \[ **R6**\], risk analysis and assessment tools \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. The development of scientific first\-principles tools such as software, databases, and frameworks, allowed maritime safety to be assessed directly and quantitatively for the first time. 

 **Life cycle risk management:** In the maritime industry, new regulations apply only to ships laying keel after a given regulation has been enforced. This can leave 90% of the existing fleet operating at inferior standards, compared to new designs. Addressing this gap, several EU\-funded H2020 projects led by Strathclyde \(2019\-2022\), e.g. FLARE, SAFEPASS, AUTOSHIP, have involved key industry stakeholders to develop the requisite tools and, through IMO, an unprecedented regulatory framework for life cycle risk management, to address safety of all new and existing ships with any available cost\-effective means \[ **R4**\]. With the development of software and modelling tools, researchers at Strathclyde have enlarged the platform of cost\-effective solutions for life cycle risk management, for example by addressing environmental risk and energy efficiency over the lifespan of the vessel, to encompass design, operation and retrofitting \[ **R2**\]. Innovative measures linked to human factors, outcomes of the SAFEMODE project \(2019\-2022\), have been applied to maritime safety. Similarly, the EU FP7 SEAHORSE project \(2013\-2016\), led by Turan, addressed human and organisational errors in maritime accidents, for example through transfer of well\-proven practices and methodologies from air transport to marine transport \[ **R6**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through sustained collaboration with the IMO and the maritime industry, both during the research process and in disseminating the research outcomes, Strathclyde researchers have contributed to significant improvements to maritime safety and innovative legislation and practice. In particular, the researchers’ participation in IMO Working Groups \(for the original SOLAS 2009 regulations and bi\-annual amendments from January 2014 onwards\) and their promotion of collaborative working in the maritime industry through Centres of Excellence \(including the Maritime Safety Research Centre, Maritime Human Factors Centre, and Safety and Risk Doctoral Training Centre\) have been key drivers in these changes. The researchers also established University spin\-out companies, Safety at Sea Ltd \(1999\-2014\) and Maritime Safety Innovations Ltd \(2017\-present\), with maritime industry leaders to provide consultancy and training, and promote innovative safety solutions with emphasis on life cycle risk management. They have organised and participated in international industry\-academia conferences and workshops to transfer knowledge from the research. In this way, the following demonstrable impacts have been achieved: 

###  Informing legislation adopted by and promoted through the IMO 

 The IMO’s rules are the most important international instrument addressing maritime safety in the global merchant fleet, covering areas such as ship design, construction and equipment, subdivision and stability, fire protection, radio\-communications, safety of navigation, carriage of cargoes \(including dangerous cargoes\), safety management and maritime security. The merchant fleet also includes all passenger ships \(carrying more than 12 passengers\) on international voyages, with millions of passengers travelling on such ships each year. 

 Vassalos and Boulougouris have provided expertise and input from research projects to various regulatory working groups through the UK Government delegation to IMO, \(including Formal Safety Assessment Group, Environmental Impact Group and Safety of Domestic Ferries Group\) \[ **S1**\]. They have influenced bi\-annual amendments to the SOLAS 2009 regulations, which were in force until December 2019, and a series of important amendments introduced from January 2020. The Director of IMO’s Maritime Safety Division confirms that: ‘Strathclyde\-led projects … provided the inspiration and supported the development of several maritime safety\-defining initiatives that paved the way to complete modernisation of maritime safety. Noteworthy are also a number of technical presentations at IMO by Strathclyde to nurture wider understanding and support a fast\-pacing regulation process over the recent past’ \[ **S1**\]. 

 Principal to these contributions is the introduction of the ‘design for safety’ approach, based on the Strathclyde research, which led to the adoption of goal\-based standards \(GBS\) within all SOLAS regulations. The importance of this approach is confirmed on the IMO website: ‘IMO Member Governments have started approaching safety from a completely new perspective – one that is goal and performance oriented, in lieu of the traditional prescriptive\-based approach, taking into account the sophisticated nature of the maritime industry’ \[ **S2a**\]. The GBS approach continues to influence the regulation process of the IMO. The latest IMO instruments using the GBS approach to monitoring safety are the Polar Code \(which came into force from January 2017\), the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low\-flashpoint Fuels \(IGF Code; adopted June 2015\), and ship construction standards for bulk carriers and oil tankers of 150m in length and above \(adopted in 2012, came into force for vessels with a building contract placed on or after 1st July 2016\) \[ **S2a**\]. 

 Amendments to SOLAS regulations on subdivision and damage stability were adopted from June 2015, to update rules for international cargo and passenger ships \[ **S2b**\]. Damage stability failure represents 90% of the risk to human lives in maritime accidents, and as a ship is subdivided into compartments, it must be able to withstand flooding in one or more compartments without sinking. Revisions were based on findings from Strathclyde led EU funded collaborations, such as GOALDS \(Goal Based Damage Stability\) and FLOODSTAND \(Integrated Flooding Control and Standard for Stability and Crises Management\) \[ **S1**\]. 

 Further amendments on damage stability regulations came into effect in January 2020, relating to subdivision of passenger ships \[ **S2b**\]. IMO’s involvement in regulation of domestic ferry safety began with the Manila Conference in the Philippines in 2015, based on the work undertaken by Strathclyde and World Maritime University, Sweden, with Vassalos acting as lead consultant on behalf of IMO \[ **S1**, **S2c**\]. This led to the adoption of the ‘Manila Statement’, which acknowledged the urgent need to enhance the safety of domestic ferries and urged States to review and update national regulations in relation to their passenger ferries \[ **S2c**\]. While domestic ferry operations are not required to comply with SOLAS, the IMO notes that now ‘many countries base their regulations on the IMO standards’ and the IMO has issued a set of standards comprising regulations and model national legislation applicable to non\-SOLAS ships \[ **S2c**\]. 

###  Embedding a safety culture in maritime industry 

 The adoption of the ‘design for safety’ approach and subsequent changes to the regulatory process has overcome previous resistance to safety improvements in the industry, as the regulations are no longer saturated with risk\-control. Maritime safety was once treated as a costly, damage limiting exercise, with design changes and safety regulation made in response to disasters at sea such as the sinking of the Estonia in 1994 when 852 people died. The risk\-based approach to ship design enabled regulators such as IMO to set the right level of safety, designers to plan for requisite safety margins and ship owners to manage impending risks, all parties achieving this cost\-effectively. The Director \(2001–2016\) of the Directorate for Mobility and Transport \(European Commission\) confirms that ‘ *Strathclyde have more often than not acted in a co\-ordinator role in many maritime safety initiatives*’ and this research has ‘ *defined the evolution and direction of maritime safety*’ \[ **S3**\]. Similarly, the Senior Vice President DNV GL, a Classification Society which offers knowledge\-based services to ship owners, shipyards, system suppliers and other stakeholders in the maritime industry, comments that ‘one of the key developments in these \[Strathclyde\] projects was methods, tools and data leading to estimation of the safety level of ships, a distinct revolutionary change in maritime safety … that has helped transform both the evolution of safety as well as the focus, opening the door to innovation and facilitating technological breakthroughs’ \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Supporting innovation in ship design and operation 

 All new merchant ships built worldwide must comply with SOLAS 2009 regulations and all subsequent amendments. The European Maritime Safety Agency \(EMSA\) reports that in 2018 there were 12,048 ‘new’ merchant ships in the global fleet between 0 and 4 years of age, ranging from cargo and container ships, bulk carriers, oil, chemical and gas tankers, passenger ships and fishing vessels \[ **S5**\] all designed and then constructed under SOLAS regulations. 

 Safety assessment at the design stage affects the maritime industry in many ways apart from safety of operation. It provides safety assurance for novel concepts, fostering and supporting innovative designs such as megaships and battery\-driven ships. It has facilitated the introduction and growth of innovations such as digital and autonomous ships, and enabled integration of novel concepts in ship design, such as safety centres and developments in life\-saving equipment. 

 The Head of Engineering at Meyerwerft, one of the most innovative shipyards in the world, comments that he promotes ‘the full positive impact of these advances in ship design, particularly the design for safety, among the industry’ and confirms the now industry\-wide application of Strathclyde research to assess safety at the design stage, in particular ‘advanced simulation tools addressing damage stability and risk of flooding in daily design of passenger ships’ \[ **S6**\]. 

 The new Royal Caribbean Cruise Line \(RCCL\) Icon megaships currently under construction can accommodate 10,500 people on board. They are described as the ultimate lifeboat, demonstrating through direct assessment that the ship can survive any realisable flooding accident scenario. The Executive Vice President of RCCL highlighted that the ‘new holistic approaches to safety, inspired by Strathclyde, are enabling us to raise the safety bar in all our ships with ingenious ways never thought possible before .... mega ships are a product of partnerships .. with Strathclyde as strategic partner’ \[ **S7**\]. The RCCL website notes that ‘All of our ships are designed and operated in compliance with the strict requirements of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that sets global standards for the safety and operation of cruise ships, codified in the Safety of Life at Sea \(SOLAS\) Convention. Safety\-related regulations are rigorous – and we often go above and beyond what is required; for example, carrying backup mechanical, navigational and safety provisions’ \[ **S8**\]. 

###  Reduction in loss of vessels, life and injuries at sea 

 The Allianz Review of Global Shipping \(2019\) reports annual total loss of vessels over 100GT has fallen substantially from 207 reported in 2000 to only 46 vessels in 2018 \[ **S9**\]. The review confirms that annual losses are now at their lowest level this century, and since 2009, when SOLAS regulations first came into force, shipping losses have declined by 65%. The Allianz report highlights that ‘improved ship design and technology, stepped\-up regulation and advances in risk management and safety are driving the sector’s long term loss improvement. More robust safety management systems and procedures on vessels is also a factor in preventing breakdowns, accidents and other mistakes from escalating into total losses’. \[ **S9**\] 

 Passenger safety in the European shipping sector has also improved. The European Maritime Safety Agency \(EMSA\) recorded a 57% drop in the number of fatalities between 2014 and 2019 from 114 to 49, and a 26% reduction in injuries to passengers and crew from 1239 to 917 over the same period \(data based on statistics gathered from the accident investigation bodies of the EU\) \[ **S5**\]. The Director of the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport \(European Commission\) confirms that with support from Strathclyde research the ‘development of regulations for passenger ships has helped the European Community to take a leading position in the process and .. help crystallise probabilistic regulations with emphasis on passenger ships, leading over the years to sustained improvement in maritime safety and a continuing downturn in loss of life at sea’ \[ **S3**\]. 

###  Economic benefits to global maritime and UK insurance sectors 

 The continued safe operation of commercial shipping is essential for the economic success of the global maritime sector. By 2019, the total value of the annual world shipping trade had reached more than 14 trillion US Dollars \(International Chamber of Shipping data\). The Director of Safety at DNV GL states that ‘through collaboration with Strathclyde we have developed a series of unique scientific methods and tools… to enhance our service offerings to the satisfaction of our customers, adding value to the whole maritime value chain’ \[ **S4**\]. Reductions in losses reduce claims on and economic loss to the insurance sector. This is particularly significant for the UK, which has a 35% share of global marine insurance premiums, 60% of protection and indemnity insurance and 26% of total global shipbroking. Analysis by Allianz Global of 230,000 marine insurance industry claims, with a value of almost USD10,000,000,000 \(07\-2018\), between July 2013 and July 2018 \[ **S9**\] shows that ship sinking/collision incidents are the most expensive cause of loss for insurers, accounting for 15% of the value of all claims – equivalent to more than USD1,500,000,000 \(07\-2018\) over this period. 

 Improvements in maritime safety \- stemming from regulations informed by Strathclyde\-led research and tools developed by Strathclyde to support ship design and operation practices – have resulted in fewer vessels lost and fewer fatalities, representing a significant benefit to the global economy and to the safety of passengers and crew.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This practice\-led research has used the podcast medium to enhance knowledge and change creative practice for a global audience of songwriters and music fans. This impact was achieved by encouraging some of Western popular music’s greatest songwriters, including Sir Paul McCartney and Paul Simon, to share insights into their working processes, which engaged songwriters and music fans around the world in discourses related to the art and craft of songwriting. Across 187 episodes, the podcast has amassed more than 3,000,000 downloads. It has also generated a series of offline events; notably at The Meltdown Festival \(2019\), and a radio documentary for BBC World Service \(2016\).

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) See paragraphs 

 Barber’s research engages with songwriting as a cornerstone of the business and culture of popular music. His work examines the creative process of songwriting in detail, aware that songs provide the material for commercial exploitation within the music industries, and the music that soundtracks our lives. As Barber argues in his published work, the academic understanding of the art and craft of songwriting is too often mythologised and framed in reductively romantic terms \(R03\). Barber’s work set out to explore how songwriters produce songs as well as the \(often inadequate\) ways songwriting is understood by both songwriters and audiences \(R04, R05\). 

 By demonstrating and then engaging with these gaps in collective knowledge, Dr Barber developed interventions that have resonated with audiences within and outside of the academy \(R01, R02, R06\). In particular, his work has addressed questions of how songwriters develop their creative practice, and how they build and sustain careers in the music industries. Through this work, Dr Barber has emerged as the global research leader in an entirely new field of work, recognised when he received an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) Research Network Grant \(2019\-2020\) to develop the field of Songwriting Studies \(R02\) through network events and the establishment of a dedicated journal. 

 His original research methodology focusses on the long\-form narrative possibilities afforded by the podcast medium and the new aural cultures that surround it \(R01\). Using the *Sodajerker On Songwriting* podcast as part of the songwriting duo Sodajerker, he explores in depth niche topics related to songwriting which are not enabled by music journalism or extant academic approaches focused on song form. The podcast medium also enables, as a key pathway to impact, dissemination to a global audience through a free, on\-demand, and increasingly popular entertainment format \(R01\). Dr Barber’s interviews with 181 professional songwriters \(and 6 bonus episodes\) have produced a unique body of primary research material comprising over 150 hours of audio content \(R01\). 

 Barber utilises what is one of the world’s most comprehensive archives of songwriter interviews \(R01\), to draw on the insights provided by the expertise of the world’s leading songwriters. This allows him to address gaps in existing knowledge, including: the multitude of ways in which songs are created or written \(R03\); songwriters’ relationships with other music industries stakeholders, including record labels and managers \(R05\); and how songwriters sustain careers and creativity over time \(R04\). 

 The evidence held in this archive has formed the basis for a range of articles \(R03, R04\) for prestigious peer reviewed journals, book chapters \(R05\) in key edited collections that mark out this new field, and conference papers \(R06\) that engage the wider field of popular music, media and cultural studies. This work produced critical insights that have addressed gaps in existing knowledge and helped Barber establish a new field of study, recognised for its innovation and significance by the award of an AHRC Network Grant \(R02\). The immediate scale of the Songwriting Studies Research Network is impressive, with a world\-wide membership of 303 amateur and professional songwriters, music industry stakeholders, and academics. Through the network, Barber has led research events and symposia \(R02\) and developed an Open Access publication, *The Songwriting Studies Journal,* \(R02\) to disseminate new work in the field.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Barber engages with the people and processes integral to Western popular songwriting. By contextualising and sharing his findings, his work has generated new knowledge that has changed practice for a global audience of songwriters and music fans. The beneficial outcomes of these interventions are evident for three groups in particular: 

-  Professional songwriters — including guests — have gained new perspectives on their practice. 

-  Aspiring songwriters have been provided with the tools and inspiration to enhance their techniques and to nurture their careers. 

-  Music audiences have been given access to new ways of understanding their favourite artists.

 Professional songwriters interviewed by Barber report experiencing the benefit of having the opportunity for self\-reflection provided by the podcast. Ivor Novello and Brit Award\-winning songwriter, KT Tunstall said, “ *The interview took me back to earlier parts of my career and provided a way of considering how I’d developed my approach. When listening to the podcast, I’ve learned a lot from hearing how other writers go about their work. The opportunity to put exciting new techniques into practice in my work is inspiring and encouraging*” \(S04\). In response to a survey designed to explore in detail the motivations of podcast listeners — developed in accordance with host institution research ethics guidelines — 70% of professional songwriters agreed that the podcast had significantly changed how they approached their work \(S03\). For respondents identifying as female professional songwriters, the podcast positively informed their professional development. 75% indicated that the podcast had significantly changed their approach to songwriting. As one female professional songwriter explained, “ *Listening to Sodajerker shifts me out of creative ruts and inspires me*” \(S03\). This is particularly impactful given that female songwriters and producers are often absent from discourses around songwriting, and chronically under\-represented in industry statistics. 83% of survey respondents identifying as female professional songwriters agreed that listening to the podcast had made them more aware of the business of popular music as it related to songwriting \(S03\).

 95% of listener survey respondents who identified as aspiring songwriters indicated they gained an enhanced knowledge of songwriting processes as a result of the podcast \(S03\). 92% also agreed that they better understood the business of popular music as it related to songwriting \(S03\). As the founder and CEO of Song Academy — a leading UK organisation engaging young people in songwriting — stated, “ *Sodajerker is leading the conversation on the craft of songwriting…Our international community of young songwriters find the podcasts inspirational and informative…Our students tell us they like listening because Sodajerker’s guests are afforded a chance to talk about their music in a way that doesn’t happen in other media venues. This opportunity to access in\-depth dialogue about the creative process and to use that knowledge in their own work has helped to transform how our young people approach the songwriting process*” \(S05\). Evidence of the podcast encouraging songwriters to try new techniques in the development of their own work was evident also for the 25.5% of survey respondents who identified as aspiring songwriters over the age of 50. One respondent said, “ *I appreciate the kinds of questions asked of the songwriters…the kinds of things that a songwriter would want to know*” \(S03\). This sentiment was also expressed by aspiring female songwriters responding to the survey, with 100% agreeing that *Sodajerker* had significantly improved their understanding of the songwriting process \(S03\). This was also evident amongst female attendees of the Songwriting Studies Research Network events, with a female songwriter stating the events provided a space to, “ *think about exactly what you’re doing and how you’re doing it and what your thoughts are, and that’s really important to keep moving and evolving*” \(S06\).

 The podcast intimately connects the listener to the songwriter and 97% of survey respondents identifying as non\-musical fans stated that they often recommended the podcast to friends and other music fans \(S03\). Through their engagement with the podcast, listeners describe arriving at a greater understanding of the songwriter’s creative practice, and new perspectives on their favourite artists. A respondent identifying as a 26\-30 year\-old female music fan said, “ *it's something different from the same 10 questions every artist is asked on every other podcast, interview, and media appearance. I always learn something new about the artist being interviewed and the songwriting process/industry*” \(S03\). This was echoed by one of the 226 listeners who reviewed the podcast on the Apple store: “ *you leave each podcast wanting to go back to your record collection and listen again to the songs you’ve just heard discussed*” \(S02\). The Head of BBC Radio Current Affairs, who commissioned the 2016 Sodajerker BBC World Service radio documentary, *The Secrets of Songwriting*, said, “ *What makes Sodajerker special is a\) the team’s incredible depth of research into, and understanding of, music: and b\) their single\-minded focus on how songwriters create original music*” \(S07\). In reaching a global audience of music fans, Sodajerker has been described by *The New Statesman* as “ *particularly good at developing a good rapport with their guests...interviewees refer to exactly how a song is written…It’s such an obvious\-seeming inquiry, yet it never fails to elicit a fascinating response*” \(S09\), and by music journalist and former *Esquire*, *Q* and *The Word* editor, Andrew Harrison, as, “ *The* Frost/Nixon *of tunesmithery*” \(S08\). Harrison said, “ *these masterclasses in the art of writing music are so fascinating that even the tone\-deaf and unmusical will love them. As a non\-musician myself, I can attest to the impact that these conversations have had on my understanding of the creative process*” \(S08\). The podcast has been freely available on demand to a worldwide audience since 2011, leading to 3,254,361 downloads \(S01\), 226 4/5\-star reviews from listeners in 6 countries \(S02\), and placings in the music podcast charts in 74 countries \(S01\). 

 Dr Barber’s work has — and continues to have — a beneficial impact on the understanding of songwriting for a variety of stakeholders. Following his appearance as a guest on the podcast and a subsequent live\-on\-stage interview with *Sodajerker* at the 2019 Meltdown Festival — which he curated at The Southbank Centre — Chairman of the Songwriters’ Hall of Fame, Nile Rodgers, said: “ *These are difficult times for songwriters, and to have a resource like the Sodajerker podcast, where knowledge is shared by world\-leading professionals and given freely to people around the world, is extremely valuable for the creative development of songwriters. For this reason, we cherish working with Sodajerker. Many organisations have a duty and responsibility to advocate for songwriters, but they are among the very few who actually do that*” \(S010\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Although Shakespeare is a national icon, for many people the author and his work remain inaccessible and elitist. In response to this perception of exclusivity, a team of scholars from University of Birmingham’s \(UoB\) Shakespeare Institute \(SI\) generated more inclusionary modes of engagement, connecting Shakespeare’s work with diverse communities throughout Birmingham and across the UK. Through these new modes, the team: 

1.  **Improved social inclusion** of marginalised groups and members of the public; 

1.  **Stimulated cultural creativity and changed the practice** of both amateur and professional Shakespearean performers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Shakespeare Institute \(SI\) is a world\-leading research centre committed to galvanising contemporary interpretations of Shakespeare’s legacy by exploring historic adaptations of the playwright’s work, editing his texts and partnering with organisations that teach, perform and reimagine his repertoire for new audiences. Working both individually and in collaboration, this trio of SI scholars has produced research findings that span pedagogy, philosophy and performance practice, and which can be summarised as follows: 

 Dr Rokison\-Woodall’s research expands the accessibility, understanding and performance of Shakespeare for young people \(RO6\). Analysing Shakespeare adaptations aimed at children — from *Lamb’s Tales* to Manga — Rokison\-Woodall evaluates the successes and limitations of these attempts, indicating how new versions can be used to introduce and teach Shakespeare in an authentic but engaging way to young people today. Rokison\-Woodall has further extended and focused this research through the *Signing Shakespeare* project \(2017–2020\) *,* which explores the practical approaches that enable D/deaf children to gain improved access to the world of Shakespeare \(RO4\).

Through utilising specific techniques and approaches, it is possible for adaptations to preserve Shakespeare’s verse whilst still reorienting the work in a way that is relatable and accessible to differing age groups, backgrounds and abilities. With D/deaf children specifically, they benefit in particular from rehearsal exercises that are grounded in visual stimuli, involve the use of the whole body in communication and which avoid cognitive overload. 

 Rokison\-Woodall also collaborated with Professor Dobson to produce a new series of edited Shakespeare plays aimed specifically at performers. *The Arden Performance Editions of Shakespeare* include facing\-page notes that provide not just definitions of words and key textual variants, but also information about historical performance choices, pronunciations, metrical ambiguities and glosses \(RO5\). 

1.  By re\-editing Shakespeare’s plays with active performance in mind, rather than classroom study, texts often read and taught solely as “literature” can be “retheatricalised” for the amateur and professional performance space. 

 Moving from the practical requirements of amateur performance to the history thereof, Dobson’s research traces the evolution of non\-professional Shakespeare productions over the last four centuries \(RO1\). He explores the way amateur performers from the nineteenth century onwards viewed Shakespeare as both ‘high art’ and ‘virtuous’, and flanked their performances with lectures and educational social gatherings. Shakespeare became, for them, a way of positively reforming civic life. 

1.  Amateur performance has been, and remains, central to our Shakespeare inheritance; this knowledge can be used by amateur groups today to legitimise their work within cultural discourses and environments. 

 Looking even further afield than the amateur performance space, *New Places: Shakespeare and Civic Creativity* — edited by Professor Ewan Fernie and containing chapters by both Fernie and Dobson — considers how Shakespeare has been taken out into the world beyond the theatre \(RO2\). Mixing critical reflection on the social value of Shakespeare with analysis of new creative work, it reveals the ways in which Shakespeare — both historically and now — contributes to contemporary civic life. This research also builds on Fernie’s ongoing enquiry into the historic conjunctions between Shakespeare and notions of freedom \(RO3\). Here, Fernie unpacks the interdisciplinary impetus embedded in Shakespeare’s language and legacy, which can, he argues, act as a stimulus to vital conversations in the public sphere. Amongst his subjects, he considers the influence of George Dawson in the nineteenth century, who championed the establishment of Birmingham’s Shakespeare Memorial Library, and David Garrick, whose 1769 Jubilee *Ode to Shakespeare* was an important articulation of the association between Shakespeare and freedom, shaping the ways in which we celebrate Shakespeare today \(RO3\). 

1.  Given the aesthetic and historic connections between Shakespeare and freedom, the playwright’s liberating potential can still be harnessed by civic culture and adapted to the interests of diverse audiences that exist outside of the dominant professional theatrical and academic community.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Two primary areas of impact were achieved by generating more inclusionary modes of engagement and thereby connecting Shakespeare’s work with diverse communities across Birmingham and the UK. **1\) Improved social inclusion of marginalised groups and members of the public.** 

 The initiatives below impacted on tens of thousands of individuals who would otherwise have been excluded from engaging with Shakespeare’s work. Activities include both large\- and small\-scale interventions devised in collaboration with key organisations. These led to the Royal Shakespeare Company \(RSC\) changing its approach to improving cultural access to Shakespeare, in particular through its education department which reaches over half a million students a year \(S8\). As a result, marginalised groups across the country were able to experience Shakespeare through a range of different media and forms: 

1.  **Improved access and educational provision for D/deaf students to Shakespeare.** 

 **The Royal Shakespeare Company’s \(RSC\) education department changed its approach** to include engagement with d/Deaf audiences due to Rokison\-Woodall’s innovative and timely project, *Signing Shakespeare* \(RF1; RO4\). As the RSC Deputy Artistic Director explains: ‘The work being undertaken by Abigail and the project team is **pioneering new forms of understanding** about \[…\] the role that Shakespeare’s work and BSL \[British Sign Language\] interpretation can play in developing this understanding in Deaf children’ \(S1\). As a result, the RSC is now co\-producing a whole range of Shakespeare for the D/deaf films, and — **for the first time — devising bespoke activities specifically geared towards D/deaf children** \(RF1; S1\). This work is significant as, despite there being 45,631 D/deaf children in the UK today, these children remain severely disadvantaged in the classroom, with only 41.1% of D/deaf children passing 5 GCSEs. All schoolchildren in the UK are required to study Shakespeare at Key Stage \(KS\)3 and KS4; however, many students in schools for the D/deaf are not taught Shakespeare at all as it is deemed too difficult for them. Again, as the Deputy Artistic Director suggests: ‘it was clear that many Deaf students were not accessing \[our\] plays and that there are multiple barriers to them being able to do so \[...\] The *Signing Shakespeare* project sought to address these barriers head on’ \(S1\). 

 *Signing Shakespeare* directly responded to these barriers by **increasing access to Shakespeare’s work** for this community, whilst **informing the pedagogical practices** of teachers of the D/deaf \(RF1; RO4; S2\). **Access to and understanding of Shakespeare amongst D/deaf students** **was increased** through the development and delivery of bespoke and targeted resources to aid their engagement; these included new films of popular scenes from *Macbeth* staring D/deaf actors using British Sign Language \(BSL\), Sign Supported English \(SSE\) and Visual Shakespeare \(VS\), and the creation of accompanying storyboards and downloadable props. With regard to **informing pedagogical practice**, teachers testified how, previously, they ‘would sometimes avoid teaching Shakespeare to pupils as we would feel that they didn’t have the language capacity to cope with it’ whereas now, as a result of the project, their ‘fear of teaching Deaf pupils has been lessoned \[sic\]’ and they have gone on to use these exercises with other year groups too. With regard to the **impacts on the students themselves**, teachers observed how their ‘confidence in the language greatly improved \[…\] In terms of aiding their understanding and inspiring them to act the scenes themselves, \[these resources\] are invaluable’ \(RF1; S2\). 

1.  **Improved cultural access to Shakespeare for marginalised school children and their families.** 

 Professors Fernie and Dobson **improved the cultural access of marginalised KS2 schoolchildren** from across eight primary schools \(located either in deprived inner\-city wards or rural areas with a high Traveler population\) **and their families**, via the *Ode to Shakespeare* project \(RF4; RO3\). By performing in the project, the children **increased their appreciation and knowledge of Shakespeare** and **grew in self\-confidence**. Their involvement also engendered a **change in Arts provision** in their respective primary schools \(S3\). 

 As feedback attests, taking part in the *Ode to Shakespeare* performances taught the children ‘ **to believe in myself more**’, to ‘Watch more Shakespeare plays’ to ‘Sing more\!\! And be more brave\!’ \(S3\). This significance is further attested to by one of the participating head teachers who said the project had **‘inspired’ in the pupils ‘a sense of value and worth**; a uniqueness that will never be replicated’. She also said it had ‘given our children an opportunity that otherwise they probably wouldn’t have \[…\] It has opened the door to so many opportunities’ \(S3\). The project — which was part of the celebrations to mark the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Shakespeare’s death — involved reviving Garrick’s 1769 *Ode to Shakespeare* as well as commissioning a new ode by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy; both were then performed in a series of live concerts starring the schoolchildren, all of whom had little or no previous experience of participation in the arts \(RO3; S3\). 

 In terms of impacts on the children’s families, most did not know 2016 was the anniversary of Shakespeare’s death until they were involved; for some parents, coming to watch their children perform was the **first ever classical music concert they had attended**; other parents even came despite speaking no English at all. In terms of the project’s public reach, the concerts were attended by 1,574 members of the public and broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 to 3,100 people \(S3\). Over the next six months, they attracted a further 24,172 viewers on BBC iPlayer; 79,984 via the BBC Shakespeare Lives site \(3.2 million views in total\) as well as 69,000 via Twitter. Finally, downstream impact included one participating school committing to the launch of an inaugural school\-wide Shakespeare Week; another secured funding for its vacant music teacher role, having observed the major impact of the project on their students \(S3\). 

1.  **Improved public arts access and engagement with Shakespeare across Birmingham.** 

 By **changing the Library of Birmingham’s \(LoB\) approach** to facilitating public access to its collections, Professor Fernie **increased engagement amongst the people of Birmingham** with the city’s important Shakespearean heritage and **generated new public funding for the region**. 

 In 2015, due to government cuts, LoB no longer had an in\-house curator; instead they turned to Professor Fernie to develop the *Our Shakespeare* exhibition \(April–September 2016\) given his expertise regarding the LoB’s Birmingham Shakespeare Memorial Library \(BSML\); the first, oldest and largest Shakespeare collection in any public library in the world \(RF4; RO3\). The exhibition’s reach — with over 10,000 visitors from across the city — and the audience responses revealed how, by working not with a traditional curator but with an expert on the collection’s historic context and impact, the BSML could in fact be presented in such a way as to **generate major civic engagement** \(RF4; S4\). As the LoB’s Cultural Partnership Manager states: ‘Professor Fernie’s research \[…\] ensured the *Our Shakespeare* exhibition **spoke to local audiences with particular strength and relevance**’ \(S4\). This effect on audiences is illustrated by 45% of attendees visiting LoB for the first time, with 40% of visitors claiming ‘little’ knowledge of Shakespeare before attending. Similarly, 49% of all visitors stated they would ‘do more research after visiting’, while 33% said they would now ‘attend an event about Shakespeare elsewhere.’ 58% of respondents reported the strong emotional impact of the exhibition, with the following positive markers cited as part of visitors’ experiences: inspiration \(38%\), belonging \(23%\) and empowerment \(21%\). When these terms were ranked in importance, “inspiration” came out on top, with “belonging” in second, once more attesting to the civic connection the exhibition elicited between the Birmingham public and their city \(S5\). 

 Fernie subsequently assisted LoB and Birmingham City Council with **a successful £675,000 National Lottery Heritage award** \(2019\) for ‘Everything to Everybody’; contributing to a new £1.7m three\-year public engagement initiative to revive the Birmingham Shakespeare Memorial Library. Being an Arts Council ‘Designated Collection’ of national significance, this **enables LoB to fulfil its statutory obligations** to utilise the BSML collection for the public benefit by bringing in Birmingham’s communities to explore, interrogate and improve the collection, thereby extending the BSML’s founding principle that it is actively owned by everyone \(S4\). 

 **2\) Stimulated cultural creativity and changed the practice of both amateur and professional Shakespearean performers.** 

 Professor Dobson **changed the practice** of over 3,000 amateur Shakespeare performers, **generated new productions**, **stimulated cultural engagement** and **shifted the approach and demographic** of the RSC \(RF3; RO1; S6\). These impacts came about via the *Open Stages* project, on which Dobson was Chief Advisor, which was launched in 2013 to combat the common perception that Shakespeare — and theatre in general — belongs to the elite. To date, the project has engaged close to 300 amateur theatre companies and involved over 3,000 amateur participants via workshops, networking events and mentoring schemes, 90% of whom said that *Open Stages* has **changed significantly the way they work**. Impacts include amateur actors acquiring new techniques and expertise; amateur companies which had never staged a Shakespeare play before going on to do so; and directors being inspired, as a result of the project, to devise their own series of education outreach initiatives \(S6\). 

 Dobson’s work with *Open Stages* also **changed the way the RSC connects with and encourages participation from communities across the country** \(RF3\). In 2015, the RSC adjusted its organisational aims and strategic plan to include a specific reference to its commitment to encouraging and enabling ‘the development of emerging and established theatre\-makers’ \(S6\). Then, in 2016, *Open Stages* led to a new kind of touring RSC production, which featured professional actors alongside amateur actors and local children from every city it visited. This version of *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* was produced by the RSC Deputy Artistic Director, who stated that Dobson’s ‘research into the history of amateur theatre making was influential on my choices’ \(S2\). The play involved 13 partner theatres, 14 amateur companies and 580 schoolchildren, was performed to thousands of audience members \(S8\) and was deemed ‘a play for the nation’ by the *Guardian* \(23 May 2016\); it also altered the demographic of the RSC’s audience, drawing ‘a noticeable number of new audience members who had **never before attended an RSC production**’ \(RF3; S6\). 

 Elsewhere, Professor Dobson and Dr Rokison\-Woodall **transformed the amateur and professional rehearsal** room by making Shakespeare’s work more accessible \(RF2; RO5\). Where previous Shakespeare editions were laden with academic and historic notes, the *Arden Performance Editions* include glosses, scansion notes and a diverse range of performance choices, providing the type of explanations that actors — rather than scholars — want and need \(RF2\). These editions have now been **adopted in the amateur classroom by leading drama schools** such as LAMDA and RADA; the Director of the latter states how it has ‘now become my standard go to edition for teaching and the one I recommend to students and staff’ \(S7\). He goes on to describe how the editions ‘are almost unique in my experience in understanding the kinds of notes which are useful to actors \(and which are not\)’; their accessibility also ‘makes for a **more inclusive working and learning experience** \[...\] likely to lead to a **much greater sense of “ownership” by students of all backgrounds**’ \(S7\). The editions have been adopted by a further 62 UK schools and universities, and 28 US universities, further extending their reach.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: Our research showed for the first time that vaccinating 70% of dogs can reduce both canine and human cases of rabies. We have subsequently shown that dog vaccination strategies can be scaled up effectively in different epidemiological settings, through a synergistic partnership with the charity Mission Rabies. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: Vaccination strategies informed by our research have led to regional reductions in human rabies cases in Blantyre \(Malawi\) and Goa \(India\). In Goa, human mortality from rabies fell from 17 cases in 2014 to sustained zero in 2018 and 2019, while canine rabies cases fell from 75 cases in 2014 to 8 in 2019. 

 Successful canine vaccination programmes have been rolled out in 7 low\-to\-middle income countries \(India, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Ghana and Thailand\) using a mobile health smartphone application that we designed together with Mission Rabies. By December 2020, these programmes had vaccinated a total of 1,490,000 dogs. The app is also used for routine rabies vaccination surveillance and control by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the charity Mayhew International in endemic and emergency settings. 

 Our research has set the target of 70% canine vaccination for the United Against Rabies’ “Zero by 2030” rabies\-elimination campaign \(2018\). The research is repeatedly cited by international public health guidelines such as those of World Health Organization \(WHO\) as the basis of strategies to eliminate human deaths from rabies.

##  2. Underpinning research 

####  The Challenge: Rabies kills many people at high cost in low\- and middle\-income countries 

 Rabies is a zoonotic disease that kills approximately 59,000 people each year. It has one of the highest case fatalities of any infectious disease, with patients almost always succumbing to the infection once clinical signs develop. The global cost of rabies has been estimated at USD8,600,000,000 \(GBP6,230,616,000; 02\-21\), with the loss of more than 3,700,000 disability‐adjusted life years. The majority of cases occur in low‐ and middle‐income countries in sub‐Saharan Africa and south‐east Asia, notably India. 

 We have long‐term expertise in developing strategies to reduce the incidence of rabies in both human and canine populations. Our work has addressed two fundamental questions to shape this area of public health: 

 1\) Can vaccinating dogs against rabies protect both dogs and humans? 

 2\) Can this be scaled to regional disease elimination programmes in different epidemiological settings? 

####  Mass dog vaccinations reduce human rabies incidence 

 Pioneering research conducted by Cleaveland in 2003 demonstrated that vaccinating nearly 70% of dogs in the Serengeti District of Tanzania resulted in a 97% decline in canine rabies cases after 2 vaccination campaigns. Over the same period, the incidence of dog rabies in unvaccinated control villages did not change significantly \[3.1\]. Cleaveland also showed that dogs are the main reservoir of rabies in sub\-Saharan Africa and that the rabies virus was not maintained to any significant extent in wildlife populations \[3.2\]. These studies were critically important in demonstrating that vaccinating 60\-70% of dogs was sufficient to control dog rabies and could lead to a significant reduction in demand for human post‐exposure rabies treatment. 

####  Scaling up mass dog vaccination in Malawi where paediatric rabies is high and dogs are mainly household\-owned 

 Nevertheless, it remained challenging to scale up dog vaccination programmes beyond the pilot study and to develop a flexible toolbox of approaches that could be effective in regions where dog ecology was vastly different. Collaborating closely with the charity Mission Rabies, we addressed this challenge in Malawi, where rabies is particularly problematic and is estimated to cost the country USD13,000,000  \(GBP9,416,500; 02\-21\) and cause 484 human deaths per year, mainly in children. We focussed on the Blantyre region, which reported one of the highest incidences of paediatric rabies in Africa in 2012, and demonstrated the feasibility of vaccinating more than 35,000 dogs over a short time period, in this case 20 days, achieving more than 70% vaccination coverage in dogs that were mainly household\-owned \[3.3\]. 

 We also developed a novel methodology, utilising continuous monitoring of the vaccination progress with a bespoke mHealth app, now known as the World Veterinary Services \(WVS\) app. This technology allowed us to understand why owners do not attend static point vaccination clinics, and thus provided the evidence base for the development and roll\-out of a more cost\- effective combination of fixed and roaming vaccination clinics \[3.4\]. This has resulted in further improvements in vaccination throughput, with a further 34,000 dogs vaccinated over 11 days with fewer personnel \[3.4\]. 

####  Scaling up mass dog vaccination in Goa where most dogs are unowned and free\-roaming 

 Implementing mass vaccination programmes is particularly difficult in India where more than 20,000 people die from rabies each year. The majority of dogs in India are free\-roaming, which makes it challenging to restrain them for vaccination. Together with Mission Rabies, we developed a novel vaccination strategy, targeted to these circumstances, that has allowed more than 70% of free\-roaming dogs to be vaccinated in several Indian cities with the use of the WVS app \[3.5; 3.6\]. This mHealth app facilitated the rapid collection of details of each healthcare intervention, including patient information and precise geographical location. Critically, it enabled field workers to operate in tightly defined areas to ensure unified vaccination coverage and rapid, real\-time detection of low\-coverage regions, which facilitated further rounds of vaccinations \[3.6\]. 

 Attribution and recognition: Research was initiated by Cleaveland and further developed by Mellanby, Bronsvoort and Mazeri at this unit with substantial contribution of the PhD student Gibson and charity Mission Rabies, which was established in 2013 to eliminate rabies using an evidence\-based OneHealth approach. The work was recognised in 2019 with a UoE Chancellor’s Award for Impact to Mellanby *“for the impact of his work in developing strategies for rabies elimination in dogs in the developing world and the resulting dramatic decline in human rabies deaths”*.

##  4. Details of the impact 

####  Impact on health and welfare 

 Mass dog vaccination strategies in Malawi and Goa were guided by the research data provided by our team and Mission Rabies. In the Blantyre region in Malawi, our One Health programme was rolled out in 2015 and resulted in a drop in paediatric rabies cases from an average of 4 cases per year between 2012 and 2015, to an average of 1 case per year between 2015 and 2017 \[5.1\]. 

 In Goa, the incidence of human rabies declined from 17 cases in 2014 prior to the dog vaccination campaign, to sustained zero human rabies cases for 2 years in 2018 and 2019 \[5.2a; **Figure 1**\], meeting WHO criteria of a rabies\-free declaration. During the same period, rabies cases in dogs reduced from 75 cases in 2014 to 8 cases in 2019 \[5.2c\]. The Head of the rabies epidemiology unit at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) was quoted in 2019 calling the control effort in Goa *“one of the most successful programs in lower/middle income countries that I have seen in a decade.”* \[5.3\]. The Director of the Goan Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services stated: “ *The research conducted into these* \[rabies control\] *activities reportedly through the University of Edinburgh has supported the development of effective methods of mass dog vaccination which have significantly reduced the canine rabies incidence \[…\], therefore reducing the risk of rabies to the people of Goa state.*” \[5.4\]. 

 In 2018, we played a key role in delivering workshop in Step\-wise Approach to Rabies Elimination \(SARE\) **Footnote:**

 The SARE is a multi\-stage planning, monitoring and evaluation tool that provides practical, measurable steps for rabies control programmes, and presents these steps as a logical flow of activities, from Stage 0 to Stage 5. 
in Goa, involving representatives of the Goan government, CDC and WHO. This resulted in the creation of the Goa Rabies Control Task Force to drive the development of standard operating procedures for the rabies elimination and surveillance programme. Based on evidence provided by our team and Mission Rabies \(e.g. data included in **Figure 1**\), Goa received a SARE score of 3.5 out of a possible 5 \[5.5a\]. This was considerably higher than the rest of India, which received a SARE score of 1.5 in August 2019 \[5.5b\], highlighting the dramatic progress already made in reducing rabies burden in Goa.

####  Impact on policy and guidelines 

 WHO guidelines from 2018 highlight the significance of dog vaccinations on rabies control, citing our vaccine coverage and rabies burden work, as well as our more recent applied research on vaccination strategies \(e.g. \[3.2\]; Knobel *et al* 2005 Bull WHO**Footnote:**

 doi: /S0042\-96862005000500012 
\) \[5.6a,b\]. Significantly, our findings helped set the 70% canine vaccination target for the United Against Rabies “Zero by 2030” rabies elimination campaign \[5.6b\]. In 2018, we were invited to write an expert chapter on rabies in stray dogs based on our research for the Scientific and Technical Review for the World Organisation for Animal Health, reflecting our internationally recognised expertise in rabies vaccination programmes \[5.6c\]. 

####  Impact of mHealth app on rabies surveillance and vaccination practice in 7 countries 

 Rabies surveillance and mass vaccination strategies have significantly improved through the mHealth application developed jointly by our team and Mission Rabies \[e.g. 3.5\]. 

 Mission Rabies has rolled out canine vaccination programmes in 7 low\-and\-middle income countries – India, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Ghana and Thailand – using the WVS app to systematically guide vaccination teams in near real\-time \[3.6\]. By December 2020, Mission Rabies had vaccinated 1,490,000 dogs \[5.7\]. 

 The WVS app has also been adopted by other major international organisations, including the CDC and the charity Mayhew International, for efficient mass vaccination programmes. Through CDC\-led activities, more than 200,000 dogs were vaccinated in Haiti in 2017 \[5.8a\], and Mayhew has overseen vaccination of 64,828 dogs in Kabul, Afghanistan between 2017 and 2019 \[5.8b\]. The CDC has further developed the app as an Integrated Bite Case management system that actively follows up cases and helps surveillance and implementation \[5.9\]. This has been used by the CDC to gather data for emergency outbreak responses, such as in Haiti and the Dominican Republic in January 2019. 

 This scaling up of Mission Rabies’s operational work and use of the VWS app is underpinned by our research expertise \[5.7\]. Its Director of Strategic Research stated: *“The contribution of the University of Edinburgh has been transformative in our ability as a charity to bring high quality research to the field of rabies control over the past five years. Through the analytical expertise offered by the University of Edinburgh it has been possible to analyse big data in a way that would otherwise been out of our reach. This has resulted in a far greater depth of understanding into operational effectiveness of mass dog vaccination campaigns which has enabled us to continue to develop effective solutions to rabies control at scale.”* \[5.10a\]. The Mission Rabies Chief Executive added “ *Mission Rabies could not have expanded the operational work as quickly and efficiently without the expertise provided by University of Edinburgh, which provided clarity of the interpretation of research data and invaluable input into future strategies.”* \[5.10b\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) influences much of modern life; increasingly it is addressing the more personal aspects of life—emotionality and social interaction. Emotional and empathic AI recognises, understands and recreates human emotional communication. Emotion strongly motivates human behaviour, and consequently, this new AI creates both commercial opportunities and ethical dilemmas. Over 20 years of emotion research at QUB has produced commercially viable emotion AI. Partnerships and knowledge transfer with two SMEs—Sensum and Adoreboard—developed products and patents used by and sold to the advertising sector \(Mindshare, Unilever, Havas\), sports broadcasting \(Red Bull Media House\) and the automotive sector \(Valeo, Volvo, Bentley, Honda, Ford, Jaguar\). QUB emotions research has informed and developed ethical emotion AI standards together with the professional organisations IEEE and AAAC. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Creating emotional and empathic AI that will work in real\-world environments requires the generation of training data occurring in natural, ecologically valid settings with spontaneous and commonplace expressions and social signals. Work over 20 years at QUB has challenged the prevailing accounts of emotion expression in human communication that relied on discrete and static conceptions of emotion and has instead spearheaded a dynamic, continuous and contextualised understanding of emotion. Emotion relevant facial expressions and social signals have a socio\-communicative function that depends on context and current social interactions. Intuitive human\-computer and human\-machine interfaces require emotional and empathic AI developed from natural human communication processes. These needs have created a research programme at the School of Psychology that seeks to understand human emotional communication in itself but with an added application of informing computational science and commercial partners how to take advantage of these discoveries. As part of this endeavour, it is essential to capture real interactive human behaviour; therefore, we have created many databases of emotional and social interactions. The most notable of these is the SEMAINE database **\[R1\]**, in addition to many others, notably BINED, ILHAIRE, and the Belfast Naturalistic Database. The goal is to place emotion AI on sound real\-word foundations. The SEMAINE database was part of a large, ambitious EU project \(The SEMAINE project\) that sought to create an embodied conversational agent functioning as a human\-computer interface **\[R2\].** 

 The knowledge gained in this research has led to theoretical work on human communication which presents ideas explaining the inherently social nature of human communication and how it differs from more general animal communication. **\[R3\]**. This has led to work on the importance of storytelling and how understanding emotional reactions to scenarios provides the basis of good storytelling—important for advertising and broadcasting impact, and technological innovations in understanding expressions and reactions. The storytelling work was central to the impact with Red Bull Media House informing their multimedia storytelling of Red Bull extreme sports athletes. 

 Analysis of the dynamic and continuous nature of emotion expression in communication started by using trace techniques that provide continuous reports of felt and perceived emotion **\[R4\].** People are required to observe and provide responses to changes in emotion over time rather than selecting categories for a time period—permitting a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic unfolding of a complex emotional and communicative experience. To do this well required new statistical methods to be developed for use in the psychology of emotion **\[R5\].** These non\-linear methods have also proved useful in the assessment of felt state using multiple physiological sensor signals and led to Knowledge Transfer Partnerships with commercial partners that have resulted in patent applications. 

 Through the course of three Knowledge Transfer Partnerships with the Company Sensum data collection and experimentation led to the joint production of eight publications to date. These were in the sports performance, sensor analysis, and automotive interface fields, an example publication is provided in **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Impact has been economic and societal. These include commercial partnerships with companies, an active role in the international Affective Computing community, a role in setting Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\) global standards for Empathic AI, and many points of public outreach. 

 **Economic Impact** 

 The company Adoreboard was founded in collaboration with Dr Gary McKeown in 2011 and it continues to perform strongly, having completed its ninth year of commercial operation with 20 full\-time employees in 2020. A Knowledge Transfer Partnership project with Adoreboard and Dr McKeown was completed in 2014. Dr McKeown was awarded an Enterprise Fellowship by QUB for a year to work with the company. 

 In 2015 Dr McKeown started a long\-term collaboration with Sensum \- another affective computing company \- formalised through 3 Knowledge Transfer Partnerships funded by the ESRC and Invest NI. The first two of these partnerships were given the highest rating of ""Outstanding"" by the KTP assessors, while the third is on\-going **\[C1\]**. The relationship with the School of Psychology is central to Sensum’s research strategy and features prominently on the “Learn More” section of the website **\[C2\]**. The first project implemented continuous, dynamic and multimodal data workflows and statistical processing in the company to give a competitive edge over rival companies \(Affectiva, Realeyes, Emotient\). Machine learning and time series statistical techniques drew multiple emotion relevant signals together to create emotional AI models \[R5\]. This functional AI model of emotion led to one of Sensum’s principal products, the empathic AI engine Synsis™ and internal statistical mechanisms for dynamic sensor analysis. The project took place over two years and involved collaborative projects with many multinational corporations including Unilever in 2016 **\[C3\]** and Red Bull Media House in 2016 and 2017 **\[C4\].** Red Bull Media House wanted to understand the emotions of their “hero” extreme sports athletes using Sensum’s synchronised sensor product SYNC **\[C5\],** to aid storytelling and provide data overlays of athletes’ felt emotion as a visual aid during broadcasts. Together with Red Bull, we also developed a Virtual Reality Mountain Bike Experience **\[C6\].** 

 The second KTP project created a real\-time model of emotion assessing emotional events as they unfold and incorporated acoustic information and facial expressions into the algorithms. A modular structure for rapid prototyping in different marketing contexts was also added. Real\-time assessment is required in the automotive as onboard driver monitoring systems are required for the European New Car Assessment Program \(Euro NCAP\). Projects within the KTP included developing the Ford “buzz car” that responds to the emotions of the driver **\[C7\]**, and assessing emotions at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2018, attended by 200,000 visitors **\[C8\]**. Longer\-term projects took place with Volvo, Valeo **\[C9\]**, and Bentley, using sensors to assess driver and passenger state as cars increasingly move towards autonomous driving. 

 The third, on\-going, KTP involves the creation of an empathic interface for use in vehicles—automotive empathic AI. These emotion aware vehicles monitor drivers’ states. This project featured in an episode of the Radio 4 series All in the Mind **\[C12\]**. Through these projects Dr McKeown has become an integral part of the scientific strategy of the company Sensum **\[C10\]**. 

 **Societal Impact** 

 Dr McKeown has a proactive role in the promotion of affective computing. He was elected to the executive committee of the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing and is an associate editor of the field’s flagship journal IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing. He plays an active role in the promotion of the ethical use of these technologies. Increasingly AI is a point of societal concern given the power it has to change how we live. Ethical use of AI in facial recognition technology, emotion AI and communicative understanding is currently or soon will be under the spotlight. Consequently, the industry is taking measures to create ethical global standards to ensure best practice. Sensum and Dr McKeown have taken a lead in this endeavour. The IEEE Standards Association asked Sensum to chair the IEEE P7014 Working Group to develop the P7014 global standard \(Standard for Ethical considerations in Emulated Empathy in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems **\) \[C11\]**. This group currently has regular meetings with the goal of developing these global standards. 

 **Public Outreach** 

 There is much public interest in emotion related psychology research and in emotional artificial intelligence and how the two interact. This interest has led to many radio and television appearances, written articles and interviews for newspapers. Collectively these appearances and articles have an audience reach of millions, including two appearances on BBC Radio 4 All in the Mind documentary, a separate Radio 4 documentary on Crying, and a BBC Television documentary on friendship and international radio and newspaper interviews **\[C12\].**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Pioneering research at The University of Manchester \(UoM\) has driven major advances in nuclear magnetic resonance \(NMR\) methodology, resulting in pulse sequences and analysis software that are incorporated in over 90% of modern liquid state NMR spectrometers worldwide – a USD1,000,000,000 *per annum* market. These advances have changed practice and capacity in industry, through the introduction of new products and processes. Diffusion\-ordered spectroscopy \(DOSY\) is having significant economic impact: one food industry company \(Givaudan\) reports sales growth of >GBP100,000,000 in this REF period as a direct result of a new flavour component found using DOSY. Pure shift methods are routinely used by major companies \( *e.g.* Syngenta\), and are now a standard feature on spectrometers supplied by all major manufacturers. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The rapid analysis of solutions by spectroscopic means is a very important chemical function. NMR spectroscopy has revolutionised the practice of chemistry by allowing the fast and non\-destructive identification of unknown chemical structures in solution. NMR equipment is an essential requirement for any serious chemical laboratory. NMR is unique among spectroscopic methods in its versatility and flexibility, partly as a consequence of the quantum mechanics underlying the phenomenon of magnetic resonance and partly because the instrumentation used has highly flexible computer control, allowing new techniques to be implemented simply by modifying the software. 

 Two powerful and complementary methods that have been developed at the UoM \(a\) exploit differences in diffusion rates between mixture components to distinguish their characteristic NMR spectra \(DOSY\), and \(b\) greatly enhance the resolution and chemical specificity of those spectra \(pure shift NMR\). The underpinning research has significantly advanced the knowledge and understanding of these NMR techniques and their applications in determining the compositions and chemical structures of complex samples. 

 The key to mixture analysis using NMR is to be able to distinguish between signals from different species. One distinctive characteristic of a molecule \(determined by its size\) that can be measured with NMR is its diffusion coefficient, and extending previous work by Charles Johnson, the UoM researchers developed methods to produce very high resolution DOSY spectra, separating the signals of different mixture components according to size \[1\-4\]. The power of DOSY was greatly increased by the researchers’ introduction of broadband homonuclear decoupling \(“pure shift”\) methods, which can increase spectral resolution by nearly a factor of 10 \[2, 5, 6\]. 

 UoM’s introduction of “matrix\-assisted DOSY” \[3\] extended the method to allow the analysis of mixtures in which species diffuse at the same rate, for example those of isomers, by exploiting differential strengths of interaction with a slowly\-diffusing matrix. 

 The pure shift methods \[2, 5, 6\] that were initially developed to boost the performance of DOSY have proven to be of great importance in their own right, and are now widely used across the whole field of high resolution NMR. Pure shift NMR has found application in many areas of science, including organic chemistry, natural products, pharmaceuticals, drug discovery and metabolomics. 

 The key improvements in analytical methodology that these two families of methods provide are a greatly improved ability to distinguish the signatures of individual chemical components in chemical mixtures, and a major improvement in the ability to infer structural information from those signatures. 

 UoM researchers have been actively developing DOSY methods for over 20 years, matrix\-assisted DOSY since 2009, and pure shift NMR since 2007. The impacts described here relate only to the period from 1 August 2013 onwards.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Nuclear magnetic resonance is one of the most important and powerful analytical tools used by chemists, and finds application in a wide range of other fields. It is able to determine, for example, the composition of a mixture, the structures of complex molecules, and the mobilities of these molecules in solution. However, to direct the complex and precisely\-timed sequences of radiofrequency and magnetic field pulses that are used in an NMR spectrometer to measure these different properties of substances is a science in itself. The impact described in this case relates to the development and commercial exploitation of two such families of pulse sequences developed at Manchester, known respectively as DOSY and pure shift NMR, that are able to analyse complex mixtures in a unique manner. They have proved vital to industrial research and product development and has led to a significant shift in practice and capacity in industrial research. 

##  Pathway to impact 

 The initial impetus for our developments came from an industrial collaboration with Pfizer Global Research, and led to dedicated processing software, which was initially shared widely but informally with other users. The subsequent development of DOSY software, both open source and licensed for the proprietary operating system of the major NMR manufacturer Varian \(subsequently Agilent\), gave both the opportunity to exploit the intellectual property generated, and an effective vehicle for disseminating the results to a wide range of users, including many industrial research organisations. Key contributors to this impact were the Department policy of maintaining shared high\-resolution NMR facilities, and the assistance of UMIP \(University of Manchester Intellectual Property management agent\) in negotiating the licensing of DOSY software. 

 In parallel to licensing proprietary code, the researchers made open\-source DOSY processing code available through the DOSY Toolbox \(and very recently through the General NMR Analysis Toolbox, GNAT, which has had >1,200 downloads since its release in October 2018\). UoM’s development of pure shift NMR, initially as an adjunct to DOSY but now very widely used in its own right, has been the subject of several workshops at international conferences \(EUROMAR, SMASH\); a September 2017 workshop held in Manchester attracted 66 delegates, 11 from abroad and 8 from industry. The workshop materials have been downloaded from the researchers’ website over 1,000 times. 

 In collaboration with the major NMR equipment manufacturer Bruker, the researchers integrated pure shift and DOSY experimental techniques into their commercial software, with the result that many of these experiments are now available on all Bruker spectrometers in a dedicated University of Manchester section of the Bruker user library. The researchers also assisted the other major manufacturer, JEOL, to implement our methods in their software. 

##  Reach and significance of impact 

 This work has changed the way that NMR is used in the chemical industries, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and food. It led to the discovery of a new flavour ingredient that generated sales well in excess of GBP100,000,000 in the REF period, was key to maintaining sales of a fungicide worth >GBP100,000,000, and has supported growth in a billion\-dollar scientific instrument market. 

 The principal impacts associated with DOSY and pure shift NMR in this period are: 

###  Driving growth and innovation at NMR instrument manufacturers 

 The integration of UoM’s DOSY and pure shift NMR techniques into major manufacturers Bruker and JEOL’s spectrometers has brought both companies significant benefits. Bruker and JEOL both include the techniques in their standard offerings of NMR experiments on current\-generation, high\-resolution spectrometers \[A, B\]. Bruker specifically highlight that “… *processing software for diffusion experiments is now an essential part of our Dynamics Centre software suite*”, and that “… *pure shift methods have become an indispensable part of our standard experiment library and are used routinely by our customers*” \[A\]. The improvements in analytical problem\-solving for NMR spectrometer customers achieved by DOSY and pure shift methods have also brought financial benefits to Bruker and JEOL. Bruker confirm, “ *the wide uptake of usage will definitely have contributed to our global NMR sales \(around $400 million per year\)*” \[A\], whilst JEOL say that the techniques “ *have contributed to our instrumentation global annual sales of $900M*” \[B\]. 

 Bruker and JEOL both acknowledge the significant advantages that adopting DOSY and pure shift techniques bring to their customers \[A, B\]. As Bruker note, these techniques “ *have significantly improved the ability of our end users to analyse mixture samples efficiently, and* in extremis *to solve otherwise intractable analytical problems*” \[A\]. For Bruker, DOSY NMR techniques have spurred them to further technical innovation including special probes \(DiffBB and BBO\) with 17 T m<sup>\-1</sup> gradient strength and −40 to 150 °C temperature ranges, as well as a new amplifier \(GREAT60\), all of which further enhance the usefulness of UoM’s DOSY techniques \[A\]. 

###  Changing practice in the food, pharmaceutical, and agrochemical industries 

 UoM’s DOSY and pure shift techniques are now used widely across the chemical industries. They have made significant contributions to the way many companies in the food, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries perform chemical analysis and characterisation. This change derives from the need in the chemical industries to solve analytical problems with increased speed, precision and detail. A Senior Technical Expert in Crop Protection at international agrochemicals giant Syngenta emphasises the importance of NMR to industry, saying “ *Chemical analysis is important throughout the research and development process and this importance is growing because modern environmental and safety regulations demand identification and quantification of molecules at lower and lower levels. NMR remains Syngenta’s primary method of structure elucidation*” \[C\]. Pharmaceutical company Arcinova’s Head of Drug Product and Scientific Direction confirms, “… *it is evident that molecular level characterisation of both drug substances and drug products is pivotal throughout pharmaceutical development for optimisation purposes and also for reducing the time to commercialisation*” \[D\] 

 DOSY NMR experiments are available to all researchers at Syngenta’s Jealott’s Hill International Research Centre, their largest R&D site, with >800 active researchers \[C\]. Specific impacts of DOSY and pure shift at Syngenta include: 

-  Identifying a xenobiotic metabolite in a highly impure sample, by separating metabolite resonances from contaminants; this was required to maintain multi\-million pound sales of a key fungicide product \[C\] 

-  Measuring diffusion, in multiple solvents, of a fungicide with sales >GBP100,000,000, helping to “… *optimize and reduce waste from the production process of this fungicide.*” \[C\] 

-  “*Understanding of how a crop protection product partitioned within a spray mix*”, crucial to understanding the mechanism of action of the formulation and previously impossible \[C\] 

 Both large and small pharmaceutical companies have also embraced the use of DOSY and pure shift methods. Small pharmaceutical company Arcinova, for example, has fully integrated the techniques into their work, saying “ *The techniques developed at Manchester are routinely implemented in our own Laboratories and,* *as a SME* \[Small and Medium\-sized Enterprise\] *, we have recently invested >£200,000 in upgrades to our magnetic resonance instrumentation for enabling the highest quality data generation and processing*”. \[D\] Specific impacts of DOSY and pure shift at Arcinova include: 

-  Characterising monomer, dimer and trimer impurities in a pharmaceutical product used for advanced cancer treatment, since commercialised and now used globally \[D\] 

-  Assessing physical stability of a liposomal product to determine whether it met technical requirements for use in humans; this product is now commercially available \[D\] 

 The international pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has also integrated DOSY and pure shift NMR techniques into their research, describing them as representing “… *a step function improvement in our ability to analyse our samples by NMR.*” \[E\]. The methods are widely used in the AstraZeneca analysis toolbox, and are “… *playing an important part in the development of both small and medium sized drugs \(e.g. oligonucleotides\)*” \[E\]. The benefits to AstraZeneca’s business are characterised by a Principal Scientist in Pharmaceutical Technology & Development, who says “ *…the understanding that is derived from these experiments helps expedite the drug development process, ultimately allowing us to deliver medicines to patients more effectively.*” \[E\]. 

 Mestrelab Research, who produce the NMR processing software Mnova, illustrate the breadth of uptake across the chemical industries. Mestrelab‘s software, which has 150,000 users globally, incorporates specific processing algorithms for DOSY and pure shift NMR experiments \[F\]. Mestrelab‘s Managing Director credits the UoM NMR techniques with contributing to their software’s success, saying, “ *We have no doubt that incorporating processing for pure shift and DOSY methods has contributed to establishing a market\-leading position for our Mnova software.*” \[F\] 

###  Delivering financial benefits to the chemical industries 

 Alongside the more general benefits derived from the enhanced problem\-solving that DOSY and pure shift techniques provide, companies have developed new products directly from their use. As an example, Givaudan, a major international flavours and fragrances company, used DOSY to discover a compound that only occurred in trace amounts in food extracts. This compound positively influences taste perception and is widely applicable to a range of flavour products; sales between 2014 and 2018 generated CHF120,000,000 \(approximately GBP100,000,000\) \[G\]. Givaudan emphasise the value of these NMR techniques for companies, stating “ *We are optimistic that the newly developed DOSY techniques and the newly deveped* \(sic\) *processing toolbox will also help us in finding the next “golden bullet” and can give Givaudan a clear competitive advantage*.” \[G\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Flow modelling research has created impact through improved product designs, increased product development capabilities, and better\-trained technical staff.  These enabled: \(i\) Parker Hannifin to develop filtration systems \[text removed for publication\]; \(ii\) Sandvik Coromant to develop new cutting tools with step\-change improvements in reliability and lifetimes; \(iii\) GSK to optimise the performance of manufacturing systems for semi\-solid and colloidal products; \(iv\) the NHS to benefit from: improved ambulance designs with lower fuel consumption, and modified ventilators and air\-driven Venturi valves to improve the treatment of COVID\-19 patients; and, \(v\) Asynt to bring flow chemistry to a wider group of chemists. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2009, research in the School of Mechanical Engineering \( **de Boer**, **Gilkeson,** **Kapur, Summers, Thompson, Toropov**\) has created new computer\-based flow modelling and optimisation methodologies for a range of flow systems and products in the commercial and public sectors. 

 **In Diesel Filtration Systems** 

 **Kapur** and **Thompson**’s research on gas\-liquid flow systems with droplets created an accurate flow optimisation methodology for droplet flows in the jet pumps of filtration systems used in diesel engines \[1\].  The research challenge was to develop, and validate, an accurate flow model with a computationally\-inexpensive geometry parameterisation that could predict when shock waves form in the jet pump.  **Kapur** and **Thompson** developed an accurate computer\-based flow modelling methodology whose predictions agreed well with experiment and used it to investigate how the shape and geometry of the pump affected local pressure changes and shock formation \[1\].  **Toropov**’s research on meta\-model building using the concept of the Moving Least Squares Method \(MLSM\) \[2\] was very effective in representing the results of their flow simulations in a computer\-based design optimisation tool.  This has been widely exploited within the company Parker Hannifin to bring about process and product optimisation. 

 **In Twist\-Drills** 

 During a Knowledge Transfer Partnership project \(KTP009868\), **Thompson** and **Summers** developed flow models of the coolant flow and heat transfer when coolant flows out of coolant channels, over the cutting edge, and then interacts with chips created by the twist\-drill cutting action \[3\].  The flow models correlated very well with experimental wear scar maps and the measured tool lifetimes.  Flow modelling results were encapsulated in MLSM meta\-models that enabled cutting tool geometry to be optimised accurately and efficiently for specified performance and sustainability objectives. 

 **In Pharmaceutical Manufacturing** 

 During his RAEng/GSK Chair in Pharmaceutical Engineering \(2014–2019\), **Kapur** worked with **de Boer**, developing new flow modelling methods for understanding and optimising the performance of industrial rotor\-stator mixers, mixer wear mechanisms and cleaning systems \[4\]. 

 **In the NHS** 

 <ins> **Emergency Response Vehicles</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>ERVs</ins><ins>\)</ins><ins>:**</ins> 

 During a Knowledge Transfer Secondment, **Toropov** and **Thompson** combined MLSM\-based optimisation techniques developed in \[2\] with high fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics \(CFD\) to optimise the aerodynamic design of emergency response vehicles \(ERVs\).  They worked with **de Boer** and **Gilkeson** using flow modelling and optimisation techniques \[2\], validated by wind tunnel experiments, to optimise the aerodynamic design of ERVs, leading to >12% improvements in ERV fuel economy \[5\]. 

 <ins> **COVID\-19:**</ins> 

 **Kapur** applied flow modelling and optimisation expertise initially developed in \[1\] to modify Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilators and develop an innovative air\-driven Venturi valve to improve treatments for COVID\-19 patients. 

 **In Chemical Flow Reactors** 

 **Kapur** developed flow modelling and optimisation techniques to create laboratory\-scale, chemical flow reactors \[6\], which have brought the benefits of flow chemistry to a wider group of chemists.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact of Flow Modelling of Diesel Filtration Systems on Parker Hannifin \(confirmed by Statement \[A\]\)** 

 This UoA’s flow modelling and optimisation research provided Parker Hannifin with a new product optimisation software design tool, which the company used successfully to design jet pump components of their droplet filters which were 20% more energy\-efficient.  The new Super Impactor crankcase ventilator—the engineering solution developed as a result of the Leeds modelling— reduces engine emissions in line with Euro 6 requirements, and boosts fuel efficiency. 

 The exploitation of the Leeds research by using the software design optimisation tool during the design of their Super Impactor product range has led to Parker Hannifin securing new business \[text removed for publication\].  The company is now employing \[text removed for publication\] additional people working in this product area.  By January 2020, the annual sales revenue from the Super Impactor product range had grown \[text removed for publication\], with this figure rising steadily as the company continued to win new customers. 

 **Impact of Coolant Flow Modelling on Sandvik Coromant \(confirmed by Statement \[B\]\)** 

 Coolant is used to improve drill life by transporting heat away from the cutting zone and evacuating waste material \(chips\) to prevent clogging.  The coolant flow modelling and optimisation software tools developed by **Thompson** and **Summers** during Knowledge Transfer Partnership project KTP009868 have: \(i\) enabled the company to understand how twist\-drill geometry affects overall cooling performance, reliability, and tool life; \(ii\) been instrumental in the development of the High\-Performance Multi\-Material Drills, which provide a step\-change in reliability.  Since their launch in March 2020, these have resulted in sales of \[text removed for publication\] up to September 2020.  Despite the launch being seriously affected by COVID\-19, the company estimate that their superior functionality will eventually result in annual sales of \[text removed for publication\]. 

 The project led to an important culture change in the company through the provision of new knowledge, training and software tools to over 60 Sandvik technical staff in Sheffield, Coventry, Rovereto \(Italy\), and Sandviken \(Sweden\).  The company now values flow modelling so highly that it has established a new R&D Modelling and Simulation team to provide flow modelling resources to the wider Sandvik Group and that this “ *has been justified and formed based on the flow modelling research carried out on this KTP”* \[B\]. 

 **Impact of Flow Modelling of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Systems on GSK \(confirmed by Statement \[C\]\)** 

 This UoA’s flow modelling research in pharmaceutical manufacturing has “ *enhanced significantly GSK’s scientific understanding of semi\-solid and colloidal systems*”.  It has been used by GSK to develop process understanding and to optimise the performance of the handling of white soft paraffin; rotor\-stator mixers and mixer scraper blades; and, in the cleaning of systems used in production of creams and ointments.  Furthermore, the training materials and courses that **Kapur** has delivered to over 150 GSK technical staff, in person and remotely, have led to “ *substantial improvements in the technical capabilities of GSK staff”* in process engineering and flow modelling. 

 **Impact of Flow Modelling on the NHS** 

 <ins> **NHS Ambulance Services</ins> <ins>\(confirmed by Statement \[D\]\):**</ins> 

 Our research published in \[5\] convinced the Yorkshire Ambulance Service \(YAS\) to commission new, more aerodynamically\-efficient ambulances.  Since July 2013, YAS have operated 43 of these new vehicles, which have achieved an improvement in the average fuel efficiency from 16–18 miles per gallon to 26 miles per gallon, with savings of \[text removed for publication\] in fuel costs per annum.  Our research \[5\] has been incorporated into the UK design specification for ambulance design, offering reductions in fuel consumption \[text removed for publication\], and ambulance manufacturer Cartwright has implemented the design for Yorkshire emergency response vehicles.  It was also a recommended innovation in Lord Carter’s review of Ambulance Services \(Ref. \[5\] is cited on p 52\):  [https://improvement.nhs.uk/documents/3271/Operational\_productivity\_and\_performance\_NHS\_Ambulance\_Trusts\_final.pdf](https://improvement.nhs.uk/documents/3271/Operational_productivity_and_performance_NHS_Ambulance_Trusts_final.pdf) 

 <ins> **COVID\-19 \(conf</ins><ins>irmed by Statement \[E</ins><ins>\]\):**</ins> 

 **Kapur** worked with Leeds NHS Trust to apply his flow modelling expertise to optimise design modifications to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure \(CPAP\) machines and to develop an innovative air\-driven Venturi valve to improve treatment of COVID\-19 patients.  The modified CPAP machines were used to treat >30 patients successfully in the first wave and were ready for use in the later COVID\-19 waves.  The valve places less burden on hospital infrastructure than other available designs, including efficient oxygen utilisation, and provides crucial additional treatment capacity should patient numbers outstrip existing CPAP and ventilator provision.  These approaches and equipment have been adopted by other NHS Trusts. 

 **Impact of Flow Modelling on Chemical Flow Reactors \(confirmed by Statement \[F\]\)** 

 Asynt Ltd created a commercial flow chemistry platform based on **Kapur’s** prototypes \[6\], creating \[text removed for publication\] sales between January 2019 and October 2020.  This is significant for an SME and enabled them to secure \[text removed for publication\] to bring further flow chemistry technologies to market, benefitting a wider group of chemists, and providing additional employment in the UK machining industries.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Tackling misinformation is an ongoing global challenge that is even more pressing since the Covid\-19 pandemic has resulted in a rise in health\-related misinformation. The Visual Social Media Lab \(VSLM\), directed by <ins>Vis</ins>, is at the forefront of innovation on practical interventions that address the timely challenges of visual misinformation. Innovative interdisciplinary impact activities by the VSML resulted in the ‘Questioning Images’ resource \(QI\), which underpinned election related media literacy campaigns in Canada and Colombia \(in 2019\). These activities have made a difference through reaching ca. 9,000 teachers, 1.2m pupils, in 70% of all schools in Canada and 199 schools, 76,000 pupils in Colombia by raising awareness of the dangers of visual misinformation as well as teaching tangible skills to identify such images. In the UK, the VSML’s rapid response to Covid\-19 misinformation produced a teacher’s guide and trained 80 teachers in a School Trust in Manchester, reaching 1,600 pupils. Evidence of impact was established through teacher surveys, focus groups, interviews and individual accounts. These highlighted that almost all teachers had improved their ability to identify mis\- and disinformation as well as their understanding of the danger images play in spreading it. Significant longer\-term improvement in pupils’ skills and positive changes within the school environment were reported as well, including improved critical thinking skills. Given the threat of misinformation to modern democratic processes, informing the curricula upon which public education will depend for years to come represents important impact. VSML research and impact activities have shaped national and international policy, practice, thinking and making in the UK, Canada and Finland.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research involves interdisciplinary collaborative work that brings together expertise from Media and Social Media Studies \(<ins>Vis</ins>\), Art History and Visual Culture \(<ins>Faulkner</ins>\), and Education and Global Citizenship Studies \(<ins>Pashby</ins>\). Their body of work has created a space within emerging academic research on social media for the study of social media images, a significantly overlooked aspect in the field. Work by <ins>Faulkner</ins> and the VSML developed methods for analysing images from social media, specifically in the aftermath of crises **\[1\]**. The work has also focused on specific genres of social media images and how to systematically study those internationally **\[2\]** as well as examining the wide circulation of individual high\-profile news images and provide new methods and approaches for their study, such as the image of Alan Kurdi, a three\-year\-old Syrian boy whose image\(s\) made global headlines after he drowned on 2nd September 2015 in the Mediterranean Sea along with his mother and brother **\[3\]**. The research highlights that communication on social media is overwhelmingly visual and that images therefore require standalone attention. This has continued in analysis of the online visual cultures of the Black Lives Matter movement **\[4\]**. 

 Based on this ground\-breaking research, in 2017 <ins>Vis</ins> collaborated with First Draft \(a globally leading US\-based initiative that fights mis\- and disinformation through research, training and education\) to study the role of images in spreading mis\- and disinformation as part of 2017 UK and French national elections. In October 2017, this research accessed data from two First Draft\-led election projects; *Cross\-Check* \(France\) and fact checking organisation *Full Fact* \(UK\). Both projects were engaged with identifying misleading stories in the run up to these elections. These stories then formed the basis for VSML research, which examined 95 misleading image\-led stories. This work developed a typology for visual mis\- and disinformation, identifying the types of misleading images most frequently shared and what was misleading about them. This generated potential indicators that could be used to identify problematic content. The most significant misleading type of image involved unaltered ‘true’ photographs with a false, misleading context. 

 Subsequently, a series of five VSML workshops were held across three continents, involving 40 high\-level stakeholders from journalism, which led to the development of the ‘20 Questions Framework for Interrogating the Social Media Image’ \(20Q Framework\), which was launched at MisInfoCon in London in October 2018. The development of the framework was in part based on the re\-purposing of art historical methods for analysing single works of art to the study of social media images involving misinformation. This work led to a chapter in the ground\-breaking and updated *Verification Handbook* that concentrates on the need to move beyond practises that are solely based in image verification, in order to equip journalists with the skills to deeply question the context of social media images and thus support more accurate reporting **\[5\]**. Following the launch of the 20Q Framework a further phase of research initiated the implementation of the framework in Canada and Colombia. <ins>Pash</ins><ins>b</ins><ins>y</ins>’s work on Global Citizenship Education and the development of teaching resources in Canada **\[6\]** has been crucial in further developing the 20Q Framework within an education context, enabling the development of the QI resource.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **International impact on visual media literacy** 

 Key impact of this research has been in visual media literacy, which has involved targeted impact activities in three countries: in Canada and Colombia focused on the role of visual misinformation in elections \(2019\); in the UK in relation to the Covid\-19 pandemic \(2020\). 

 **Canada** 

 Due to the growing threat to democratic processes, especially in relation to the 2019 Federal Elections, the Canadian government have prioritised funding research and interventions to tackle the impact of misinformation on democracy. Canadian NGO CIVIX \(non\-partisan, national registered charity dedicated to building the skills and habits of active and engaged democratic citizenship among young Canadians\) was awarded funding and applied it to update the flagship Student Vote \(SV\) programme. To ensure this included state of the art materials on media literacy to tackle misinformation they engaged in a global search to identify potential new resources. CEO Taylor Gunn states that the 20Q Framework was chosen because ‘we thought it was genuinely unique, no other people were talking about images like this or using these examples and we had an instinct that this framework and working with images could be incredibly attractive to teachers. And also to students, including younger grades because it is so accessible’ **\[A\]**. During 2019, the VSML worked closely with CIVIX to translate the 20Q Framework into an innovative and timely teaching resource: *Questioning Images* \(QI\). QI became part of SV for the Canadian Federal Elections \(October 2019\) and was engaged with by over 1.2m young Canadians, involving more than 9,000 schools and upwards of 25,000 teachers, covering 70% of all schools in Canada **\[A\]**. QI has also been supported by Election Canada, the independent, non\-partisan agency responsible for conducting federal elections and referendums. QI consists of two versions \(Elementary and High School\) and exists in English and French. A workshop was developed to introduce it to teachers, which was demonstrated at eight boot camps in Canada \(ca.1,500 participants\), of which three were delivered by <ins>Vis</ins>. In evaluating the 2019 SV programme, CIVIX found that 20% of teachers \(5,000\) had taught QI and used the materials, meaning that it was actively taught to as many as 240,000 pupils. For CIVIX this was the first close collaboration with academia in terms of resource\-led development and it has contributed to how the organisation thinks about evaluating programmes and interventions. CIVIX CEO Taylor Gunn confirms: ‘ultimately it was Farida’s research that made QI possible for us and it’s been a really exciting, powerful but also fun partnership. QI was consistently the biggest hook at our boot camps’ **\[A\]**. In early 2020 the VSML secured funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage’s Digital Citizen Contribution Program to further develop the partnership between the VSML and CIVIX. This research also involves The University of Alberta \(Shultz\). This grant \(CAD214,000\) has been awarded to fully assess the impact of QI during 2020\-2021. Chris Beall, Director, Strategic Policy and Research in the Broadcasting and Digital Communications Branch at Canadian Heritage has stressed that this is ‘important and timely work’ **\[B\]**. Our impact survey \(n=77\) shows that almost all teachers agreed the framework improved their ability to identify mis\- and disinformation \(96.2%\) as well as their ability to identify how images play a role in spreading mis\- and disinformation \(97.5%\). Further focus groups with teachers \(n=17\), highlighted that they had used QI repeatedly since 2019, often as the first media literacy lesson for the year; and used it across all subject areas. They had often also recommended QI to colleagues teaching other subjects, including between schools. Almost all reported increased confidence in questioning images themselves and reported a range of skills improvements in their students, including those not directly related to misinformation detection. These included being able to debate issues better and present arguments more coherently, more sustained interest in this resource than they had expected, as well as the ability and confidence to inform and challenge the opinions of others. A great example was shared by Toronto District School Board teacher Christina Ganev, who explained that her students had questioned a guest speaker from the Toronto Public Library and introduced her to QI as a more up to date and sophisticated approach to addressing misinformation: ‘That to me is really a measure of success; that they remember and that they can apply it in a different context, which is what as teachers we’re always looking for. And that's one thing that Questioning Images does very successfully. So, there's a success story that's incredible\!’ **\[C\]**. We heard many examples like this one as part of these focus groups. 

 **Colombia** 

 As part of CIVIX’s *Voto Estudiantil* \(VE\) programme for the Local Elections in Colombia in 2019, <ins>Vis</ins> joined CIVIX and partners at a teacher consultation in Bogota in May 2019, where she introduced 20Q and QI as part of a research presentation and workshop. Following this successful workshop, QI was translated as *Analicemos Las Imagenes* and included in the 2019 VE curriculum. It was distributed to teachers during five Democracy Bootcamps in Bogotá, Buenaventura, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín. In total 603 teachers worked with this curriculum and were given a printed version of the QI framework to be used with their students. The curriculum was given to 199 schools in Colombia and 220 total campuses of those schools. In total 76,245 students cast a ballot in VE 2019, which means QI potentially reached more than 76,000 students. Manuela González, part of the CIVIX team in Medellín notes how QI has contributed to an increase in critical thinking skills amongst students: ‘While we were visiting schools within the development of the *Voto Estudiantil* project, we identified that several teachers liked this activity due to it being interactive and attractive for students; some of those students started guessing the context of the images by creating stories based on the claims linked to the pictures, which were posts in social media sites. Finally, when the real context, facts and story behind the images were shown to the students, we were able to see how they had conversations where they talked about the need to think in a more critical way about the information that they receive on a daily basis through their social media, and how they could start developing skills to assess if contents are trustable or not’ **\[D\]**. 

 **United Kingdom** 

 When the Covid\-19 pandemic took hold in early 2020 and the UK entered its first lockdown, <ins>Vis</ins> reached out to Wise Owl Trust \(WOT\), a group of three primary schools \(90 teachers, 1,600 pupils\) with whom VSML had been developing a funding project for an extensive and longitudinal Visual Media Literacy intervention. These plans were put on hold when the pandemic hit, though the need for teacher resources to tackle Covid\-19 related misinformation was more urgent than ever. The VSML received a small rapid response grant from philanthropic organisation Luminate \(USD10,000\) to quickly develop a resource for WOT. As a result, a guide for primary school teachers ‘Stop. Think. Share? A Teacher’s Guide to Mis\- and Disinformation during the Covid\-19 Pandemic’ was published in May 2020 **\[E\]**. An impact survey showed that 87.5% of teachers found the guide either helpful or extremely helpful and 78.6% reported having learned something about mis\- or disinformation that they did not know before reading it. The same number of teachers also believed a resource like this would be helpful to pupils and parents and 75% stated they felt more confident in their ability to recognise mis\- and disinformation while 60.7% said they think more critically about the accuracy of what they share on social media. Finally, 93% stated they would like more resources like this and 96% were not aware of any other similar resources **\[E\]**. Confirming these findings, WOT CEO Sophie Murfin states: ‘The guide has made staff far more aware of the issues and what can be done to tackle them. This has helped to curb anxieties around the spreading of misinformation especially associated with Covid\-19 and has given them the confidence to question. The ability to pause and think about the reliability of information has had a huge effect on the school community. It has created space for open dialogue. This has in turn led to a far better culture, one of openness and transparency’ **\[F\]**. One of the year 6 teachers, Sam Shaw, also notes the impact on her pupils: ‘I have seen a real impact on the kids through teachers having picked up these skills. The kids in my class have become more critical of the things they see online, of the images on social media’ **\[G\]**. The Manchester Director of Education has gone on to share the guide with all state\-funded primary school headteachers in Greater Manchester \(137 schools\). 

 **International impact on policy and professional practice** 

 This research has impacted policy making both nationally and internationally. The research has informed the House of Lords Select Committee Inquiry on Political Polling and Digital Media in the UK, for which <ins>Vis</ins> was invited directly to twice give oral evidence \(one closed, one open session\). The evidence from the public session has been extensively used in the *Politics of Polling* report \(April 2018\). This includes highlighting in full the case of a misleading image \(from the Westminster attack in March 2017\), which forms a key example in the 20Q workshops and QI lessons. Consequently, the report confirms the need for Visual Media Literacy training: ‘Similarly Professor <ins>Vis</ins> spoke of the “enormous potential” of the “overhauling of the national curriculum so that we can teach young people, and all citizens, how to deal with information online”’ **\[H\]**. As a result of her Visual Media Literacy research <ins>Vis</ins> was invited to join the EU’s Media Literacy Expert Group \(MLEG\). For this, the European Commission brings together media literacy stakeholders to meet annually to identify, document and extend good practices in the field of media literacy, facilitate networking between different stakeholders, explore synergies between different EU policies and support programmes and media literacy initiatives. In March 2019, <ins>Vis</ins> gave the keynote at the *Truth Matters: Strategies for Combating Manipulated Realities* seminar organised by Fulbright Finland and attended by leading journalists, educators and representatives from the Finnish Prime Minister’s Office. Mirka McIntire Manager, Teacher Exchange and Education Programs at Fulbright confirmed the importance of this presentation, stating: ‘seminar participants praised your talk and I have already shared your email address with the Finnish National Agency for Education, as one of their \[Counsellors\] of Education was equally impressed by your approach as we were’ **\[I\].** In August 2019, Canadian funders and policy makers The McConnell Foundation, Luminate and the Public Policy Forum convened a group of 23 experts and stakeholders from the fields of civic digital literacy and misinformation prevention under the banner *Digital Threats to Our Democracy*. <ins>Vis</ins> attended this invitation\-only retreat as the only participant from Europe and the report produced from this convening confirms one of the key recommendations made by <ins>Vis</ins> on the need to ‘Enrich and scale existing and nascent digital media literacy education efforts. Specifically, secure the adoption of Open Educational Resources through a combination of policy, production, implementation, and assessment efforts in order to reach a goal of universal school\-age digital media literacy in ten years’ \(p.11 *Digital Threats to Democracy* report\) **\[J\]**. Work by <ins>Vis</ins>, <ins>Faulkner</ins> and <ins>Pashby</ins> has also shaped the thinking of the McConnell Foundation and other Canadian funders as well as the Canadian Government on the importance of visual misinformation **\[B\].** In November 2019 <ins>Vis</ins> was invited to present on Visual Media Literacy at an invitation\-only workshop organised by Google and Facebook \(ca. 30 participants\), *Evidence in Action: Identifying Shared Research Priorities on Visual Misinformation*, demonstrating the importance of this work to technology companies who are so centrally involved in the distribution of misinformation via their platforms. In March 2020 <ins>Vis</ins> was invited \(as the only European academic\) to join the Advisory Board of *Reset Tech*, a new initiative, bringing together experts from politics, civil society and academia, engaged in programmatic work on technology and democracy focused on shaping policy in this area. It operates internationally to ensure that the commercial interests of big tech companies are compatible with the values of robust and resilient democracies. Executive Director Ben Scott was previously a Senior Adviser to New America in Washington DC, helping design the Public Interest Technology Initiative, and led the technology policy advisory group for the 2016 Clinton US presidential campaign. Of the Visual Media Literacy work led by <ins>Vis</ins>, he stated: ‘I think your work is exceptional – at the cutting edge of the field in research on digital disinformation and informing the curricula upon which we will all depend for public education in the years to come. This issue sits at the centre of the biggest challenges we face in modern democracies’ **\[K\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Demand poses a serious challenge to UK police forces, often shown to outstrip the resources available to meet it and consequently requires forces to prioritise demand and restrict what services they provide to the public. Research conducted by Dr **Walley** at the Open University investigated the non\-urgent demand in the control room of Gloucestershire Constabulary \(GC\) by using a “failure demand’’ perspective.  Through the introduction of demand management and demand reduction techniques based on the research’s applied theory, GC was able to improve its ability to meet demand and its response times, reduce officer workload and save significant amounts of money through reduced staffing costs. The successful results achieved by GC led to further funding and engagement by other police forces and programmes, resulting in further impact to professional practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services \(HMICFRS\) independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces and fire & rescue services. Their reports have consistently pointed towards the police’s inability to meet demand over the last 10 years. The decline in police officer numbers, which have fallen by 14% since 2009, has contributed to workload pressures which mean that forces are often unable to answer and respond to many of the 93,000 emergency calls per day. This demand only represents 20% of the total public demand from calls to the police, showing the vast scale of what services police need to provide. 

 Research conducted by Dr Paul **Walley** at The Open University from 2015 – present has provided a valuable methodology and an evidence base for improved demand and capacity management.  The early work in 2015 **\[O3\]** was a scoping study which identified existing demand and capacity techniques that could be used in policing, to act as a basis of further improvement. **Walley** has since promoted improvement of public service capacity management practices through the application of ""failure demand analysis"" in both healthcare **\[O2\]** and police **\[O4\]**. The healthcare work **\[O2\]** highlighted the extent to which existing systems generated their own unnecessary demand, leading to system failure.  In policing **\[O4\] Walley** was able to demonstrate the trade\-offs between responsiveness and efficiency. 

 From January to July 2017, in the core piece of research **\[O1, O5\]**, a representative sample of historical non\-urgent incidents from Gloucestershire Constabulary \(GC\) was taken and completely reviewed by a team of police officers and staff, under instruction from **Walley**. Typically, 80 different pieces of information about each incident were extracted from records that included the audio recordings of calls coming in, with the call handler’s response.  The work undertaken to analyse demand created a number of insights into the ways in which police manage demand that had not been previously observed.  First, the work highlighted how the existing prioritisation systems employed by GC \(and still practiced by other police forces\) have a detrimental effect on response times to some relatively urgent incidents. Second, the unique analysis of demand entering the system showed how up to 38% of all demand entering the system was created by failing to deal with demand first time without error.  Thirdly, the analysis established a clear link between the impacts of the prioritisation system and the existence of unnecessary demand.  For example, 

where the prioritisation system suggests a delayed response to an incident, this increases the likelihood of someone calling back with a further incident to report. 

 The research **\[O1, O5\]** produced recommendations that GC make significant adjustments to how work was dealt with when it came in, which included the production of a new ‘Demand Management Matrix’ that radically re\-defined how demand should be prioritised and met by GC personnel, shown in the figure left.  For example, it was shown that up to 45% of all demand could be dealt with immediately, either over the phone or with some other remote form of resolution **\[O5\]**.  At the time GC were only dealing with 18% of demand in this way.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Research\-based recommendations were adopted by Gloucestershire Constabulary, resulting in changes to best practice and professional training**</ins> 

 As an immediate consequence of the research outcomes and recommendations produced by **Dr Walley**, GC adopted a new model for the dispatch and resolution of work coming into their control centre, as part of a much wider demand and capacity management improvement programme **\[C1, C2\]**. The changes included **\[C1\]**: 

1.  Channel management: improving all the ways in which demand enters the system. 

1.  Control room improvement: the control room processes were redesigned in 2018, especially to understand the demand/capacity balance at any one time. 

1.  Developing partnerships with other agencies. 

1.  Better integration of reactive policing with proactive work such as safeguarding. 

1.  Improvements to HR activities, such as CPD. 

 GC devised 6 categories of demand response based on **Walley’s** matrix: 1\) Emergency demand \(met in person\) 2\) Priority in person attendance 3\) Remote investigation 4\) Neighbourhood resolution 5\) First contact resolution 6\) Hand over demand to a more appropriate agency **\[C2**, p.15 **\]**. Additionally, as per the recommendations by **Walley**, they also ran additional training for control centre staff, a reconfiguration of back office support, and a redefining of criteria for allocating work to dispatch **\[C1\]**. These allowed GC to make radical changes to their performance. 

 The graph below shows changes in how the work is dealt with, introduced in July 2014, reducing the amount of in\-person contact by 65%. In the first full month with the new system 43% of all police response was a remote or first contact resolution, compared with 26% for the same month the year before. **\[C2**, p16 **\]**: 



 
The work conducted by **Walley** **\[O5\]** discovered that out of every 100 incidents, 160 items of work were generated, of which 60 would be unnecessary or avoidable. By shifting how demand was met, a reduction of in\-person visits by police officers to non\-urgent events led towards greater use of first contact \(remote\) resolution. This meant that advice or other support was provided by the call handler rather than the work being passed to other force employees, reducing officer workload. 

 A comparison of demand percentages a year before and a year after the changes were implemented, shown in the figure right, further demonstrates this shift in how demand was met **\[C2**, p.17 **\]**. 

 <ins> **Recommendations by The Open University led to significant</ins> <ins>improvements in performance, efficacy,</ins> <ins>reduced workload,</ins> <ins>and cost savings</ins> <ins>which have enabled GC to deal with life threatening incidents more promptly**</ins> 

 The changes, detailed above, made by GC based on recommendations from Dr **Walley** have resulted in significant improvements to performance and efficacy. Testimonial from a Superintendent at GC states that “ *We are now able to resolve about a quarter of all non\-urgent calls in one touch, without the need for a follow\-up visit of call. Our estimate is that this proportion has doubled since the change were implemented from July 2017. The proportion of calls where attendance is delayed fell from 82% to 52% over the same period. Our own internal estimate is that we were able to halve the amount of wasted repeat calls or visits as a consequence of the actions taken*” **\[C1\]**. The changes in call handling behaviour and demand resolution have led to a considerably reduced workload on front\-line officers. 

 These changes mean fewer calls are entering the control centre system. The combination of all the changes at GC has allowed the centre to improve its call response times for both urgent and non\-urgent demand. For example, the control centre was previously unable to meet the national response time target of 10 seconds to pick up a 999 call, but testimonial from GC confirms that “ *\[t\]here have also been significant improvements in responsiveness to urgent calls, where we were able to meet our target of answering within 10 seconds on a more regular basis*” **\[C1\]**. In 6 months, this average has been reduced to 9 seconds. The figure below shows the key change in 999 performance \[graph based on performance data shared by Gloucestershire Constabulary, which can be corroborated by the stakeholder providing testimonial **\[C1\]**. 



 GC is now able to identify specific incidents where this improved performance has saved lives. In one case a call was picked up within the target time, but the caller only had time to shout her name before an assailant cut the call. The force was able to identify the caller, her location and were able to prevent her from being murdered in an ""honour"" killing \(she was found tied up in the boot of the assailant's car\). 

 The impact of Dr **Walley’s** research is captured well in the testimonial provided by GC: “ **Dr** Paul **Walley’s** research has had a huge impact on efficiency and efficacy in GC. His collaboration with GC has resulted in an improved capability to understand the demand in our system and how we can make changes to eliminate unnecessary work”* **\[C1\]**. 

 <ins> **The research has enabled</ins> <ins>GC</ins> <ins>to continue and enhance</ins> <ins>the analysis of demand conducted by The Open University</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>to continue working towards best practice**</ins> 

 The method applied by Dr **Walley** to the analysis of demand was judged as highly effective within GC, resulting in ‘ *an additional legacy*’ as senior managers were motivated to replicate this analysis to develop their own internal capability to sustain the demand management practices **\[C1\]**.  One area they looked at as a consequence of this work were additional calls that enter the Force Control Room but are not recorded as incidents, which were outside the scope of the original study. It is reported that 19.5% of calls to the control room via 101 non\-emergency lines were to contact an officer or gain an update on a matter already being investigated **\[C2**, p.17 **\]**. This analysis led to a force wide initiative to ensure staff phone number were correct. The testimonial from GC emphasises this additional impact, stating that “ *\[w\]e made changes to the ways our own officers used the system, resulting in further reductions in unnecessary demand and improvements in responsiveness*” **\[C1\]**. 

 <ins> **The successful results achieved by GC led to further funding and engagement by other police forces and programmes, resulting in further impact to professional practice**</ins> 

 As a result of the dissemination of the research and the significant success of the work with GC, a project team funded by the National Police Chiefs’ Council \(NPCC\), the national coordination body for law enforcement in the UK, commissioned **Walley** to work on a large change programme hosted by South Yorkshire Police. This evaluation **\[C3\]**, which is an integral part of the programme led by NPCC, involved 15 case studies of national practice in police forces. Described as “ *one of the programme’s key outputs*”, the report was disseminated by The Open University, the NPCC and South Yorkshire police and “ *circulated to all 43 police forces and uploaded to the programme’s Knowledge Hub Page, which current has over 380 members*” **\[C4\]**.  Testimonial from South Yorkshire Police confirms that “ *the report led to recommendation for the forces, and we are confident that it will be used in a similar way for other forces across the UK*’ **\[C4\]**. Furthermore, the programme to which the report contributed “ *ultimately resulted in the team receiving further funding to continue our work to create opportunities to reduce demand for police and partners*”, signalling new and continuing impact in the future **\[C4\]**. 

 This report produced a further request from British Transport Police \(BTP\) who commissioned **Walley** to conduct review work consistent with the research done with GC. Preliminary findings were presented in October 2019 **\[O4\]**. BTP provide testimonial that this analysis provided clear guidance that fed directly into capacity planning, funding, and changes to professional practice for BTP: “ *The work supported us to refine our own capacity model, used to inform the Chief Constable’s Group about the likely capacity required to maintain service levels \[…\] Whilst* **Dr** **Walley** provided that overall expertise and guidance his work also generated assurance amongst our Chief Officer Group”* **\[C5\]**. Furthermore, the work conducted by **Walley** “ *provided us with recommendations on how \[the model\] could be improved and evolve in the future. This had a significant impact on trust in the model and its funding. The output of the model has been used in various ways since, to direct resourcing and budget*” **\[C5\]**. 

 In summary, the research conducted by Dr **Walley** into sustainable ways to manage or reduce demand have had a significant impact on the performance of one force and has contributed towards best practice and changes to demand management in other forces and groups.

 Gray’s research on religious practice in medieval Wales has directly informed the Welsh Government’s policy on tourism, which assigns an important place to faith tourism. Gray’s work has highlighted the potential of pilgrimage routes to attract visitors to Wales and to generate sustainable economic benefits in disadvantaged areas. Specifically, Gray has been the driving force behind the  [Cistercian Way](http://www.cistercianway.wales/), a long\-distance footpath linking monastic sites in Wales, inaugurated in 2016. Designed in conjunction with stakeholders such as The Ramblers, and with sponsorship from Visit Wales, the Cistercian Way dovetails with the Welsh Government’s  [Faith Tourism Action Plan](http://www.hrballiance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wales-faith-tourism.pdf) \(2013\), which was underpinned by work undertaken by Gray and John Winton, director of the  [National Churches Trust in Wales](https://www.nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us).

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case study is based upon research by Professor Maddy Gray on three interlinked themes: \(i\) medieval pilgrimage routes, \(ii\) shrines and other places of veneration, and \(iii\) the Cistercian Order. Gray’s work also addresses the place of pilgrimage and other forms of faith\-based travel in contemporary society. 

 Gray’s specific contributions include: 

1.  **The key role of the Cistercians in the development of the Welsh landscape**. Fifteen Cistercian monastic houses were established in medieval Wales, the first of them in the 1130s. They were to have profound spiritual, political, and material effects. The Cistercians enjoyed the patronage of the Welsh princes, who bestowed lands on the order and sponsored the building of churches and monasteries. The Cistercians, for their part, were strongly supportive of Welsh independence. The Order was also a force for economic change, introducing new agricultural practices and improving internal communications within Wales. These aspects of Cistercian life were explored in a special issue of *Archaeologia Cambrensis* co\-edited by Gray in \( **R1**\). 

1.  **The distinctive nature of shrines and pilgrimage in Wales, all within the context of a broader Atlantic Christianity**. Research by Gray has highlighted the contribution of ‘holy places’, such as sacred wells or the shrine of the Virgin Mary at Margam \( **R4**\), to a Welsh sense of identity, by describing the connections between relics and place in Medieval Wales \( **R5**\). 

1.  **The consumption needs of pilgrims and the development of group identities** \(expressed through specific forms of clothing or adornment\). Gray has studied the material culture of pilgrimage in medieval and early modern Wales and reflected upon how the provisioning of modern faith tourists, through locally provided catering and accommodation, could contribute to the regeneration of local economies \( **R3** and **R5**\). 

1.  **The hostility that pilgrims can sometimes generate in present\-day host communities and the potential for economic regeneration that pilgrimage can bring**. In 2009 Gray and Winton outlined the key issues, drawing on interviews with key stakeholders invested in the Penrhys shrine in the Rhondda valley, South Wales \( **R2**\). These included local government agencies, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff, Penrhys villagers, and members of the laity in the Catholic parish of Ferndale. Among the problems identified by Gray and Winton were a lack of historical awareness on the part of the host community, the lack of any mechanism for connecting visitors to the local community, the absence of any framework for religious tourism within Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, the ethical problem of generating commercial gains in ways that respects the sacred context, and the challenge of retaining those gains within the local community. Gray and Winton made specific recommendations for overcoming these difficulties. These included: clarifying the aims of any regeneration scheme; encouraging regular communication between different stakeholders; widening the circle of stakeholder groups; and fostering entrepreneurial responses to religious tourism that were sustainable.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Gray’s research has generated new ways of thinking about pilgrimage as an aspect of heritage tourism and about the value of faith\-based tourism in economic and social regeneration. This is a matter of growing moment. As the secretary\-general of the UN World Tourism Organisation acknowledged in 2015, 'religious tourism can be one of the most effective tools to foster inclusive and sustainable development' \[ [International Conference on Religious Tourism: Fostering sustainable socio\-economic development for host communities](https://webunwto.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/imported_images/42772/final_sg_religious_tourism_bethlehem_15.pdf) **, p. 6**\]. Gray has fostered such development within a Welsh context. Her work has led to faith tourism being ‘recognised as an integral component of the visitor experience in Wales, adding significant value to the destination offer, contributing to the well\-being of the visitor and host community, and enhancing local, regional and national ""Sense of Place""' \( [Faith Tourism Action Plan](http://www.hrballiance.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wales-faith-tourism.pdf), p. 2\). 

 The impact of Gray’s research has been manifested in various ways: 

1.  **Informing the Welsh Government’s 2013 Faith Tourism Action Plan**. With funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales’ Strategic Impact Programme in 2009, Gray was able to work with John Winton of the National Churches Trust in Wales, the charity dedicated to ‘supporting places of worship of historic, architectural and community value’. Together, they explored policy options for faith tourism in Wales *.* As John Winton recalls, their work led the Welsh Government, at the prompting of Visit Wales, to commission an action plan. The plan was drafted ‘very much in consultation with Maddy Gray and informed by her research’ \( **S1**\). Winton continues: ‘The Action Plan was completed in 2013 and was widely welcomed. The then Minister for Business, Enterprise, Technology & Science in the Welsh Government, Edwina Hart, was particularly enthusiastic.’ As a result, faith tourism is now an integral part of tourism promotion by Visit Wales, with a dedicated  [Faith Tourism website](https://www.visitwales.com/inspire-me/holidays/faith-tourism) hosted by Visit Wales. 

1.  **The establishment of the Cistercian Way** \(CW\), a round\-Wales route linking Cistercian abbeys and other heritage sites. Following the special edition of *Archaeologia Cambrensis* in 2005 \( **R1**\), there was revived interest in a walk originally plotted by Gray in 1998. Further Strategic Impact Programme funding awarded to Gray and Winton in 2014 facilitated liaison with local communities along the projected route and consultation with Welsh political figures, notably Peter Black, the then Liberal Democrat spokesperson for heritage, and Edwina Hart AM during her 2011\-2016 tenure of the Business, Enterprise, Technology & Science portfolio in the Welsh Government. After briefings by Gray to Welsh Assembly Members and ministers, the CW was awarded start\-up funding via Visit Wales, which enabled web design, mapping and waymarking. Initially, south\-east Wales sections of the CW were prioritised as a flag\-ship project for the 2015 Valleys Festival of Walking. The CW was launched at the 2016 National Eisteddfod – a major cultural event in Wales, which attracted  [140,297](https://eisteddfod.wales/visitor-figures-2016) visitors in 2016. The CW has subsequently become a well\-known walking route, embraced by  [The Ramblers](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/) \(123,000 UK members\) and the  [Long\-Distance Walkers Association](https://ldwa.org.uk/) \(8,800 members\), and featuring on walking tourism websites such as [ ](http://www.golakes.co.uk/) [www.open\-walks.co.uk](http://www.open-walks.co.uk/), where a dedicated Cistercian Way page has received 2,674 visits \(as of 13 January 2021\). The CW has also been adopted by recreational businesses such as  [*Journeying*](https://www.journeying.co.uk/), which provides mindful walking tours across the UK. The net effect has been considerable. When asked about the measurable effects of Cistercian heritage tourism in the National Assembly in January 2017, the Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport replied that Cistercian sites managed by the government agency Cadw had seen ‘a considerable increase in visitor numbers’ \( **S2**\). He continued: ‘And, in terms of the associated spend, we’ve again seen an increase. We’ve seen, for example, with Cadw properties at Tintern and Valle Crucis and Strata Florida, between them, they’ve attracted more than 84,000 visitors.’ 

1.  **Gray’s appointment to Church in Wales diocesan steering groups on pilgrimage** **for the dioceses of Llandaff and Monmouth**. Gray was invited to join the steering committee for the Llandaff Diocesan Year of Pilgrimage 2020 following a clergy training day which she delivered in preparation for a Pilgrimage Summer School in Santiago de Compostela \( **S3**\). Bishop June Osborne believes Gray’s introduction to pilgrimage ‘contributed significantly to the success of the summer school’ \( **S4**\). 

1.  **Consultative roles for Gray with several regional projects**, including the  [St Thomas Way](https://thomasway.ac.uk/), a pilgrimage route between Swansea and Hereford, revived with AHRC funding in 2017 \( **S5**\), and the  [North Wales Pilgrim’s Way](https://pilgrims-way-north-wales.org/index.html). Gray has also been involved in several more local initiatives. To take one example, Gray’s research on pilgrimage to the Holy Rood of Llangynwyd led to the development of the Laleston Stones Trail, a route laid out by the Laleston Community Council following the medieval pilgrimage route known as the Ffordd y Gyfraith. In another example, Gray has been regularly consulted by the  [Penrhys Pilgrimage Working Group](http://www.penrhyspilgrimageway.wales/), whose members have developed and waymarked a section of Cistercian pilgrimage trail from Llandaff to Penrhys. This links directly to the research carried out by Gray and Winton \( **R3**\) which considered the impact of the Marian shrine at Penrhys on the local community. These local routes have contributed to the health and well\-being of local communities during the Covid\-19 crisis. Lady Helen Lloyd\-Jones, convenor of the Penrhys Pilgrimage Working Group, has witnessed ‘a tremendous number of walkers used \[the route\] for exercise during Lockdown’ and ‘This is bringing economic value to the community’ \( **S6**\). 

1.  **The formation of the Faith Tourism Forum for Wales**, an initiative spearheaded by Gray and Christopher Catling, secretary to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. Catling explains: ‘For some time, I have been encouraging Visit Wales to build on their Faith Tourism Action Plan… Having come across Maddy’s research on the Cistercians and pilgrimage, as well as the Cistercian Way and other heritage projects that Maddy had some involvement in \(for instance, St Thomas’ Way\), I approached Maddy to ask for her help in organising a Spiritual Tourism symposium’ \( **S7**\). Key constituencies committed to the initiative. The 120 delegates to the over\-subscribed launch, scheduled for April 2020, would have included members of the Welsh Assembly, representatives of local authorities and public bodies \(Natural Resources Wales, Cadw, and Visit Wales\), and delegates from walking groups and faith communities. The launch fell victim to the Covid\-19 crisis. Nevertheless, the delegates are connected digitally via a blog \( [faithtourismwales.wordpress.com](https://faithtourismwales.wordpress.com/blog-2/)\) and the scheme will be revived when public health allows.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis, responsible for 250,000 annual childhood deaths in Africa prior to introduction of rotavirus vaccine. A UoL\-led clinical trial of rotavirus vaccine in Malawi informed a WHO recommendation in 2009 that children in low income, high mortality countries should receive rotavirus vaccine. Subsequent introduction of a childhood vaccination program in Malawi was used as an exemplar to demonstrate impact, safety and cost\-effective health protection. By reducing hospital diarrhoea admissions and diarrhoea deaths by a third, it is estimated that the vaccine program in Malawi has averted 1,505 deaths since 2013. Our demonstration of programmatic impact has informed international policy with rotavirus vaccination programs now introduced in 38 African countries, preventing an estimated 169,400 deaths over the same period.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

###  Background 

 The University of Liverpool \(UoL\) has led studies of rotavirus diarrhoea in Malawi since 1997, designed to facilitate and accelerate the introduction of rotavirus vaccines into childhood Expanded Programme on Immunisation \(EPI\) programmes in Malawi and other low\-income African countries. Rotavirus vaccines developed by GSK \(RV1\) and Merck \(RV5\) were known to work well in high income countries, but their ability to protect children in the world’s poorest countries was unknown. Live, orally administered vaccines against other enteric diseases \(e.g. cholera, typhoid\) performed less well in the poorest settings, for reasons that are unclear. 

 After describing a high burden of rotavirus disease among children under two years of age in Malawi, Professor Cunliffe subsequently led a pivotal, Phase III clinical trial of the RV1 rotavirus vaccine in Malawi. This first trial of a modern rotavirus vaccine in Africa showed that severe rotavirus diarrhoea episodes were reduced by half<sup>3.5</sup> leading to a WHO recommendation in 2009 that all the world's children should receive rotavirus vaccine, with a particularly strong recommendation for those countries with a high burden of diarrhoea deaths. 

###  Demonstration of vaccine impact, effectiveness and safety 

 The RV1 vaccine was added into Malawi's infant immunisation schedule in October 2012. This enabled UoL \(in partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health\) to undertake detailed, prospectively conducted studies to demonstrate the impact, safety and cost\-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination across the country. 

 Case control studies in 2012 \- 2014 demonstrated that national vaccination was more than 60% effective in preventing severe rotavirus diarrhoea episodes among infants in urban Malawi, with population incidence of rotavirus hospitalisations reduced by over 40%<sup>3.4</sup>. A large, prospectively conducted cohort study of 48,672 live births, then demonstrated that rotavirus vaccination reduced infant diarrhoea deaths by a third in rural Malawi, the first evidence from a low\-income country that rotavirus vaccination saves lives<sup>3.1</sup>. The UoL also demonstrated that rotavirus vaccination provides cost\-effective health protection in Malawi<sup>3.3</sup>. 

 Through its work in Malawi, UoL contributed to a multi\-country African study led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA which demonstrated that rotavirus vaccination did not result in the development of intussusception \(blockage of the small bowel\) in African infants; this is an important finding given the association of this rare side effect with rotavirus vaccination in more developed settings, and is perhaps related to earlier age of vaccination and reduced vaccine “take” in this setting <sup>3.2</sup>. 

 Together, these findings supported the argument for widespread adoption of rotavirus vaccination in other low\-income, high\-burden settings which has been promoted via annual workshops with the Malawi Ministry of Health and WHO EPI representatives, as well as via the RotaCouncil and through media coverage. Professor Cunliffe led several Cochrane reviews demonstrating the safety and efficacy of rotavirus vaccines, in order to inform their continued use and inform WHO policy<sup>3.6</sup>.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

##  Part I: Context and impact of rotavirus vaccination in Malawi 

 Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe paediatric gastroenteritis with the largest number of rotavirus deaths occurring in sub\-Saharan Africa, estimated at 121,000 deaths in 2013<sup>5.1</sup>. A WHO recommendation informed by UoL research led to support from Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, for countries in Africa to introduce rotavirus vaccine into their immunisation programmes. 

 Rotavirus vaccination was introduced into Malawi’s EPI schedule in 2012 resulting in immunization coverage of 81% among one\-year\-olds by 2013, increasing to 90% subsequently<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup>. Vaccine rollout was informed by UoL’s research findings and UoL representation on the Malawi National Immunization Technical Advisory Group \(NITAG\), which advises Malawi’s Ministry of Health on all matters relating to vaccination in the country. Since August 2013, the program in Malawi \(Under 5 population of 2,600,000\) is estimated to have averted 359,100 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis, 27,300 inpatient admissions, 1,505 deaths, and 47,600 disability\-adjusted\-life\-years \(DALYs\) \[derived pro\-rata from estimates for the 20 year period following introduction<sup>3</sup><sup>.3</sup>\]. Over 20 years, the societal cost per DALY averted was estimated to be USD10 \(05\-2016\), and the cost per rotavirus case averted was USD1 \(05\-2016\)<sup>3</sup><sup>.3</sup>. This economic evaluation of a typical African national immunisation program has encouraged vaccine introduction across additional African countries and helped to sustain commitments to enable continued vaccination.<sup>5.</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup> <sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup> <sup>5.</sup><sup>4</sup> 

##  Part II: Impact across Africa 

 National rotavirus vaccination programs have been introduced in 38 of the 54 African countries,<sup>5.</sup><sup>5</sup> preventing an estimated 24,200 deaths among children younger than 5 years in sub\-Saharan Africa in 2016 alone<sup>5.</sup><sup>3</sup>. Based on immunisation coverage between 2013 and 2020<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup>, the 2016 data allow estimation of the impact of these programs; since August 2013, 169,400 lives were saved across Africa, and approximately 40,400,000 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis, 3,070,000 inpatient admissions and 5,360,000 DALYs were averted<sup>5.</sup><sup>3</sup>. National data also report substantial reductions in hospitalisations due to diarrhoea following introduction of vaccine programs; for example, within two years of vaccine introduction, Zambia experienced 51% and 31% reductions in rotavirus hospitalizations for infants and over one\-year olds, respectively<sup>5.</sup><sup>4</sup>. In Botswana, there were 43% and 48% reductions in gastroenteritis\-related hospitalizations and deaths in infants during the rotavirus season, respectively<sup>5.</sup><sup>4</sup>. Likewise, Togo saw impressive results in the first rotavirus season post\-introduction: 43% reduction in rotavirus hospitalizations for infants<sup>5.</sup><sup>4</sup>. As these countries graduate from Gavi support they will need to self\-finance continued vaccine use, highlighting the importance of demonstrating programmatic impact. 

 **Part III: Informing ongoing policy and adoption of vaccination programs** 

 The public health impact of rotavirus vaccination has been felt in Malawi and across Sub\-Saharan Africa. This has been communicated by UoL through annual workshops held with the Ministry of Health in Malawi between 2010 and 2016. UoL disseminated research findings to the general public in Malawi across a wide range of media outlets including newspaper reports, national radio \(Malawi Broadcasting Corporation Radio 2, Times Radio\) and television \(Malawi Broadcasting Corporation TV and Mibawa TV\), with live phone\-in programmes to inform the public on the benefits of using rotavirus vaccines<sup>5.</sup><sup>7</sup>. The success in Malawi has been highlighted by international press<sup>5.</sup><sup>8</sup> including The Guardian 

 \(print readership: 867,000; circulation: 152,714\) running the headline ‘ “Tipping point” hope as vaccine slashes infant deaths in Malawi’ in response to the 2018 Lancet Global Health paper<sup>3.1</sup>. UoL’s ground\-breaking rotavirus research programme was highlighted by Universities UK<sup>5.9</sup>. 

 Dissemination of findings relating to impact, safety, and cost\-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination from Malawi as a representative low\-income African country has informed vaccine introduction more widely. Thus, UoL organized the 11th African Rotavirus Scientific Symposium in 2017, advocating vaccine use across the continent, which attracted over 300 delegates including Ministry of Health representatives of 40 African countries<sup>5.</sup><sup>5</sup>. Three African countries that were represented at this meeting subsequently introduced rotavirus vaccine. The findings from Malawi have been promoted by the RotaCouncil, an International Rotavirus Advocacy Group of Experts of which Professor Nigel Cunliffe is a member<sup>5.</sup><sup>6</sup>. Since 2015, most African countries that have introduced rotavirus vaccine have observed an increase in vaccine coverage, with average uptake increasing from 77% to 84% by 2018<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup>. In addition, the evidence of vaccine impact from Malawi is being used in negotiations for introduction in new countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which introduced rotavirus vaccine into their immunisation program in October 2019<sup>5.6</sup>. 

 A Cochrane review led by Professor Cunliffe further validated the efficacy of rotavirus vaccination with no increased adverse risk, supporting the WHO recommended vaccination schedule in Africa<sup>3.</sup><sup>6</sup>. A recent unpublished update \(requested by WHO\) of rotavirus vaccine effectiveness and safety, and containing expert input from Professor Cunliffe and Dr Hungerford, is being used as evidence in a pending reinforced WHO rotavirus vaccine recommendation \(expected in 2020 but delayed by COVID\-19\). 

##  Part IV: Conclusion 

 A range of independent sources have validated the UoL findings, demonstrating consistently reduced hospitalisations since the introduction of rotavirus vaccination programs, resulting in a reduction of 169,400 deaths across Africa during the between 2013 and 2020<sup>5.</sup><sup>3</sup>. These benefits are expected to be sustained through continued vaccine use.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study describes how interdisciplinary research into sustainable design and a related body of experimental practice\-based research has positively contributed to environmental and social sustainability initiatives in rural Northumberland. The co\-production of a series of award\-winning design\-build artefacts has enhanced public understanding and education through the provision of new facilities, learning resources, community involvement and participatory research and engagement activities. The research process and the constructed artefacts have informed new approaches and practices in public, private and third sector organisations and they have positively contributed to the local economy by developing and widening access to new public infrastructures and improved visitor facilities that have also enhanced the experience and conservation of Northumberland’s unique landscapes and ecologies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact is underpinned by influential cross\-disciplinary research developed by Farmer and Guy dating back to 2000 that contributed a unique socio\-technical perspective to the understanding of sustainable architecture. Their 2001 paper published in a special edition of the JAE guest edited by Kenneth Frampton won the prestigious American Collegiate Schools of Architecture \(ACSA\) annual research award in that year. The research introduced a social constructivist perspective on the development of sustainable architecture and highlighted the contested nature of ecological design and the related implications for architectural practice, research and education \( **PUB 1**\). Subsequent case studies of completed green buildings helped to reveal the social processes underpinning the development of sustainable architecture and the relationships between diverse technical design strategies and their local deployment and use. This work highlighted the importance of contextual understandings of environmental and technical innovation \( **PUB 2, PUB 3**\). Related research into the ethics of sustainable design has explored how the philosophy of pragmatism provides a useful analytical and moral framework that connects the environmental ethics of sustainability to the design, construction, and subsequent use of buildings. This pluralist understanding of environmental design acknowledged the primacy of practice, situational diversity and the co\-evolution of environmental values within particular contexts \( **PUB 4**\). The research suggested that sustainable design be understood as a transformative socio\-technical practice where new design and environmental knowledge emerges from reflective design activity located in particular contexts when designers, constructors and communities confront environmental problems, learn about their \(and others’\) values, beliefs and practices to progressively enhance the ecology of built environments. 

 Written publications have provided the foundation for the development of an experimental design research approach that explores the synergies between research, pedagogy and practice and which position the researcher as simultaneously educator, design practitioner, and self\-builder. Farmer has been involved in the construction of several award\-winning full\-scale research\-led prototype buildings exploring ultra\-low energy and zero carbon design, community\-based design, responsible specification, ultra\-local materials and technical innovation with limited resources. These practical design\-build experiments have provided wider opportunities for critical reflection on the processes and products of sustainable design as well as exploring how future professionals can be educated with the knowledge, attitudes and values that will promote sustainability in their own future practices \( **PUB 5, PUB 6**\). Testing Ground is an extension of these earlier design\-build experiments and was established by Farmer in 2013. The programme utilises the methods of constructive design research and deploys design and construction action as particular a mode of place\-based inquiry in which the making of artefacts codifies a situated understanding of existing contexts whilst also providing a way of investigating alternative environmental futures. It is exploring expanded methods for co\-producing environmental knowledge and is grounded in the understanding that sustainable design should actively seek out the proximate knowledge of varied local actors who have the latent abilities to imagine and re\-imagine how technologies, buildings and spaces can operate sustainably within a specific context \(selection of images of Testing Ground projects below\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Northumberland is England’s most sparsely populated county and is home to some of its remotest communities. The area has witnessed dramatic environmental changes, from sheep farming to large\-scale commercial forestry, the construction of the Kielder reservoir, the establishment of the Northumberland National Park and more recently the founding of the Northumberland Dark Sky Park in 2014, Europe’s largest area of protected Gold Tier night sky. The area is characterised by dramatic landscapes, natural beauty, rare ecologies and a high quality of life but it also faces substantial socio\-economic challenges and has been slow to recover from the economic downturn. 

 The Kielder Water and Forest Park Trust defines its role as promoting sustainable economic growth, employment creation and supporting tourism in the Kielder Valley which plays a major role in the local economy \( **IMP3**\). As part of its overall strategy the Trust recognises the strategic value of cultural activity and it established an ‘Art and Architecture’ programme almost 25 years ago. However, from 2009 onwards opportunities to secure capital funding for arts\-based regeneration projects were substantially reduced due to the financial crisis and changing funding policies nationally and regionally \( **IMP1, IMP2**\). It is against this background that *Testing Ground* was established in 2013 as a collaborative research partnership and educational programme \( **IMP1, IMP2**\) and as an innovative way of providing support to organisations and communities whilst simultaneously experimenting with sustainable design principles and practices and delivering interesting and engaging built work within a rural context. 

 **Activities leading to Impact** 

 Since 2013 Testing Ground has developed a unique, ambitious and sustained programme of constructive design research that has creatively supported and influenced a range of stakeholders through innovative methods and practices. Seven permanent artefacts have been constructed in different locations spread across the Kielder Water and Forest park and the Northumberland National Park. Six of the projects are fully accessible to members of the public, and the seventh is located on the Calvert Trust site and provides enhanced infrastructure for the Trust’s guests. The outcomes of the research have been to develop a creative practice that co\-produces interesting and engaging artefacts situated within rural contexts that contribute to an understanding and celebration of local places, for residents and visitors alike. The approach empowers and supports local people to act positively on their environment, with limited resources and in sensitive environmental and ecological contexts. 

 In summary, the impact associated with these creative research practices has been to: 

-  Co\-produce new public infrastructures and facilities in rural contexts that would otherwise not have been possible \( **IMP1, IMP4**\) 

-  Instigate a change of practice within organisations allowing them to widen their reach and community engagement activities \( **IMP1, IMP2, IMP3, IMP4**\) 

-  Enable, develop and extend cultural and eco\-tourism initiatives and activities that play a major role in the local economy \( **IMP3, IMP4**\) 

-  Provide practical support to rural communities and assisting third sector groups to take advantage of design and practical expertise, secure additional funding and develop new activities and income streams \( **IMP5, IMP8, IMP9**\) 

-  Generate new understandings and participatory approaches that seek to address sustainability and biodiversity within local communities and organisations’ \( **IMP3, IMP2**\) 

-  Develop an educational dimension to the work of rural organisations which in turn has created enhanced opportunities for young people and supported the education of future design professionals \( **IMP1, IMP2, IMP10**\). 

 **Impacts from processes and practices** 

 Testing Ground \(TG\) has influenced and supported new approaches and working methods in various rural organisations from across the public, private and third sectors. It’s focus on environmentally responsible design and specification allied to participatory and co\-production techniques has influenced the Kielder Water and Forest Park Trust to change their existing processes for curation and for commissioning artists and architects and has contributed to a substantial broadening of their existing community engagement activities \( **IMP1, IMP2**\). TG has supported the Trust in building closer relationships with the various communities within Kielder and this has “transformed the way in which the Trust is perceived within communities” \( **IMP1**\). The work of TG has also enabled the Trust to engage with wider audiences and to geographically expand its activities beyond Kielder and to spread their influence by supporting wider communities in the National Park and wider Northumberland \( **IMP1**\). 

 Northumbrian Water have highlighted the contribution that TG has made in helping them to establish new partnerships, in supporting their social purpose activities as well as enhancing the way in which the company engages with wider communities \( **IMP3**\). According to their CEO, the company uses the TG programme as an exemplary precedent of partnership working to: “ *show how you can get something really, really good at the end of it, that adds value… either from a tourism point of view, or potentially an employment point of view, or the sustainability of the communities, all of which this programme does. So, you can wax lyrical about this amazing experience that this particular installation had and how it worked and how the community bonded with it.”* \( **IMP3**\). 

 Forestry England have described the TG programme as providing “long lasting legacy” and as being “exemplary” in the way that it is “connecting different fields and themes” and demonstrating an attitude to sustainability and the “purposeful use of timber.” They describe how the projects have stimulated creative thinking in Forestry England and have suggested that it is helping to them to promote their work nationally. TG projects have featured prominently on the national website and in publicity materials and social media campaigns and as a result the work is beginning to feature in timber journals and the trade press. They suggest that TG is; *“seen as some of the best practice in Great Britain, because its…out working with the community, its doing the design, working with the environment, understanding what environmental issues there are out there, how they can work in harsh weather conditions, how can they take on board the community aspirations, but with the constraints of the land manager, and the sustainable use of timber.”* \( **IMP4**\). 

 The UK Woodland Assurance Standard \(UKWAS\) who are an independent certification standard for verifying sustainable woodland management in the UK have suggested to Forestry England that TG “is one of the best things they’ve seen, probably internationally, but certainly in Great Britain.” \( **IMP4**\). 

 The Calvert Trust have suggested that the co\-production processes developed by TG have been transformative in the way in which they think about their own buildings and the development of their estate. It has also helped them to think differently about the wider processes and practices involved in designing for disability \( **IMP6**\). TG has also provided practical support to rural communities and third sector groups and has made positive impacts by providing revenue generating opportunities as well as supporting bids to secure further funding \( **IMP5**\). Local residents have pointed to the positive contribution TG has made to community cohesion and sense of community and how it has inspired the development of a whole range of new community activities \( **IMP8, IMP9**\). 

 **Impacts from co\-production and the artefacts** 

 The new facilities developed through TG are supporting tourism initiatives that play a major role in the local economy. The programme is making a positive impact on tourism by enhancing the reputation of Kielder as a visitor destination \( **IMP4**\). According to the CEO of Northumbria Water, it has enhanced the visitor offer and in particular it has helped to develop new tourism around cultural activities and in particular helped to develop public “knowledge and understanding of architecture” \( **IMP3**\). TG has also helped to generate new visitor activities including curated tours of projects, design workshops and architectural events. In doing so TG is generating more activity, footfall and presence and as a result is contributing to the economic sustainability of the region \( **IMP3**\). 

 Similarly, the Northumberland Wildlife Trust \(NWT\) testify to the transformative impacts that Testing Ground has generated at the Bakethin Conservation Area, Kielder by making ecological education, wildlife watching or wildlife experiences more accessible at Kielder \( **IMP7**\). The new nature\-watching infrastructure developed by TG has helped the Trust to engage with new users and made a difference in how visitors perceive and use the site \( **IMP7**\). This has increased the appeal to visitors and widened the demographic of those visitors, also resulting in an increase in visitor numbers and in particular a greater number of families using the site and facilities. The work at Bakethin is now informing the future development of facilities and has contributed to new thinking and approaches within Wildlife Trusts, supporting a shift in ethos away from nature reserves for experts and enthusiasts towards wider public engagement \( **IMP7**\). 

 Finally, the unique design\-build pedagogical approach developed through Testing Ground which develops collaborative and situational learning – often in challenging or ecologically sensitive contexts has had a transformative impact on the sixty or so architecture students who have been directly involved in the programme to date. A key aim of the programme has been to develop reflective practitioners and future professionals furnished with the knowledge, attitudes and values that will promote sustainable, socially responsible and context\-sensitive work in their own future practices. The Royal Institute of British Architects recognised TG by highly commending the Rochester Roundhouse in the 2017 MacEwen Award for high quality design as well as “teaching how to be socially responsible architects and contractors” as well as its “teaching and learning programme to produce architecture graduates with experience working on live, budget\-conscious projects from beginning to end.” They described the graduates of the programme as “future architectural giants.” \( **IMP10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Given the challenges associated with increasing antibiotic resistance, optimal use of antibiotics for children is important for global antimicrobial stewardship. Oral penicillins contribute 5 of the 8 million prescriptions for oral antibiotics given to children in England each year. King’s research \(2011\-2020\) showed that age\-band dosing guidelines had remained unchanged since 1963 and that there was a wide variation in prescribing practice, with the majority of children receiving sub\-optimal doses. Following our recommendation that the UK dosing schedule be revised, new national prescribing guidelines were developed and introduced in 2014 by the UK Joint Formulary Committee \(comprising the British Medical Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Department of Health\). This new dosing regime has dramatically changed prescribing practice, with 94% of children in the UK now receiving the correct dose \(equivalent to over 4.7 million prescriptions per year\). As of 2019, the new guidelines influenced by King’s have also been adopted internationally as the primary dosing schedule in Brunei, Malta, Republic of Ireland, Seychelles and Sri Lanka; and have been incorporated alongside local prescribing guidelines in 40 countries, comprising of 28 Commonwealth countries and 12 G20 nations, including Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and China. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Oral penicillins are the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children worldwide.** They contribute to 5 of the 8 million prescriptions for oral antibiotics given to children in England each year. In the UK, most paediatric antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary healthcare, and an infection for which a penicillin is prescribed \(typically an inner ear infection, symptoms of sore throat or cough\) is the most common reason a child visits a General Practitioner \(GP\). 

 **Improving antibiotic stewardship requires accurate prescribing.** In recent years, antibiotic prescribing practices have come under scrutiny because of increased antimicrobial resistance \(AMR\) as a result of inappropriate prescribing. Promoting appropriate antibiotic prescribing is therefore an essential strategy to combat antibiotic resistance. In order to eliminate bacteria causing an infection, the antibiotic concentration in a patient’s blood must be maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration \(MIC\) for the bacteria. Penicillins work in a ‘time\-dependent’ mechanism in order to kill bacteria: the longer the time  the blood antibiotic concentration is above the MIC, the greater the killing effect of the antibiotic. In the event of antibiotic underdosing, the blood antibiotic concentration does not surpass the MIC or only attains the MIC for a short period of time. Therefore, the antibiotic activity is reduced. This leaves the bacteria exposed to non\-lethal antibiotic doses, fuelling antibiotic resistance by allowing bacteria to mutate and evolve rather than being killed. There have also been extensive efforts to ration physicians’ antibiotic prescribing practices in primary care to reduce the prevalence of inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for both children and adults. 

 **The UK guidelines on prescribing antibiotics for children were not fit for purpose.** The British National Formulary \(BNF\) and BNF for Children \(BNFc\) are the gold standard publications in the UK to provide prescribers, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals with evidence\-based, up\-to\-date information about the selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. The BNF/BNFc are so highly regarded that they are also used as reference formularies by national healthcare providers throughout the world. Nevertheless, before 2014, the BNF/BNFc recommended dosing of oral penicillins in children were complex and potentially confusing, using age\-bands, weight\-bands or weight\-based calculations. Importantly, given that the weights of children do not change in a linear fashion with age, the UK’s age\-banding system was also more likely to result in suboptimal dosing. This situation was further complicated because the few original pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies underlying the guidelines predated the more recent rising trend of obesity in children. 

 **King’s researchers identified inaccuracies in the evidence base for current prescribing guidelines.** We undertook an extensive search of the literature and historical formularies \(lists of approved medicines, their chemical formulae and associated clinical data\) dating back to the 1930s. Using the Freedom of Information Acts both in the UK and USA to request and search clinical trial data held in the UK by The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\), and in the USA by the Food & Drug Administration \(FDA\), we uncovered the evidence\-based origins of the age band regime **\(1\)**. Specifically, our research uncovered that the current UK dosing schedule was based upon a relatively arbitrary principle of \(i\) halving adult oral penicillin doses for older children; and \(ii\) halving again for younger children and infants. We showed that this principle had remained unchallenged in the literature and hence, dosing was unchanged in clinical practice since its introduction into the UK prescribing guidance in 1963 **\(1\)**. Astonishingly, we subsequently demonstrated that this age band dosing principle was based solely on a 1955 publication, drawing on the clinical observations of a single UK GP which, in effect, meant the guidelines had no evidence base at all **\(2\)**. This opened the question as to whether children today are receiving a clinically effective dose. A 10 year old child weighing 30 kg and receiving 250 mg three times a day will, under this schedule, receive 25 mg/kg/day – a very low dose, compared to the Summary of Product Characteristics \(SPC; the description of a medicinal product’s properties and the conditions attached to its use, explaining how to prescribe\) recommendation for Amoxil Paediatric Suspension for all indications in children weighing <40 kg, of 40\-90 mg/kg/day. 

 **Comparing prescribing practice and accuracy of antibiotic exposure with age\-weight data for children prescribed amoxicillin.**  In collaboration with researchers at UCL, Imperial, Basel and Hong Kong University, King’s used data from the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children \(ARPEC\) survey of antimicrobial prescribing on the age and body weights of children in hospital, to compare the three main dose selection methods used globally: US/EU exact weight based dosing; UK age banded dosing; and WHO weight banded dosing **\(3\)**. We calculated the accuracy of amoxicillin exposure \(the most common penicillin\) and found that because of the rising prevalence of childhood obesity, age\-band\-based prescribing \(such as the UK’s system\) could lead to sub\-therapeutic dosing **\(3\)**. This is because fat tissue can affect the distribution, metabolism and clearance of antibiotics differently in obese compared to lean children. Body size affects liver and kidney function, with antibiotics being removed faster from the blood of obese children than lean children. 

 **King’s demonstrated the discrepancy in antibiotic prescribing due to weight variation and strongly advocated new guidance was urgently required.** To find out the extent to which childhood weights might influence the starting dose of oral penicillins, in 2014 we undertook a review of data collected by GP practices from across the UK. By comparing actual dosing in prescriptions issued by GPs with the 2011–12 BNFc age\-band dosing recommendations, we made some worrying findings: First, that there was a wide variation in the dosing of penicillins for children in UK primary care, and second, that 55% of children receiving oral penicillin in the UK in 2014 were underdosed **\(2, 4\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Changing the UK’s national prescribing guidelines.** Following the King’s led review of UK paediatric antibiotic dosing guidelines, in relation to the weights of children today **\(1\-4\)**, our research was part of the evidence used by the Joint Formulary Committee to support changes to the UK prescribing guidelines in 2014 **\[A\]**. The Joint Formulary Committee is comprised of representatives from the British Medical Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Department of Health, and is the group responsible for making decisions on behalf of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) about national prescribing guidelines, which are followed by all health professionals in the NHS. 

 As a result of the Joint Formulary Committee recommendations, the UK’s prescribing guidelines were updated and adopted by the BNF/BNFc in 2014 **\[B\]**. These changes introduced into the BNF/BNFc by the Joint Formulary Committee meant that most children prescribed amoxicillin would now receive the SPC recommended dose of at least 45mg/kg/day for children weighing <40 kg, which for ease of use would be expressed in age bands. For example, a 10\-year\-old child weighing 30 kg and receiving the revised dose of 500 mg three times a day will now receive 50 mg/kg/day compared to the previous old dose of 25 mg/kg/day. 

 **New prescribing guidelines have been adopted by NHS Primary Care across the UK.** These new prescribing doses have been introduced into the computer prescription software used by over 9,000 GP surgeries across the UK. This is significant because it ensures that the new dosing is widely adopted: the software generates prescriptions with specific dosing levels, thus making it highly likely that GPs will adhere to the new, correct dosing level **\[C, D\]**. 

 **The resulting changes in prescribing practice ensure most children now receive the correct dose of antibiotics in the UK.** Having demonstrated that, before 2014, 55% of children receiving oral penicillin were underdosed **\(3\)**, King’s led a cross\-sectional survey of oral penicillin dosing across the UK following the introduction of new guidelines in 2014: After the guidance changed in 2014, the number of children estimated as being underdosed dropped to 5.8% **\[E\]**. In other words, \~94% of children in the UK now receive an optimal dose of penicillin appropriate for their age and weight **\[E\]**. 

 **The UK’s new prescribing guidelines have also been integrated into prescribing guidelines internationally.** In 2019 we undertook a review of prescribing guidelines globally by auditing individual prescribing formularies of pharmaceutical societies and government health departments in different countries, and by contacting \(clinically\) practicing academics in schools of pharmacy. Our review showed that **\[F\]**: 

 \(i\) **the new 2014 guidelines have been adopted in their entirety by Brunei, Malta, Republic of Ireland, Seychelles and Sri Lanka.** This represents a combined population of approximately 6,000,000 children under the age of 14. 

 \(ii\) and have been **incorporated alongside existing prescribing guidelines in 28 Commonwealth countries and 12 G20 countries**, including China, which alone has a childhood population of 255,000,000 under the age of 14. 

 The countries that use the new prescribing guidelines recommended by the UK Joint Formulary Committee are shown in the map below **\[F\]**. We estimate that globally, around 500,000 GPs and other healthcare providers \(e.g. nurses, pharmacists, dentists\) across these countries have access to these guidelines through print and digital versions of the BNF/BNFc. 



 **The significance of this work has been recognised by an RCGP research impact award.** In 2014, the King’s study uncovering the historical evidence base for dosing guidelines and discrepancies in UK prescribing practices **\(1, 4\)** was awarded the Research of the Year Award in ‘Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproductive Health’ by the Royal College of General Practitioners, in recognition of the impact of the research **\[G\]**. Moreover, endorsement for the impact of this research by the NHS, learned societies, the global medical and scientific community, and World press and TV has been persistent and consistent since 2011 **\[H\] \[I\]**. 

 **Careful antibiotic stewardship is now considered critical in the fight against AMR.** A growing awareness of the urgency for action to tackle AMR has put the problem high on the global political agenda, and the need to address prescribing practice has been widely recognised. The UK Special Envoy on Antimicrobial Resistance, Professor Dame Sally Davies, former Chief Medical Officer for England explains: *“*As Chief Medical Officer, I advised the UK government on the development and delivery of the 5\-year National Action Plan \(2019 to 2024\) and 20\-year vision for AMR. The Action Plan specifically highlights the necessity for sound antibiotic stewardship through prescribing. *”* 

 Importantly, specific action on prescribing in children is needed: *“*While hard to measure specific, direct impacts on the larger problem of AMR from any individual study, we now have compelling evidence that reducing inappropriate prescribing will make an important contribution. Across the world, infectious diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in children under the age of five years; this is exacerbated by drug\-resistant infections. AMR disproportionately impacts low\- and middle\-income countries, and children. Both of these demographics suffer a delay in access to the treatments they need, which puts the Sustainable Development Goals at risk – especially that of ensuring healthy lives for all at all ages. Addressing prescribing in children is therefore a vital step – both for improving an individual patient’s prospects, and for preserving treatments for future patients who need it. *”* 

 *“*In my role as a representative to the United Nations’ Global Leaders Group on AMR, I am most keen to find and support work that is scalable and that can be tailored to communities and countries across the world. Professor Long’s work has now been adopted by 40 countries from across both the Global South and the Global North. Raising awareness is one thing – but changing behaviour and practice, as Professor Long’s research has done, paves the way for better patient outcomes across the world. *”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 From 2004 to 2017, University of Kent researchers developed novel federated identity management \(FIM\) and privilege access management \(PAM\) technologies, which have been integrated in OpenStack since November 2013. OpenStack is a community cloud project involving 135\+ international leading vendors, including Lenovo, Oracle, RedHat, IBM, Rackspace, and Cisco. FIM allows OpenStack users to use their existing usernames and passwords, instead of having to create a new pair whenever they want to access a new cloud service. Introducing FIM has been recognised by OpenStack for accelerating and shaping the project’s federated identity system’s performance and by OpenStack users for advancing their organisational security and efficiency whilst also saving significant costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Background** 

 Since **2004**, Professor Chadwick and his team in the School of Computing at Kent have undertaken extensive research in the field of Information Systems security. The work began with the development of PERMIS – a suite of open\-source privilege and access management \(PAM\) software that provides novel authorisation technologies to developers’ software systems. This was the subject of an impact case study in REF2014. Since **2009**, the research has progressed into the novel application area of federated identity management \(FIM\). 

 The underlying problem addressed by the research was the hundreds of usernames and passwords that users are forced to remember, which leads to significant vulnerabilities. FIM greatly reduces this number by allowing a single identity provider \(using one username/password\) to log a user into dozens of federated systems. The FIM research has been of practical benefit to OpenStack – the most popular open source cloud software in the world that has a membership of 135\+ international organisations, including global vendors such as Lenovo, Oracle, RedHat, IBM, Rackspace, Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu and Huawei. Prior to November 2013, OpenStack only supported traditional access control methods by individually allocating new usernames and passwords to users – a process that reduced security, impeded business proficiency, and wasted time for both users and service providers. The work on FIM changed that by allowing users to authenticate to an OpenStack cloud using their existing credentials through an external Identity Provider, rather than creating another username and password pair for a particular OpenStack cloud. 

 **The research** 

 Chadwick’s reputation and expertise in the field of system security led to him being invited to present the concept of FIM at FOSAD **2008**. The International School on Foundations of Security Analysis and Design \(FOSAD\) is one of the foremost events for disseminating knowledge in the area of computer systems and networks security. In **2009**, the presentation evolved into a seminal and highly\-cited paper that provides an introduction to digital identity, identity management, and FIM, and the key issues faced, as well as ideas on how to address them **\[R1\]**. 

 In **2011**, following the work on PERMIS **\[G1\]** and the FOSAD talk, Chadwick responded to an ESPRC call for cloud computing with an argument for the integration of FIM. The resulting funded project **\[G4\]** led to the publication of an introductory paper **\[R2\]**, which describes a policy\-based authorisation infrastructure that can be used by cloud providers to ensure that the usersʼ privacy policies are stuck to their data. This was followed by a paper demonstrating the feasibility of a policy\-based authorisation infrastructure in cloud infrastructure **\[R3\]**, and a final results paper that describes open source software to support a trust, privacy and security infrastructure for the cloud **\[R4\]**. 

 This research initiated Chadwick’s collaboration with OpenStack. He presented the approach at several OpenStack meetings between **2011** and **2013**. Since there were many different FIM protocols in use and still in development, one of the key challenges was how to support *interoperability*. The concept, *protocol independent FIM*, was adopted by the OpenStack developers and now all OpenStack releases support FIM with several protocols supported as standard. 

 Furthermore, new FIM protocols can easily be added, as and when they are developed. The incorporation of FIM into OpenStack was demonstrated in **2014** in **\[R5\]**, which presents a detailed federated identity protocol sequence. The paper also describes the implementation of the protocol independent system components, along with the incorporation of two different FIM protocols, namely SAML and Keystone. The FIM protocols were further validated through GÉANT's CLASSe project \( **2013\-2015**\) **\[G6\]**, which showed how cloud services such as OpenStack can be smoothly integrated in a federation built with an AAA \(Authentication, Authorisation, and Accounting\) infrastructure, by using Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web \(ABFAB\) technologies **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Advancing OpenStack’s commercial innovativeness and efficiency** 

 Chadwick was invited to the OpenStack summits in the USA in 2012 and 2013 to discuss the Kent research on FIM, educating and informing OpenStack stakeholders on its processes through the discussion of key blueprints **\[a\]**. As a result, in **November 2013** Chadwick’s novel FIM design was implemented in the ‘H’ phase of OpenStack, adding federated access to Keystone \(OpenStack’s identity manager\) **\[a\]\[b\]**. The Kent FIM protocol was the first \(and remains the only\) system to have introduced federated identity to OpenStack, and since its implementation in **November 2013** Chadwick has continued to support OpenStack and its developers and users via his advisory role in the Keystone working group \( **2011\-2017**\). 

 In response to Chadwick’s continued contribution and support of the Kent FIM, OpenStack’s Keystone Project Lead, Steve Martinelli, stated: ‘David \[Chadwick\] and his team\[‘s …\] expertise and guidance in the area of Federated Identity has been priceless. I can confidently say that their collaboration and background on the subject has helped accelerate and shape Keystone's support of Federated identity \[…\] David's opinion is sought out when discussing Keystone issues on OpenStack's mailing list, where his deep understanding of security, and identity management is made evident. The same can be said about David's involvement at OpenStack summits \(our bi\-annual design conferences\), where he is involved in the architectural design of new Keystone features’ **\[c\]**. 

 Jisc – a company supporting institutions of higher education and research in the UK – also benefits, as stated by Stefan Paetow, Jisc’s Research Liaison Coordinator: ‘University of Kent readied the Openstack software stack for use with federated identity technologies, including Moonshot, by piloting Openstack with the pre\-Assent Moonshot pilot infrastructure and the UK Access Management Federation, submitting fixes to Openstack and Jisc where required, and driving the web\-based use case for Moonshot forward’ **\[d\]**. 

 **Improving OpenStack developer proficiency** 

 Many developers are interacting with OpenStack in order to use its interface. Of these developers, Chadwick has advised and educated many as a result of his consultancy via the OpenStack summits and working group mailing list. His Kent team has also generated many new lines of code or patches, for instance, to enhance the usability and proficiency of the software. A senior manager at RackSpace identified that between **2011** and **2014**: ‘University of Kent has contributed 1400 lines of code, 102 reviews, 71 patches, 14 blueprints \[and…\] have been approachable subject matter experts, whose knowledge was widely adopted by the Keystone community’ **\[e\]**. Similarly, an engineer from RedHat in **2017** stated that: ‘Professor Chadwick was essential in enabling the project to properly implement Identity Federation, a set of features without which OpenStack would be unusable by a great many organizations \[…\]. As a software engineer at Red Hat, I have seen a direct correlation between the success of our implementation and the work that Professor Chadwick and his team contributed to the project’ **\[f\]**. 

 **Enhancing OpenStack users’ security and cost\-effectiveness while reducing administrative burden** 

 Users save time and effort while increasing security, because with FIM, users do not have to create and remember a large number of different passwords. Having to create and memorise numerous passwords leads users to choose weak and easily crackable passwords. With FIM, they need to create and maintain only one strong password. 

 Over 135 international organisations are currently utilising OpenStack, and running their jobs and applications off it. We carried out a survey of OpenStack users to assess the impact of having FIM integrated into Open Stack **\[g\]**. Sixty per cent of the respondents \(n=14\) stated that adopting FIM makes the system more \(or much more\) secure. A Cloud Manager from a national computer network for universities and research noted: ‘\[we\] don’t have to manage safety of credentials, since we store none. We are not subject to brute\-force, since services are accessed via identity tokens only’ **\[g\]**. The Head of Identity Management of the same institution noted further: ‘No passwords inserted in web forms, no passwords kept in the keystone, no recovery/force\-passwords\-on\-the\-phone, etc.’ **\[g\]**. 

 Traceability is important as part of implementing security, and this is facilitated by FIM. A System Administrator at a small company highlights the benefit of FIM: ‘We will get to know who accesses what and when’, while a researcher pointed out: ‘R&S and Sirtfi \[Security Incident Response Trust Framework for Federated Identity\] helps. Also using the institutional accounts helps with traceability’ **\[g\]**. Similarly, an organisation’s security relies on a proper audit of their users. For example, it is imperative to revoke access from former employees who had left the organisation. Evidently, the advantage of FIM is clear, as further established by one Network Engineer: ‘We can audit access controls from a central system and we can easily require MFA \(Multi Factor Authentication\) for user logins’ **\[g\]**. This is echoed by an Administrator/Architect from an American telecommunications company dealing with several thousand users: ‘Old account remove quicker’; this echoes the view of a Technical Architect at another organisation, who states: ‘revocation is central. Centralized group management assignment are key as well’ **\[g\]**. 

 In addition, FIM offers a potential for saving time and money. The time\-saving benefit of having FIM is highlighted by a Cloud Manager from a European institution: ‘Registration time is just few clicks wrt \[with respect to\] alternative procedure for identity verification’ **\[g\]**. An Administrator at a large American telecommunications company elaborated further: ‘Multiple Operation people were spending >30% of their time just managing accounts before we implemented hooking into corporate Active Directory System’ \[g\]. Meanwhile, a Cloud Architect at a UK Government agency believed that FIM reduces operational costs, affording a saving of ‘0.5 of a person to maintain the identity proxy’ **\[g\]**. Similarly, a System Administrator at a small company noted a saving of ‘roughly $5000’, while the Head of Identity Management at a European institution reported a saving of ‘0.2 FTE’ **\[g\]**. 

 Administrative burden can also be reduced by using FIM, with 47% \(n=11\) of the respondents suggesting that there is less or much less administrative burden in running their system. A Senior Software Engineer at a public open cloud exchange project commented: ‘A unified authentication management has allowed us to let users use the same accounts for OpenStack and OpenShift, which we are operating. So we and users don't have to deal with multiple accounts or systems of access management \[…\] Also we can offload verifying a user to the identity providers they are coming from’ **\[g\]**. A Technical Specialist at a European organisation pointed out: ‘when a user leaves the home organisation, and his account is deactivated, this user cannot log in anymore in the open stack environment. Effectively, his permissions are revoked while openstack maintainers don't know \(and now don't care\) that he is gone’ **\[g\]**. A Cloud Platform Architect at a multinational telecommunications company summarised the impact in reference to his 3,600 users: ‘No more account management, users shall do it for us’ **\[g\]**. 

 Based on his FIM research and as a result of the growing recognition of his expertise in this field, Chadwick was an invited expert to the nascent W3C Verifiable Credentials working group in **2017**. His contribution led to his co\-authorship of the Recommendation and its associated Implementation Guidelines **\[h\]** and Data Model **\[i\]**. In **2019**, the University created a spin\-out company, Verifiable Credentials Ltd, to capitalise on the implemented Proof of Concept.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The International Criminal Court \(ICC\) is the only permanent international criminal tribunal to date. It has jurisdiction over the most serious international crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. Akande’s research on the various ramifications of state consent within the ICC’s legal framework has brought significant change to the Court’s judicial and prosecutorial activities and decisions regarding 1\) the immunity of senior state officials; 2\) bringing into force the crime of aggression and 3\) the classification of armed conflict and the scope of war crimes. It has also directly shaped the work of ICC prosecutors and judges, courts in ICC party states, and a major international NGO \(International Committee of the Red Cross\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Akande’s research has sought to explain the basis on which the International Criminal Court exercises its jurisdiction and the legal limits to the exercise of such jurisdiction over the nationals of states that are not party to the Court’s Statute. Akande’s body of research at the University of Oxford has looked at how the principle of state consent informs several contentious aspects of the ICC Statute. 

 **Immunities of state officials:** Akande’s work has focussed on the longstanding tension between securing accountability for international crimes and the immunities accorded to senior state officials which safeguard the independent exercise of state functions. He argued that the key to reconciling those two fundamental interests lies in the principle of state consent. In a series of articles **\[R1, R2\]**, Akande asserted that while personal immunities conferred upon heads of state, heads of government and ministers of foreign affairs applies under customary international law even in respect of the most serious international crimes, those immunities could be lifted by the United Nations \(UN\) Security Council explicitly or by necessary implication when referring a ‘situation’ to the ICC for prosecution. Since virtually all states in the world have consented to the exercise by the Security Council of the power to create international criminal tribunals, and, significantly, to displace immunities, the ICC Statute’s provisions on the non\-applicability of immunities would apply, even to States that were not party to the Statute, on the basis of the state’s consent to the UN Charter. This interpretation, disseminated in a 2009 article **\[R1\]**, became commonly known as the ‘Akande approach’ or the ‘Security Council route’ to immunities and was adopted in a series of ICC decisions relating to the prosecution of the Sudanese President. 

 **Crime of aggression:** After the drafting of amendments to the ICC Statute concerning the crime of aggression, controversy remained as to who could be subject to prosecution for this crime. In a seminal working paper **\[R3\]** and a subsequent journal article co\-authored with Professor Antonios Tzanakopoulos \(Faculty of Law, University of Oxford\) **\[R4\],** Akande argued that, even when activated, the crime could *not* be applied to acts committed on the territory of or by nationals of non\-ratifying states parties, to the extent that these had *not* consented to the amendments. Nevertheless, a referral of the situation to the Court by the UN Security Council would supply the necessary consensual basis to prosecute crimes of aggression committed by nationals of non\-ratifying states. 

 **War crimes and the classification of armed conflict:** Under the law of armed conflict, conflicts may either be international or non\-international and this determines which body of law applies to that conflict, including which war crimes are applicable in that conflict. In **R5**, Akande argued that central to classifying armed conflicts marked by foreign military intervention is the consent of the state on whose territory the hostilities occur. He concluded that if the territorial state does *not* consent to the foreign intervention, the conflict must be classified as international because there is an attack *against* the territorial state.

###  Reinforced the validity of ICC judgments relating to non\-immunity of Omar al\-Bashir 

 Akande’s approach to the interpretation of the ICC Statute’s provisions on immunities of state officials **\[R1, R2\]** has provided a key supporting rationale for the ICC decision that Sudan’s \(now\-former\) President, Omar al\-Bashir was not entitled to immunity from arrest and prosecution. Al\-Bashir is accused of committing genocide and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region, predominantly against three ethnic groups: Fur \(approximately 894,000 people in Sudan\), Masalit \(approximately 440,000 people\) and Zaghawa \(approximately 2,370,000 people\): the initial arrest warrant for al\-Bashir was issued by the ICC in 2009, whilst he was still a sitting head of state. Sudan is not a state party to the ICC Statute so the legality and validity of his arrest was under significant scrutiny, and in some cases, disagreement from both party and non\-party states. In April 2014, the ICC’s Pre\-Trial Chamber held, along the same lines as the arguments expounded in **R1**, that by referring the situation of Darfur \(Sudan\) to the ICC, the UN Security Council had necessarily applied the ICC Statute to Sudan **\[C1\],** meaning the Statute would operate to remove any immunities for al\-Bashir. The foundational role of Akande’s work on this issue was accepted by the Supreme Court of South Africa in a case following an official visit to South Africa by al\-Bashir in June 2015. Finding that this visit was unlawful, the Court cited **R1** when ordering the executive authorities of that country to cooperate with the ICC in arresting Bashir. The court’s decision in March 2016 **\[C2\]** stated: ‘ *The Government* \[of SA\] *called these principles* \[of state immunity\] *in aid in support of its position that President Al Bashir was immune from arrest and surrender in terms of the Implementation Act. It cited the authoritative statements by the International Court of Justice \(ICJ\)… the ICJ said \(para 58\) that it had examined State practice, including national legislation and decisions of higher national courts, but was unable to deduce that there existed under customary international law any exception to this rule where the individual concerned was suspected of having committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. This appears to be accepted by leading commentators such as Professor Akande* \[with footnote to **R1**\]’. 

 This legal reasoning was further elaborated by the ICC Pre\-Trial Chamber in July 2017, when it held that, by reason of the application of the ICC Statute to Sudan and the displacement of Bashir’s immunities, South Africa was also in breach of its obligation to arrest him during an official visit in June 2015 **\[C3\]**. Akande’s work was not cited in the decisions but the ICC’s reasoning mirrored the substance of Akande’s argument in **R1** which was publicly noted by two commentators from the blog of the European Journal of International Law i.e. “ *The South Africa decision* \[by the ICC\] *is more sophisticated than the DRC decision by taking up the suggestion of Dapo Akande to treat Sudan like a state party*”. **\[C4a–c\]**. ICC Pre\-Trial Chamber II made yet another finding of non\-cooperation in 2017 against ICC party state Jordan **\[C5\]** using the same approach proposed in **\[R1\]** and also citing the South African decision throughout as precedent. Following Jordan’s appeal of that decision, several ICC hearings in The Hague, and heated academic debate, the ICC Appeals Chamber upheld the finding of Jordan’s non\-compliance. In doing so, it explicitly acknowledged Akande’s research using his approach as one of the key grounds of its Appeal Judgment: with a footnote citing **R1** as the basis, it found: ‘ *Jordan could not rely on article 98\(1*\) \[referring to national prerogatives\] *as a basis to not cooperate with the Court*’ **\[C6\]**. Akande’s work **\[R1, R2\]** was also heavily cited in the Prosecutor’s response to Jordan’s appeal **\[C7\]**, with 29 references throughout, and the majority reflecting the court’s agreement with Akande’s argument that the application of the ICC Statute was legally valid: ‘ *As Dapo Akande points out, since “\[t\]he Court does not apply national law,”* this qualification *“would be redundant unless it was directed at authorities who would otherwise be bound by national law—national authorities*’. On 11 February 2020, Sudan's ruling military council agreed to hand over the ousted al\-Bashir to the ICC in  [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague) to face charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur. Al\-Bashir will in due course be forced to account for his actions – a historic moment in securing justice for the people of Sudan. 

###  Supported the activation of a new crime of aggression 

 Akande’s research on the crime of aggression helped culminate in the activation of this crime at the ICC. Akande was invited to verbally brief the Assembly of State Parties’ \(ASP\) – the ICC’s management oversight and legislative body – on the issues raised in **R4** \(as evidenced in a subsequent report, **C8**\). The report noted that these presentations were ‘useful to expand their knowledge and to illustrate legal and policy arguments for various positions’ and that ‘texts of the expert presentations were circulated to all States Parties after the meetings’ \[ **C8**\]. This informed their ultimate decision to activate the crime of aggression on 17 December 2017, which noted ‘ *with appreciation*’ the earlier report **\[C9\]**. This decision, effective from 17<sup>th</sup> July 2018, endorsed Akande’s interpretation of the aggression amendments \(that the ICC was precluded from prosecuting aggression committed by nationals of states that have not accepted the relevant provisions, even when committed on the territory of states that have accepted ICC jurisdiction **\[C9\]**\). Although not binding on ICC judges, this decision, as Akande argued in **\[R5\]**, must be taken into account by ICC judges when interpreting the aggression amendments. 

###  War crimes and the classification of armed conflict 

 Akande’s research **\[R5\]** was also used by Trial Chambers of the ICC when classifying the hostilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\)’s Ituri region. This armed conflict formed the factual matrix of the cases against Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda, both leaders of different rebel armed groups operating in that province. The conflict took place between several non\-state armed groups which initially made it a non\-international armed conflict \(as it was *not* a conflict between two or more states\). However, with Uganda’s occupation of parts of that region, along with its intervention in the conflict to fight against certain rebel groups, the classification of the conflict was rendered more complex. Relying on the criterion of consent, proposed by Akande in **R5**, the Chambers found that the presence of Uganda in the DRC’s territory without its consent, internationalised the conflict, as every Ugandan military attack on the territory was necessarily against the DRC. Akande’s work was directly cited in the *Katanga* Judgment **\[C10\],** rendered in March 2017, and indirectly in the *Ntganda* Judgment \(by cross\-references to the relevant findings in *Katanga*\), issued in July 2019 **\[C11\]**. This classification is crucial, as different rules apply to international and non\-international armed conflicts. By adopting Akande’s proposed criterion for classifying the hostilities, the ICC was able to identify the applicable war crimes and to hold perpetrators to account accordingly. Akande’s approach to classifying armed conflicts on the basis of state consent **\[R5\]** was cited several times by the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2016 **\[C12\]**, whose guidance on the rules of armed conflict is instrumental in securing compliance with international law and in reducing war casualties.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Chemoradiotherapy is now the standard first line treatment for patients with head and neck cancer \(HNC\) who have advanced lymph node disease. For many years, this has been followed by neck dissection surgery but only a minority of patients are subsequently found to have had residual tumour and as such many undergo unnecessary painful, disfiguring and debilitating surgery. Professor Mehanna has demonstrated that the use of advanced imaging, positron emission tomography \(PET\-CT\) eliminates the need for invasive surgery in over 80% of these patients, thereby reducing operative complications from 31% to 8%. The specific impacts which follow from this are: 

-  **Improved outcomes for patients**, as surgery is no longer necessary and hospital stay and surgery\-associated complications are therefore reduced. 

-  New **National and International recommendations** for the treatment of patients with HNC \(including UK, Europe, Japan and USA\) have been introduced. 

-  Widespread **change in clinical practice** as neck dissections for HNC patients are no longer performed, leading to reduction in surgical activity in the UK, Europe and Australia. 

-  **Reduced costs of treatment** both nationally and internationally; for example, the NHS saves approximately £3 million each year as a result of reduced hospital stays for \~2,000 patients. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Head and neck cancer \(HNC\) is the sixth most common cancer globally, affecting more than 5.5 million people, with 600,000 new cases a year, and causing over 379,000 deaths in 2015. Average 5\-year survival following diagnosis in the developed world is 42–64%. 

 For many years, surgical neck dissection has been used after initial chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced disease. However, this is a 2–3 hour operation and requires a 4–7 day hospital stay. It can result in life\-changing complications such as life\-threatening bleeding, pain and life\-long paralysis of mouth movement, prominent scarring and disfigurement, and permanently reduced shoulder movement and infection. 

 Previous work carried out by Mehanna \(Isles et al 2008\) showed that PET\-CT scanning had a high negative predictive value \(97.5%\) for persistent cancer in the neck following chemoradiotherapy \(i.e. a negative scan indicates high confidence that there is no tumour\). However, this evidence was from small retrospective studies, supporting the need for a definitive trial. Mehanna then designed the PET\-NECK study which compared PET\-CT guided surveillance policy to planned neck dissection. The study was run in conjunction with Professor Janet Dunn \(lead cancer statistician\) at Warwick Clinical Trials Unit. 

 During trial recruitment, early evidence emerged of the potential importance of a coincident viral infection, Human Papillomavirus \(HPV\), which appeared to drive many cases of HNC. HPV\-positive head and neck cancer \(HPV\+HNC\) responds much better to chemoradiotherapy treatment than HPV\- cases \(HPV\-HNC\) with consequent improved survival. Importantly, HPV\+HNC is the fastest\-rising subgroup of HNC in the UK and incidence doubled between 1996 and 2006, and then again between 2006 and 2010. It was therefore critical to understand both the global prevalence of HPV\+HNC and the effects of HPV status on the outcomes of the treatments being assessed in the PET\-NECK trial. 

 Working with Dr Sally Roberts and Professor Ciaran Woodman, Mehanna carried out a systematic review of the global prevalence of HPV\+HNC, which confirmed significantly rising trends, especially in the USA and Europe \(R1\). These results led to a critical 2\-year extension of the trial, enabling assessment of subjects’ HPV status, and investigation of this on the outcomes of imaging versus surgery. 

 PET\-NECK, published in 2016, recruited 564 patients and is the largest UK HNC trial in the last 2 decades, \(R2, R3\). 282 patients were in the ‘neck dissection’ arm and 215 neck dissections were performed in this cohort, with patients experiencing a total of 85 \(30%\) complications. In contrast, the 282 patients in the ‘PET\-CT surveillance’ arm underwent 56 neck dissections, experiencing a total of 22 \(8%\) complications. Importantly, survival and tumour control were the same in both groups. 

 These research findings provided clear evidence that ‘PET\-CT surveillance’ treatment was as effective as ‘routine neck dissection’, providing the same tumour control rate, whilst sparing an invasive neck dissection operation in 80% of patients who received PET\-CT surveillance. This equated to 214 patients being spared surgery in this study alone. 

 Full health economic analysis, including modelling of long\-term health economic benefit, was undertaken in 2016–2017 in collaboration with Claire Hulme and Peter Hall, Leeds University \(R4\). 

 The PET\-NECK trial collected data on clinical efficacy, treatment complications, NHS resource use and societal costs allowing comprehensive assessment of impact on people’s lives and on healthcare costs. Careful comparison of implementation costs of surgery versus PET\-CT imaging established a reduction in cost of treatment of £1,492 per patient and supported wide\-scale adoption. 

 The analysis of HPV\-status was crucial as it showed similarly good outcomes in HPV\+ patients between the two arms, demonstrating that PET\-CT surveillance was equally effective for patients with HPV\-HNC and HPV\+HNC and could therefore be used with confidence to treat both patient groups \(R2 and R3\). 

 Key findings \(KF\): 

-  ‘PET\-CT surveillance’ is as effective as ‘routine neck dissection’ in rate of tumour control and can be used to manage both HPV\- and HPV\+ HNC. 

-  Patients can be spared neck dissection using PET\-CT surveillance. 

-  PET\-CT demonstrates long\-term cost effectiveness to healthcare providers.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have fundamentally transformed the treatment of HNC globally, thereby **improving patient outcomes and reducing costs**. This has been achieved by **directly informing professional standards and guidelines which has resulted in** the adoption of **new clinical practice**. 

1.  **Improved patient outcomes by reduction in invasive neck surgery** 

 Significant patient benefits are demonstrated by **reductions** in both **the need for major surgery and in surgery\-associated complications** \(which significantly affect quality of life \[R2, R3\]\). This is evidenced by results of the PET\-NECK study \(R2, R3; KFii\) and reflected by the fact that the number of **neck dissections** carried out for HNC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy in the UK has **reduced by over 50**% from 25.8% in 2007 \(before PET\-NECK trial started\) to 12.2% in 2018 \(Hospital Episode Statistics \(HES\) data\) \[S1\(i\-ii\)\]. As a result, it is projected that 12,000 patients have been spared neck dissection in the UK since 2014 and 2,760 patients have avoided complications in the UK alone. To illustrate, the Beatson Oncology centre \(Glasgow\), which delivers CRT for whole of the West of Scotland Cancer network, reported **a 95% reduction in neck dissections** between 2013–2016 \(presented ICHNO 2019, in publication \[S2i\]\). **Only 5% of 187 patients assessed by PET\-CT required a neck dissection thus** **177 patients were spared the pain, complications and hospital stay** \(on average 935 in\-patient hospital days\) associated with surgery. 

 This patient benefit has been repeated internationally. For example, at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, the main cancer centre in Queensland, Australia, the number of patients receiving PET\-CT after **CRT increased from 8 in 2005–2006 to 83 in 2017–2018** with only 4 \(5%\) patients needing neck dissection \[S2ii\]. Similarly, at the University Hospitals of Cologne and Leipzig \(major HNC centres in Germany\) the number of **PET\-CTs after CRT rose from 7 in 2010 to 89 in 2019** and from **11 in 2005–2006 to 102 in 2018–2019** respectively, after the German Joint Federal Committee approved PET\-CT in 2017 \[S2iii\]. 

1.  **Transforming global professional standards and guidelines for HNC treatment** 

 Globally, **changes have been made to national clinical guidelines** including the USA, Italy, Japan, Germany \[S3\(i\-vi\)\] and the UK \[S3\(v\-vii\)\]; as well as a recommendation for implementation by NICE guidelines in 2018 \[S3\(vii\), based on our findings \[KFi–KFiii\]. 

 Citing Mehanna and the PET\-NECK \(R2\) study as primary evidence, the following **national guidelines** have changed to include the use of PET\-CT for HNC: 

-  The UK’s National Institute for Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) updated its guidelines \(2018\) for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract referencing the PET\-NECK trial \(R2\) as evidence \(Recommendation 1.5\) \[S3v\]. 

-  The UK National Head and Neck Management Guidelines \(2016\) \[S3vi\] were changed \(based on KFi–KFii\) to recommend the use of PET\-CT scan\-guided surveillance in management of advanced nodal disease instead of planned neck dissection. This has translated to changes in many local and regional guidelines across the UK, for instance the West of Scotland Regional head and neck cancer guidelines \[S3vii\]. 

-  **US** National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) Head and Neck Guidelines, 2018 \[S3i\]. 

-  **Italian** Medical Oncology Society \(AIOM\) Guidelines for H&N cancer, 2016 \[S3ii\]. 

-  **Japanese** head and neck cancer guidelines, 2018 \[S3iii\]. 

-  **German** Joint Federal Committee, part of the Federal Ministry of Health \(2017\) \[S3vi\]. 

1.  **Transforming professional clinical practice around the world in the treatment of HNC** 

 Prior to the PET\-NECK study, no clinical units in the UK offered PET\-CT scans to patients for HNC. In 2018, 82% of the 21 centres in CompARE indicated **they would assess patients by PET\-CT 3 months after treatment**. This is supported by participation in the national multi\-centre CompARE trial looking at different treatments for people with oropharyngeal cancer \(2017–ongoing\) \[S4i–iii\]. 

 The number of PET\-CT scans now administered to HNC patients receiving **chemoradiotherapy** **in the UK has increased from no scans in 2007 to 685 in 2018** as verified by the latest data available from HES \[S1\(i\-ii\)\]. 

 International change in practice is reflected by reduced surgeries carried out at International centres as detailed above. 

 That our work led to change is further attested to by the American Society for Clinical Oncology \(ASCO, the world’s largest cancer society\), which described PET\-NECK as one of the “most notable advances in cancer treatment” in ASCO’s 2016 and 2017 reports on the advances in cancer treatment \[S5\]. 

1.  **Reduced treatment costs for HNC surgery** 

 Our health economic study measured per\-person lifetime cost\-saving and quality\-adjusted life years savings of £1,492 per patient, on an average treatment cost of £24,047 \(R4; KFiii\). This translates to a saving of approximately £3 million each year to the NHS. In the UK alone, we calculate a reduction of 12,000 operations between 2014 and 2020, saving £18 million for the NHS. As international practice has changed, major cost\-savings would be anticipated worldwide.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Open University \(OU\) research on floodplain\-meadow vegetation has led to a significant shift by conservation charities, governmental agencies, community groups, and landowners in their approach to conservation of rare floodplain\-meadows. The change has been co\-ordinated through the multi\-partner Floodplain Meadows Partnership \(FMP\), conceived and led by Professor David **Gowing** of the OU as a vehicle for knowledge transfer. The FMP has engaged with practitioners \(through site visits, training events, website\) and produced a  [technical handbook](http://www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/sites/www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/files/Floodplain%20Meadows%20-%20Beauty%20and%20Utility%20A%20Technical%20Handbook.pdf) to make research accessible. As a result, changes to policy, professional practice, and site management have occurred, leading to enhanced biodiversity and improved flood\-risk management. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Floodplain meadows are highly valued both for their biodiversity and their utility in managing flood risk. They were formerly a major land use on floodplains across northern Europe and they have a potential future role in mitigating climate\-change through their ability to produce biomass without artificial inputs and to sequester carbon in their soils. They are very dynamic systems and the composition of their vegetation responds to the prevailing hydrological regime. The precise mechanism by which the hydrological regime determines their diversity was poorly understood. This gap has impeded the ability to manage land jointly for biodiversity and Natural Flood Management \(NFM\). Professor **Gowing** and his team have sought to address this gap. Two major research findings on floodplain meadows underpin our impact: 

 **1. Hydrological niches underpin species coexistence:** 

 Meadow plant communities are diverse because their component species have differential tolerances to soil waterlogging and drying. The OU team defined the favoured hydrological regime of 99 plant species in a report commissioned by DEFRA **\[O1\]**. This report provides base data which enables management decisions to be based on scientific evidence. 

 Many species have specialised their hydrological niche relatively recently in evolutionary time, suggesting that the communities we see today have co\-evolved. Such co\-evolved communities are likely to sustain greater diversity than plant communities assembled artificially. Research by the OU team supports the idea of conserving the community as an entity in its own right rather than conserving just the target species within it **\[O2\]**. 

 The OU team also found that the segregation of hydrological niches first shown in English Floodplain Meadows is mirrored in the wetland communities of the South African fynbos. This led them to make the case that hydrological niche segregation is a fundamental mechanism by which species coexist **\[O3\]**. They were further able to refute the criticism, generated by the neutral theory of evolution, that the link between plant community composition and hydrological regime is actually driven by spatial relationships and is therefore not significant. The resulting paper helped establish hydrological niche segregation as a generally accepted mechanism of species coexistence **\[O4\]**. 

 **2. Consistency of management is key to maintaining species richness:** 

 How land managers decide when to cut their meadows is centred on competing models of meadow management \(prescriptive vs. responsive\). When managers combine approaches, with limited evidence available, the result is inconsistency. Our research has demonstrated advantages of the responsive model **\[O5\]**. 

 Their importance for biodiversity conservation and both mitigation of \(carbon sequestration\) and adaptation to \(flood risk management\) climate change prompts their restoration. From a meadow\-restoration scheme survey, we found that a significant factor determining the success of restoration was consistency of management. Based on this, they were able to define the sufficient and consistent management that is a feature of successful restoration schemes **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The FMP consists of representatives from all organisations in the UK with an active interest in conserving the habitat and has objectives to share research findings, encourage better management and restoration of floodplain meadows through policy change, site management change and training. 

 Establishing the FMP in 2007 has led to research findings being translated into accessible formats aimed at practitioners and policymakers through newsletters \(circulation 1000\), a website, conferences, 270 site visits \(430 land managers\), and documents **\[C1\]** to inform practice, for example: 

-  Research reviews to statutory bodies, e.g. ‘ [A review of the ecology, hydrology and nutrient dynamics of floodplain meadows in England](http://www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/sites/www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/files/files/A%20review%20of%20the%20ecology%20hydrology%20and%20nutrient%20dynamics%20of%20floodpain%20meadows.pdf)’ and ‘ [A Review of the Calthion in England and Wales’](http://www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/sites/www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/files/JP021%20edition%201%20-%20A%20review%20of%20the%20NVC%20for%20the%20Calthion%20group%20of%20plant%20communities%20%281%29%20final%20word%20version%20as%20published.pdf) each offering a hydrological perspective on wet grassland plant communities, expanding the range of described communities. 

-  Technical guides, e.g. ‘ [Floodplain Meadows: Beauty and Utility](http://www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/sites/www.floodplainmeadows.org.uk/files/Floodplain%20Meadows%20-%20Beauty%20and%20Utility%20A%20Technical%20Handbook.pdf)’ and ‘ [Guide to Floodplain Meadows](https://www.field-studies-council.org/shop/publications/floodplain-meadows-guide/)’ providing practical management advice. 

-  Seventy\-six consultant reports to Government, NGOs, and commercial organisations \(housing developers and gravel companies\), e.g. ‘Clifton Ings and Rawcliffe Meadows SSSI: hydrological and plant community modelling,’ applying **O1,** **O2**, **O3**, and **O4** to a specific context. 

 Specific impacts of the FMP were evaluated through a workshop involving the FMP Steering Group **\[C2\]**, and questionnaire surveys of conservation practitioners, land managers, and FMP Ambassadors **\[C3, C4\]**. 

 **Impacts on policy** 

1.  Our research on hydrological niches **\[O1**, **O2**, **O3\]** has changed the way in which the **Environment Agency \(EA\)** approaches floodplain wetlands, and has led to a change in its policy on Natural Flood Management \(NFM\), which in turn has shaped the text of the Government’s 25\-year Environment Plan \(pp. 52, 57–59\) **\[C5\]**.“ *If the FMP project had not existed, the authors \[...\] would not have been able to authoritatively advocate floodplain meadows as an effective natural flood\-management measure \[…\] \(and grasslands\) probably wouldn't have featured as explicitly in 25 year plan \[...\] so we have done amazingly well actually, to help shift balance of awareness/knowledge of the roles played by species rich wet grassland”* National Policy Advisor, EA, now retired **\[C5,** p.1 **\]**. 

1.  **Flood Alleviation Scheme Managers**, **river engineers,** and **conservation practitioners** across England can now use restoration of wet grassland as an NFM technique because of this policy. An example is a Flood Alleviation Scheme in York, which uses a floodplain meadow SSSI for NFM, using our research to inform floodwater management **\[C6\]**. *“This FMP research, and the Environment Agency’s Policy document \[…\] helped us to realise that not only could we protect most of the species\-rich grassland in the scheme, but also instigate the restoration of similar habitat in the rest of the flood storage area, thereby delivering enhanced biodiversity and natural flood management”* \(Project Manager, Environment Agency\) **\[C6\]** *.* 

1.  Our Calthion report to **Natural England** \(NE\) \(drawing on **O1** and **O3**\) led to a change in NE’s “Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs” **\[C1, C5\]**. Twenty percent of new grassland Sites of Special Scientific Interest \(SSSI’s\) designated since 2014 have been based on this report, giving those areas legal protection **\[C1, C2,** p.2, Section 3.1 **\]**. The practitioner software tool ‘ [MAVIS](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/modular-analysis-vegetation-information-system-mavis)’ \(52 downloads/month\) has been changed as a result to include the plant communities we described **\[C7\]**. This is used by **conservation professionals** to assess a site’s botanical conservation value. As a result, floodplain sites can now be more accurately described and defended from development. 

 **Impacts on management and restoration activity on floodplain meadows** 

 By reinforcing the central role of hydrology in structuring plant communities **\[O1, O2, O3, O4\]** and the importance of consistent management **\[O5, O6\]**, we have changed: 

1.  Management plans by **NE staff** at the five sites designated under European Legislation as Special Areas for Conservation \(SAC\), for their floodplain meadow plant community **\[C1\]**. *“As a result of these changes in management plans, Natural England are confident that these sites are moving towards being managed appropriately and have been able to more accurately report their status to the European Commission in 2019 for the*  [<ins> *six yearly review of the European Habitats Directive*</ins>](https://jncc.gov.uk/jncc-assets/Art17/H6510-UK-Habitats-Directive-Art17-2019.pdf) *.”* Senior Specialist – Grasslands, Natural England **\[C1\]**. 

1.  Site\-management activity by **land managers,** leading to enhanced biodiversity. 87% of managers changed their approach to site management, 82% to hay\-cut timing, and 48% to water management **\[C3,** pp.2\-3, graphs 2&3 **\]**. *“An area of floodplain meadow adjacent to the study site is now under increasingly sympathetic management and should be considered worthy of statutory designation. The study \[by FMP Ambassador\] has elevated the importance of this site on a national \(i.e. Wales\) level”* FMP Ambassador and then Director of Radnorshire Wildlife Trust **\[C3.** p.24 **\]**. 

1.  Methods for restoration of meadows by **land managers** leading to more successful outcomes. 61% of managers changed their approach to floodplain\-meadow restoration methods and 52% to post\-restoration management **\[C3,** p.2, graph 2 **\]**. *“FMP gave post\-restoration advice at Oundle Lodge Meadows \[…\]. A better understanding of the relationship between flooding and hay\-cut timings in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus availability gave us valuable information in how we can tweak hay\-cut timings to better improve the botany of the meadows”.* Grazing Officer, Wildlife Trust **\[C3,** p.8 **\]**. 

 **Impacts on practitioners and delivery of professional services, enhanced performance** 

 We have run 3 phases of a 3\-year training programme creating ‘ **FMP Ambassadors’**. This programme is aimed primarily at professional conservation staff, covering the scientific methods used by the FMP to understand sites, supporting Ambassadors to study a site of their choosing, report their findings and advise others locally. This programme includes 47 individuals in 33 counties working for 38 different organisations **\[C8\]**. This has led to: 

1.  Improved knowledge within the **professional conservation sector.** 94% of Ambassadors have enhanced their skills in ecohydrology of floodplain meadows \[ **C4,** p.5, graph 3.1 **\]**. 

 *“I have become a known expert within Yorkshire Wildlife Trust to be consulted on such matters’.* FMP Ambassador **\[C4**, p.13, row no 3 **\]**. 

 *‘My understanding of the processes involved in floodplain meadows, their ecohydrology, skills in monitoring and handling data and think through solutions have all significantly improved my ability to deliver improvements to land management in practice”.* FMP Ambassador **\[C4,** p.13, row no 11 **\]**. 

1.  Skills developed within the **professional conservation sector**. 94% of trainees stated their organisation was benefitting from their learning **\[C4,** p.13, graph 8 **\]**. All of them reported a better understanding of management and restoration concepts **\[C4,** p.6\-7, graph 3.5\) and 88% have given advice to others locally **\[C4,** p.7\-8, graph 4 **\]**. *“The long\-term data being collected on\-site is highly beneficial, something hugely lacking in Ireland for this habitat \[…\]. I have trained in other staff \[…\] and liaised with ecologists directly involved in grassland management. I am soon to meet the leading grassland ecologist in Ireland to discuss floodplain management.”* FMP Ambassador **\[C4,** p.14, row no 3 **\]**. *“Having been involved in training some of the Ambassadors myself and during my own work, it is very clear to me that they are fully engaged in the learning and concepts and that the FMP has been instrumental in changing their approach to management and developing their skills”* Field Studies Council Biodiversity Manager \(now retired\) **\[C8\]**. 

 **Impacts on the environment: Protection and Restoration of Floodplain Meadows** 

 Impacts on the **environment \(biodiversity**\) have been achieved through: 

1.  Provision of consultancy advice \(based on **O1**, **O2**, **O3**, **O4**\) to commercial companies \(e.g. Smith and Sons Ltd. gravel company, Hills Quarry Products Ltd., Persimmon Homes\) through planning permissions to ensure gravel extraction and housing development do not change the hydrology of legally protected sites **\[C9\]**. In all cases, the legally\-protected sites have retained their botanical diversity in the face of adjacent development. 

1.  Protection of national and internationally protected meadows through changes in management \(based on **O5**\), resulting in conserved or increased species diversity **\[C3, C10\]**. 51% of practitioners reported that species diversity on their sites had increased, 49% reported that habitats for pollinators had improved, and 79% reported that species\-rich habitats had been retained. 

1.  More floodplain meadow restoration projects are being delivered **\[O6\]**: 72% of practitioners have started or are considering restoration projects **\[C3,** p.17, graph 4.2 **\]**. *“With invaluable advice from Floodplain Meadows Project we have initiated the Thames Wildflower Meadow Restoration Project \- a partnership of landowners restoring meadows along the Upper Thames”* Joint owners of a floodplain meadow and instigators of a community project – The Thames Valley Wildflower Meadow Restoration Project **\[C3,** p.28 **\]**. 

 In summary, our research has reached the user community through the FMP. We have changed policy, such that wet grasslands are now an NFM measure, being used in flood\-alleviation schemes and more sites have received legal protection. We have changed behaviour amongst practitioners and their organisations, resulting in better management and long\-term conservation of the habitat. We have increased the amount of restoration activity and extent of the habitat.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Joe Moran’s writing on shyness raised public awareness and understanding of this common but often ill\-defined condition. In the recent focus on mental health and wellbeing in public discourse and policy, shyness has received little attention. Moran’s project made shyness part of public discussions about wellbeing and being human, and addressed unhelpful simplifications of and misconceptions about it. This work formed part of Moran’s longstanding commitment to public writing and the communication of complex issues and debates beyond the academy. He has continued his interest in the relationship between creativity and mental health in more recent books, written for a wide readership, on writing \(First You Write a Sentence, 2018\) and failure \(If You Should Fail: A Book of Solace, 2020\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Moran conducted all the research and impact for this project whilst at LJMU. The main research output was a 95,000\-word monograph, Shrinking Violets: A Field Guide to Shyness, published in the UK in 2016 and in the US \(in extensively revised form\) in 2017. 

 Until Moran’s book, shyness had received little scholarly attention within the humanities. As a mundane and chronic condition, it has also largely evaded psychological definition and medicalisation, although extreme versions of it have been diagnosed recently in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as ‘social phobia’ or ‘social anxiety disorder’. The contiguous but distinct phenomenon of introversion aroused much public interest following the bestselling success of Susan Cain’s book Quiet \(2012\). Moran’s work, which Cain has called ‘thoughtful, beautifully written and vividly detailed’ \(quote provided for dustjacket copy for Shrinking Violets\), fed into the interest around these broad areas of social anxiety and introversion while offering quite different insights. 

 Moran argues that shyness cannot primarily be understood through scientific categorisation or medical diagnosis. Unlike related phenomena such as introversion, shame, embarrassment, fear and timidity, it is hard to explain in terms of differing levels of brain stimulation, observable physiological manifestations, or adaptive, self\-preservatory evolutionary traits. 

 It is best understood, instead, as a fundamentally human condition, bound up with the uniquely human activity of meaning\-making, and our capacity to construct strange, circular, self\-defeating stories about ourselves. The real feelings associated with shyness are thus inseparable from how we articulate those feelings. Moran shows that shyness has been felt and thought about in countless, historically specific ways. In tracing the cultural history and shifting representation of shyness, his book makes a significant contribution to recent work in the medical humanities and the history of emotions. 

 Shyness, Moran argues, is both common and complicated, existing on a continuum running from mild social awkwardness to crippling anxiety. Many outgoing people experience it, and even the acutely shy experience it unevenly and situationally. It manifests itself in such diverse ways because it feeds on two opposing human traits: self\-consciousness and sociability. Shyness, which rarely involves complete social withdrawal, reveals the human capacity to sublimate our communicative urges into oblique forms – art, music and writing, for instance – and tangential social behaviours. 

 Moran’s work seeks to challenge the simplistic narratives of self\-help and personal growth that surround shyness. Where the Victorians spoke of ‘constitutional shyness’, we now prefer to see shyness as a debility to be overcome, even a pathology to be treated. Moran sees it, rather, as an enduring and tenacious aspect of our personalities, part of being human. His work thus seeks to dispel misunderstandings about, and enrich our understanding of, this inescapably human condition. 

 Shrinking Violets achieves this not through the standard communication of research findings, but through an innovative work of scholarly non\-fiction, a hybrid of memoir, biography, cultural history, textual criticism and philosophical reflection. It conveys, in writing that is rich, layered, lyrical and particularising, the many\-sided and elusive nature of its subject. It aims to enable both the shy and non\-shy to understand shyness better, as both an intimately felt experience and a culturally articulated one, and to see it as part of the healthy jigsaw of human diversity.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Moran’s book, Shrinking Violets, received widespread attention, nationally and internationally. It was BBC Radio 4 Book of the Week in August/September 2016, attracting 3,231,000 unique listeners \(Rajar figures\), and was extracted in the Independent and Australian Financial Review. It was widely and favourably reviewed in the UK, Europe and America. Many reviews focused on the positive impact it would make in challenging reductionist readings of a multivalent condition. The Daily Mail reviewer wrote that ‘to a shy person, this book is incredibly cheering. It shows us we are not alone.’ The Observer called it ‘fantastic and involving … a feat of empathy’. Introducing Shrinking Violets as the Sunday Times ‘Thought Book of the Year’, the reviewer called it ‘beautifully written’ and ‘a strange and fascinating way to think about our shared humanity’. \(CS1\) 

 Before and after publication, Moran wrote articles on shyness for the Guardian, the Radio Times, The Conversation, the Daily Beast and other media, and blogged for Psychology Today. Readers’ comments on these pieces underline their impact: ‘What an unusual and beautiful description of shyness, seeing it as just a natural trait instead of something to be eradicated.’ \(CS2\) ‘Beautifully written piece … It struck so many chords with me.’ ‘I've learnt that most people are sympathetic to shyness because … we can all relate to it as this lovely article shows.’ \(CS3\) 

 Moran spoke about shyness at major literary festivals such as Words by the Water \(March 2017\), Ways with Words \(July 2018\) and Gladfest \(September 2019\), allowing him to engage with audiences in Q&As and book signings \(CS4\). ‘I went to your talk about shyness,’ one audience member wrote, ‘and it gave me an appreciation of my own … It has made me see my “strangenesses” in a new light.’ \(CS5\) He was interviewed about shyness by major publications in the Netherlands \(Volkskrant\), Denmark \(Weekendavisen\), Ireland \(Irish Examiner\), Spain \(El Mundo, El Pais\), Poland \(Charaktery\) and Italy \(La Repubblica\). An interview for the BBC website had over 280,000 unique browsers, its author commenting that ‘with Moran as its reluctant, mild\-mannered cheerleader, the Shy Pride movement may have just been born’. \(CS6\) Moran was also interviewed on BBC Radio 4, BBC World News, BBC World Service \(twice\), the Irish station Newstalk \(twice\), RTÉ Radio 2 \(twice\), ABC Australian Radio National \(three times\) and radio stations in Spain, Melbourne, Cape Town, Montreal and Salt Lake City, often interacting with listeners in call\-ins. Introducing Moran on BBC Radio 4’s Thinking Allowed, Laurie Taylor said that ‘in my insensitive, snap\-out\-of\-it extrovert way, I’ve never regarded \[shyness\] as meriting any great degree of personal or sociological attention, but a new and quite beautifully written book has changed all that’. \(CS7\) 

 Moran reached new audiences in diverse ways. He performed a stand\-up routine on shyness at the Liverpool Everyman Theatre \(Liverpool Bright Club, March 2017\); appeared alongside practitioners of ‘shy activism’ and autism awareness, Hamja Ahsan and Paul Wady, at the DIY Cultures Fair, Shoreditch \(May 2017\) and Writing on the Wall, Liverpool \(May 2018\); and contributed to Jamie Thom’s book A Quiet Education: Challenging the Extrovert Ideal in Our Schools \(John Catt, 2020\). 

 A significant strand of this impact targeted vulnerable groups who may find it hard to articulate their shyness. Moran was interviewed by Teen Breathe, a magazine promoting mental wellbeing in young people \(November 2018\), and for the Creative Introvert Podcast \(13 March 2018\). He spoke about shyness and masculinity at the Being a Man festival \(Southbank, November 2016\) and was interviewed on this subject by joe.co.uk \(18 November 2016\), melmagazine.com \(7 December 2016\) and the podcast The Modern Mann \(27 March 2017\). He also spoke to the careers site The Ladders about coping with shyness at work \(8 March 2017\), particularly in working environments that value dialogue and collaboration, by focusing on one\-to\-one interactions and prepared public speaking. He was interviewed by Canvas8 \(10 February 2017\), a behavioural insights practice offering paywalled resources for clients including Coca\-Cola and Unilever, on getting the best out of shy employees. This resulted in an internally circulated report, ‘The science of shyness’, in which Moran emphasised the importance of not seeing shyness as something to shake off but as a resilient and paradoxical condition. He gave talks about shyness in academia to PGR students at Birkbeck \(June 2016\) and LJMU \(November 2019\). 

 Web comments about Shrinking Violets evidence its impact on readers: ‘Inspiring and reassuring to know that others … suffer with shyness in ways similar or far more extreme than I have.’ ‘Shrinking Violets is not a miracle cure for shyness – it’s more like a hand reaching out to take yours, a reassurance that you're not alone.’ ‘Anyone who is shy, or knows someone who is ought to read this book to better understand themselves or others.’ \(CS8\) ‘Being shy I'm not sure I can articulate how good this book is … I don't think I've read anything as human as this about shyness.’ ‘I found this book a very positive encouragement … given how negatively shyness can be portrayed/viewed by the world at large.’ \(CS9\) 

 In the many letters and emails Moran received from readers, and comments on his own website, the positive personal impact of his work and its broadening of understanding were common themes: ‘Your book helped me I think overcome some difficulties, or at least better rationalize the human relations and my stand in interacting with others.’ ‘The best part about reading is where you come across something, a thought or feeling you had felt peculiar to yourself, written down by someone else, and they’ve expressed it in a way that perfectly synthesises your thoughts … Shrinking Violets gave me lots of those moments.’ \(CS5\) ‘It’s definitely altered how I feel about my own shyness, which I used to see as an ugly affliction that needed to be cured.’ ‘I understand \[my wife and daughter\] a bit better after reading your excellent book.’ ‘A remarkable achievement … as a shy and reserved person, I … valued your analysis and observations.’ ‘Your book helped show me that I ought to go easier on myself.’ \(CS10\) These responses evidenced a key argument of the book: that shyness is a condition that affects everyone differently but speaks to our common humanity.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The marking of student work is plagued by human error. Loughborough University research into applying comparative judgement to educational assessment minimised marking error and resulted in three impacts. First, the non\-ministerial government department Ofqual implemented the technique to regulate qualifications, which has increased the fairness of examinations for around 5.5m candidates to date in England and Wales. Second, our research was commercialised by the testing agency No More Marking Ltd., which generated sales of almost £1.5m, and created nine new jobs. Third, our research transformed assessment practice in 2,227 schools in 27 countries, which enabled the novel assessment of learning progression for around 579,400 students and enhanced the professional development of over 10,000 teachers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Marking errors create three systemic problems. First, they lead to ‘tick\-box’ assessments comprising short, piecemeal questions that reduce marking errors at the cost of thoughtful, lengthier responses, and that fragment curricular knowledge into isolated facts for rote learning. Second, marking errors mean that students' grades are unreliable; for some students this unfairly hinders life chances. Third, marking errors mean that standards over time and across different awarding bodies cannot be accurately compared, or equivalence maintained. These latter two problems reduce public confidence in qualifications. 

 Our programme of research began when Jones joined Loughborough in 2011 with a five\-year Royal Society Fellowship awarded to investigate why GCSE mathematics examinations were not fit for purpose. Jones found that the requirement to rapidly mark hundreds of thousands of exam scripts resulted in question papers almost entirely made from short, piecemeal questions that minimise marking errors but also reduce validity \[R1\]. To address this problem Jones led a programme of research that developed a comparative judgement \(CJ\) technique for assessing mathematical knowledge. The CJ technique takes a radical approach to tackling marking errors by eliminating marking itself. Instead, subject experts decide which of two presented scripts is ‘better’ in terms of a high\-level criterion such as ‘conceptual understanding’. Many such binary decisions are collected from several assessors and then fitted to the Bradley\-Terry model to produce a score for each student. 

 This work involved Alcock \(2012\-2014\), Foster \(2017\-ongoing\), Gilmore \(2014\-ongoing\) and Inglis \(2013\-ongoing\) and led to three key research findings: 

 **1. CJ is reliable** \( *funders: HEFCE, Royal Society ED090015*\). 

 To demonstrate the reliability of CJ we developed a statistical measure based on a split\-halves technique \[R2\]. This measure enabled us to demonstrate that CJ produces reliable outcomes when used to score open\-ended mathematics assessments, showing that assessments need no longer resort to piecemeal questions to minimise marking error \[R1\]. Moreover, the reliability of CJ assessment outcomes is robust across age groups from primary \[R5\] to undergraduate level \[R3\], and across topics, institutions \[R2\] and jurisdictions \[R5\]. 

 **2. CJ is a valid assessment tool** \( *funders: HEFCE, No More Marking Ltd., Nuffield Foundation EDU/40389 & EDU/38927, Royal Society ED090015*\). 

 Given the dominance of piecemeal test questions in high\-stakes assessments, we theorised validity as the reliable assessment of nebulous but important learning outcomes such as problem\-solving and conceptual understanding. We investigated the validity of CJ using numerous techniques including expert review \[R3\], interviews and surveys with students and assessors \[R1\], comparing the outcomes of different groups of assessors \[R4\], content analysis of test responses \[R5\], and investigating the convergence and divergence of CJ outcomes with standardised measures and existing achievement data \[R3\]. 

 **3. CJ can help measure standards over time** \( *funder: AQA*\). 

 We developed a CJ\-based technique for comparing assessment standards across institutions and time. To demonstrate the technique, we showed that standards in A\-level Mathematics have declined since the 1960s \[R6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our research into applying comparative judgement to educational assessment resulted in three impacts via pathways including the dissemination of research findings to awarding bodies \(Assessment and Qualifications Alliance \(AQA\); Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment \(CCEA\); Edexcel; New Zealand Qualifications Authority \(NZQA\); Oxford, Cambridge and RSA \(OCR\)\) and invited seminars and international assessment conferences \(e.g. AEA\-Europe\). Another important pathway to impact was high\-profile national media coverage \( *BBC*, *Daily Mail*, *Daily Telegraph*, *ITV*, *TES*, *The Times*\), and receiving the *British Educational Research Journal* Editor’s Choice Award for the best paper published in BERJ during 2016. 

 We describe the resulting three impacts in turn. 

 **1. Fairer examinations have benefitted 5.5m candidates over 5 years.** 

 Our novel technique for comparing assessment standards changed the examination system in England and Wales, having been adopted by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation \(Ofqual\) since 2015 to increase the fairness of UK examinations for around 1.1m candidates per year \[S1\]. Ofqual used outcomes from our novel technique to instruct awarding bodies to account for relative difficulty when writing subsequent examination papers, improving fairness both across awarding bodies and over time. Dr Michelle Meadows, the Deputy Chief Regulator at Ofqual, said 

 “*Research conducted at Loughborough has directly impacted the examination system in England and Wales, making it fairer and impacting around 1.1 million candidates per year. Our comparability and awarding work based on Loughborough’s research is crucial for ensuring public acceptance of the examination system*” \[S1\]. 

 **2. SME No More Marking Ltd. has benefited commercially to the value of £1.5m.** 

 Our research was commercialised in November 2013 when Dr Chris Wheadon, former Chief Examiner of awarding body AQA, set up the small/medium enterprise No More Marking Ltd. \(NMM\). The purpose of NMM was to develop an online comparative judgement service based on findings from our research \[S2\]. NMM had created 9 new jobs and generated almost £1.5m in sales as of October 2020 \[S3\]. Wheadon, CEO of NMM, wrote that 

 “*Loughborough’s research on comparative judgement directly led to the development of No More Marking’s online assessment platform. … The development and validation of an inter\-rater reliability measure enabled us to convince potential clients that our approach eliminated marker error; this was particularly influential in the growth of our customer base*” \[S2\]. 

 **3. Transformed practice in schools has improved the assessment of 579,400 students and enhanced the professional development of over 10,000 teachers.** 

 NMM launched six subscription services for schools that enabled the novel assessment of learning progression in mathematics and English. Within each service, NMM administered tests and provided schools with nationally benchmarked data on learning progression at the student, class and school level. To date, 2,227 schools in 27 countries have subscribed to NMM’s services, and these schools received reliable data on the learning progression of around 579,400 students \[S3\]. Wheadon wrote that Loughborough’s research 

 “*enabled the design of our ‘Proof of Progress’* \[mathematics\] *subscription service to schools”* \[S2\]. 

 ‘Proof of Progress’ was NMM’s first service, launched in 2015 \[S3\]. Following this initial success, further services were developed. Wheadon wrote that 

 “*Loughborough’s research into the reliability of comparative judgement within the context of comparing standards across institutions led to the development of further subscription services for assessing writing \(Assessing GCSE English; Assessing Primary Writing; Assessing America’s Writing\)*” \[S2\]. 

 NMM’s services received high\-level endorsement in 2016 when Nick Gibb, the Schools Minister, said that NMM has 

 “*improved the assessment of written work in English*” \[S4\]. 

 Our research into improving the validity of mathematics assessments has particularly benefited students who were previously unfairly disadvantaged by more traditional assessments. For example, one mathematics lead teacher in New Zealand expressed concern about the effect that traditional tests have on 

 *“children of Pasifika and Māori heritage who perform disproportionately poorly due to the cultural inappropriateness of such tests”* \[S5\]. 

 She went on to explain that, in contrast 

 *“comparative judgement enables the use of more open\-ended and therefore more valid mathematics assessments, as demonstrated by research conducted at Loughborough University*” \[S5\]. 

 A unique benefit of NMM’s services is that data on the learning progression are inherently moderated and directly comparable across schools. To achieve this, teachers assess the work of students from their own schools and from different schools. This moderation and comparability across schools increased confidence in the assessment data that NMM provided to schools. For example, one Vice Principal wrote that students’ 

 “*reaction to the judging has been very positive* \[and students\] *are reassured and motivated by the fact their work is not just seen by the class teacher but by teachers across the school and the country*” \[S6\]. 

 To date, NMM’s services have involved over 10,000 teachers making holistic comparisons of the quality of students’ work from across different schools and different year groups. This contrasts with common school practice whereby each teacher assesses their own students using traditional marking. Consequently, NMM’s services have enhanced teachers’ professional development as explained by a prominent Deputy Headteacher, who wrote that the comparative judgement approach 

 “*is helping me to be much better informed about how writing is looking in each cohort compared to traditional assessment methods.* ... *I also love that I have every teacher looking at writing outside of their year group*” \[S7\]. 

 A Vice Principal wrote that 

 “*the teachers* ... *were very positive on how the switch to judging had impacted on their working life. They felt better supported, less alone, more reflective of their teaching practice and enjoyed the opportunity to learn from teachers not just in their own school but across the country. One teacher remarked that it is really interesting when you see that a teacher in another school has taught the pupils a certain approach and you can see it has really worked*” \[S6\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 All modern economies are heavily reliant on a continuous supply of electrical power. High voltage circuit breakers are crucial equipment to mitigate network faults and maintain the stability of power delivery networks. Low carbon footprint system components are increasingly important. A comprehensive digital design tool developed by the Liverpool team enabled two international manufacturers to shorten their product development time from 5 years to 2 years, resulting in savings in development cost and additional revenue totalling GBP \[text removed for publication\] and at the same time lower significantly the carbon footprint through a 30% reduction in the materials required. Liverpool’s research also enabled a third international manufacturer to develop a circuit breaker that employs ‘greener’ insulation gases that have a global warming potential \(GWP\) < 1% of that of the currently used gas \(SF<sub>6</sub>\) which has been used for over 50 years and has a GWP of 23,800 times that of CO<sub>2</sub>. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 **A complex problem:** A high voltage circuit breaker is required to interrupt a damaging network fault current up to 60kA within a time scale of 50ms. This is achieved by first producing an electrically conducting arc plasma \(ionised gas\) between two separating electrodes to temporarily maintain the flow of the fault current and then using high speed gas flow to cool the arc and eventually convert it into an insulating gas, when the alternating current crosses its zero point. The performance of this complex system depends on the collective effect of the interwoven physical mechanisms: switching arcs burn in transonic flows of gas mixtures with fast changing species concentration; high temperature gas \(\~25,000K\) emits megawatts ultra\-violet radiation leading to severe polymer ablation; strong magnetic pinch interacts with the gas pressure and flow field; and turbulence enhanced energy transfer dominates the arc cooling near current zero. All these contribute to a very complex system to model. 

 **Liverpool research:** Previous research in Liverpool had focused on experimental and computational investigation into simple nozzle arcs at low current in pure SF<sub>6</sub> gas. Key research for a digital simulation tool to model the arcing process and aid circuit breaker design started in Liverpool in 2001 and took 4 critical steps. 1\) The ablation by radiation of the arc confining polymer nozzle was studied and modelled by Fang, Yan and Zhang \(J\) during 2001 – 2003, by solving a specific concentration equation for polymer vapour and verified by experiments. The required thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients of SF<sub>6</sub>\-polymer vapour mixture were calculated using fundamental theory \[3.1\], extending the arc model to self\-blast circuit breakers \(relying on polymer nozzle ablation for current interruption\), the most advanced high voltage circuit breaker to date. 2\) In 2002\-2005, the validity of a simplified and fast radiation transfer model was verified by Dixon, Yan and Fang by comparing the results with those from more accurate but computationally prohibitively expensive models \[3.2\]. 3\) Collaborative research with Pinggao from 2007 to 2013, resulted in a novel arc root modelling method that dramatically reduced the inaccuracy of arc voltage prediction from 35% to 10% \[3.3,3.4\], yielding a key step forward for the modelling of commercial circuit breakers. 4\) The work of Yan, Liu and Zhang \(Q\) \[3.5,3.6\] over the period of 2013 – 2018 identified the theoretical links between the arc quenching capability of a high\-speed gas and its material properties \[3.5,3.6\], providing clear guidance on the selection and synthesis of ‘greener’ gases to replace SF<sub>6</sub>. A method was developed to handle this C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>7</sub>N\+CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixture and its material properties resulting from the non\-recombination of the fresh mixture when subject to arc discharges. The digital modelling tool was also upgraded to accommodate the C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>7</sub>N\+CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixture that has a global warming potential of less than 1% of that of SF<sub>6</sub> and is also the most favoured gas mixture worldwide to replace SF<sub>6</sub> in the power industry. 

#  Development of Liverpool’s simulation tool with circuit breaker manufacturers: 

 

 Figure 1: Timeline for simulation tool development and its use in industrial design. Reyrolle was the only high voltage circuit breaker manufacturer in the UK and became purely a manufacturing base after it was acquired by Siemens in 2005. 

The development of the simulation tool was made possible by Liverpool’s experience with commercial computational fluid dynamics software and knowledge of numerical algorithms based on the finite volume method. Code developed at Liverpool, specifically for the tool, was seamlessly integrated into the commercial software by the team, to simulate the operation of pressure valves and other moving objects in transient high temperature gas flows. This made it possible in 2005 to model the arcing process in self\-blast circuit breakers with full consideration of the breaker geometry and functional components \(Figure 1\), and was subsequently tested on ABB circuit breakers during 2005\-2006. The tool was enhanced by the arc rooting method and fully verified in 2010 using test results from three international manufacturers and with additional results from Spencer.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 A comprehensive digital design tool developed by the Liverpool team has enabled impact to be made on two fronts: commercial, and environmental via reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This impact has been achieved via two international manufacturers who have shortened their product development time from 5 years to 2 years, resulting in savings in development costs and generating additional revenue totalling GBP \[text removed for publication\], and also reducing the carbon footprint through savings in materials by 30%. Liverpool’s research also enabled a third international manufacturer to develop a circuit breaker that uses greener insulation gases that have notably less global warming potential \(less than 1% of that of SF<sub>6</sub>\). 

 The impact of the research is a direct result of active industrial engagement of Liverpool researchers. The first collaborator, Pinggao Group, is the largest switchgear manufacturer in China with 10,000 employees. The collaboration with Pinggao was initiated in 2006 when the Director of Pinggao’s Technology Centre attended Yan’s lecture series given at Xi’an Jiaotong University. In a subsequent visit to Pinggao in the same year, Yan spent three days presenting Liverpool’s approach for arc modelling and giving seminars on switching arc theory, which convinced Pinggao of the benefits of mutual collaboration. 

#  4.1 Game\-changing design practice leading to the shortening of product development time from 5 years to 2 years \(Impact on manufacturing process\) 

 A cash stream totalling GBP1,425,586, through 8 individual projects, was committed by the three international manufacturers to further improve and test the arc model through fundamental and applied research, enabling the simulation tool to accommodate a wide range of design features \(puffer and self\-blast types, double motion type, dual hollow moving contacts, etc.\) and become more intelligent, reducing the engineering design effort required to run the simulation tool **.** Pinggao commenced using the digital simulation tool in 2010 to develop new circuit breakers and 13 products have been successfully developed and rolled out into market. The simulation tool has been so useful that it became an essential tool for Pinggao’s circuit breaker product design. Any initial design has to be optimised and verified by the simulation tool before it goes to the prototype stage. As is stated by the Director of Pinggao’s Technology Centre in his letter \[5.1\], 

 “ *Using Liverpool’s tool to evaluate and optimize new product design has become an essential step in our R&D activities. The average development time for the new products developed with the aid of Liverpool’s tool is less than 2 years. This is much shorter than the average time of 5 years before* **.**” 

 The tool was also transferred to Shanghai Sieyuan Electrical Co. Ltd for product design and 2 new products were successfully developed within two years \(from 2014 to 2016 and from 2015 to 2017, respectively\), significantly accelerating their product development speed and ensuring the delivery of the circuit breaker product to customers under commercial contracts \[5.2\]. This is acknowledged in particular by Dr Wei Gu, the product development team leader at Shanghai Sieyuan, in his witness letter \[5.3\], 

 “*Our team of 5 engineers completed both the designs and tests within an average of 2 years from absolutely nothing to pass the complete set of Type Test. For a similar product, it would take 5 years in the past to develop.*” 

#  4.2 Commercial impact \- Reduction of product development cost and time to market 

 A total of 15 different product series have been developed and sold by Pinggao and Shanghai Sieyuan. The total savings in development cost to Pinggao is estimated to be GBP \[text removed for publication\] in the period August 2013 to July 2020 \[5.1\]. For Pinggao, the earlier access to the market by the new products created an additional revenue of GBP \[text removed for publication\] over the period of August 2013 to July 2020 \[5.1\]. At Shanghai Sieyuan, a team of 5 engineers designed, using Liverpool’s simulation tool, a 300kV and a 420kV self\-blast circuit breaker within 2 years \(2014\-2016 and 2015\-2017 respectively\) \[5.3\]. In addition, the R&D cost has been reduced by GBP \[text removed for publication\] for each product \[5.2\]. As stated in Sieyuan’s letter \[5.2\], 

 *“The use of Liverpool’s numerical simulation technology minimizes the time from laboratory to market, which has helped the company to create an additional sale of \[text removed for publication\] GBP in the period 2014 – 2020.”* 

#  4.3 Environmental impact \- Contribution to green electricity transmission 

 
Globally, the annual SF<sub>6</sub> production is around 8,000 tons \[5.4\]. Based on atmospheric measurement data, global SF<sub>6</sub> emissions were 8,100 tons \[5.5\]. This essentially creates a production\-emission scenario because there is no natural sink for SF<sub>6</sub>. These emissions are equivalent to the annual greenhouse footprint of 40 million cars. 

 Figure 2: A new design of a single\-phase of the 1100kV circuit breaker at Pinggao, enabled by the use of Liverpool’s digital design tool. It has dimensions of \[text removed for publication\] m \(length by width by height\). 

Using the simulation tool, Pinggao was able to minimise the size of the design of their 1000kV Ultra High Voltage \(UHV\) circuit breaker \(Figure 2 shows a single\-phase section, a unit has three phases\), leading to a weight reduction from \[text removed for publication\] tons for a three\-phase unit, land use reduced by 20% and manufacturing cost \(mainly material\) reduced by 30% \[5.1\]. The use of SF<sub>6</sub> per unit was also reduced significantly, by 37% from \[text removed for publication\] kg, equivalent to 21,150 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per unit. 

 Following an invited talk presented by Yan at an international conference \(FSO 2017\) on SF<sub>6</sub> replacement and subsequent technical discussions, collaboration with South Korea’s largest switchgear manufacturer, Hyosung Corporation, was formally established in March 2018 to extend the digital simulation tool to aid the design of high voltage gas blast circuit breakers based on gases with low global warming potential, a mixture of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>7</sub>N and CO<sub>2</sub>. The digital simulation tool was transferred to Hyosung in late 2018. A 170kV circuit breaker based on the environmentally friendly gas mixture, which represents the highest voltage level of circuit breakers using alternatives to SF<sub>6</sub> around the globe, has been developed in collaboration with Liverpool. As identified above, this has reduced enormously the global warming potential \(GWP\) due to switching gases. The GWP of SF<sub>6</sub> is 23,800 times that of CO<sub>2</sub>\) \[5.6\]. 

 For the electricity industry, direct replacement of SF<sub>6</sub> based asset \(retrofitting\) is of paramount importance. This is evidenced in the letter from Hyosung \[5.6\], 

 *“Moreover, we have successfully kept the size of the new product the same as that of the old one using SF<sub>6</sub> gas – which is exactly what our customers such as KEPCO \(Korean national grid\) want for retrofitting existing assets.”* 

 The newly developed SF<sub>6</sub> free circuit breakers are being supplied in large quantities as part of a commercial contract between Hyosung and KEPCO \(Korean National Grid\) \[5.6\]. 

#  4.4 Development and consolidation of long\-term industry\-university collaboration 

 The team at the University of Liverpool not only transferred the digital simulation tool to industry to help product design, but also organised a series of training sessions and workshops for the design engineers from the collaborators. 5 engineers from Pinggao Group spent 3\-6 months at Liverpool where they undertook training on advanced arc physics, switching process and practical skills on arc modelling. 2 senior engineers from Shanghai Sieyuan visited for 3 months in 2012 to be trained on arc modelling. 2 engineers from Hyosung have attended two workshops at Liverpool in 2018 to be trained on arc physics and arc modelling and another also spent three months \(June – August 2018\) at Liverpool to study switching theory. These efforts have helped the establishment of long\-term collaborations with the industry, the successful transfer of knowledge to our industrial collaborators and sustained continued research funding to the University of Liverpool.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 An increase in physical activity by just 25% could prevent over 1.3million deaths per year around the world. In England only 17.5% of children in England meet the Chief Medical Officers’ guidelines for physical activity for health. Research by Duncan and Eyre has considered how children’s health and physical literacy can be enhanced through the development of Fundamental Movement Skills \(FMS\). Their work provided teachers, coaches and community sport\-providers with new knowledge, which has changed practices at international, national and local levels. The embedding of these improvements in guidance has helped thousands of children reach a positive trajectory for health. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Fundamental Movement Skills \(FMS\) are considered the building blocks for all forms of physical activity, comprising: locomotor, object control and stability skills. Poor FMS in childhood can impede a child’s development and lead to poor health in adulthood.  Research led by Professor Mike Duncan and Dr Emma Eyre at Coventry University has helped create a pathway for children to engage in physical activity for life through development of their FMS.</ins> 

 <ins>In 2012 and to 2015, Coventry City Council approached Duncan to find a new method to assess whether children in local schools were acquiring movement skills for Physical Education \(PE\) at the ‘optimum’ chronological milestone. Prior to 2012, data assessing the PE skills of UK children was scarce. Duncan assessed movement skills, relating to eight FMS \(including run, hop and jump\), in children from years 2–6 \(ages 6\-11\). The children’s movements were</ins> <ins>analysed</ins> <ins>using biomechanics software. Results highlighted that a child’s specific year group \(age\) influenced seven out of the eight skills, and that factors such as weight status and gender showed significant correlation with levels of mastery over different skills \(R1\). The research demonstrated how analysis of FMS attainment could be used to inform targeted interventions amongst primary school children.</ins> 

 <ins>From 2016 to 2017, the British Academy funded Duncan \(G1\) to develop the scientific understanding of the relationship between FMS, physical activity, weight status and related health indices in children \(R2\). Duncan used a storytelling activity, through a</ins> <ins>randomised</ins> <ins>control trial in 74 children aged 3\-4 years of age, to examine connections between these factors. Duncan’s research was the first investigation to evidence that combining FMS development with</ins> <ins>storytelling could enhance both language and movement capacity in early years children to a greater extent than movement or storytelling\-only interventions alone.</ins> 

 <ins>Concurrently, Duncan undertook research with the United Kingdom Strength and Conditioning Association. This assessed the safety and effectiveness of using resistance training interventions within primary school children on FMS, physical self\-efficacy and health\-related fitness. The research demonstrated the importance of developing FMS during childhood, judged against the key health\-related metrics of physical activity and weight status \(R3\).</ins> 

 <ins>From 2017 to 2020, Duncan and Eyre carried out research funded by the Ba</ins><ins>dminton World Federation \(BWF\)</ins> <ins>to examine the efficacy of</ins> <ins>a badminton\-s</ins><ins>pecific movement intervention for primary school children, t</ins><ins>he</ins> <ins>Shuttle Time</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>\(STP\),</ins> <ins>compared to traditional physical education</ins> <ins>\(G2, G3\)</ins><ins>. Using a cluster</ins> <ins>randomised</ins> <ins>design with 124 children, Duncan and Eyre evaluated FMS attainment levels before, during and after participation. The research showed that FMS development could be anchored to a specific sport rather than a generic</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>of activities, as is more common. It demonstrated that the STP was not effective in all children, as had been assumed by BWF, and raised important questions about the efficacy of ‘one\-size\-fits\-all’ interventions \(R4\).</ins> 

 <ins>Duncan’s work on FMS and the development of physical literacy amongst young people is ongoing, and he was recently invited to be lead author of an Expert Statement on FMS for children’s health on behalf of the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by Duncan and Eyre has helped provide children with the ‘tools’ to be physically active for life: improving knowledge, guiding practice, and informing policy for teachers, sports organisations and private companies. 

 <ins>Guidance for BWF Outreach</ins> 

 Launched in 2012, ‘Shuttle Time’ \(ST\) is the flagship young person’s programme of the Badminton World Federation \(BWF\) that supports its implementation in 138 countries, with over 50,000 coaches trained. In 2017 BWF approached Duncan and Eyre to measure the effectiveness of the programme with FMS. They found that ST best enhanced FMS in children below seven, but was far less effective in those aged 10 or above. As a result, FMS development was embedded for the first time within a governing body of sport’s work. BWF used the research to change the way ST was implemented, and to support ‘the further growth of the programme globally’ \(S1\). 

 BWF disseminated new guidance based on CU findings to all coaches worldwide, resulting in improved coaching knowledge and practice \(S1, 2\). Implementation guidelines now specify that ST is most effective in Key Stage 1 \(equivalent\); BWF revised ST for KS2 as a result, refocussing the programme on Fundamental Sport Skills \(rather than FMS\). The Development Director of Badminton Pan America stated that this has ‘changed thinking ‘on how they ‘use Shuttle Time to enhance children’s experiences of badminton and… help enhance children’s movement skill development’ \(S2\). 

 <ins>Enhancing FMS for Schools, Early Years and Community Sports Providers</ins> 

 Following engagement with CU researchers, since 2016 Coventry City Council have used analysis of children’s FMS to inform development of targeted interventions relating to physical literacy: schools now include child\-specific resistance exercise training in statutory PE at Key Stage 1 \(S3\). Duncan’s work has also provided an effective framework for assessments of primary PE, which are mandatory but often poorly conceptualised: schools across Warwickshire – catering for some 82,000 children \- now include FMS assessment in their standard monitoring and observation strategies for curriculum PE \(S3\). Warwickshire Education’s Integrated Disability Service also used this research to change motor\-skill and movement interventions to better enhance education opportunities for children with special educational needs, integrating speech therapy with FMS to improve language development \(S4\). 

  

 From 2015 to 2020, Duncan worked closely with one of the largest grassroots football clubs in Birmingham County FA, reaching some 1,500 junior footballers over five years. Over 30 community grassroots coaches were trained in the best ways to enhance movement and motor skills for children, and the chairman reports the ‘positive influence’ it has delivered to help develop foundation skills \(S5\), proven to benefit lifelong physical activity and health. 

 <ins>Promoting S</ins><ins>torytelling to Enhance Movement and Language</ins> 

 Research combining FMS development with storytelling activities \(R2\) informed a novel intervention designed to be practically useable by pre\-school teachers, with activities based on the popular children’s book ‘The Gruffalo’. This work was utilised as a template within teachers’ ‘INSET’ training across Warwickshire, leading to the incorporation of child\-specific resistance training and/or combined movement with storytelling in classrooms \(S3\). Schools attest to the ‘sustained impact on the physical education outcomes’ of pupils, improving ‘motor\-development related outcomes’ and the way it has helped ‘provide continuous professional development’ for teachers, improving provision \(S3\). 

 The research was also utilised by HE institutions Dublin City University \(DCU\), Mary Immaculate College \(MIC\), Limerick, and Instituto Universitário da Maia \(ISMAI\), Portugal to inform teacher education programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate level \(S6\). A Senior Lecturer from MIC notes that ‘many student teachers have adopted this practice during the school placement experiences’. At ISMAI and MIC the research was also used to inform wider community\-based programmes: for example, the findings of R2 were ‘central to changes’ in ISMAI’s ‘PETIZ’ community gymnastics programme, which ‘enhanced’ the experiences of participants, helping babies and toddlers ‘to move more effectively’ \(S6\). 

 <ins>Informing</ins> <ins>UK Government Policy</ins> 

 In 2015 the UK Government gave Sport England a new remit to support children aged 5\-14 years. SE commissioned Duncan and Eyre \(R1, R2\) to undertake a review \(completed in March 2017\) to inform the body’s response to this, and provide knowledge on childhood development. This led SE to integrate FMS into their approach. As a result from 2017 new questions related to physical literacy were included within the annual ‘Active Lives’ survey, a cross\-government decision\-making tool collecting data from 96% of English school children in years 1\-11 \(S7\). Guided by Duncan and Eyre, SE now measures the data received against key performance indicators relating to positive attitudes towards sport, physical literacy, and being active, informing the way SE assesses children’s physical development for the Government \(S7, S8 S9\). 

 <ins>Informing Commercial Development</ins> 

 In 2017 Jupiter Play, a UK\-based SME producing play equipment for children in public spaces, used Duncan’s work to adjust their strategy and ‘explicitly embed the development of FMS in the design of spaces for local communities across the UK’ \(S10\). Jupiter used the research to demonstrate FMS benefits of their product range to customers in an online campaign during the first COVID\-19 UK lockdown period \(March \- June 2020\). It ‘informed the advice, design and products supplied by Jupiter Play’ at residential sites Houlton, Rugby and Alconbury Weald, Huntingdonshire, marking the beginning of Duncan’s collaboration with largescale development company Urban&Civic plc \(S10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our research developing and evidencing arts\-based interventions has impacted on: 

-  **Practice**: Large, established UK charities \(British Lung Foundation, Aesop, Live Music Now\) now deliver arts\-based activities into community care services, improving older people’s wellbeing. Singing groups have been established, helping those suffering respiratory and neurological disorders. Interventions using dance are being used to reduce falls and improve well\-being in older adults. 

-  **Policy:** The research on singing groups informed the development of the NICE Guidelines \- Older people: Independence and Mental Wellbeing \(NG32\). The All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) Creative Health Report 2017 used our research to inform their national\-level policy development, including arts\-based interventions in Social Prescribing policy. 

-  **End\-users**: Our research has reached and enriched the lives of 30,000\+ people with neurological conditions, mental health issues and respiratory illnesses. A new charity and community\-interest company were established directly from our research and are delivering services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Through 22 studies, involving 2,255 participants, our research programmes have demonstrated the effectiveness of participatory, arts\-based interventions in improving the quality of life, physical and mental health, and well\-being for various groups. These include older people, adults with enduring mental health problems, children, people with learning disabilities, adults with dementia, and adults suffering severe respiratory and neurological conditions. This work has been extended and replicated in international studies, including in Italy, Australia, Korea, Canada and Hong Kong. 

 We undertook the first randomised controlled trial \[ **3.1**\] on the value of regular professionally\-directed group singing to improve the mental health and quality of life for older people \(65\+\) living independently.  Singing group participants had significantly reduced anxiety and improved quality of life \(p<0.01, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and SF12\).  Economic evaluation showed significantly improved Quality Adjusted Life Years \(2.3% increase, compared to 0.8% for the control group\) for a minimal additional cost of the intervention \(£315 intervention vs £281 control group, per person for 14 sessions\).  The transferability of the model of ‘English Silver Song Clubs’ and further effectiveness was examined through research carried out in other countries, e.g. Italy **\[3.2\]**, which replicated reductions in anxiety and depression post intervention. 

 Building on this, we then examined the effectiveness of this intervention within the adult mental health population, using validated questionnaires to assess mental health and wellbeing \(CORE\-10 and Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale\) \( **3.3**\). In this pre\-post study delivering professionally conducted singing groups over six months, significant improvements were found in the psychological well\-being of those with enduring mental health problems \(p<0.001\).  Participants noted benefits of easier breathing, enjoyment, mental health, and social connectedness. 

 Our studies on singing and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in adults and older adults have demonstrated clear benefits for participants’ general social and psychological well\-being. For example, in a qualitative study focussing on the participant perspective, participants reported improvements in respiratory symptoms and psychological well\-being, e.g. “ *I can practise that breathing and just calm myself down and it's amazing that…And I think in singing I've learnt without even realising it how to control my breathing.”* **\(3.4\).** 

 Extending the research programme further to neurological disorders and again widening the reach to international cohorts, further studies investigated the therapeutic impact of creative arts interventions on Parkinson’s disease. We collaborated in the first international study on singing groups for people with this condition in Australia, England and South Korea **\(3.6\)**. Cross\-culturally, impacts were similar with significant improvements in participants’ social support \( *p<0.02*\) and reductions in stigma \( *p<0.01*\), anxiety \(p<0.05\) and stress \(p<0.05\). 

 We have also extended the reach of our creative arts in health and well\-being research by investigating dance as a therapeutic intervention to prevent falls in the older adult population.  With the charity Arts Enterprises with a Social Purpose \(AESOP\), in a mixed methods evaluation design we investigated health and social outcomes for dance programme participants **\(3.5\)**.  Poor coordination can be associated with falls.  Using validated questionnaires, interviews and focus groups, our findings pre\- and post\-intervention showed the intervention improved coordination \( *p=0.028*\), and had wider psychosocial outcomes in relation to enhanced sense of social belonging \( *p=0.005*\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Integrating creative arts interventions into practice** 

 Our research has demonstrated the wide benefits of using singing groups in practice for those with respiratory conditions.  This has increased support for, and delivery of, new, effective services through a range of organisations. For example, the British Lung Foundation \(BFL\), using our research as the evidence\-base, launched the UK\-wide ‘Singing for Lung Health’ initiative. They established 107 singing groups and provided each with seed funding for 12 weeks, which benefitted an estimated 1,300 people. BFL monitoring showed participants ‘ *more effectively managing their lung conditions, bringing positive feelings of hope and self\-belief, along with the benefits of social support and networking*.’ This initiative was further sustained by adopting ‘ *a provider\-led approach by successfully partnering with local providers such as the NHS trusts, singing or charitable organisations* **\[5.1\]**. In addition, five ‘Singing for Breathing’ groups, targeting adults with COPD, were established in the South\-East, benefiting over 250 people annually since 2013. The NHS Research Lead attached to one group described the impact of the psychosocial outcomes as ‘ *overwhelmingly good*’ and that Medway Community Healthcare are now considering introducing singing groups within their care pathway for their COPD patients **\[5.2\]**. These groups have been largely self\-sustaining due to the benefits perceived by the participants, using trained volunteers to lead the groups, so enabling a cost\-effective, successful and sustainable intervention. 

  

 Focussing on older people and those with dementia, our research demonstrates the therapeutic benefits of singing groups and has had excellent community take\-up, becoming integrated in practice and service development. For example, the charity Sing for Your Life used our RCT **\[3.1\]** to leverage funding to develop the resources to progressively grow a network of over 40 ‘Silver Song Clubs’ for older people living in the community across the UK and Canada. The associated Silver Song Music Box programme for older people in residential care in the UK has reached an estimated 5,250 older people who can now sing every day without external support. Importantly, during lockdowns resulting from the Covid\-19 pandemic, the CEO of Sing for Your Life reported an increase in orders for the Music Box, as one of the few accessible, effective and enjoyable interventions which could be delivered **\[5.3\]**. 

 Another leading UK charity, ‘Live Music Now’ \(LMN\) used our research to justify a large\-scale national initiative and then worked in partnership with us to develop the required resources. The LMN ‘Choir in Every Care Home’ initiative was launched in 2015, and involved 35 national care and music organisations working collaboratively. The free resources have been accessed by over 19,000 people at care homes and elsewhere throughout the UK. Additionally, the significance of this intervention was mentioned by the CEO of LMN specifically in relation to mitigating the impact of Covid\-19 and lockdown in care homes **\[5.4\]**.  The CEO, Care Quality Commission, endorsed this work as benefiting care home standards in 2017: *“Creativity and innovation are key ingredients in outstanding care homes, and regular singing and live music activities can help care homes positively address all five key questions our inspectors ask of care homes.’* **\[5.5\].** 

 Additional impact of our research includes the establishment of the Canterbury Cantata Trust \(CCT\) charity which runs the ‘Sing to Beat’ Parkinson’s programme. This has 30 established singing groups, reaching over 450 people with Parkinson’s, their carers and family members nationally **\[5.6\].** CCT has also used the research to develop training for professional musicians \(n=132\) to run these groups, supporting their sustainability. CCT has also partnered with our SDH Centre team to use the COPD research to support singing groups in East Kent, serving over 300 participants. 

 The research on using dance to reduce falls has had major impact by providing evidence for the collaboration with AESOP to launch the ‘Dance to Health’ programme. This led to a £2.1 million investment in the national phase 1 roll\-out, involving 1,363 participants and 822 volunteers **\[5.7\]**. Independent evaluation of this programme showed a reduction in falls by 58%, leading to significant NHS cost savings **\[5.8\]**. Phase 2 has already been commissioned for 2020\-2025, aiming to create an additional 500 groups. 

 **Changing policy to include art\-based interventions** 

 Our research has resulted in some significant policy developments, embedding these interventions in practice guidance. The RCT \[ **3.1**\] is cited in the 2015 NICE Guidelines NG32 \[ **5.9** section 1.2.1\] and 2016 NICE Quality Standard QS137 \[ **5.10**\] to support service development that incorporates singing as cost\-effective good practice for group\-based activities to reduce social isolation and improve well\-being for older people. In the NICE guidelines, singing is singled out as the only arts\-based intervention with ‘ *high\-quality cost\-effectiveness evidence available*’ relating to **3.1** \[ **5.9**, p26\]. 

 The All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) *Creative Health* report cites 17 publications from the team as evidence of effective arts\-based interventions, in relation to the research on both dance and group singing. It highlights the Silver Song Clubs as a case study \[ **5.11** sections, 8.6.5 & 8.6.6\] and notes the Care Quality Commission endorsement of ‘A Choir in Every Home’ to which our research contributed \[ **5.5**\].  Impacts include embedding the delivery of evidence\-based interventions within NHS, Local Authority commissioning and delivery strategies, and inclusion in health and care professionals training and a cross\-governmental strategy to support delivery of health and well\-being through arts and culture.  The National Academy for Social Prescribing has released £1.8 million to support community projects including singing projects using our evidenced approach to manage COPD and enhance respiratory health, and using dance to prevent falls **\[5.12\].** 

 **Improving health and quality of life for end\-users, their families and carers.** 

 From the known evidence, the impact of our research has reached over 30,000 people in the UK to date, and recipients in Europe, Australia, North America and Asia. This reach is likely to be much higher as the singing and dance groups are often self\-sustaining, and large charities such as LMN and AESOP continue to support and develop their programmes. Importantly, service managers pointed to the benefits of these new interventions being deliverable during the Covid\-19 pandemic and hence, having added value to the end\-users **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. 

 An important impact has been to make these evidence\-based and cost\-effective interventions accessible to more people. As a result, a Community Interest Company – Music4Wellbeing, and a new charity, the Canterbury Cantata Trust, were established to deliver these interventions.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Physical inactivity is a global risk factor for noncommunicable disease, which damages individual physical and mental health and generates a significant economic cost in both medical care and lost productivity. University of Bristol research has standardised and expanded the evidence available to inform physical activity guidelines and developed novel infographic dissemination methods to improve professional awareness and implementation. These data and outputs have been used by national and international governments, policy makers and health organisations to update and create new guidance for previously underrepresented groups. Infographic dissemination methods have changed health practitioner knowledge to support patients’ changes in physical activity behaviour and are embedded in the UK’s and WHO’s Global Physical Activity Action Plan and new Global Physical Activity guidelines. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Physical activity guidelines are the rubric for setting population levels of physical activity for optimum physical and mental health and provide benchmarks for national surveillance. The 2011 UK Chief Medical Officers’ \(CMOs\) physical activity guidelines highlighted a lack of evidence on the health implications of sedentary behaviour, along with an absence of large scale, objective, time\-stamped measurement techniques in population surveillance and the monitoring of trends over time. One priority identified by the CMOs was standardised data cleaning, reduction and analysis procedures for objective device\-derived data. University of Bristol \(UoB\) researchers have established the world’s largest body of research on methods to develop and disseminate physical activity guidelines. They developed standard methods for harmonising data from over 37,000 young people aged 3 to 18 years across studies from Europe, the US, Brazil and Australia. 

 Work conducted by Cooper using the International Children’s Accelerometer Database \(ICAD\) database \[1\], and Jago in the B\-Proact1V cohort \[2,3\], changed the landscape on understanding how children were active by shifting away from reliance on self\-reported data to objectively assessed children’s physical activity and sedentary behaviour \(SB\). This was a significant contribution to the study of sedentary behaviours where the relationship between SB and health outcomes was uncertain due to imprecision in the measurement of SB. Work led by Cooper provided key evidence to identify the links between objectively assessed sedentary behaviour and both child and adult metabolic health \[1\]. 

 In 2017, an evidence review carried out in collaboration with Public Health England \(PHE\) reported that over 6.3 million adults aged 40 to 60 do not achieve 10 minutes of continuous brisk walking over the course of a month and are missing out on important health benefits \[4\]. For currently inactive individuals, the review suggested that 10 minutes of brisk walking per day could ease performance of everyday physical activities, improve mood and quality of life, as well as reduce risk of early death by 15%. The review also produced novel evidence\-based guidelines for the promotion of 10\-minute bouts of brisk walking as the focus \[4\]. 

 The 2011 guidelines identified that dissemination of national physical activity guidelines to priority groups was critical but that no established methods existed. A novel method was developed by Foster to review and integrate different types of research evidence \(systematic reviews of RCTs, prospective cohort studies, qualitative studies, grey literature, web\-based resources\) into infographics and evaluate their utility with panels of health professionals and the public using co\-production techniques \[5\]. This was the first time the use of infographics to disseminate evidence\-based physical activity guidelines to health professionals had been attempted. To construct the new physical activity guidelines for disabled adults, the UoB team worked alongside University of Birmingham colleagues with over 350 disabled adults, ten disability organisations and 50 health professionals \(HPs\) to test how the recommendations could be presented and co\-produce a resource. The result was the first infographic co\-produced with disabled adults to communicate evidence\-based physical activity recommendations for a range of experiences of disability \[5\]. 

 Following the development of the physical activity infographics \[5\], the UK CMOs commissioned UoB to lead the updating and revision of the UK physical activity guidelines. Foster was the overall PI for this process, supervising the construction of evidence\-based guidelines and reporting on academic output from ten Expert Working Groups \(EWGs\), made up of a collaboration of over 90 UK academics, policy makers and practitioners. Jago was the Chair of the Children & Young People’s EWG, and Cooper was the Chair of the Sedentary Behaviour Group, with Foster also chairing the Pregnancy, Post\-Partum, Muscle, Bone and Balance Health Expert Working Groups. Sebire and Armstrong led work packages for Children & Young People and Muscle, Bone and Balance Health respectively. 

 The UoB team also identified the need for physical activity guidelines for three key underrepresented population groups that had not been included in the past: women pre\- and post\-partum, and adults with disabilities. UoB led evidence reviews to create new guidelines for pre\- and post\-partum \(Foster\) and children \(Jago\). The updated guidelines, published in September 2019 \[6\], are now relevant to over 67.6 million UK children and adults, by providing evidence\-based physical activity guidelines from preconception to older years, \(PI \-Foster\). It provides a benchmark for the surveillance of population interventions and first contact in their clinical management.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Globally, one in four adults and three in four adolescents do not currently meet the global recommendations for physical activity set by the World Health Organisation \(WHO\). In 2013, the global cost of physical inactivity was estimated to be INT$54 billion per year in direct health care. Physical activity guidelines act as a gold standard for assessing behaviour in clinical interventions and setting targets for chronic disease management, set effectiveness levels of programmes and research interventions, and offer the public a behavioural benchmark. UoB evidence reviews, infographics and production of the UK CMO Physical activity guidelines has created new guidelines for underrepresented population groups and improved UK and global policy dissemination and practice knowledge. Foster was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s 2019 New Year Honours list, in recognition of his work to promote physical activity. 

#  Improved UK health policy dissemination and practitioner knowledge 

 The 2019 update of the UK CMO physical activity guidelines, led by Foster \(outlined in Section 2\), generated a revised and extended national health policy guidance document \[6\]. This included a suit of six infographics \[Aiii\], developed by UoB research and methods \[e.g. 4, 5\], presenting recommended levels of physical activity across all groups. *“The guidelines underpin the Government’s policy on physical activity and are the official source of UK physical activity information. The \[Bristol\] team has provided a critical role to support the construction of evidence, evidence\-based guidelines and policy.”* \[Ai\]. In a personal note, the CMO England said, *“Without you none of this would happen. Thank you from me and also from the Nation for your hard work”* \[Aii\] *.* 

 Since their release these guidelines have been downloaded over 100,000 times \[Ai\], and have been disseminated via UK CMOs to Royal Colleges, NHS Trusts and Care Agencies \(potentially reaching 1.4 million NHS workers and 1.6 million social care workers\), offering a summary of the correct information about physical activity to use in their daily practice. A Senior Policy Manager for the Department of Health and Social care reported that *“Since 2015 each new infographic has been year on year the most downloaded resource from the Gov.uk website”* \[Ai\]. New WHO Physical activity Action Plan and Global PA guidelines have included infographics as mechanism for dissemination \[Fii, Action 1.1\]. 

 Heath practitioner understanding was assessed by PHE, who reported in their evaluation survey \(2018\) that the knowledge of UK health professionals of current physical activity guidelines had increased from 15% to 77% in 2018. The report stated *‘the majority \(77%\) of respondents believe they have good awareness of UK physical activity guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer, reflecting the substantial efforts that have been made to publicise the latter over the last four years’* \[B\]. 

 The update to the UK physical activity guidelines has also prompted the construction of a new \(November 2020\) CMO Expert Committee for Surveillance, co\-chaired by Foster, that will review the current surveillance measures of physical activity across the UK. 

#  New guidance for unrepresented population groups 

 The 2019 update to physical activity guidance \[6\] also identified the need for physical activity guidelines for i\) women pre\- and post\-partum and ii\) adults with disabilities. The pregnancy infographic \[Aiii\] was developed and tested with panels of health professionals and pregnant women before consultation with more than 250 UK\-based doctors and midwives. In the UK this is relevant to over 650,000 women annually during and after their pregnancies, a time when women’s physical activity levels decline. This development has led to changes in pregnancy services within CCG areas – for example, in Oxfordshire all pregnant women now have their physical activity assessed at booking in clinics for the first time and have the CMO infographic discussed by their midwife or doctor \[C\]. 

 The UK disabled adult community of over 11 million people with a limiting long\-term illness, impairment or disability was also a new constituency for physical activity guidelines. The assessment of physical activity using the new guidelines, is now an integrated part of the revised Care Needs Assessment protocol \[Ei\] and supported by Sport England and Disability Rights UK’s pilot programme “Get Yourself Active” \[Eii\]. This new programme connects adults with their social workers and local activity coordinators to offer opportunities for activity. It has also been approved by PHE and endorsed by the four UK CMOs. An independent evaluation found that *“The proportion of respondents who undertook physical activity at least once a week or more increased from 28% at the start of the programme, to 68% six months into the programme.”* \[Eii\]. 

#  A novel approach to increase physical activity 

 The UoB\-led evidence briefing \[4\] was used by PHE as the foundation for creating their Active10 national walking campaign targeting low socioeconomic status \(SES\) adults \[Di\]. Our work \[4\] produced evidence\-based guidelines for the promotion of 10\-minute bouts of brisk walking as the focus and connected our work with the production of the 2019 UK CMO physical activity guidelines \[6\], where 10\-minute walks were used as a key example of starting activity. The Active 10 campaign achieved around 500,000 downloads of the mobile phone app, with evaluation suggesting increases in brand and app awareness, and those taking action \[Dii\]. 

#  Improving international public health policy dissemination 

 Jago was appointed to the WHO Global Physical Activity Guidelines Expert Group to update the WHO’s physical activity guidelines, published in November 2020 \[Fi\]. In response to the development of UK infographics, the dissemination of physical activity guidelines using infographics and targeted campaigns were recommended among 20 national actions by the WHO Global Physical Activity Action Plan 2018 \[Fii, Action 1.1\]. The updated 2020 guidelines built on the existing UK physical activity guidelines, developed by Jago, and include disabled adults for the first time \[Fi, Action 1.4 & 3.5\]. The WHO Secretariat has undertaken to disseminate physical activity recommendations for children, young people, adults, pregnant women and people living with disabilities, mirroring the UK \[Fi, p87\]. The new 2020 Guidelines \[Fi\] include infographics for all these groups and advises countries to use infographics and tailor their guidance to specific population groups. *‘Providing information on the national guidelines in a variety of formats is also useful. For example, a relatively new but increasingly common approach to communicating physical activity guidelines is through the use of infographics’* \[Fi\]. 

 UoB development of infographics using new methods \[4, 5\] has also stimulated other nations to adopt similar methods for co\-creation. The Canadian Physical Activity Under 5’s guidelines followed the testing and co\-creation phase piloted by UoB to produce a single page infographic to present their 2017 guidelines \[H\]. The role of infographics as part of dissemination pathways and models of communication of physical activity guidelines to health professionals and beyond has also been replicated by other international Public Health agencies including in the USA \[Ii\], and New Zealand for maternity care \[Iii\]. Our disability infographic \[5\] has been directly adopted by the national governments of South Korea \[Ji\], Finland \[Jii\] and Spain \[Jiii\]. 

 UoB research has also contributed directly to the development of the national physical activity guidelines and plans of several countries. For example, our research was cited in the recent USA 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report \[Gi\] and 2017 National Physical Activity Recommendations for Adults and Older Adults in Germany \[Gii\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers in creative writing at Leeds Trinity University have used their national and international experience to help aspiring writers find their voices and express themselves, both for personal development and for publication. As a result, beneficiaries have entered into careers in writing, editing, or tutoring, produced prizewinning work and become best\-selling writers. The researchers have done this by drawing together young writers, aspiring authors, and experienced practitioners in public engagement events on campus and in the community, and by taking their expertise to schools, festivals, community centres and writing retreats locally, nationally, and internationally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Bedford’s novels for teenage and young adult readers have had national and international acclaim. *Flip* \(2011\), his first novel in the genre, was shortlisted for the national Costa Book Awards and won four regional prizes in the UK. His second and third, *Never Ending* \(2014\) and *Twenty Questions for Gloria* \(2016\), were both nominated for the CILIP Carnegie Medal. *Twenty Questions for Gloria* was also selected for The Guardian’s Best New Children’s Books Guide for 2016, won the 13\+ category in the Coventry Inspiration Book Awards. Its popularity with readers is evidenced by the fact that it was a top\-three YA download on lovereading4kids. 

 Bedford has published many short stories and his first solo collection; *Letters Home* was published in 2017. The title story, first published in 2006, was made into a short film that premiered at the 2009 Version Film Festival, at the Cornerhouse, in Manchester. His short stories include specially commissioned pieces that are part of his outreach to the community: for example, two ‘ *Room Zero*’ \(2015\) and ‘ *A Capsule of Time*’ \(2013\), were written for Malvern College, Worcestershire, and Wellington College, Berkshire, to celebrate World Book Day and were published on the schools' intranets. 

 Hardwick is recognised nationally and internationally as ‘a major proponent of the neo\-surreal prose poem in Britain’ \(Paul Hetherington and Cassandra Atherton, *Prose Poetry: An Introduction* \(Princeton University Press, 2020\), p. 125\). His collection *Learning to Have Lost* won the 2019 Rubery International Book Award for Poetry. The Lithium Codex was shortlisted for the same award, and his individual poems have won national and international awards and prizes. 

 Hardwick’s prose poetry, most notably in *The Lithium Codex* employs the still\-contested form to explore issues such as loss and mental illness in a manner which is both unflinching and at the same time ‘life\-affirming’ \( *HQ*\). The combination of candour and poetic rigour which informs his work has impacted on diverse communities within and outside of the academy. 

 Hardwick has published five full poetry collections and four chapbooks, along with several collaborative works in diverse media, including print, film, music, and performance. He has been invited to and attended national and international events and symposia including the Art and Soul Conference at the University of Winchester and the Prose Poetry Research Group at the International Poetry Studies Institute \(IPSI\), University of Canberra. Hardwick has edited several anthologies, including \(with Miles Salter\) *The Valley Press Anthology of Yorkshire Poetry* \(Valley Press, 2017\), which was a 2017 National Poetry Day Recommendation, and \(with Anne Caldwell\) *The Valley Press Anthology of Prose Poetry* \(Valley Press, 2019\), both of which featured new writers alongside poets of international standing. 

 Alyal’s collaborative book with Hardwick, *Close as Second Skins* \(Indigo Dreams, 2015\) was shortlisted for the AHRC\-funded 2015 Saboteur Award for Best Collaborative Work. She has published two solo volumes of poetry, *The Ordinariness of Parrots* \(Stairwell, 2015\) and *Season of Myths* \(Wordspace/Indigo Dreams, 2016\), as well as collaborative work in print, performance, and film, and articles and book chapters on myth, poetics, and creative practice. Her interest in world mythology and poetry has not only informed her own collections and numerous individual poems in journals and anthologies, but also provided impetus for workshops. This, in turn, has led to her editorship of several anthologies which showcase both emerging and established poets.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Researchers in Creative Writing at LTU have collaboratively had an impact on aspiring writers by creating a lively and supportive writing culture that began locally but now has national and international reach, plus a vibrant online presence. The flagship public engagement event at LTU has been the annual Writers’ Festival. Seed funded by the Royal Literary Fund in 2005, the now self\-supporting event draws around 200 writers at all levels of experience, both from the local community and around the UK, as well as from the university, for a day of workshops with professional writers in various genres. Claire Wigzell, whose journey towards being a published poet began at the Writer’s Festival writes that **‘I found the positive and friendly atmosphere, the deep respect for people and the striving for high quality writing meant that I achieved a great deal’** \(Wigzell1\). Work that Wigzell has produced through mentorship from the researchers includes commissions from Leeds City Council for civil engagement performances at Kirkstall Abbey and Leeds Art Gallery. 

 The researchers have also had an impact on aspiring writers through the Wordspace off\-campus open mic night which has run monthly since being founded in tandem with the Writers’ Festival 2015. Wordspace has created a community which welcomes, promotes, and supports new writers alongside guest performers of national, sometimes international, standing. Actively promoting equality and inclusivity, Wordspace has acquired a reputation as a safe space for aspiring writers and comperes. Gill Lambert, now a published poet and workshop leader writes that **‘I built up my confidence in the safe environment that Wordspace created.’** \(Lambert1.pdf\) Joe Williams found the **‘welcoming and inclusive space’** the chance to hear and meet writers **‘from many different backgrounds** was ‘ **invaluable to me in developing my own writing**’ \(Williams1.pdf\). The Wordspace ethos has successfully been transferred online, with regular attendance of around 20\-30, <ins>drawn from the UK \(York, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield,</ins> <ins>Hertford</ins> <ins>and Devon\), USA, Canada, Palestine, and Sri Lanka</ins>. Wordspace has nurtured a number of award\-winning writers, including Mark Connors, Maria Frankland, Hannah Stone, and J.A. Browne, author of the children’s books series *The Earth Chronicles,* as well as Williams, Lambert and Wigzell. 

 In partnership with Indigo Dreams Publishing, the researchers founded the Wordspace imprint in 2015 to showcase new writing from this vibrant community in anthologies and single\-author volumes. The nine volumes published to date include LMA Bauman\-Milner’s debut collection of short stories, *Dark Doors* \(2015\), which was shortlisted for a Saboteur Award. 

 These initiatives have also had the impact of supporting writers to become professional writing tutors. It has been a policy at the Writers’ Festivals to grow workshop leaders by appointing new leaders like Frankland, Lambert and Browne alongside established practitioners. Browne writes that **‘I learnt a great deal about teaching creative writing, the content and logistics, and addressing larger audiences’** \(Browne1.pdf\). As a ripple effect of this activity, Lambert and Connors co\-founded Yaffle Press \(Keithley\) in 2019, and Frankland has set up her own company as a writer and tutor. She writes: **‘My company is earning me a full time living, something I have always dreamed of. I thank Trinity in each and every book I publish.’** \(Frankland1.pdf\) 

 Hardwick has had international impact by leading workshops drawing on his research, with a particular emphasis on the distinctions and connections between poetry and prose, in <ins>Australia \(Poetry on the Move\), Germany</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>\(Writers Ink\), Italy \(Poetry on the Lake\),</ins> <ins>as well as</ins> <ins>nationally \(Art and Soul, Winchester\) and</ins> <ins>regionally \(</ins><ins>Hive Young Writers Sheffield\)</ins><ins>.</ins> Many new writers have published work which was stimulated by – or developed in – these workshops. Australian poet Lucy Alexander author of *Strokes of Light* \(Recent Works Press, 2020\) wrote: ‘ **I came home with ideas fluttering around my head like Ravens.’** \(Alexander1.pdf\) Respected Australian writers  [Eugen Bacon and Dominique Hecq](https://leedstrinity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/e_brook_leedstrinity_ac_uk/Documents/REF2021/UoA27English/Impact/(https:/paulsemel.com/exclusive-interview-speculate-authors-eugen-bacon-dominique-hecq/).) acknowledge his influence. Listing Hardwick alongside Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and Margaret Atwood, Hecq says: **‘Most recently I’ve discovered the work of Oz Hardwick after taking a master class with him at a poetry festival. He taught me the simple art of defamiliarization.’** Hardwick’s association with the Prose Poetry Project at the International Poetry Studies Institute \(IPSI\), University of Canberra has resulted in creative publications in collaboration with Recent Works Press, Australia. Hardwick’s support of writers beyond the curriculum has twice been nominated for a Festival of Learning Tutor Award which ‘recognises inspirational tutors or trainers who have supported learners, in a range of contexts, to go on to lead successful and rewarding lives.’ He has been granted honorary membership of Writers Ink, with the citation that **‘Oz has never ceased to inspire and encourage others with his writing’, he is ‘an outstanding instructor.’** \(WritersInk1\) 

 Alyal has particular impact on women writers, for example as invited speaker and workshop leader for a day at the Ilkley Literature Festival 2018, ‘Acting Out: Women’s Voices and the Spoken Word’. Since lockdown, she has been working with writing tutor Judi Sissons of The Writing Space, leading workshops and editing a collection of participants’ work: *Words from a Distance* \(currently under consideration with Stairwell Books\). Sissons described Alyal’s impact as **‘encouraging the women to have confidence in their writing and share it with a wider audience … providing mutual support for women’s wellbeing and creativity.’** \(sissons1.pdf\) 

 Bedford has had an impact on young people by engaging them with creative writing \(2,500\-3,000 secondary school students over author visits to 40\+ secondary schools across England\):  [feedback on a talk to Year 7 students at Crossley Heath School](https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/martyn-bedford/work/teaching), Halifax, stated that **""I have heard from several students who are now thinking about being authors\!""** Bedford has tutored adults at Residential Writing Courses including Moniack Mhor \(Scotland\), the Arvon Foundation \(Lumb Bank\), and The Hurst \(Shropshire\) and Art of Writing \(Italy\). Since 2019, he has acted as a mentor with The Writers’ Studio, a scheme that offers a range of one\-to\-one support packages to aspiring writers, which particularly encourages writers from communities that are underrepresented in British publishing. Among the writers who have achieved success after mentoring from Bedford is novelist Linda Green: **‘It was after rewriting based on Martyn’s advice that I was taken on by an agent and got my 1st book deal. If you’re serious about your writing,**  [**I highly recommend him.'**](https://twitter.com/emmacsweeney/status/1232972193895735296) Green has now published 10 novels, which have sold more than one million copies and been translated into 12 languages. 

 In their collaboration on the Writers’ Festival and Wordspace, Alyal, Bedford and Hardwick ensure that the expertise developed in individual outreach is brought to bear on the local, national, and international creative writing community fostered by LTU.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Doubts about the financial and ethical probity of politicians are a familiar feature of historical and contemporary public discourse. Philp and Knights have worked in collaboration and individually on the history and political theory relating to understandings of public office and its corruption.  Their research findings have: 

1.  influenced the UK’s Committee on Standards in Public Life \(CSPL\)’s identification of standards and interpretation of principles in relation to particular roles within government and the administration, and in relation to wider concerns about misconduct, intimidation and public trust, and have underpinned recommendations for best practice and regulatory reform 

1.  informed UK and EU policy makers and NGOs about the lessons from history regarding the path\-dependence of constructions of public office and corruption 

1.  influenced policy and practice in the EU and Kenya in relation to public office and corruption. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Through joint workshops, joint research projects and networks, and extensive discussion of each other’s work since 2013, Philp and Knights developed and tested their insight that public office and its ethos and structure have evolved historically in different ways in different contexts and in relation to different dimensions of government activity \(e.g. politics, the administration, the judiciary\). They have explored the implications of this insight for policy concerning conceptions of institutional probity in different contexts. As a result, they have framed their contributions to government policies on malfeasance and corruption in ways that are sensitive to local understandings. 

 Their work emphases three key themes: 

 1\) **The importance of context.** Their stress here is on how the evolution of standards of public office and its corruption responds to historical pressures that vary across different national contexts. Philp’s research is rooted in political realism \(3.2\) in relation to the definition and understanding of office and corruption \(3.1; 3.3\). His work highlights contextualised ethics \(as opposed to morality\) of office, the conflict of values and the limits of impartiality. Knights’ research on Britain \(and its empire\) in the pre\-modern era shows that anti\-corruption strategies from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries were the product of unique contextual factors. He demonstrates that time and will are needed to change political, social, religious, legal and economic cultures, challenging the ‘big bang’ account of transformative political change. For both, standards of office are part of a larger story about state formation and the local contexts that shape cultural values and governance frameworks and create path\-dependencies that can assist or inhibit reforms. This joint stress on context informed an AHRC GCRF Highlight Notice grant \(led by Philp 2016\-18\) comparing the histories of public office in Kenya, Mexico and the UK. 

 2\) **Accountability**. Philp’s research has distinguished different types of accountability and emphasised its tensions with political agency. He has encouraged more careful differentiation between administrative and political office \(2014, 5.1\), emphasising the latter’s distinctive demands and the British public’s often poor understanding of these. This insight contributes to more tailored and measured interpretations of the principles governing of public life in British politics and public administration. Knights emphases the importance of the idea of trust in holding officers to account and in the evolution of accountability mechanisms \(3.6\). His work uses case studies to explore the mindsets of those in major public offices, the challenges of holding officers to account, the shifting and contested boundaries between licit and illicit behaviour, and the varied nature of the debates in wider society that affect how officers behave \(3.4; 3.5\). 

 3\) **Alignment**. Both researchers stress the importance, and the difficulties, of aligning practices in the political system with the expectations of a wider public, to enable intelligent forms of accountability and enhance trust \(3.3\). Philp’s work on realism and political conduct has guided his advisory work with the Committee of Standards in Public Life. Knights’ historical research into differences between political, administrative, colonial and corporate office shows that Britain developed very distinctive conceptions of public office and its responsibilities, thereby underlining its limitations as a model for other cultures \(3.4; 3.5; 3.6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Knights’ and Philp’s work has achieved three forms of impact: influencing the UK government and its ethical framework; influencing European approaches to corruption; and influencing public understanding of corruption and the demands of public office. 

###  Influencing UK Government Policies 

 Philp’s research has informed public standards debates through his long\-term relationship \(since 2001\) with the Committee on Standards in Public Life \(CSPL\). The CSPL is an advisory non\-departmental public body, sponsored by the Cabinet Office. The Committee advises the Prime Minister on ethical standards across the whole of public life in England, monitoring and reporting on issues relating to the standards of conduct of all public office holders. Philp chairs its Research Advisory Board, plays a key part in the drafting of papers and submissions of evidence, and attends its monthly meetings. 

 Philp’s contributions to the CSPL’s July 2014 *Ethics in Practice* report, for instance, led the Committee to commission his ‘Public Ethics and Political Judgment’ paper, to address whether normal workplace solutions to standards issues such as induction should apply to politicians. In the preface to the paper Lord Bew, then Chair of the CSPL, stated that Philp’s work helped them understand that existing principles ‘remain central in the challenge to raise ethical standards in the twenty first century’ \(5.1\). The CSPL now stresses the importance of induction in informing public office holders of ethical standards and induction is now offered to all new MPs. Lord Bew summarised Philp’s involvement by saying ‘Mark has led in terms of research ideas and outcomes, and offered invaluable advice with regard to policy development with high impact on the Committee’s work and output’ \(5.2\). In a January 2016 meeting between the CSPL and The Commons Standards Committee, Lord Bew specifically praised the influence of Philp’s research into the distinctive challenges of public office. 

 Philp’s research has likewise informed the CSPL’s work on MP’s outside interests \(March 2018\), Intimidation \(Autumn, 2017\), and Artificial Intelligence and Ethics \(May 2019\). Philp also shaped the CSPL review of ‘public private’ partnerships.  Although there was pressure from the corporate sector to waive ‘selflessness’ for firms bidding for government contracts, Philp successfully made the case to the CSPL for seeing this as an appropriate principle for those acting under PPI contracts \(5.2\). 

 In 2017, Philp was appointed as a formal consultant on the report to the Prime Minister on Intimidation in Public Life, for which he wrote briefing papers, acted as commentator in public evidence sessions and responded to multiple drafts. He in particular identified the importance of cross\-party collaboration in tackling intimidation, which was emphasised in the report \(5.3\). Cross\-party meetings were subsequently facilitated by the CSPL \(November 2018, March and May 2019\); the Jo Cox Foundation has also responded to these initiatives. \(5.4\). Describing the report, the Prime Minister stated: ‘Their report makes sobering reading….It presents a credible plan of action to help build a more civil public debate and I welcome its recommendations…the government will act on the Committee’s recommendations’ \(6 February 2018, 5.4\). As a direct result of the report, the Government has committed to legislating to create a new offence of intimidation of candidates \(5.4\). 

 Following the succession of Lord Evans as Chair of the CSPL, Philp contributed extensively to the Committee’s 2020 report on the challenges posed to public standards by new AI technologies \(5.2; 5.3\), while also supporting the secretariat in a range of areas concerning the promotion of public standards, including recommendations regarding harassment and bullying in Parliament. Alongside his ongoing work with the CSPL, Philp has contributed to the Law Commission Inquiry into Misconduct \(to which Knights also made a submission\) and to the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments \(5.5\). 

###  Influence on European governance 

 Knights’ research was presented to the Council of Europe’s Committee on Political Affairs and Democracy, at a meeting in December 2016 chaired by Michele Nicoletti, now the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Nicoletti drew extensively on Knights’ research for a report on corruption, using it as a case study to stress the importance of understanding national contexts. In the report Nicoletti wrote: ‘I will borrow his analysis to show the impact of the building of the modern State on corruption … Professor Knights concluded that we need more academic and policy attention to be paid to the ways in which corruption was, and is embedded in social and cultural values, which change slowly but provide the essential environment in which the institutional reforms take place’ \(5.6\). That report was presented to the European Assembly and led directly to an EU resolution in the European Assembly on promoting integrity in governance \[Resolution 2170, 2017\]. 

 Knights has also influenced other European agencies. For instance, in February 2018 Knights was one of 40 international experts invited to a Strasbourg Round Table on ‘Council of Europe Co\-operation Activities against Economic Crime’. The resultant report detailing policy action points was then included in the EU’s ‘Action Against Corruption: Cooperation Highlights 2018’ \(5.7, p.8\). 

###  Informing understandings of corruption 

 Knights’ work has attracted considerable attention, encouraging a wider societal reflection on corruption and standards in office. His report, and ethical case study, for Transparency International were downloaded 4,611 and 840 times respectively between September 2016 and July 2020 \(5.8\). He has given talks in many public fora, speaking 3 times in the Putney Debates organised by Oxford University’s Law Faculty, which were live\-streamed beyond the physical audience \(videos received 1,338 views, 5.8\); to the Swedish Quality of Government Institute; to publics in Liverpool, Newcastle, London, Coventry; and via popular magazines such as *History Today* \(circulation 18,161\) and *BBC History Magazine* \(circulation 97,550\), as well as via his blog, which relates past corruption scandals to the present \(5.9\). 

 Philp and Knights’ joint AHRC project on ‘Constructions of public office’ in Kenya, Mexico and the UK led to work with Strathmore University in Nairobi drawing in a range of public officials from the Kenyan Public Service and from County Administrations to discuss problems faced. In a subsequent GCRF Accelerator\-Fund project the team developed a suite of resources, including a training system using the 2010 Kenyan Constitution \(which itself draws heavily on the CSPL’s principles\). The project integrated more local and contextual understandings into programmes for training and staff development, so as to enable a more targeted approach to risks of inefficiency, corruption, and malfeasance. The training system was developed through bespoke workshops provided by the team, which successfully helped middle\-rank public officials negotiate the conflicting pressures they experience. One participant from the Auditor General’s Office said he had found the workshops useful in guiding his work ‘by focusing more on the principles of integrity rather than the laws on ethics and integrity in public office per se’ \(5.10\). These workshops drew the attention of the Office of the President and were attended by the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

 GCRF funding to develop training workshops for trainers enabled further work in Kenya, in association with Strathmore, with the results being brought together on the project’s  [website](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/ehrc/events/constructionspublicoffice/). A further follow\-up project to take the methods into the County administrations in Kenya is currently awaiting the resolution of the challenges of Covid\-19.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Dr Eleanor Formby has developed new and broader sociological understandings of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans \(LGBT\+\) lives, challenging prevailing and dominant psychological accounts. Formby’s work has created new spaces for debate around LGBT\+ lives \- at the personal and individual level, within schools, in public policy, and within professional practice. Formby has directly challenged received understanding of LGBT\+ lives amongst policymakers, LGBT\+ civil society organisations, and within LGBT\+ media. Her advisory role to a touring play, ‘The Talk’, demonstrated the use of the arts alongside social science in stimulating debate and reaction. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Formby's work examines LGBT\+ people’s life experiences from a sociological perspective, moving beyond common individualising and psychologising approaches which tend to render LGBT\+ lives as homogenised, and often victimised. Taking issue with the notion that LGBT\+ people can be understood as a singular ‘community’, her research offers a nuanced, yet applied, contribution to the study of LGBT\+ existence. This has contributed understanding in two linked sub\-areas: the experiences of young LGBT\+ people, particularly regarding homophobic, biphobic and transphobic \(HBT\) bullying; and LGBT\+ people’s understandings and experiences of ‘community’. Experiences of inequality and prejudice underscore both, hence research which can help combat this is important. The body of work stems from a range of research led/conducted by Formby over more than a decade. Related publications emanate from varied external research income sources, including AHRC \(research grant, Formby PI, £29,000\), statutory \(three different local authorities and an NHS Foundation Trust\), and voluntary sector organisations seeking to better understand their clients and/or the impact of their work. 

 The first sub\-area of research, published across five peer\-reviewed journal articles \( **R1**\- **R4**, **R6**\), has evidenced young people’s experiences of school, youth work and university settings, based on both self\-completion survey and in\-depth qualitative methods. This identified LGBT\+ people’s poor experiences of school\-based sex and relationships education \(SRE\) \( **R1**, **R6**\), and building on this, has examined LGBT\+ young people’s experiences of SRE within youth work, which can fill gaps left by mainstream schooling contexts \( **R6**\). The research suggests that more inclusive SRE can support the mental health of LGBT\+ young people, tackle sexual health issues, and address concerns about violence and abuse within young people’s sexual encounters and intimate relationships. 

 Addressing young people's negative experiences in and out of school, Formby has identified that the notion of bullying is too limited and narrow when thinking about homophobia, biphobia and transphobia \( **R3**\). This is highlighted by examining experiences beyond bullying, by challenging the perceived inevitability of bullying, and by looking at responses to negative experiences. Formby has linked LGBT\+ invisibility in the curriculum to experiences of homophobia, suggesting that there is more at play than individual experiences of bullying, and that homophobia can be understood as an absence of something \(i.e. inclusion\), as well as an active hostility \( **R2**, **R3**, **R6**\). She has demonstrated that some school responses can appear to ‘abnormalise’ LGBT\+ identities, for instance in referrals to counselling that young LGBT\+ people can interpret as apportioning blame. Importantly, barriers and facilitators to schools and youth services addressing issues about sexuality, homophobia and transphobia have been identified \( **R2**\). 

 Using qualitative research methods, Formby has also examined LGBT\+ perspectives on university, to look at the implications for pastoral care and other service provision on campus \( **R4**\). In doing so, she departs from previous scholarship that has tended to understand LGBT\+ students as ‘vulnerable’ and needing ‘support’, arguing instead that university spaces should be \(re\)framed in a way that moves beyond \(only\) personal or individual ‘care’. Within this, she outlines some of the issues that LGBT\+ students face, regarding curriculum and course content; discrimination, prejudice and bullying; and facilities and service provision on campus. 

 In the second sub\-area of research, stemming from the AHRC\-funded study on understandings and experiences of ‘community’ among LGBT\+ people, Formby identifies a range of concerns about use of the term ‘LGBT community’ \( **R5**\). Based on a mixed methods design, this monograph details, for example: LGBT\+ people’s diversity, and related experiences of prejudice and discrimination from both non\-LGBT\+ people and LGBT\+ people; the importance of ‘safe’ space, such as Pride events and commercial ‘scenes’; contested notions of belonging and ‘imagined’ community; and how all of these issues impact upon LGBT\+ wellbeing. Formby foregrounds the lived experience of LGBT\+ people to offer a wide\-ranging and critical analysis of commonalities and divergences in relation to LGBT\+ identities, emphasising the variety and complexity of contemporary LGBT\+ experience. In doing so, she has stimulated debate about what ‘community’ means, and what it means to be LGBT\+.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The body of work has impacted upon public debate and understanding, on professional practice, and on policy development. 

####  The Arts and Public Debate 

 Formby’s research has informed public discourse on LGBT\+ identities and relationships. For example, drawing on R1, she acted as advisor in the development of a play, ‘The Talk’ \(Highly Commended at the VAULT Festival, London, 2018\), which examined relationships and sex education \(RSE\). Subsequently she was also a Q&A panellist during its English tour \(2018\). The playwright said that Formby aided her understanding of the history of RSE, and the impact of recent policy changes, particularly on LGBT\+ inclusion. The playwright commented: 

 *""100s of people saw the play in cities around England… Eleanor's voice in the production \(and as a panellist\) was a very important one… trainee teachers often left the performance more inclined to want to be trained in RSE and to take an active role in teaching it \[and\] I know… schools are currently teaching more RSE than they were before""* \( **E1**\). 

 An audience member at a 2018 ESRC Festival of Social Science event in Huddersfield commented: 

 *""I went along to 'The Talk' with my 23\-year\-old daughter and we both found it moving. We had one of the best chats about our sex and relationship experiences. I really felt that the play allowed us to discuss things we ordinarily wouldn't have even thought about discussing. Genuinely one of the most touching things I have seen in a LONG time""* \( **E2**, emphasis in the original\). 

 Similarly, dissemination related to **R5** included a public book launch event \(in 2018\) and several public blog posts, the most widely read in The Conversation \(2017, over 51,000 reads by 2020\). This generated a considerable volume of public debate within LGBT\+ media forums and involving LGBT\+ members of the public. This included media coverage in Gay Times, The Gay UK, Gscene, and Pink News, resulting in online Facebook and Twitter interactions. Attitude conducted a poll on the issues raised, leading to further debate amongst readers. Throughout 2018, Pink News cited the research in five different articles about LGBT\+ people, contributing to more nuanced public views about LGBT\+ language use and identities. Significant public engagement has therefore informed social attitudes. 

####  Professional Practice 

 Formby’s research has impacted on professional practice. For instance, CEO of SAYiT \(a Sheffield\-based charity that supports LGBT\+ young people\) explained how **R2** and **R3** impacted on their work: 

 *""\[Formby's\] research has impacted on me professionally and personally in the following ways, \[it has:\]… informed funding bids with local evidence of the need to support young LGBT\+ people; informed the work which we do and the services we provide for LGBT\+ young people… \[and;\] enabled us to provide evidence of the importance of our training and awareness raising in terms of improving the environment in which LGBT\+ young people still experience LGBT\+ phobia… \[Her\] work \[also\] led to us developing work around LGBT\+ domestic abuse. We now run an innovative domestic abuse awareness and support project across the whole of South Yorkshire having secured government funding. \[Formby\] was a catalyst in this process of learning and the development of the project""* \( **E5**\). 

 Public engagement events designed to disseminate research and stimulate discussion have also led to professionals reflecting on their practice. As one audience member explained \(in relation to **R5**\): 

 *""\[The end of project event in 2015\] enhanced my existing knowledge and awareness on aspects of sexuality, current research findings and hearing people's perspectives on impact on their lives… I've shared this with professionals on my training courses and with colleagues within my service. We have looked at our paperwork and practices… and how we can strive to make our services and resources more inclusive""* \( **E2**\). 

 Similarly, Sheffield City Council’s \(Children’s\) Equality Lead commented: *“Eleanor's research has been particularly helpful to us in increasing our awareness of the experiences of LGBT\+ identities, relationships and life experiences in supporting our work as Stonewall Education/CYP Champions, identifying and developing local projects to help ensure equality and inclusion for LGBT\+ young people”* \(Stonewall are a leading UK LGBT charity\) \( **E3**\). 

 Another local authority inclusion lead \(in Kirklees\) reported that she used *“content and thinking”* from one of Formby’s \(2016\) events in her training delivery \( **E3**\). A Sheffield\-based safeguarding advisor also reported improved awareness and understanding, saying they felt *“more able to talk to colleagues about the issues and more able to signpost to services”* \( **E3**\). 

 Other public research dissemination events have generated impact and garnered positive feedback. An academic from the University of Birmingham suggested *""Things have really changed in terms of awareness of LGBT issues in HE… \[R4\] was an important part of that change""* \( **E4**\). Similarly, a consultant working with universities said: 

 *""Really helpful… \[R4\] covers such a broad range of student experience. I’ve used it in workshops for universities… as I find most unis are \(a\) complacent, \(b\) very unaware as to what faces LGBTQ students and staff… I’ve not found anything like it in the UK""* \( **E4**\). 

 A PhD student at Birmingham City University commented: 

 *""The \[2015\] event had a huge impact on me… I changed my personal practices and my work practices, and have briefed colleagues on issues arising from the event… \[It was\] such an inspiring day. It was life affirming and fascinating. It made me see the differences I could make to help LGBTQ\+ students feel better supported in HE""* \( **E4**\). 

####  National and International Policy Engagement 

 Drawing on **R2**\- **R3**, Formby has contributed to various policy debates, nationally and internationally. This has included an invited talk on HBT bullying at the European Parliament \(2014\), feeding into the international guidance on ‘Minimum Standards to Combat Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying’ \( **E9**\), and an invitation to join the international steering group for the LGBTQI European education index project. Similarly, an invitation to meet with MPs \(including then Minister for Women and Equalities\) and senior civil servants at a Westminster 'academic experts' seminar \(2014\) resulted in a Government Equalities Office \(GEO\) published report ‘The Watched Body’ on gender stereotypes \( **E6**\). This body of research \( **R2**\- **R3**\) has also directly informed Government\-funded practice on addressing HBT bullying: it informed the 2014 GEO report about ‘What Works’ in tackling these forms of bullying \( **E6**\), and then in turn the design of their £2 million grants programme to address this issue \(2016\-19\), which was subsequently evaluated by Formby. In a related policy initiative, Formby was invited to be Advisor \(both interviewee and peer\-reviewer\) to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology in the run\-up to Relationships and Sex Education \(RSE\) becoming statutory in England \(from 2020\), resulting in their 2018 Parliamentary research briefing on RSE \( **E6**\). 

 Similar research\-informed advisory work has also resulted in changed practice by Ofsted, ultimately designed to improve the schooling experiences of LGBT\+ youth. As they detailed: 

 *""Eleanor's research and feedback have improved our awareness of issues surrounding LGBT\+ identities in education. This has had a direct impact on fine\-tuning our data collection instruments. Fine\-tuning them was crucial not only because it allowed us to get better data, but also because the topics are quite sensitive""* \( **E7**\). 

 Formby’s input therefore directly influenced the design of Ofsted research \(2019\-20\). Other organisations engaging with the UK government have also used Formby’s research within their advocacy, for instance NUS drew on R4 in their 'LGBT manifesto' leading up to the 2015 general election \( **E8**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A decade of EPSRC\-funded research led by the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) underpinned the development of novel algorithmic methods that significantly accelerated and improved the accuracy of risk calculations for investment banks and design sensitivities in engineering. The full commercialisation of these Automatic Differentiation \(AD\) tools in 2014 by Oxford\-based Numerical Algorithms Group \(NAG\) Ltd has: 

-  Strengthened risk management in derivatives trading for \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\], enabling more informed investment decisions and more efficient regulatory adherence. 

-  Resulted in two leading banks winning Risk Awards for implementation of the tools; one credited the algorithmic techniques for the avoidance of hundreds of millions of pounds in losses during the Covid\-19 pandemic and an increase in trade flows that contributed to a 33% revenue rise. 

-  Optimised aerodynamic performance for a Formula One team and a solar car that completed the World Solar Challenge 2019. 

-  Added new capabilities to a tool used to optimise the design of marine infrastructure.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Society is increasingly reliant on the numerical simulation of complex real\-world phenomena. In many industries it has become important not only to compute the simulation value, but also its sensitivity to the model inputs in a highly accurate and computationally efficient way. Automatic \(also known as Algorithmic\) Differentiation \(AD\) is a set of mathematical techniques for transforming numerical modelling code so that it calculates the numerical sensitivities of the model values as well as the values themselves, and to the same precision. The adjoint \(or reverse\) mode of AD \(AAD\) involves making the program run backwards and recovering all the intermediate numerical values in the process; for some models this mode can compute sensitivities thousands of times faster than finite difference methods. In finance for example, the use of AAD can significantly speed up the calculation of sensitivities of derivatives prices to underlying factors, known as Greeks, i.e. the different dimensions of risk involved in taking an options position. 

 Research at UH’s Centre for Computer Science and Informatics Research \(CCSIR\) in the early 2000s made a significant contribution to advancing the theory underpinning the technology. Led by Christianson, the UH team expanded the basic notions of AD and identified lines of research that could lead to the development of practical tools for optimisation \[ **3.1**\]. Christianson then worked with engineering researchers at Cranfield University to apply AD to race car performance optimisation. They showed that use of an AD software tool to calculate the optimal vehicle controls \(i.e. steer angle and driving/braking torque\) for a simple, one\-turn manoeuvre was more robust and ten times faster than using finite difference methods \[ **3.2**\]. In 2002, CCSIR began a 12\-year collaboration with RWTH Aachen University and Oxford\-based Numerical Algorithms Group \(NAG\), a numerical software and HPC services provider. Funded by four EPSRC grants, the ‘CompAD’ project, led by Christianson, succeeded in developing the world’s first industrial\-strength Fortran compiler with built\-in support for AAD. 

 Under the first grant \[ **G1**\], the research group sought to ease the burden that AD placed upon the user \(at the time, AD tools required intensive, time\-consuming configuration\) by providing new datatypes and creating easy\-to\-use interface routines for extracting the derivatives. Having had the idea to place AD functionality inside a Fortran compiler \[ **G2**\], the group succeeded in integrating AD capabilities into the NAGWare Fortran 95 Compiler and then, for the first time, embedded the ability to generate adjoint code automatically \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. This was adequate for small to medium\-sized problems \(up to a few hundred input variables\). However, the solving of even moderately large problems \(thousands of input variables\) required the systematic use and manual placement of checkpoints in order to manage the trade\-off between storage on the way forward and recomputation on the way back. This was considered limiting and time\-consuming for users without previous experience of AD and represented a barrier to the uptake of numerical methods based upon it. Therefore, the third project \[ **G3**\] automated this process of trading off storage and recomputation in a way that was close to optimal. The AD\-enabled NAG Fortran Compiler was used to generate a discrete adjoint version of a geophysical fluid dynamics numerical model \[ **3.5**\]. Higher order derivatives were generated automatically by feeding back into the compiler parts of its own output during the compilation process \[ **3.6**\]. 

 The final project \[ **G4**\] sought to turn the tool into commercially viable AD software. The team achieved this by extracting the AD functionality from the CompAD compiler and integrating it with the NAGWare Fortran Library, a set of algorithms designed to solve complex mathematical problems quickly and easily. Proof of its efficiency and viability was demonstrated through an application for the German Waterways Board to improve dredging along the River Danube. CompAD was used to predict the flow and profile of sediment. Instead of calculating just a single value at one point in time and space, it allowed a probability distribution of the evolution to be automatically derived. A reliability analysis then ranked uncertainty input parameters.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The CompAD compiler, developed through contiguous EPSRC grants, was fully commercialised by NAG in June 2014 with the release of AD\-native versions of its NAG optimisation library, the world’s largest collection of commercially available numerical and statistical algorithms \[ **5.1**\]. In collaboration with RWTH Aachen and Naumann \(who is also a Visiting Research Fellow at UH\), NAG built on the CompAD research insights to create dco/c\+\+, an AD\-specific software tool for computing sensitivities of C\+\+ codes, and aligned it with its AD\-enabled library. NAG further developed its AD/AAD tools over the impact period, with a focus on optimising its offering for the financial services industry. Major updates that made AD/AAD processes quicker, more efficient and more productive were announced at the 14th WBS Quant Finance Conference in September 2018 and in November 2020 \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **Direct economic impact via NAG’s commercialisation of the CompAD compiler** 

 NAG Ltd is a not\-for\-profit company limited by guarantee, with offices in Oxford \(headquarters\), Manchester, Chicago and Tokyo. The CompAD project allowed NAG to offer the benefits of adjoint AD \(i.e. greater accuracy, efficiency and robustness in computing sensitivities\) to a range of industries, opening up new market opportunities \[ **5.3**, **5.4**\]. Key applications were finance, where rapid computation of sensitivities is used to hedge risk and assess how robust investment portfolios are to market changes; aerodynamics, for example in Formula 1 where adjoint methods allow teams to achieve desired levels of downforce and drag; and oil and gas exploration, where adjoint methods can be used to optimise seismic imaging \[ **5.4**\]. 

 In addition to the licensing of its dco/c\+\+ tool, NAG provides consultancy services to banks to help them use the dco tool to generate adjoint codes. NAG’s decision to develop adjoint versions of its library routines was made in response to banks’ requests; the company runs workshops to support the quant industry in practical implementation. While non\-disclosure agreements limit what can be said, \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] \[ **5.3**\]. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] \[ **5.3**\]. 

 According to NAG’s Chief Commercial Officer, \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] He wrote: ‘Our involvement with the CompAD project was a pivotal experience for us in developing a route to exploit the potential of AD technology … We are now broadly recognised as market leader of AD technology. Maintaining a reputation for technical innovation and excellence is not easy especially in financial services where the technology arms race does not stop \[ **5.3**\].’ 

 **Strengthening risk management in financial services for better investment decisions and regulatory adherence – and significant loss avoidance** 

 In financial trading ‘Greeks’ refer to the dimensions of risk for an options position. They are used by traders and portfolio managers to hedge risk and understand how their profit and loss ledger will behave as prices move. Calculating derivatives exposure across a portfolio is complex. The traditional approach to calculating Greeks has been to make small adjustments to the values of the inputs in the pricing of a derivative and calculate the output value each time, in a process known as bumping. It comes at a significant computational cost, especially for a portfolio of thousands of trades. In many cases, these calculations are prohibitively expensive and cannot be completed within a practical timeframe. Adjoint AD can compute Greeks up to 1,000 times faster than bumping, and with machine accuracy \[ **5.4**\]. Banks use NAG’s AD tools to calculate, at far greater speeds and accuracy, sensitivities to hedge risk, explain exposures and assess how quickly portfolios could lose value in a downturn \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Banks tend to be secretive. However, two banks in particular have spoken publicly about their use of AAD and these act as representative case studies for how the wider financial services industry has benefitted. According to a 2019 article in WatersTechnology \[ **5.5**\], Canada’s third largest bank Scotiabank \(assets: £571bn\) used NAG’s AD tools to build a new ‘risk engine’ that is capable of calculating valuation adjustments \(XVAs\) more accurately and 30 times faster. XVAs take into account the funding, credit and capital costs associated with trading derivatives; traders incorporate XVA into the price of a new derivative trade. Running XVA calculations is one of the largest computational challenges that banks face. The bank said that this new platform ‘ *allows brokers to deliver more accurate derivatives pricing in 20 seconds, which would previously have taken 10 minutes*’. It also ‘ *allows for more nuanced risk analysis thanks to more detailed risk scenario modelling that can assess more than 10 times the number of previous scenarios*’ \[ **5.5**\]. As Scotiabank notes, the need to accelerate these calculations has become increasingly important in order to adhere to more stringent international regulations \(the Basel III regulatory standards, published December 2017\) that are designed to protect the global economy from excessive risk\-taking by banks \[ **5.5**\]. AAD has made it possible for banks to calculate XVAs for each new transaction carried out with a client and accurately assess the impact of these adjustments on the bank’s balance sheet at the end of every day’s trading \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Having worked closely with NAG to develop the AAD algorithm library, Scotiabank ‘switched on’ the AAD function of its new risk platform in early 2020 \[ **5.6**\]. The result was ‘ *a tool that allows traders and risk managers to better understand exposure across asset classes, including rates, credit, foreign exchange and commodities*’ \[ **5.6**\]. This insight proved ‘ *invaluable*’ for Scotiabank when the markets plunged in March 2020 amid the Covid\-19 pandemic \[ **5.6**\]. The new technology platform enabled the bank to quickly run multiple scenario analyses and implement a hedging strategy that responded to market volatility. The bank’s head of XVA trading said: ‘… *this warned us ahead of time that if we saw a 100 basis point move in credit, we would need to put on large hedges in the rates and FX markets*’ \[ **5.6**\]. Major investment banks experienced losses amounting to hundreds of millions during this period \(JP Morgan recorded a $951m loss in three months to March 31\) \[ **5.6**\]. However, Scotiabank avoided such losses; it did not report an XVA charge on its balance sheet and the bank said the new risk engine had directly increased trade flows, resulting in a 33% year\-on\-year rise in revenues to the end of October 2020 \[ **5.6**\]. Scotiabank won Technology Innovation of the Year in the prestigious Risk Awards 2021 \(which evidences the benefit delivered to the bank during the REF 2021 impact period\) \[ **5.6**\]. 

 Danske Bank, Denmark’s largest bank, won the In\-House System of the Year 2015 Risk award for its implementation of AAD in its production and regulatory systems \[ **5.7**\]. One of the designers of the system authored *Modern Computational Finance: AAD and Parallel Simulations \(2018\)*, a practical guide for risk professionals on the application of AAD to finance. The book refers to AAD as ‘ *arguably the strongest addition to numerical finance of the past decade*’ and now ‘ *a key skill for all quantitative analysts, developers, risk professionals or anyone involved with derivatives*’ \[ **5.7**\]. In October 2020, Danske Bank announced it had combined AAD with neural networks to carry out valuation adjustments ‘ *thousands of times faster*’ \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **Achieving aerodynamic gains and optimising infrastructure design in engineering** 

 Through NAG products, engineering companies have, during the impact period, employed AD to calculate sensitivities of drag, lift or ballistic profile in order to identify the desired geometric shape of a vehicle for optimal performance. NAG reports that a high\-profile Formula One team used its adjoint AD tools to improve car performance by designing precise car geometry to achieve desired levels of downforce and drag \[ **5.3**\]. Team Sonnenwagen, a group of students from Aachen University, used NAG’s AD\-based dco/c\+\+ tool to optimise the design of its solar car that participated in the 2019 World Solar Challenge, a 3022\-kilometre race through the Australian outback for vehicles powered only by the sun. The dco/c\+\+ tool was described as ‘ *pivotal*’ in identifying design changes that minimised air resistance and ‘ *new suggestions for the cars aerodynamics that would otherwise have gone unnoticed were detected and implemented*’ \[ **5.9**\]. Team Sonnenwagen went on to finish sixth out of 53 teams from around the world. 

 In 2016, the CompAD compiler was incorporated directly into TELEMAC \(now TELEMAC\-MASCARET\), an open\-source suite of solvers used to model free\-surface and groundwater flow, which is managed by a consortium including French energy company EDF and the German Waterways Board \[ **5.10**\]. This software is used to analyse river flows, sediment transport and wave propagation in the context of marine infrastructure development like dams, bridges and groynes, dredging and flood management. The embedding of AD capabilities in TELEMAC has allowed users of the software to solve previously unsolvable or computationally very expensive problems, thus making a wider range of hydraulic modelling applications possible \[ **5.10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The  [UN Committee on World Food Security \(CFS\)](http://www.fao.org/cfs) is the world’s leading platform addressing issues of hunger and food insecurity. CFS policy recommendations are elaborated through a participatory process involving 300 million small\-scale food producers through the  [Civil Society and Indigenous People’s Mechanism \(CSM](http://www.csm4cfs.org/)\). Yet the CSM is facing challenges to ensure the participation of marginalized groups in global governance. Dr. Claeys and Dr. Brem\-Wilson have enabled the CSM to address these challenges by increasing the engagement of rural youth, the capacity of CSM Coordinators, the involvement of under\-represented sub\-regions and the CSM’s ability to monitor, leading to greater inclusion and diversity. Their research contributed to political change through the development of new norms that incorporate small\-scale farmers’ concerns, enhancing the legitimacy, buy\-in and implementation of CFS policy outputs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The most recent estimates for 2019 show that prior to the COVID\-19 pandemic, almost 690 million people were undernourished. Despite global efforts to address food insecurity, little progress has been reported, because food system governance is marked by exclusionary processes favouring the values and interests of powerful corporations, investors, and big farmers \(R1, R5\). To tackle this challenge, the UN Committee on World Food Security \(CFS\) was reformed in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Food Crisis to become a participatory multi\-stakeholder platform that places civil society engagement at its core. 

 Over the last 12 years, Claeys and Brem\-Wilson have analyzed how groups representing small\-scale food producers have organized in transnational networks to speak with their own voice at the UN \(R1, R2, R4\). They have documented how rural and urban constituencies have established the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples’ Mechanism \(CSM\) to participate in CFS debates \(R4\). They have insisted on the importance of involving food producers at every stage of the policy\-making process, leading to greater legitimacy, buy\-in and implementation of CFS policy outputs \(R5\). 

 Brem\-Wilson and Claeys’ research on the Civil Society and Indigenous People’s Mechanism \(CSM\), has focused on identifying obstacles to the effective participation of small\-scale food producers \(R1, R2, R3\) and on increasing inclusion and diversity \(R4, R5, R6\). Funded by the CSM \(and internally by Coventry University\), Claeys \(G1\) and Brem\-Wilson have conducted online surveys, semi\-directed interviews and participation observation, while positioning themselves as scholar\-activists working alongside affected constituencies. Their main research findings have identified four key areas requiring action within the CSM for it to become a more efficient and inclusive platform: 

-  **Foster the participation of rural youth in the CSM**: the independent evaluation of the CSM conducted by Claeys in 2018 showed that very few rural youth were actively involved in the CSM, leading to serious gaps in how global food security policies address the specific challenges facing small\-scale food producers under the age of 35, often lacking access to land and rural employment opportunities \(R6\). 

-  **Build the capacity of the CSM coordinators so they can effectively involve small\-scale producers from around the world in global policy processes:** Brem\-Wilson’s participatory research on facilitation within the CSM pointed to a lack of clarity on how the 40 CSM coordinators are supposed to act as “facilitators” to engage with grassroots communities worldwide, resulting in inconsistencies and ineffectiveness, as well as a lack of motivation on their part \(R3, R6\). 

-  **Address gaps in representation from three sub\-regions**: the independent evaluation of the CSM conducted by Claeys in 2018 identified imbalances in how the 17 sub\-regions participate in the CSM, putting the legitimacy and functioning of the CSM at risk. It recommended taking measures to include missing sub\-regions \(Central Asia, South Asia and Southern Africa\) in the governance bodies of the CSM \(R6\). 

-  **Develop new data collection practices for a more inclusive CSM:** the independent evaluation of the CSM conducted by Claeys in 2018 pointed to the lack of an efficient strategy for data collection and monitoring. The lack of process in place to collect data on participation in the CSM, disaggregated by gender, age, constituency or sub\-region, prevented the CSM from addressing imbalances in participation \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2018, Claeys released an independent evaluation of the CSM \(R6\), while Brem\-Wilson produced a report on facilitation practices within the CSM \(R3\). These documents contained recommendations for improving internal functioning \(see four key areas above\), many of which were adopted by the Coordination Committee of the CSM. This contributed to political change through the development of new legal norms that incorporate small\-scale farmers’ concerns and priorities, leading to greater legitimacy, buy\-in and implementation of CFS policy outputs. Substantial impacts can be identified in the following four areas: 

 <ins>Enhanced participation of rural youth.</ins> 

 ‘The CSM evaluation generated awareness and created momentum around the importance of increasing youth participation’ \(S1\). This led to the following impacts: a\) the Coordination Committee of the CSM issued a call to all participating organizations asking them to appoint youth leaders \(S1\); b\) as a result, the dormant Youth Working Group was reinforced \(gaining over 100 active participants\), and new facilitators and coordinators were appointed \(S1\); c\) this led to ‘remarkable strides in increased youth participation in the CSM ‘ \(S10, p. 16\), with an increase from 3% in 2014 to 25% at the annual CSM Forums of 2018 and 2019 \(S10, p.6\); d\) the Youth Working Group drafted a statement highlighting their  [vision and key policy demands](http://www.csm4cfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Draft-CSM-Youth-Vision-2019.pdf), including around the  [COVID crisis](http://www.csm4cfs.org/csm-youth-policy-declaration-covid-19/) \(S1\); e\) the Youth Working Group influenced a number of CFS policy outputs at the 46<sup>th</sup> session of the CFS. A new and prioritized thematic workstream on “promoting youth engagement and employment in agriculture and food system” was added to the CFS workplan  [2020\-2023](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/cfs/Docs1819/cfs46/FinalReport/CFS46_Final_Report_EN.pdf) \(S2, p.6, X, 28, c\), and the ‘urgency of involving youth and women in the urbanization and rural transformation debate’ was recognized in 2019 at the 46<sup>th</sup> Session of the CFS, in the workstream on  [Urbanization, Rural Transformation and Implications for FSN](http://www.fao.org/3/na633en/na633en.pdf) \(S3, p.2, 4\). As a direct result of Claeys’ recommendations, the inclusion and participation of the rural youth in the CFS were greatly enhanced and new legal norms were developed that protect the rights of the rural youth. The evaluation ‘was instrumental to these changes’ \(S1\). 

 <ins>Increased capacity of CSM sub\-regional and constituency coordinators.</ins> 

 The CSM does not represent or speak on behalf of affected constituencies but facilitates their participation. Facilitation is therefore key to its identity and purpose. Yet, Brem\-Wilson’s research ‘was the first attempt in its 8\-year existence to systematically assess the practice of facilitation in the CSM’ \(S4\). Brem\-Wilson’s research had the following impacts: a\) ‘responding to recommendations’ in Brem\-Wilson’s report, the Coordination Committee of the CSM ‘decided to constitute a specific Facilitation Working Group’ \(S4\); b\) ‘the first task taken on by the Facilitation Working Group in June 2019, again addressing Brem\-Wilson’s recommendations, was to launch an inclusive process of co\-producing a \(…\) ‘ [common understanding’ of facilitation](http://www.csm4cfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Common-understanding-of-Facilitation_English_21.1.20.pdf). This resulted in a framework document, adopted in January 2020, that is now established as the CSM’s definition of facilitation’ \(S4, S6\); c\) the Facilitation Working Group developed a new facilitation guide, leading to improved practices within the CSM \(S4, S5\); d\) CSM Coordinators developed a better understanding of their roles as facilitators, leading to their increased engagement and motivation \(S4, S5 *\).* The research led to enhanced practitioner capacity and substantial changes in professional standards and behaviours. 

 <ins>Increased representation of small\-</ins><ins>scale</ins> <ins>producers from 3 of the 17 CSM sub\-regions.</ins> 

 The CSM evaluation identified the ‘important weakness’ that ‘some sub\-regions participate more than others’ within the mechanism \(S7\), and recommended reaching out to missing sub\-regions. ‘After that recommendation was discussed at the meeting of the Coordination Committee of the CSM in June 2018’, the Secretariat ‘took several steps to proactively foster the participation of underrepresented sub\-regions, focusing on Central Asia, South Asia and Southern Africa’ \(S7\). This led to the following impacts: a\) the CSM appointed representatives from these 3 sub\-regions to its Coordination Committee \(S7\); b\) the CSM organized a grassroots  [consultation](http://www.csm4cfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Draft-CC-Report-2019-revised-FINAL.pdf) for the Southern African region, ‘which received dedicated funding after the evaluation identified this as a priority’ \(S7\). The objective of this meeting was to ‘reactivate civil society engagement’ from 8 countries in the sub\-region and identify joint policy priorities for CFS work \(S8, p.18\). The independent evaluation ‘proved to be an essential learning tool for our organization, as it… offered concrete and pragmatic ways forward’ \(S7\). It ‘contributed to significant improvements’ \(S7\), by strengthening inclusion within the CSM, and influencing the rights and participation opportunities of small\-scale food producers from 3 important sub\-regions. 

 <ins>Development of new practices and creation of new spaces for a more inclusive CSM.</ins> 

 ‘The CSM evaluation identified a key weakness around \(…\) data collection practices \(…\), which were assessed as **‘**insufficient to fully assess inclusivity’ \(S9\). The CSM Secretariat ‘took on board the recommendation of drastically reviewing the participant registration sheet in order to gather more personal data to be able to better track and monitor who participates’ \(S9\). This new registration sheet was implemented at the CSM Forum in 2018 and 2019. As a result, the CSM Secretariat is now able to ‘have a clear view on which constituencies and sub\-regions participate and which groups are over or under\-represented’ \(S9\). ‘This step marks an absolute breakthrough… as such information gathering is essential to monitoring the CSM’s level of inclusivity and to being able to identify and address weak areas’ \(S10, p.17\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A focus on inward investment from international productions and deference to a traditional canon had stymied new, more diverse Moroccan filmmakers and diminished the significance of Moroccan cultural influence on world cinema. 

 The Transnational Moroccan Cinema \(TMC\) project generated new ways of thinking and has changed film cultural policy among Moroccan film industry professionals and academics. TMC brought together 100 Moroccan cineastes at a debate in 2016 which led key industry figures to develop a new film cultural strategy. It has enabled diverse filmmakers, particularly women, to be accepted into the canon. A pioneering feminist film, preserved by TMC, has been accepted as one of 25 films key to Moroccan history and internationally exhibited. Emerging filmmakers have been supported with professional development and routes to international markets. Throughout the project 70 young Moroccan filmmakers have benefited from workshops and opportunities for collaborations including residencies in London for two emerging talents to develop new projects.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research for this case study builds on Higbee’s work on transnational cinema. The key findings of this research \[see **3.1, 3.2, 3.3 & 3.6**\], propose that an exclusive focus on the national, or \(in the case of Moroccan cinema\) the francophone, is detrimental to the understanding of the production, distribution and exhibition of films. Further insights and findings emerged from the AHRC\-funded “Transnational Moroccan Cinema” project \(TMC\) \(December 2015 – December 2018\) and the follow\-on project “An Alternative Distribution Network for Moroccan Cinema: Online Audiences, Festival Networks and Transnational Talent Development” \(November 2019 – November 2020\). The TMC research project was led by Higbee \(PI\), with Prof Florence Martin \(international CI\) and Dr Jamal Bahmad and Dr Stefanie Van de Peer as Research Fellows. 

 While existing research, critical discourse and audience reception display a deference for the older generation of cineastes and the ‘canon’ of Moroccan cinema, there is a distinct lack of access to the history of Moroccan cinema for aspiring filmmakers both in Morocco and internationally. \[ **3.4**\] While the Moroccan Film Council \(Centre Cinématographique Marocain – CCM\) has the space to store old films on 35mm format, the facility is not future\-proofed. Furthermore, women’s films were specifically at risk of being lost through patriarchal canon formation and neglect. Higbee’s project has restored, subtitled and digitised one historically important woman’s film, *A Door to the Sky* by Farida Benlyazid \(1989\), and made it newly available for global screenings. *La Falaise* \(Besaïdi, 1997\) an artistically significant short film by one of Morocco’s most important contemporary directors, will be restored and digitised in 2021. 

 The CCM’s strategic focus had prioritised inward investment from international productions, to the detriment of Moroccan filmmakers \[ **3.3**\]. There was no network of support between different levels of the industry: funders, producers and filmmakers did not enter into meaningful dialogue and were not sufficiently supported by the CCM in realising international co\-production or exposure for their films. Meanwhile, younger Moroccan filmmakers looked outward, towards Europe and America, rather than exploring their own cinematic heritage \[ **3.4**\] and existing film education did not translate into viable career opportunities. Morocco’s main film festivals \[see **3.5**\] in Marrakech and Tangiers lacked opportunities for Moroccan filmmakers. Marrakech was criticised in 2016 for not including a single Moroccan filmmaker, while the Tangiers festival’s invite\-only format excludes those filmmakers who are not yet established. 

 The key findings outlined above have been disseminated by the TMC research team on the project website and via social media, in articles and book chapters, as well as a monograph and edited collection. Two international conferences \(in Marrakech in December 2016 and Edinburgh in October 2018\) for academics and industry professionals, offered a key space for knowledge exchange. Higbee was invited to present his research in Morocco \(Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, in November 2019\) and internationally \(at HKU/CUHK, Hong Kong, in April 2018 and at HKBU in December 2018\). In November 2018 he served as president of the jury at the International Film School Festival, Tetouan.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Higbee’s work has increased access to the archives of Moroccan cinema globally; created opportunities for emerging filmmakers in Morocco; and changed awareness of, and interest in, Moroccan films on an international level for both audiences and industry professionals. Specifically, the following impacts have been achieved: 

###  1. Safeguarding and promoting works of historical significance 

 At the TMC conference ‘Morocco in Motion: the global reach of Moroccan Cinema’ \(Edinburgh, October 26\-28, 2018\), writer and director Farida Benlyazid revealed that her pioneering feminist film *A* *Door to the Sky* was stored at the CCM. The film had been considered “lost” as it did not have English subtitles and the French subtitles needed review, and the original 35mm film had deteriorated. Determined to make it available to a Moroccan and international audience, Higbee’s team shipped the film to the UK, where it was restored, subtitled in English and French, and digitised. It was then donated to the filmmaker and placed in the CCM archive in Rabat. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Higbee then persuaded the CCM to celebrate a world premiere of the restored film at the National Film Festival in Tangiers, for an audience of almost 300. \[ **5.2**\] It has since played at a number of international online festivals during the Covid\-19 pandemic, including the Africa in Motion Festival \(28/11/20, 57 views\) and the Being Human national festival of the humanities \(21/11/2020, 44 views\). Clear evidence of the film’s new lease of life as a result of Higbee’s work can be seen in its inclusion by the CCM in a selection of 25 films key to Moroccan film history that were streamed free online during March and April 2020 – viewed by 2,220 people in Morocco.\[ **5.2**\] 

###  2. Changing attitudes within and about Moroccan cinema 

 In December 2016, as part of the Marrakech International Film Festival \(MIFF\), in collaboration with the Moroccan Chamber of Film Producers \(MCFP\), Higbee organised a round\-table discussion about the state of the Moroccan film industry. The event was attended by more than 100 industry professionals and academics, including CCM director Sarim Fassi Fihri \[ **5.3**\]. At a time of perceived crisis for the Moroccan film industry \(with no Moroccan films having been selected for the MIFF\), it provided an opportunity to formulate a collective strategy. Key industry figures present committed to meeting twice a year in a forum that continues the initiatives begun by TMC. 

 *“After the Marrakech debates, we created a ‘National Coordination’, involving trade unions and professional organisations in the sector, aimed to set new priorities, and \[meet\] challenges such as the great one of winning back our own audiences and defining a cultural policy. We will continue this work and hope to bring more attention and confidence to Moroccan filmmakers.”*  – Ahmed El\-Maanouni, former president of the MCFP \[ **5.4**\] 

 At the Morocco in Motion conference, TMC invited a diverse selection of 15 Moroccan artists and industry practitioners to participate in a series of round\-table discussions in Edinburgh. Those who attended described how it had allowed a constructive debate to flourish: 

 *“Today I met people I did not have the opportunity to meet in Morocco. Thank you for having made this meeting possible, because I find this event priceless. It’s really exceptional to have the time and the opportunity to speak intelligently with so many people \[about Moroccan cinema\], to meet some of you for the first time.”* – film producer Lamia Chraïbi \[ **5.5**\] 

 Higbee’s research has led directly to greater international collaborations for the Moroccan film industry. Between 2017 and 2019, he consulted for UK production company Hurricane Films for a commercial feature film, *Beatrice and Her Father*, set in Morocco, advising how to navigate funding and co\-production and brokering meetings with their eventual co\-producer, Lamai Chraïbi. Shooting is due to commence in spring 2021. Hurricane Films have described Higbee’s contribution as ‘ *invaluable*’. \[ **5.6**\] 

###  3. Creating opportunities for emerging talent 

 Higbee’s research team organised debates at international film festivals between young and established professionals, enabling for the first\-time interactions between these different generations of Moroccan cinema. In addition, working in collaboration with the LFS \(2017\-2019\), Higbee delivered a series of pitching and cinematography workshops in Tetouan, as well as two residencies for emerging Moroccan filmmakers in London \[ **5.7**\]. Activist filmmaker Nadir Bouhmouch participated in both TMC conferences, and Higbee’s research team has promoted his work through online interviews and research publications. 

 *“It gave me the opportunity to meet filmmakers whose films have been influential and dear to me for so long. ... This has given me a renewed determination at a time when I was beginning to feel hopeless and isolated.”* – Nadir Bouhmouch, after the 2016 conference in Marrakech \[ **5.7**\] 

 Bouhmouch has since participated in the prestigious Venice Final Cut development programme and his latest documentary was selected for leading documentary festival Hot Docs \(Toronto\). Higbee has also introduced Bouhmouch’s work to a wider range of film festivals and filmmakers. As a direct result of Higbee’s recommendation to the festival, The Folk Film Gathering \(Edinburgh\) screened Bouhmouch’s latest documentary at the 2020 online edition of the festival, inviting the filmmaker to participate in a filmmaker roundtable, where Bouhmouch established a collaboration with renowned British documentary collective Amber. \[ **5.9**\] 

 French\-Moroccan filmmaker Sofia el Khyari found participation in the Edinburgh conference and the screening of her film *Ayam* at the AiM film festival \(see photo \[ **5.1**\]\) a similarly transformative experience: “ *I returned to Paris, with my head full of projects, inspiration and ambition\!\! … I can't thank you enough for inviting me and promoting my young work to everyone.”* \[ **5.7**\] 

 Higbee’s project promoted further transnational talent development through collaboration with the London Film School \(LFS\) and the International Film School Film Festival in Tetouan \(FIDEC\). Two Moroccan documentary\-makers spent a term in residence at the LFS in spring 2017, developing new projects \(see Janjague and El Hachadi testimonies \[ **5.7**\]\), while Higbee and a delegation of LFS staff and students were invited by Abdelmalek Essaadi University to participate in the third FIDEC festival in November that same year. They returned in 2018 and 2019 to deliver three further pitching and filmmaking workshops for around 70 young Moroccan filmmakers, providing significant support and feedback to those seeking national and international funding for projects. In 2018, Higbee presided over the festival jury **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4. Extending audience reach and challenging perceptions of Moroccan cinema 

 By collaborating with the UK’s leading African film festival, Africa in Motion \(AiM\), and its partner organisations over the past four years, Higbee has increased understanding of the significance of Moroccan cinema in an African context. More than 500 people saw Moroccan films programmed at the festival as a result of TMC’s involvement. AiM producer Justine Atkinson’s testimony explains that TMC’s influence on curatorial practices enabled *“audiences to navigate a carefully curated programme of film screenings and events, therefore increasing their knowledge and access to Moroccan cinema at a time of disproportionally low levels of public exposure to Moroccan films*”. \[ **5.9**\] 

 The number of Moroccan events programmed at AiM rose from two in 2016 to nine in 2018, while the Moroccan film *Transes* \(El Maanouni, 1981\) was picked up by two other UK festivals: Watch Africa Cymru, in Wales \(November 2017\), and Open Colour, in Bristol \(April 2019\). TMC also delivered masterclasses with Moroccan filmmakers and panel discussions following screenings, which introduced new audiences to Moroccan film culture, and positively changed attitudes towards North African cinema, which has often been seen as separate from sub\-Saharan African cinema. \[ **5.9, 5.10**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Integrated programmes of geotechnical research led by Profs. Jardine, Potts and Zdravkovic, in collaboration with industry, delivered substantial benefits to offshore energy sector since 2014, including: 

 I1.  new axial, lateral, monotonic and cyclic offshore pile design technologies, endorsed by a widespread use in Industry; 

 I2. critical design solutions to fossil and renewable offshore energy projects that have enabled multi\-million GBP developments to progress safely in deeper waters and more challenging environmental and/or ground conditions; 

 I3. piling cost reductions up to 30% over codified methods, delivering UK benefits rising to approximately GBP300,000,000 per year by 2018; 

 I4. greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental benefits following the two\-third reduction achieved in offshore\-wind electricity prices and its growth of a one\-third share of UK supply, allowing developers to switch to principally offshore\-wind production. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research streams explained below underpinned the development of new, robust and accurate, field\-validated, design technologies for axially and laterally\-loaded offshore piles through: \(i\) advanced laboratory experiments, Imperial College Pile \(ICP\) and other field testing campaigns with new technologies, integrated with \(ii\) advanced numerical modelling developments and their applications with the bespoke geotechnical Imperial College Finite Element Program \(ICFEP\). 

1.  **Axial pile loading research in clays and sands \[R1\-2\]:** Investigations since 2000, led by Jardine, funded by French Government \(CNRS\), EPSRC, Health & Safety Executive \(HSE\), Royal Society, Shell, Total and others included: extensive laboratory research; development/application of new highly instrumented pile models \[R2\]; and field pile testing at Dunkirk \[R1\]. Identifying the fundamental mechanisms governing the ageing and damage of piles under axial cyclic loading enabled new, field\-verified, “ICP” design methods for clays and sand. Dissemination through papers, keynotes, honour lectures, design booklets, engagement in offshore projects led to widespread application and inclusion in American Petroleum Institute \(API\), HSE and International Organisation for Standardisation \(ISO\) guidance \[R3\]. 

1.  **Axial and lateral monotonic and cyclic loading of piles in chalk \[R3\]:** Chalk, which is encountered widely offshore Northern Europe can lose strength dramatically during pile driving and give uncontrollable pile free\-falls into the seabed. The 2014\-17 UK\-Innovate project with Iberdrola and Geotechnical Consulting Group \(GCG\), led by Jardine and Kontoe, applied novel sea\-bed static and dynamic pile testing technologies in unique field measurements at the new Wikinger Baltic windfarm \[R3\]. Together with instrumented onshore experiments, the research identified the piles’ governing installation, ageing and cyclic\-loading processes, identified why installation problems may occur, and showed how to overcome the difficulties through new “ICP\-Chalk” design methods that avoid unnecessary over\-conservatism. Jardine and Kontoe led further chalk research with the ALPACA and ALPACA Plus \(2019\-20\) Joint Industry Projects \(JIPs\) with Oxford University, eight offshore developers and four Consultants. Novel dynamic fibre\-optic sensors and physio\-chemical investigations delivered detailed guidance on axial\-and\-lateral, static\-and\-cyclic design analysis for chalk sites \[R3\]. 

1.  **Numerical modelling of soil\-structure interaction \[R4\-6\]:** Numerical analysis of foundation problems is challenging because of soils’ highly non\-linear and multi\-phase nature. Research since 2000, led by Potts and Zdravkovic, funded by EPSRC, Portuguese Government, GCG, Crossrail and HSE, delivered ICFEP’s unique monotonic and cyclic soil modelling capabilities, enabling realistic predictions of small\-strain \[R5\] and failure \[R4\] behaviour of soils for a wide range of loading and ground conditions. Together with novel structural shell element formulation and modelling approaches for submerged soil\-structure interfaces, these advances enabled the first accurate analyses of laterally\-loaded offshore piles \[R6\] and identified the primary mechanisms governing the soil response to such loading. 

 4.  **PISA design method \[R6\]:** Field\-monitoring of monopile wind\-turbine foundations by Ørsted identified costly over\-conservatism in monopile design processes adopted in industry. The 2013\-18 PISA & PISA2 JIP projects funded by Carbon Trust and ten offshore developers, delivered substantially more efficient design for laterally\-loaded piles than existing codified methods, by applying advanced three\-dimensional \(3D\) predictive ICFEP modelling approach, soil laboratory testing and comprehensive large\-scale field pile testing. Zdravkovic, Jardine, Potts and Taborda worked with Prof Byrne’s team at Oxford to design and model large instrumented pile tests at sites in UK and France. Excellent agreement between ICFEP predictions and subsequent field observations unlocked paths to more economical 3D numerical \[R6\] and 1D design methods. The PISA research outputs found immediate and widespread application through engagement in the sponsors’ projects and through a suite of Géotechnique papers, including \[R6\], endorsed by the Industry and UK Carbon Trust:  [https://www.carbontrust.com/news\-and\-events/news/new\-design\-methods\-for\-offshore\-wind\-monopiles\-to\-create\-cost\-savings\-for](https://www.carbontrust.com/news-and-events/news/new-design-methods-for-offshore-wind-monopiles-to-create-cost-savings-for). New research under the EPSRC/ORE Supergen ALPHA project has extended ICFEP design analyses for lateral pile loading to include challenging \(brittle and sensitive\) chalk ground conditions.

###  4. Details of the impact 

1.  **New pile design paradigms:** The ‘ICP’ axial cyclic loading and ageing design approaches for sands and clays, \[R1, R2\], have been applied in many £multi\-billion North Sea oil/gas and wind\-energy projects since 2014, enabling better safety and economy in foundation design, as detailed in publications \[S1\-S5\] co\-authored with industry. Iberdrola group, lead industrial partners on East Anglia One \(EAONE\) wind farm, report that \[S2b\]: 

 “ *the ICP\-05 method is considered highly reliable for North Sea sands and clays and will be continuously considered where relevant on future developments within the Iberdrola offshore renewables ever growing portfolio*”. 

 The new ICP\-Chalk axial loading and ageing methodology applied on SPR’s GPB1,200,000,000 Wikinger Baltic windfarm, \[R3\], enabled material and risk reduction project benefits valued at \[S5\]: 

 “*tens of millions of Euros in supply and fabrication costs and several further million Euros of savings in \[pile\] installation costs”.* 

 Comparable benefits from ‘ICP’ design approaches apply to new Chalk projects, including SPR’s GBP1,000,000,000 Baltic Eagle and LEMS’ 496MW Le Tréport projects whose developers maintain close links with the Imperial team, including investing in ALPACA JIP. Ørsted applied the team’s novel field\-testing technologies in GBP40,000,000 pile experiments conducted offshore Taiwan in 2019. 

 The PISA research \[R6\] led to paradigm changes in numerical modelling methods of offshore piles, as detailed in publications co\-authored with industry \[S6, S8, S9\], which deliver significantly more accurate and efficient designs for laterally\-loaded monopiles. Ørsted \[S10a\] refer to the work as: 

 “*a flagship in the offshore wind industry, an extremely successful joint\-industry project that has had a direct and indisputable effect on the ability of offshore wind to become cost\-effective and in turn be able to compete with other energy sources*”, reporting that “ *PISA methods provided cost savings in excess of £10m as compared to conventional design methods*” for the Hornsey\-01 windfarm. 

1.  **Critical design solutions to offshore developments:** The static and cyclic axial ICP design methods’ \[R1\-R2\] contributions to major projects since 2014 include: \(i\) assuring safety in difficult ground conditions in BP’s GBP4,500,000,000 West\-of\-Shetland Clair Ridge \(the UK’s largest oil project\), where production commenced in 2018 under extreme metocean conditions, \[S1\]; \(ii\) Gaz de France’s GBP1,400,000,000 2016 Cygnus project, which is the UK’s largest gas field and supplies 1.5M UK homes; and \(iii\) EAOOne, a GBP2,300,000,000 SPR/Vattenfall windfarm that adds 800MW to UK capacity \[S2a\], whose developers attested in 2018 after completing the foundations for 102 jacket\-supported wind\-turbines that \[S2b\]: 

 *“the use of the ICP\-05 design methodology played a very significant part in its success”,* achieving “ *estimated £11m steel cost savings”* while dynamic load tests *“proved the required capacity*”. 

 Similar contributions were made to Chevron’s Captain Enhanced Oil Recovery project \[S3\], Premier Oil’s Solan West\-of\-Shetland development and German North Sea jacket\-supported structures, including Orsted’s Borkum Riffgrund \[S4\]. 

 The Imperial team has also worked with GCG to apply ICFEP’s predictive modelling approach and advanced capabilities \[R4\-R5\] in several major offshore wind projects. Source \[S10b\] testifies: 

 “*ICFEP has been instrumental in enabling a step\-change in the design of monopiles as foundations for offshore wind turbine generators*”, documenting particular benefits in “ *enabling Ørsted’s foundation design to meet certification body standards*” and achieving “ *some of the major landmarks in Ørsted’s offshore wind development*”: *\(i\) Burbo Bank Extension, operational since 2017, the world’s first to use currently largest 8MW turbines; \(ii\) Walney Extension, at 659 MW the world’s largest wind\-farm when commissioned in 2018; \(iii\) Hornsea\-01, world’s first to exceed 1 GW capacit*y with 174 turbines \(in 2020\) and \(iv\) Hornsea\-02, currently under design, to deliver 1.386 GW, adding to Ørsted’s capacity to power 5.5M UK homes by 2022. 

 Similar ICFEP\-supported design contributions were made to Ørsted’s German Gode\-Wind \(2014, \[S6\]\), UK Race Bank \(2015\) and German Borkum Riffgrund 02 \(2016\) projects and Innogy’s UK Triton Knoll, where the next generation 9.5 MW turbines will deliver 855 MW from 2021, \[S8\]. 

1.  **More economical foundations:** Examples of the multi\-million British Pound savings enabled by the ICP static and cyclic axial offshore design procedures, \[R1\-R3\], at clay, sand and chalk ‘jacket’ sites are detailed in \[S2b\], \[S3\] and \[S5\]: savings up to 30% in foundation costs were achieved over routine codified methods. 

 The PISA design guidance for lateral loading, \[R6\], has been applied in multiple projects since 2015 and PISA\-based tools \(MoDeTo\) were implemented for general use,  [https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product\-line/geotechnical\-engineering\-software/plaxis\-modeto](https://www.bentley.com/en/products/product-line/geotechnical-engineering-software/plaxis-modeto), in the leading commercial software Plaxis since 2018. Independent consultants, \[S7\], working with PISA\-based tools, report savings for the Triton Knoll UK windfarm: 

 “*in excess of 30% compared to traditional design approaches*”. 

 Ørsted \[S10b\] testifies to PISA design methods being: 

 “*central to increased efficiency of foundation design and reduced cost of foundations, which accounts for around 20% of the total capital \(CAPEX\) expenditure*”. 

 CAPEX reductions of 6% were achieved from the foundations research in the 17 major offshore projects cited above, and in many others, through the new approaches’ widespread UK and international use. Noting that the CAPEX value of UK offshore wind projects commissioned in 2018 exceeded six billion GBP, widespread use of the new methods may have led to UK savings exceeding GBP300,000,000, plus further international benefits. 

1.  **Cheaper, greener and secure energy:** The team’s piling research helped the UK to maintain secure and cost\-effective domestic oil & gas supplies since 2014, while reducing offshore wind\-energy costs by two\-third, down to half new nuclear prices \( [http://tinyurl.com/y274hvlf](http://tinyurl.com/y274hvlf)\). 

 Developers have been able to shift to low\-carbon sources, with Ørsted \[S10b\] stating that: 

 “*the share of green energy in Ørsted’s power generation has risen from 17%* \[in 2006\] *to 75%* \[in 2018\] *, with the number expected to reach 99% in 2025*”.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Improved access to essential medicine by under\-privileged populations across eight districts in four provinces of Zambia** was achieved by the launch in 2017 of a ground\-breaking hi\-tech inventory distribution system relying on special\-purpose forecasting and inventory control algorithms and a distributed computer system with mobile devices adapted to sub\-Saharan Africa’s limited infrastructure. This system was designed, developed and deployed by an international partnership including the Zambian government, the World Bank, DfID, UNDP, Professor Gallien’s research team and IBM. It **replaced the old, flawed** paper\-based drug distribution system and **for the first time** allowed health officials to **track the supply and demand of dozens of medicines** in real\-time, which allowed them to **better predict and cope** with both seasonal surges in demand and delays in shipping, and to secure the availability of drugs including life\-saving antibiotics and malaria medicines for more patients in Zambia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research addressed the **difficult and challenging issue** of how to distribute life\-saving drugs in developing countries that lack the necessary systems and infrastructure. Working with the Zambian government and academic colleagues, Professor Gallien first used data from a supply\-chain field pilot scheme that ran from April 2009 to April 2010 \[3.4\] along with his research on national procurement of medicines in African countries \[3.3\] to devise a computer model that could **accurately simulate the national distribution of anti\-malarial medicines** based on artemether\-lumefantrine \(AL\) \[3.1\]. Manufactured abroad, these drugs are imported to a national warehouse in the capital city Lusaka. Distributed to about 120 district stores, they are finally shipped to 1,500 health clinics across the country. 

 The model accounts for clinic orders, patient demand and the timing of deliveries. The results **closely mirrored** the situation on the ground. For example, while AL stocks in the clinics \- from which the medicine is given to people who need it \- were adequate at the end of 2009, the computer simulation **correctly predicted that many would run out** early in 2010 despite sufficient inventory in the Lusaka warehouse. 

 These results demonstrated that inventory control \(formulas used to calculate specific shipment quantities of drugs to every destination on an ongoing basis\) were a key reason why clinics ran out of AL. They were not adequately capturing peaks and troughs in both supply and demand, including changes caused by the seasonal nature of malaria and flooding. Existing methods also caused systematic inequalities in patient access to drugs across different geographic areas within Zambia. 

 Gallien used mathematical models to build better inventory control methods. Numerical experiments showed these would substantially improve patient access to drugs \[3.2\]. This rigorous and quantitative prediction of the substantial achievable reductions in patient\-facing stock\-outs provided the key motivation for the Government of Zambia and the World Bank to form an international partnership that would implement the system envisioned by Professor Gallien’s research team and the algorithm it had developed. Professor Gallien contributed extensive technical support to that partnership, and his team shared the computer code implementing the algorithms he had developed so it could be used by IBM.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research described in section 2 has been **used to design and introduce a new drug distribution system in Zambia** called eZICS \(Enhanced Zambia Inventory Control System\). The goals of eZICS include improving drug availability for patients, creating real\-time inventory and movement visibility through the supply\-chain, digitising Zambia’s distribution system and reducing inventory management labour. 

 Following system design recommendations outlined in \[3.1\], its main components include smart phones with barcode scanners at every storage location that are connected to a centralised application and database, enhanced demand and supply lead\-times forecasting, and enhanced inventory control policies \(\[5.4\] and \[5.5\]\). 

 The initiative started in 2010 and was supported by a partnership that ultimately included the Zambian Ministry of Health, the World Bank, the UK Government’s Department for International Development, UNICEF/UNDP, computer giant IBM and **Professor Gallien’s research group** \(see \[5.1\] and historical timeline in \[5.5\]\). 

 The collaboration involved a transfer of the technical knowledge and computer code which Professor Gallien’s group had developed for \[3.1\] and \[3.2\] to the IBM solution development team responsible for delivering the eZICS system to the Zambian Government for deployment by its central medical store \(MSL\). 

 Launched in 2016, the new tool **transformed the supply of medicines**. Dr. Bonface Fundafunda, Managing Director of MSL and advisor to the Zambian government at the time, says it “allowed an officer at any health facility, to process all the requirements that were needed to enable an informed supply chain decision to be made.” \[5.2\] 

 Professor’s Gallien’s **studies were pivotal in the tool’s development**, he adds. “The studies provided decision\-makers with the basis for planning the supply of health products to different health facilities per region of Zambia, taking into account parameters such as climatic impact. For example, facilities being cut off due to annual flooding events.” 

 Positive impacts of the system included **improved stock accuracy**, **wider transparent access** to data on stock levels, orders and movements and **better national planning and budgeting** for medicines. 

 After **training workshops attended by more than 100 employees**, the system was **extended in 2018**, to cover the supply of 40 medicines across eight districts in four provinces of the country \[5.3\] and \[5.4\]. Staff at health facilities could use mobile devices with barcode scanners to record and transmit stock and usage details to a central inventory control system. Unlike the historic system, the eZICS was **fully transparent**, giving each district **real\-time information on drug stock levels** at the clinics, and the ability to **coordinate the transfer of supplies** from one facility to another if required. 

 While the national deployment of eZICS has currently been paused due to funding issues among others, the system “continues to **receive high praise** in terms of simplicity, broad impact on management of supply chain for health products,” Fundafunda says. “It can be deployed across different types or levels of the health sector, from the low village health centre or health post, to a major referral health facility with equally complex pharmaceutical and health product management infrastructure.” Commenting on the impact of this work, he concludes “this approach enabled the Ministry and partners to start seeing assured healthcare service provision \[…\]. By extension, the assured availability of health products made contribution to positive health outcomes for Zambia.” 

 Finally, eZICS also served as a pioneering project and proof of concept beyond Zambia as it was the first inventory distribution system with decentralised real\-time inventory visibility to be deployed in the public sector of any sub\-Saharan African country. Other countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo have since sent missions to Lusaka in order to benefit from MSL’s experience with eZICS.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Global climate technology policies and funding are widely viewed as having historically failed to meet the needs of low\- and middle\-income countries. Sussex research demonstrated this was due to failures to understand the importance of: building innovation systems around climate technologies; aligning technologies with the self\-defined needs of poor individuals or communities; and responding to the political realities where interventions are made. Sussex researchers then designed a new policy approach that is able to deliver this. Globally, the policy approach has: informed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s \(UNFCCC\) review and future direction of its climate technology policy; been adopted as a funding mechanism by the USD10,300,000,000 Green Climate Fund \(GCF\); and informed the World Bank’s review and reshaping of their climate technology approach in developing countries. At a continental level, the policy approach has been adopted by the African Union to train African government and intergovernmental policymakers in leveraging international climate funding. At a national level, the policy approach is being implemented by 16 policy organisations from 9 different African countries, framing national policy and practice, and underpinning proposals for GCF funding. To date, these GCF proposals have resulted in USD9,994,500 of GCF funding being awarded to Burundi \(leveraging USD21,727,000 in match funding, with an estimated 573,500 beneficiaries\). Kenya also has two proposals at advanced stages of GCF approval, worth a total of USD20,000,000. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Facilitating the transfer of climate technologies \(technologies that assist in mitigating or adapting to climate change, like low\-carbon energy technologies, or drought\-resistant farming technologies\) to developing countries has been a core aim of global climate policy for the last three decades. It is, however, widely viewed to have failed in practice, benefiting only richer developing countries and international companies who supply technologies to them. For example, under the Clean Development Mechanism – one of the core global policy mechanisms that fund climate technology transfer to date – China accrued around 60% of total investment and India around 11%. Africa as a whole, including South Africa and the relatively richer countries of Northern Africa, accrued only 3% across the whole continent \[R1\]. 

 Based on a combination of long\-term empirical analyses in Sub\-Saharan Africa \[R2, R3\], India and China and inter\-disciplinary conceptual work \[developed over a decade and summarised in R1\], Sussex research has both demonstrated how climate technologies can be successfully transferred, and designed a new policy approach that can make this happen \[R4\]. The research focussed mostly on energy technologies, but used this to develop conceptual and practical policy insights of relevance to climate technologies more broadly. The key research insights that underpin this policy approach are: 

 1. Traditional climate technology policy only addresses two dimensions of the problem, namely technology and finance, reflected in a past dominance of engineering and economics in the technology and development literature \[R1, R3\]. This ignores the importance of attending to socio\-cultural \[R5\] and political \[R2\] dimensions that help or hinder technology transfer and the need to build indigenous innovation systems in developing countries to foster broader change around new technologies \[R1, R4\]. Even where policy interventions have focused purely on the financial dimension, Sussex research has shown that aligning financial approaches with existing socio\-cultural practices of paying for technology services \(e.g. light\) amongst poor individuals and communities can explain the success and longevity of initiatives \[R5\]. 

 2. The research has highlighted the relevance of insights from the broader body of literature on national systems of innovation and applied this to show that, where climate technologies are successfully transferred, it is due to long\-term processes of building indigenous technological capabilities and strengthening the systemic contexts through which sustained uptake of new technologies can be nurtured \[R1, R4\]. National systems of innovation provide the context within which all processes of technology development, transfer and uptake occur. They encompass the network of actors \(e.g. firms, universities, research institutes, government departments, NGOs, suppliers, consumers, etc.\) within which innovation occurs, and the strength and nature of the relationships between them. In developing countries, particularly around newer climate technologies, these systems are often either weak or non\-existent, and need to be actively nurtured \[R1, R4\]. 

 3. Importantly, by combining a ‘national systems of innovation’ theory perspective with conceptual insights from the strategic niche management literature, the research demonstrated that the ‘national systems of innovation’ perspective needed to be extended to also attend to the social contexts, and the political/economic impediments to new technology uptake \[R1, R2\]. This led to a new theoretical contribution, based on understanding successful climate technology transfer as requiring the development of ‘socio\-technical innovation system building’ in developing countries \[R1\]. 

 The researchers then used this understanding of requirements for ‘socio\-technical innovation system building’, grounded in new empirical analysis in Sub\-Saharan Africa \[R2, R3\] to formulate a concrete policy approach. The result was the ‘Climate Relevant Innovation\-system Builders’ \(CRIBs\) policy approach \[R4\]. This asserted that successful climate technology transfer requires key actors \(individuals and institutions with knowledge of local contexts and people’s needs\), to focus on actively building the innovation systems that provide the context within which new technologies are adopted, along the whole supply chain from importers, to suppliers, to vendors, to consumers. This should be done in ways that are aligned with – or can evolve – poor people’s existing socio\-technical practices \[R1, R4, R5\] and existing political interests \[R4\]. This is supplemented by Sussex research that develops a systematic approach to developing collaborative R&D efforts in relation to climate technologies. It created a taxonomic approach for analysing collaborative designs and provided policymakers with guidance on how to configure R&D collaborations to meet climate technology needs \[R6\]. 

 The research is based on a long\-term intellectual collaboration between Ockwell and Byrne \(UoA 17 – Business and Management Studies\) that began in 2009, with Ockwell originally focussing more on aspects of the innovation studies and energy geographies literatures in the context of climate technology transfer and Byrne focussing more on the strategic niche management literature. Since that time, the new empirical, theoretical and policy insights described above represent joint intellectual contributions that have emerged from over a decade of close collaboration, joint thinking and research, including co\-convening the energy & climate research domain of the £9m ESRC STEPS Centre \[G1\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The Sussex research that led to the CRIBs policy approach has had significant impact on policy and funding at global, continental and national levels. 

 <ins> **Global climate policy impact**</ins> 

 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s \(UNFCCC\) Technology Executive Committee – the political body responsible for implementing climate technology policy under the UNFCCC and the Paris Climate Agreement – used the CRIBs approach to evaluate their existing climate technology policy and inform their agreed way forward to improving it \[S1\]. In particular, they adopted the CRIBs recommendation that future technology interventions under the UNFCCC act as ‘innovation system builders’ \[S1\]. The resulting recommendations were officially adopted by the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Implementation \[S1, S2 p.12,16,18, 20,21\]. The significance of this is emphasised by \[text removed for publication\] the UNFCCC Secretariat who acknowledged that the Sussex research *“has been adopted as a key concept in the technology development and transfer work and advice of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism… It was also relevant in the context of the evaluation of the GEF Poznan strategic programme on technology transfer \(PSP\) undertaken in 2018/19, as the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network and the PSP pilot regional centres operate as new climate innovation system builders, that connect actors and networks, provide technical and policy support and mobilize climate finance for climate technology projects”* \[S3\]. 

 One mode through which the UNFCCC recommends climate technology transfer be achieved is via collaborative research, development and deployment \(where Sussex research has contributed in the past, \[R6\]\). The UNFCCC used CRIBs to frame their assessment of how to fund collaborative research and development through the Green Climate Fund \(GCF\). The GCF is a USD10,300,000,000 fund set up by the UNFCCC to fund global efforts towards attaining international climate change goals in developing countries. The GCF board acknowledged CRIBs as a policy approach and agreed to fund its implementation. It also used the analytical categories set out in Sussex’s CRIBs paper \[R4\] to frame how the GCF would target its funding \[S4, S5\]. This included whole sections of these GCF policy documents \[S4, S5, see annotated pdfs\] that attend to “building innovation systems’ and “understand\[ing\] and respond\[ing\] to context\-specific conditions and needs” in recipient countries, as per the CRIBs paper \[R4\]. The policy documents \[S4 p3\-4, S5 p16\-17 & 32\] also directly cite the CRIBs paper and mention the CRIBs approach multiple times. \[text removed for publication\], UNFCCC Secretariat, confirms “ *This \[the CRIBs\] approach was central in advising the Green Climate Fund in 2018*” \[S3\]. 

 Sussex’s CRIBs work was also used to inform a change in direction in the World Bank’s Climate Technology Programme. This Programme originally focussed exclusively on traditional mechanisms, such as supporting entrepreneurs and business incubation, but insights from CRIBs introduced the value of building innovation systems to achieve broader change. \[text removed for publication\] the World Bank confirmed: *“Evidence, insights and recommendations from David Ockwell and Robert Byrne's publications on Climate\-Relevant Innovation\-systems Builders were valuable inputs to the strategy of the World Bank infoDev Climate Technology Program and to the development of its program activities. The publications provided a strong policy rationale and a convincing practical framework for the role of institutions in building innovation systems that advance climate technology goals in developing countries. The publications advance unique ideas that cannot be found elsewhere in the literature and therefore were a significant resource for the Climate Technology Program.”* \[S6\]. As a result, the programme now includes “market ecosystem creation” as the first of its five core activities \[S11\]. 

 <ins> **Continental</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>level African climate policy impact**</ins> 

 In the light of difficulties African countries have had to date in leveraging international climate finance, the African Union \(AU\) recognised the Sussex CRIBs approach as an opportunity for African countries to improve access to GCF funding. They therefore commissioned Sussex’s key research partners in Africa \(the African Centre for Technology Studies, ACTS, which hosts the Africa Hub of the ESRC STEPS Centre’s Global Sustainability Consortium, convened by Ockwell and Byrne\) to provide CRIBs training to 41 African and international climate policymakers from 18 different countries \[S7\] \( [https://www.acts\-net.org/cribs](https://www.acts-net.org/cribs)\). The training focussed on equipping participants with the necessary knowledge and capacity to advise their governments on using the CRIBs approach to leverage climate finance via the GCF, and use CRIBs to improve the implementation of climate technology policy in their respective countries. 

 18 different African countries were represented at the AU training event, sometimes with several delegates from each, including representation of: 14 different African government ministries; four intergovernmental organisations, including the AU, World Bank, and African Development Bank, and 16 organisations with formal roles in advising and implementing national climate policy in their constituent countries \[see participant list in S7\]. \[text removed for publication\], African Union concluded that “ *CRIBs presents a paradigm shift for the participants in these processes as articulated in most of their comments in the evaluation after the meeting \[AU CRIBs training event\]. This methodology will open gateways for easy access to climate funds. The African Union continues to get more requests for continuation of similar trainings in different regions of the continent.”* \[S7, S8\]. 

 \[text removed for publication\] also asserts that the AU CRIBs training “ *triggered the development of the African Union Green Innovation Framework for the continent*” \[S8\] which aims to help AU member countries’ transition to green economies for sustainable development in line with AU’s “Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want” \(“ *the continent’s strategic framework that aims to deliver on its goal for inclusive and sustainable development”* \[S9b\]\). The AU Green Innovation Framework, which builds directly on the CRIBS approach, is now complete with public launch expected in early 2021 \(having been delayed by COVID\-19\) \[S9a\]. 

 <ins> **National</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>level African climate policy impact**</ins> 

 At a national level, as a result of the AU\-commissioned CRIBs training, and two further focussed training and capacity\-building programmes run by Sussex with ACTS, 16 policy organisations from nine different countries are now in the process of either developing funding proposals to the GCF to implement CRIBs in their countries, or using the CRIBs approach to inform their climate policy\-making and implementation processes \[S7\]. In both Kenya and Burundi, CRIBs\-based GCF funding proposals have already been submitted \[S10\]. To date, this has resulted in USD9,994,500 in GCF funding being awarded to Burundi \(leveraging USD21,727,000 in match funding, with an estimated 573,500 beneficiaries\) \[S12a & b\]. Kenya also has two proposals at advanced stages of approval, worth a total of USD20,000,000 \[S12a\]. This national\-level uptake of the CRIBs approach represents a significant shift in emphasis towards focussing policy and practice on building innovation systems around climate technologies based on understanding the context\-specific needs and political realities of different countries and people therein. Some examples are included below \(with further examples from Ghana, Egypt, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Nigeria and Malawi available in S7\). 

 In Kenya, the National Environment Trust Fund \(NETFUND\) supports implementation of the AU’s action plans and is designated by the Ministry of Environment to apply for GCF funding. The research director of NETFUND has adopted the CRIBs approach in all programme design: *“we have adopted this as the approach in developing ministerial projects and programmes. So far we have developed 12 programmes under this approach and they are under consideration for funding within government budgets… One of the concepts… was shared with GCF and they have sent back very positive comments and also ideas on how to improve on it.  We intend to pursue this concept under the \[GCF’s\] simplified approval process.”* \[S7, p13\]. This funding proposal has since been submitted and is currently under its second round of review by the GCF; initial GCF comments having been very positive, leading to a request for revision and resubmission \[S10\]. Similarly, Dr Kelvin Khisa, Head of the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute \(a state corporation under the Kenyan Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives\), states that: *“We are currently developing a GCF readiness proposal for Kenya on the development of energy efficiency regulations following the 4 CRIBs goals”* \[S7, p16\]. 

 Another example is the work of the Ministry of Water and Environment in Uganda. *“At the Ministry of Water and Environment, we have really made progress after the CRIBS training and we have changed the way we think in terms of applying for GCF and AF \[UNFCCC Adaptation Fund\] funds. The theory of change that the CRIBs approach advocates for has improved our skills in writing bankable proposals. I and my team are currently building on the knowledge I attained from the training to develop GCF and AF fundable proposals for my Ministry. This has been further instigated by the fact that the Ministry is in the process of being accredited as an implementing entity for both GCF and AF”,* Mildred Namwiira, economist at the Ministry of Water and Environment, Uganda \[S7, p15\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Growth Catalyst is an EU funded programme, based on University of Liverpool Management School \(ULMS\) research on small firms, that supports learning and behavioural change among entrepreneurs in the Liverpool City\-Region. Growth Catalyst resulted in improved leadership practices for 176 entrepreneurs and growth amongst 161 firms, demonstrated by increases in average turnover of 49%, firm investment of 38% and 333 additional new full\-time jobs between 2014 and 2019. These indicators of impact have been recognised by multiple sources, including the independent European evaluation of the programme. In the context of the Liverpool City\-Region, which underperforms economically compared with the UK average, the impact of Growth Catalyst is significant and far\-reaching. The success of the programme resulted in a further £1m of European funding being awarded to ULMS to deliver four additional cohorts of firms up to 2021. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Growth Catalyst programme has transferred three main research insights into practice, ultimately having an impact on small firm leadership, business growth and subsequently the Liverpool City\-Region. The programme is underpinned with the findings of research undertaken by staff at ULMS and based on the concepts of ‘strategic space’, ‘critical reflection’ and networking. Jones and Macpherson \(3.1 & 3.2\), revealed that behavioural change amongst entrepreneurs stimulates small firm growth particularly when it nurtures interpersonal trust, learning and business\-related networking. This change process recognises the importance of entrepreneurs developing ‘strategic space’ \(3.1\), that allows them to reflect on their learning and affords them, as owner\-managers and entrepreneurs, access to resources, motivation and capabilities to review and transform existing practices within their firms. 

 Further research undertaken by Anderson \(3.3\), on action\-learning in small firms, identified the importance of ‘critical reflection’ amongst entrepreneurs, especially when they are taken out of their everyday work environment. ‘Critical reflection’ is the process through which owner\-managers and entrepreneurs take time to consider their actions and the resulting consequences, to enable them to identify opportunities as well as ways to resolve problems and difficulties in their firms. Finally, Giordano’s research \(3.4\) on the effects of EU funded programmes, found that cultivating durable networks is a crucial element in maximising the impact of support programmes on participating firms. This form of networking between local firms has been shown to stimulate growth \(3.4\). His research also emphasised the importance of local and regional stakeholder partnerships in enhancing leadership development and small firm growth \(3.5 & 3.6\). 

 The concepts of ‘strategic space’ and ‘critical reflection’ influenced LEAD, a previous European\-funded programme for entrepreneurs, delivered by ULMS researchers from 2009 to 2012 and are integral to the Growth Catalyst programme, started in 2014. The research carried out by Giordano embedded a networking dimension in the Growth Catalyst programme, in the form of durable peer\-to\-peer collaboration between participants and the development of strong partnership working between Growth Catalyst and key City\-Region stakeholders. 

 The research and its key concepts have been applied in the design and delivery of the Growth Catalyst in three ways: a series of master classes and professional business coaching sessions that have encouraged entrepreneurs to recognise the importance of developing ‘strategic space’ \(3.1 & 3.2\); action\-learning sets \(in groups of 4 to 5\) are run throughout the programme encouraging ‘critical reflection’ and peer\-to\-peer learning on how to tackle common issues in their respective firms \(3.3\); and actively strengthening networking amongst participants and relationships with key business support stakeholders in the City\-Region, to facilitate greater partnership working with entrepreneurs to help stimulate their growth. This relationship with the research ensures the programme’s distinctiveness from other City\-Region business support programmes and has shaped the impact that Growth Catalyst has had on small firms’ leadership and firm growth.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Between 2014 and 2019, 176 entrepreneurs from 7 cohorts each completed the 8\-month Growth Catalyst programme. Significantly, many of those participating had little, or no previous formal business education so the programme has provided an important opportunity to develop the leadership capabilities of entrepreneurs in the City\-Region. The impact of the programme is demonstrated through evidence at the individual, firm, and City\-region levels. Without the contribution of the underpinning research to the design and delivery of the programme these impacts would not otherwise have occurred. Ongoing impact is further demonstrated by an extension of the programme from 2019 to 2021, supported by £1m of European funding. 

 An independent European\-funding programme evaluation \(5.1\), a follow\-on survey \(5.2\) and an analysis of firm investment \(5.3\) shows that firms whose leaders completed Growth Catalyst grew faster, invested more and created more jobs than other small firms in the City\-Region that did not participate in the programme \(see Table 1\). Between 2014 and 2018, 250 additional full\-time jobs were created by Growth Catalyst firms from 6 cohorts \(5.2, pg 29\-30\). An additional 83 full\-time jobs were created from cohort 7 in 2019 \(5.2, pg 37\). 

 Table 1: Comparing the performance of Growth Catalyst firms with non\-participating small firms in the Liverpool City\-Region 2014\-2018 \(Source: See 5.1, 5.2 & 5.3\) 

| **Indicators of firm performance** | **Growth Catalyst firms** | **Other small firms in the City\-Region** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turnover growth \(5.1, pg 56 & 5.2, pg 24\)  \(% increase, 2014\-2018\) | **\+49%** | \+1% |
| Investment growth \(5.3\)  \(% increase, 2014\-2018\) | **\+38%** | \-10% |
| Job creation \(5.1, pg 61 & 5.2, pg 29\)  \(average increase in staffing levels, per firm, 2014\-2018\) | **2 jobs per firm** | No overall increase |

 This evidence shows the significant impact of Growth Catalyst on small firm growth in the City\-Region. Crucially, 7 out of 10 entrepreneurs attributed their firm’s growth to the practical developments in individual leadership gained from the programme \(5.2, pg 26\). 

###  4.1. Impact on individual leadership development 

 Evidence from entrepreneurs completing Growth Catalyst demonstrates the effects of applying the concepts of ‘strategic space’ and ‘critical reflection’ on individual leadership development \(5.2, pg 10 & 5.4\). For example, the owner of a fast\-growing, service sector business explained that the programme helped them to *“*\[d\] *evelop a strategy rather than a fantasy goal for the future… it has given me the skill set to manage it properly rather than let the growth get out of control”* \(5.4, pgs 3 & 6\). The owner of a marketing firm emphasised the significance of learning about ‘strategic space’ arguing that, *“*\[the programme\] *gives you time to think… the* \[coaching\] *mentor session, the action learning, it forces you to think about your business, in an abstract and practical way,* \[about\] *how am I going to solve… problems”* \(5.4, pgs 47\-48\). An independent European\-funding programme evaluation reported that participants had a 100% satisfaction rate for the value of the learning acquired \(5.1, pg 46\). Moreover, 70% of programme participants stated that they became a better leader and manager, with improved strategic decision\-making skills and better approaches to delegation \(5.2, pg 35\). 

 An industrial cleaning business owner reported that the content of the master classes and coaching had helped him to reflect that, *“it changed me as a person and the way I operate as a manager. I realised I was being a manager and not a leader. I was firefighting problems on a daily basis and not having time to do what I needed”* \(5.4, pgs 40 & 42\). The Director of a family manufacturing firm explained, “ *I gained a lot from the coaching*, *the action learning was really good, we actually followed it on in our little group and we have had maybe 3 meetings since* \[Growth Catalyst ended\]… *I could pick up the phone now and ask for advice”* \(5.4, pg 28\). 

 Independent Assessors for the Small Business Charter Review stated that ULMS has a *“very active and grateful cohort of Growth Catalyst SME business owners”* that *“benefited hugely from the Programme… and are excellent ambassadors for the management school and* \[the\] *wider university”* \(5.5, pg 30\). 

###  4.2. Impact on firm\-level practices and networking 

 As a result of the changes in leadership generated from programme\-learning, entrepreneurs implemented improvements in workforce planning and practices within their firms. Two\-thirds of programme participants reported making organisational changes, that led to improved employee communication, knowledge sharing and staff training \(5.2, pg 14\). The programme has made them better managers, particularly in terms of strategic planning, mentoring and coaching employees, workforce planning, managing conflict, building teams and performance management \(5.2, pg 10, Figure 1\). <sup> </sup>A family business owner explained that her mindset changed because of Growth Catalyst so she treated her staff differently *,* asking them if there is there anything she can do to help, or make their job better or easier *“because you want the best out of your employees”* \(5.4, pg 18\). 

 The follow\-up survey found that Growth Catalyst firms were in a strong financial position \(5.2, pg 32, Table 26\) and were planning growth in the next five years. Strategies that stood out amongst Growth Catalyst firms included the diversification of markets, geographical expansion, the expansion of premises and acquisition of new equipment and attracting external investment.  Almost two\-thirds said they were planning to increase their workforce \(5.2, pg 31, Table 25\). 

 Two thirds of participants also stated that, since completing Growth Catalyst, they are more convinced of future business success and are better equipped at dealing with crises \(5.2, pg 32\). A female CEO explained that, after taking over from her parents, the programme had helped her to grow the business, *“I started off* \[in the business\] *with massive imposter syndrome. I didn’t have really much experience in running a business as I’d never done it before, I was learning on the job and… the coaching, the action learning and the masterclasses as a combination… helped give me… clarity on how I was supposed to run the business*” \(5.4, pg 14\). <sup> </sup> 

 Participants reported that they had benefitted from revenue creating opportunities made available through the peer network of Growth Catalyst. <sup> </sup>The owner of a digital marketing agency explained that his firm “ *got* \[three\] *contracts with other peers in…* \[the\] *network*” to the value of *“at least £40,000”* \(5.4, pg 56\). <sup> </sup>The owner of a marketing firm stated that, for a fellow participant, they did *“£10\-15,000 of* \[rebranding\] *work…*\[as\] *we knew each other and* \[we\] *were trusted”* \(5.4, pg 51\). 

###  4.3. Impact on City\-Region economic development 

 Whilst the above demonstrates the changes within firms as a result of entrepreneurs’ participation, Growth Catalyst has also had a material effect on the local economy. The independent European\-funding evaluation of Growth Catalyst estimated that it contributed almost £5m in GVA to the City\-Region economy: a three\-fold return for every £1 of European funding invested \(5.1, pg 62\). <sup> </sup>This is significant because existing small firms in Liverpool have been performing below the national average in terms of growth, investment and job creation \(City\-Region GVA per capita is only 75% of the UK average; 5.1, pg 8\). 

 In 2019, Growth <sup> </sup>Catalyst was acknowledged in the Scale\-up Institute’s Annual Review of UK business support programmes, as providing support for local small firms to stimulate growth \(5.6, pg 21\). <sup> </sup>Another independent consultancy report, on City\-Region business support provision, recognised the New Markets 2 programme, of which Growth Catalyst is a part, as offering *“a more intensive and tailored service which is focused on growth implementation”* \(5.7, pg 25 of report\). 

 Growth Catalyst has stimulated partnership working by participant entrepreneurs with key City\-Region stakeholders including the Federation of Small Business, Merseyside Special Investment Fund and Sci\-Tech Daresbury \(5.8\). Local stakeholders also acknowledge the impact that the research\-informed programme has had. <sup> </sup>The CEO of the Women’s Organisation, a Liverpool NGO, stated “\[Growth Catalyst\] *has longevity and a strong track record in providing bespoke leadership development to help small firms to scale\-up to help drive economic impact in the* \[City\-Region\]” \(5.8, pg 10\). A civil servant responsible for European funding in the Liverpool City\-Region Combined Authority affirmed that *“Growth Catalyst is a well\-managed programme, which has delivered a range of significant outputs which means that it has contributed, more broadly, to the development of the small firm ecosystem in the Liverpool City\-Region”* \(5.8, pg 7\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Globally, specialised environmental courts and tribunals \(ECTs\) are dynamic adjudicatory forums offering a flexible mechanism for dispute resolution. Professor Gita Gill’s India research is the first study based in a developing country of a specialised environmental tribunal\-National Green Tribunal \(NGT\). The research impact is primarily in India, but with substantial international dimensions at the United Nations level. Gill’s research has: 

1.  shaped and improved India’s NGT judicial practice by addressing scientific uncertainty and the application of the precautionary principle for better informed decision\-making, and changed its participatory procedures resulting in greater accessibility and flexibility; 

1.  enhanced and enabled two Indian NGOs to access environmental justice through increased awareness and capacity\-building that resulted in E\-filing cases for the first time before the NGT, and registering complaints and obtaining a compensation order from the National Human Rights Commission \(NHRC\); and 

1.  influenced the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\) guidance related to environmental adjudication in ECTs, as evidenced by citation and adoption of best practices for policy makers and judiciary at the global level. 
","
 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 Gill’s research is the first in\-depth empirical study of India’s National Green Tribunal \(NGT\). The NGT, established in 2010, is a specialised statutory judicial body with legal and scientific judges adjudicating environmental laws and disputes involving multi\-disciplinary solutions. The Tribunal offers wide access to environmental justice through five benches covering all regions of India. Funded by a British Academy Grant \(2013\-16\) Gill’s Indian fieldwork includes 110 recorded interviews, analysis of 1,130 reported judgments and court observations. Gill’s research builds on ethnographic work with the NGT judges. This resulted in unique interview access to NGT Judges, Registrar General, Registrars and inspection of internal court documentation. 

 Gill’s empirical findings resulted in the first monograph devoted to a specialised environmental tribunal from a developing country \[ **R1**\]. The key findings of the monograph are that the NGT: \(a\) delivers consistency in inter\-disciplinary decision\-making involving technically complex and polycentric environmental problems; \(b\) embeds international environmental law principles in the domestic legal context; \(c\) applies a human rights lens to address environmental protection; and \(d\) facilitates access to environmental justice through a liberal interpretation of the term ‘affected environmental party’, as well as offering speedier decisions and lower costs than traditional courts. 

 Gill’s NGT research reflects a practice\-based approach that critically analyses characteristics of complex environmental disputes and decision\-making. The range and depth of Gill’s research identifies and promotes the innovative role of NGT decision\-makers and their ability to reach inter\-disciplinary holistic decisions by harmonising legal norms and scientific knowledge. Gill’s 2016 and 2017 articles address the relative paucity of environmental empirical studies concerning how scientific knowledge is utilised in judicial decision\-making \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. Her findings demonstrate how the NGT judges configure the boundaries of adjudication by adopting both problem\-solving and often policy\-creation approaches in their decision\-making to ensure protection of human health and environment. The benefits of subject specific knowledge on the inter\-disciplinary bench promotes better environmental decisions while simultaneously recognising scientific uncertainty in environmental matters. 

 Building on her innovative findings, Gill’s 2019 article stresses the importance of a greater understanding of the precautionary principle that emphasises caution in environmental decisions in the absence of scientific certainty \[ **R4**\]. Gill’s unique Indian data provides a path\-breaking, observational study of the judiciary’s understanding and application of the precautionary principle and related scientific uncertainty. Gill creates a practical, explanatory, environmental governance framework that illustrates levels of scientific certainty/uncertainty and categorises acceptable parallel legal standards of proof for judicial decision\-making in the application of the precautionary principle. The framework facilitates precautionary interventions with greater certainty and develops a ‘scientifically\-legal’ lexicon of meaning for the judiciary that promotes swift and uniform environmental decision\-making. 

  

 Additionally, Gill’s research outcomes are manifested in social value engagement through grassroots activism with two Indian NGOs resulting in the protection of human rights and the environment. In India 66 percent of the population \(895 million\) are rural dwellers. These people are often disenfranchised victims of environmental degradation and violation of human rights due to their poverty, unawareness, and illiteracy. Their effective access to environmental justice and protection of human rights requires addressing issues of inequality, inequity, recognition, and capability. Gill promotes the intertwined crucial relationship between the human right to life, health, and environmental protection \[ **R5**\]. Her research advances the importance of accessing environmental justice through statutory institutions, i.e., the NGT and NHRC. Both institutions offer greater accessibility, flexibility, relaxed petitioner standing, and lower costs that enhance legal process and remedies \[ **R1**, **R5**, **R6**\]. 

 Gill’s research incorporated by UNEP stresses the importance of dedicated ECTs to advance the environmental rule of law and promote sustainable development. Her research identifies NGT as a best practice institutional role model relevant to those developing countries that are exploring, creating, or improving environmental dispute resolution institutions \[ **R1**, **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Gill’s research impact results from direct engagement with institutions and citizens in India, and influence on UNEP. In India, the beneficiaries include NGT judges whose judicial practice has been influenced, improved, and changed; and two grass\-root environmental NGOs through enhanced awareness and capacity building, thereby resulting in E\-filing cases for the first time before the NGT and registering complaints and obtaining a compensation order from the NHRC. On the international level, UNEP has benefitted from Gill’s research, evidenced by citing and adopting best practices to improve environmental adjudication in ECTs. 

 **4.1 Shaping and Improving India’s NGT Judicial Practice** 

 Gill’s innovative inter\-disciplinary research on the relationship between scientific uncertainty and judicial governance has resulted in better informed environmental decision\-making. Based on extensive discussions with Gill between 2014\-2020 and an on\-going research relationship, the NGT Scientific Judge, Dr Ajay Deshpande, reconsidered his perception of how the environmental adjudicatory framework, the NGT, addressed scientific knowledge and evidence, and the use of environmental law principles, especially the precautionary principle \[ **E1**\]. Consequently, the NGT Scientific Judge, as the Chairman of the 2019 NGT National Monitoring Committee for Hazardous Waste Management, found Gill’s work ‘ *very useful in evolving the formulation for effective implementation of the hazardous waste rules and forming an opinion of the expert committee*’ that led to ‘ *informed decision\-making in the application of precautionary principle*’ \[ **E1**\]. Gill’s research \[ **R3**\] was cited in the 2019 Interim Report of Monitoring Committee on Management of Hazardous Waste \[ **E2**, p20\]. The 2019 Interim Report on Management of Hazardous Waste was submitted and accepted in its totality by the NGT. The Tribunal in the case of *Rajiv Narayan v Union of India* \(NGT Order, 12<sup>th</sup> April 2019\) directed that the 2019 Interim Report’s recommendations be fully implemented and monitored by the Chief Secretaries at the state level and the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and Central Pollution Control Board at the national level. Hazardous waste remains a major and continuous environmental challenge in India. 

  

 Gill’s direct engagement and impact on NGT judicial practice is further evidenced by the 2014\-15 field work interaction between Gill and the NGT Registrar General, Judge Sanjay Kumar. The Registrar General’s court, under the NGT Rules 2011, decides all questions arising out of the scrutiny of the applications and appeals before they are registered. Principles drawn from Gill’s *‘thought\-provoking, practical and original research’* \[ **R5**\] led to the Registrar General re\-evaluating the use of discretion, procedural requirements, and decisions under the 2011 NGT Rules to promote participatory procedures that help to deliver greater accessibility and flexibility \[ **E3**, p2\]. Consequently, the Registrar General, based on Gill’s research **,** made the following changes: \(a\) testimonies of four witnesses admitted in the Bengali language instead of mandatory English or Hindi language \[ **E3**, p4\]; \(b\) extended the time\-period for filing replies or other processes beyond the statutory limit \[ **E3**, p6\]; and \(c\) secured police protection for official on\-site investigators sent by the NGT for fact verification \[ **E3**, p7\]. 

 **4.2 Enhancing and Enabling Indian NGOs to Access Environmental Justice through NGT and NHRC** 

 Gill’s research and grass\-root activism with two Indian environmental NGOs, Parvayaran Mitra and InnerVoice Foundation, successfully enhanced and enabled victims of environmental degradation to obtain redress through NGT and NHRC. 

 Gill acts as an Advisor and Trainer with Paryavaran Mitra \(Friends of Environment\) to support victims of environmental degradation through awareness and capacity\-building empowerment programmes, and to enforce their environmental\-human rights by E\-filing cases in the NGT. For example, in January 2020, Gill produced a Toolkit titled *Access to Environmental Justice in India through Courts* based on her rich research and writing, including \[ **R1** to **R6**\]. The 32\-page Toolkit is published in English, Gujarati, and Hindi, and is available free on Parvayaran Mitra’s website. The Toolkit extends public accessibility to environmentally affected parties, citizens, and environmental activists. It provides significant practical information and guidance to access NGT and NHRC in order to obtain speedy justice, redress environmental damage or harm, and enforce fundamental and legal rights. The Toolkit ‘ *support\[s\] capacity\-building through growing awareness of environmental laws and access to environmental justice through the Indian judiciary*’ \[ **E4a**, p3\]. The Toolkit was launched and tested on 18\-19 January 2020 in Ahmedabad \(India\) at a two\-day Awareness and Capacity Building Workshop. The Workshop was attended by 70 people, including environmentally affected villagers, Panchayat \(elected village and community\) grass\-root leaders, environmental activists, local pressure groups and environmental professionals. Paper copies of the Toolkit were given to all participants. Gill, in the Workshop, explained and demystified the powers, procedures and E\-filing provisions of the NGT. The Workshop Report \[ **E4b**, p32\-45\] evidences presentation, simulation, and small group\-work exercises. The participants identified their local problems and Gill helped them understand procedure, drafting, and how to E\-file an environmental case before NGT **.** 

 The Workshop Results \[ **E4c**, p47\-54\] evidences that all participants stated a raised environmental awareness and 91% of rural participants felt empowered to pursue a legal remedy in the NGT \[ **E4c**, p49\]. To quote, in translation \(a\) **‘** *So many new information was received which we were not aware about… The E\-filing about NGT was helpful and we will go to NGT’*; \(b\) ‘ *I have been trying to solve the issues in my village but no\-one is listening to me. But now I will go to the NGT and achieve my goals*’; \(c\) ‘ *From all the info that I got from this workshop I will use E\-filing in NGT to help my community and make sure my efforts are not futile. I will now use NGT as a forum to fulfil my purpose and access to justice. We've been suffering for years and this workshop has given us hope that environmental justice is possible*’ \[ **E4c**, p47\-48\]. The Workshop was a ‘ *huge success and Gill’s contribution was immensely helpful and beneficial especially on E\-filing before the NGT*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 A direct outcome of the Toolkit and Workshop is the E\-filing, for the first time by Paryavaran Mitra, of two cases before the NGT. Gill’s involvement was central in drafting and E\-filing these cases. Gill’s research and direct involvement ‘ *has brought change resulting in Paryavaran Mitra approaching the NGT for environmental justice*’ \[ **E5**\]. Her research was cited in both cases. The first case *Chetan Vyas v Swan Energy Limited* \(E\-filing Number 2704105001602020, 15 June 2020\) \[ **E6**, p1\] supported by Paryavaran Mitra, challenges the construction, without environmental clearance, of a gas\-based power plant that will affect seven villages in Gujarat’s Amreli district having 20,000 inhabitants, 5,000 fishermen and 5,000 head of livestock. The excerpt of Gill’s research \[ **R1**\] on an effective environmental clearance is cited in Para 18 and Annexure A\-4 \[ **E6**, p13 and p67\-69\]. The second case *Mahesh Pandya v Gujarat Pollution Control Board* \(E\-filing Number 2704105002762020, 23 July 2020\) \[ **E7**, p1\] seeks the postponement of an environmental public hearing for a proposed refinery extension project during COVID\-19 restriction times. The proposed Gujarat refinery project will affect 14 villages in Jamnagar district with 32,724 villagers, and 11 villages in Devbhumi Dwarka district with 35,092 villagers. In total 67,816 villagers’ lives would be detrimentally affected due to the proposed refinery that may cause adverse environmental consequences. Gill’s research \[ **R1**\] on the importance of an effective public hearing concerning environmental projects is cited in Para 20 and Annexure A\-8 \[ **E7**, p10 and p56\]. On\-going research between Gill and Paryavaran Mitra focuses on her new British Academy project involving capacity\-building and access to environmental justice concerning rehabilitation and resettlement due to compulsory land acquisition \(2020\-23; SRG20\\200093\). 

 Gill’s on\-going advisory input resulted in InnerVoice Foundation’s ability to approach NHRC regarding arsenic groundwater contamination, health and human rights violations. As a ‘ *direct result of the practical insights flowing from \[Gill’s\] published research, legal expertise and involvement*’ \[ **E8**\] InnerVoice has: 

 \(1\) Filed complaints before NHRC that concerned 60,000\-100,000 school children and residents in Jamalpur, Chakiya, Sonbarsa, Raniganj and Gonhiya Chhapra, Ballia \(Uttar Pradesh villages\). The NHRC received and admitted the complaints and strongly directed the state Government of Uttar Pradesh to take up the matter urgently and undertake remedial action \(Case file 33723/24/10/2016\) \[ **E8**, p2\]; and \(2\) obtained a suitable compensation order from NHRC for next of kin of the deceased who died because of consuming arsenic contaminated water \(Order 30<sup>th</sup> July 2015\) \[ **E8**, p3\]. 

 **4.3 Influencing United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\)** 

 In 2015\-16, UNEP drew heavily on Gill’s research and expertise for its publication titled ‘Environmental Courts and Tribunals: A Guide for Policy Makers’ \[ **E9**\]. UNEP’s 2016 Guide is considered as a ‘ *truly valuable and practical ECT guide and roadmap*’ \[ **E9**\] for policy makers and judiciary for adopting best practices to improve environmental adjudication in their quest to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2016 Guide acknowledges Gill as a global access to justice expert \[ **E9**, Appendix E, p123\] on ECTs, and especially the NGT. The 2016 Guide incorporates Gill’s research \[ **R1**, **R2**\] by citing and adopting best practices to improve integrated law and scientific competence, both crucial to successful decision\-making in complex environmental cases \[ **E9**, Endnote 63, p98\]. Other ‘best practices adopted include procedural flexibility, transparent selection of adjudicators, liberal standing provision, stakeholder consultation process, and continuing professional development of adjudicators \[ **E9**, Endnotes 61, 62, 64, 69, 78 and 85; p98\-99\]. Examples of 2016 Guide usage include UNEP \(Law Division\) organising a workshop run in February 2017, which ‘enhanced the capacity’ of members of the Kenyan National Environmental Tribunal and provided tribunal members with *‘practical examples* *to adjudicate environmental matters*’ \[ **E10**, p2\]. On the international level, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to enhance the effectiveness of state based non\-judicial mechanisms \(such as ECTs\) in cases of business\-related human rights abuses, used the Guide as a resource for experts to use in its Accountability and Remedy Project II \[ **E10**, p2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Unwanted blood clots are a major cause of heart attacks. Ticagrelor is a drug that prevents blood clot formation. Clinical studies pioneered by Professor Rob Storey validated the use of a novel twice\-daily 60\-mg dosing regimen of ticagrelor for long\-term use beyond the first year of heart attack treatment in large international cohorts. This dosing regimen, approved in 2016 by the EU and NICE has been incorporated into international guidelines. It is cost\-effective, and through clinical uptake, has improved the prognosis of heart attack patients at risk of a second heart attack or stroke. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Every day in the UK, approximately 515 people go to the hospital with a heart attack. Most heart attacks, and strokes, are caused by blood clots and can be treated and prevented by antiplatelet drugs. Even when patients have been treated for heart attack, they are at increased risk of a subsequent heart attack, stroke or death. For this reason, dual antiplatelet therapy \(aspirin plus another specific antiplatelet agent\) is recommended for one year after the initial event. 

 Professor Storey led UK investigations of the antiplatelet drug, ticagrelor, in patients treated for heart attack that led to its approval and first\-line use for heart attack. Subsequent research in 10,793 patients compared ticagrelor\-versus\-clopidogrel\-treatment, demonstrated a 50% reduction in stent thrombosis, a potentially fatal complication of heart artery stenting, and an 18% reduction in mortality during the first year with ticagrelor treatment \[R1\]. However, 20% of heart attack patients go on to have a subsequent heart attack or a stroke or die from cardiovascular causes in the 3 years after completing their first year of treatment. 

 Given this long\-term risk in heart attack survivors, Professor Storey led investigations of long\-term treatment with ticagrelor in patients who were more than 1 year after their heart attack and had higher risk of further cardiovascular events in a study known as PEGASUS\-TIMI 54. This study showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events with each of two doses of ticagrelor \(the usual heart attack dose of 90 mg twice\-daily and a new dose of 60 mg twice\-daily\) compared to placebo \[R2\], with a marked benefit in those continuing on or with only a short break in dual antiplatelet therapy before entering the study \[R3\] and evidence of mortality reduction in the highest\-risk patients, such as those with peripheral arterial disease \[R4\]. 

 Professor Storey also designed and led a platelet function substudy which explained the efficacy of the 60 mg twice\-daily ticagrelor dose. This regime achieved high levels of peak and trough platelet inhibition in nearly all patients, similar to that observed with the standard 90 mg twice\-daily dose during long\-term therapy after heart attack \[R5\]. Also ticagrelor 60 mg twice\-daily was better tolerated by patients due to lower rates of bleeding and other adverse effects \[R6\]. This evidence underpinned the selection and approval of the ticagrelor 60 mg dose for long\-term treatment after the first year of heart attack treatment.

 Regulatory approval for ticagrelor 60 mg for long\-term treatment after a heart attack 

 Following the results of the PEGASUS\-TIMI 54 study **\[R2, R5, R6\] **,* European, US and more than 110 global regulatory bodies have approved the 60 mg twice\-daily dose so that this can now be used as extended therapy in patients from 1 year after their heart attack \[S1, S2\]. The change to ticagrelor’s EU labelling to incorporate ticagrelor 60 mg came into effect from November 2016 \[S1\]. 

 Endorsement of ticagrelor 60 mg in international guidelines 

 Following guideline recommendations in 2015 supporting the first\-line use of ticagrelor 90 mg in the first year after a heart attack \[R1, S3\], extended treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg beyond the first year has now been supported by the European Society of Cardiology 2019 guidelines on the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes \[S4\]; Professor Storey was a member of this task force. Consequently, ticagrelor 60 mg twice\-daily has increasingly been adopted for reducing risk in patients with a previous heart attack. These patients now benefit from lower risks of a subsequent heart attack, stroke and death during long\-term treatment while avoiding the adverse effect of long\-term anti\-platelet agent use. 

 Cost\-effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg after heart attacks 

 The National Institute of Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) were advised by Professor Storey as an external expert on use of antiplatelet agents to reduce risk of secondary heart attacks. They subsequently approved ticagrelor 60 mg twice\-daily as a cost\-effective option for extended therapy in patients with prior heart attack \[S5\]. The incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio \(ICER\), determined with a worse\-case scenario \(probabilistic modelling\), is £24,711, which falls within the acceptable quality\-adjusted life year \(QALY\) threshold range set by NICE of £20\- 30K, and therefore, a willingness\-to\-pay was established. 

 Commercial impact 

 Ticagrelor was reformulated as a 60 mg tablet in 2016, and prescriptions for ticagrelor 60 mg increased 20\-fold per month in the 6 months following Professor Storey’s PEGASUS\-TIMI 54 platelet substudy publication and a further 20\-fold following approval by NICE with 204,991 items prescribed in the month of December 2019, as shown in the figure below \(NHS Business Authority English Prescribing dataset\). Overall global sales of ticagrelor reached $400M in Q1 of 2019, an increase of 19% from all sales of 2018 \[S6\]. AstraZeneca successfully secured a patent series to describe the results of the PEGASUS\-TIMI 54 study and its platelet function substudy; Professor Storey is designated as an inventor on this series \[S7\]. 

 In 2019, Professor Storey was the winner of the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society Research of the Year Prize following a presentation that included the beneficial impact of Ticagrelor on stent thrombosis risk in heart attack patients.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Somerville's research has underpinned queer arts events in Worcester and has had a direct impact on the organisational development of Worcestershire Pride; in particular, the embedding of its commitment to queer arts in its Constitution. His work has led to the recognition and support of LGBTQ\+ events by Worcester City Council and has increased community awareness and understanding of queer arts and related LGBTQ\+ issues in the city. A queer arts festival was initiated by Somerville \(the first of its kind in the city\), which has had impacts on culture and the community, enriching lives and deepening knowledge. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research supporting this impact case study includes two performance projects, *Admiring La Stupenda* \(2013\-2019\) and *Pavarotti and Me* \(2015\-2020\) \(References 1\). Both performances offer queer perspectives on opera, and both employ strategies familiar to queer cabaret and contemporary performance/Live Art. Research into the relationship of Live Art to opera \(Reference 2\) also underpins this case study. Both performances, and other short works \( *Oh\! England*, *The Mermaid*, *Trio xxx* and *Opera Lap Dance*\) performed in Worcester during this period, employ autobiography as a tool to interrogate a subject \(in this case opera\) while simultaneously decentring heteronormative claims to authority over this subject. In these performances the identity of the ‘opera queen’ is presented as that of an outsider, not only from wider heteronormative society, but also outside the queer community where the opera queen is a bygone, forgotten identity. *Admiring La Stupenda* arises from a body of research into ‘the operatic’ and positions the opera queen as a conduit to hidden ways of knowing connected to opera and by extension Somerville’s lived experience and emotional world. *Pavarotti and Me* arises from a further exploration of the potential of autobiography to reveal understandings about the subject \(opera\) and the self in relation to it. The primary insight of the research therefore concerns the power of queer autobiography to participate in knowledge generation and dissemination, while at the same time challenging established ways of knowing. 

  

 Somerville’s performances and publications are part of his wider project to interrogate and facilitate queer identity. This project – deploying and drawing on autobiography \- led to and informed his work on queer arts events in Worcester, and his development of impact related to increased awareness of queer arts and related LGBTQ\+ issues in the city. Insights gained during the creation and performance of these outputs were a vital resource when mentoring, supporting, and programming other queer artists in the arts events of Worcestershire Pride and in positioning queer arts festival in the cultural landscape of Worcester, a rural city. Findings on rural queer identity led, specifically, to Worcestershire Pride adopting the theme of ‘Out in the Country’ for its 2018 activities. 

 Somerville, senior lecturer at University of Worcester, was the primary and only researcher working on these projects from 2013 to 2020, which build on a body of work in queer performance in the UK since 2009 and on journalism, art direction \(Mondi Award winner 1999\), performance making, activism and queer festival management \(Johannesburg Pride Co\-Chair 2001\) in South Africa dating back to 1996.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 Somerville’s research activities have had four distinct but related types of impact. 

 First, Somerville has had a direct impact on the organisational development of Worcestershire Pride. He was centrally involved in the establishment of a committee and the Constitution for Worcestershire Pride and in the enabling of a productive dialogue between Worcestershire Pride and Worcester City Council. He advised on governance documents, matters of procedure, and fundraising. Through this, Somerville’s work has had an impact on the policies and processes of the City Council, specifically leading it to recognise and support LGBTQ\+ culture \(Source A\). 

 Second, impact has occurred as a result of Somerville’s key role in the embedding of arts activities in the work of Worcestershire Pride, ensuring an impact on audiences and the local community in terms of increasing awareness, knowledge and understanding of LGBTQ\+ issues. These activities have impacted on culture and the community, enriching lives and deepening knowledge. The queer arts festival initiated by Somerville was the first of its kind in the city \(Sources A, C and D\). Somerville’s work has impacted on the legacy of Pride on queer performance in the city’s arts venues. 

 Third, by encouraging, supporting and mentoring other queer artists to programme and present work in Worcester, Somerville’s activities have had an impact on the knowledge and working practices of these artists and performers within the context of rural LGBTQ\+ culture \(Sources E and G\). 

 Fourth, Somerville’s performances of *Admiring La Stupenda* and *Pavarotti and Me* have had an impact on increased awareness of LGBTQ\+ issues in Worcester and beyond. Both pieces ‘bring to the forefront thought\-provoking and intellectually stimulating topics of how opera, at its most fundamental and raw self \[is\] a clear challenge to our binary society and as such, Queer.’ \(Source G\) 

 Somerville was recognised by the city of Worcester for his contribution to the LGBTQ\+ community when he received the ‘Mayor’s Best of Worcester Award’ 2020 \(Source H\). 

 Appropriately, in the case of a project concerning queer performance and art making, the route from research to impact here does not follow a simple, linear or direct path. Activities underpinning research output creation and dissemination facilitated the realisation of impact through a fluid dialogue between practice as research, public engagement and impact activity. This dialogue informed the creative development of performances and enabled a public platform for research dissemination, while at the same time impacting upon and underpinning the development of Worcestershire Pride, of queer arts events in Worcester, and the work of queer artists. As Nicola Longworth\-Cook \(Out2gether\) puts it \(Source F\), ‘Daniel’s research activities created a vibrant and exciting spark in Worcester. They captured the energy and the anticipation of the coming Pride events and brought disparate sections of the local LGBT\+ community together to share opportunities to experience queer art in a way that had hitherto not existed.’ 

 In June 2016 the committee’s first public event was held; a vigil outside the Guildhall following the Pulse nightclub massacre. The Pride flag was flown from the Georgian building for the first time in its history. In May 2017, the first ‘Sexuality Showcase’ was held at Worcester Arts Workshop. As producer for what was a pilot for a queer arts festival to coincide with the inaugural Pride 2017, Somerville programmed and mentored acts by queer artists in Worcester. 

 As Director of Arts for Worcestershire Pride, Somerville ran the Worcestershire Pride Festival of Arts and Culture 2017, which involved participation by local arts organisations including Worcester Arts Workshop, Worcester Museum and Art Gallery, and the Hive, where exhibitions of queer art were held for the first time. 39 artists appeared, reaching approx. 300 members of the public, enriching culture and awareness, and impacting artists who were given a platform that was otherwise unavailable and the public that encountered queer art on a scale not seen previously in Worcester. Amanda Hickling \(Source B\) writes that Somerville’s central involvement with Worcestershire Pride saw an ‘increase in the LGBTQ\+ and queer arts scene in Worcester. It bought members of the community & LGBTQ\+ community together with a common interest in the arts and culture.’ Other showcase efforts were inspired by this, including a festival organised in August 2017 by the Worcester graduate company Provisional Act Theatre Company that invited Somerville to present *Admiring La Stupenda*. Nicole Roman \(Source C\) writes ‘by being an educator, a performer and a fierce advocate for queer performance’, Somerville ‘made an impact on the arts scene in Worcester and left an outstanding legacy to the city.’

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 




For two decades, the St Andrews team \( [SCAPE](https://scapetrust.org/): Scotland’s Coastal Archaeology and the Problem of Erosion\) has evolved citizen and community centred approaches to researching coastal heritage that is increasingly threatened by the effects of climate change. This has included a strategic effort to involve the public in the creation of a register of coastal heritage at risk for Scotland, which is now used to prioritise funding by Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\). Between August 2013 and March 2020, the team’s participatory citizen science methods have led to 536 people \(volunteers\) updating information on the condition of 1,557 coastal heritage sites, and 683 people \(volunteers\) involved in research and interpretation projects at 16 threatened coastal sites. SCAPE’s work is given as an example of best practise in citizen science by the US Parks Service and has been praised by the President of the Society for American Archaeology for shifting attitudes towards the role of local communities in mitigating heritage loss, seeing them as *“not only first responders but true knowledge producers”* \(2016\). This impact case study provides evidence of the well\-being benefits to individuals of involvement in project activities and gives examples of threatened sites transformed by community action into heritage assets for the future. This impact case study also shows how the team’s international reach has been translated into action in new projects based upon their model of participatory research, including by England’s Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network \(CITiZAN\), Maine’s Midden Minders, Florida’s Heritage Monitoring Scouts \(HMS\) and by projects in Puerto Rico and Iceland.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Climate change is threatening an uncalculated number of archaeological sites globally and those at the coast are already experiencing the most dramatic damage and loss. These contain evidence of humanity’s past and are an irreplaceable resource of learning for contemporary society. In the face of near certain acceleration of climate change impacts, there is an urgent need for new approaches to manage threatened coastal heritage. 

 Since 2000, Dawson and his team have evolved methods applied in Scotland that integrate citizens and communities in researching coastal heritage at risk. These methods are increasingly applied in other parts of the world \(R1\). Much of the work has been in collaboration with SCAPE, a research organisation within St Andrews set up by Dawson. 

 Between 2000 and 2010, Dawson managed all new coastal heritage surveys on behalf of Historic Scotland. In 2011, he completed a desk\-based analysis of over 12,000 documented sites and devised a new method for prioritising action based upon heritage value and vulnerability \(R2\). This resulted in a database and report, with 940 sites identified as high priority and requiring immediate attention, and many others needing visits to update out\-of\-date records. 

 To provide the information needed for management, Hambly, Dawson and Graham launched the nationwide Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk Project \(SCHARP\) in August 2012. With thousands of sites spread around the country, engaging communities was crucial for compiling condition reports, reporting new discoveries and providing estimations of social and intrinsic value \(R3\).The ground\-breaking project web portal \(R4\) and mobile app allowed the public to update and edit original data, to submit photographs, to make recommendations, and to add new discoveries to the project database. 

 The updated records were analysed, and recommendations were reviewed by national and regional heritage managers. The resulting report \(2017\) took a nationwide view and provided the evidence needed to identify the most threatened sites and the coastlines most susceptible to change \(R5\). 

 The participatory research approach adopted by the team also brought to the fore the significance communities felt by moving on from monitoring and observation to taking action at locally valued eroding sites. Since August 2013, collaborative research projects at 16 threatened sites nominated by communities have involved archaeological excavation, 3D digital documentation and interpretation, filmmaking and, in one case, the relocation of a site from the intertidal zone to the local Heritage Centre to create a new visitor attraction. These projects demonstrate how community\-led initiatives can be very effective in preserving the heritage values of threatened sites through the transformation of the information they hold into new knowledge and experiences \(R6\). 

 In 2018, ‘Learning from Loss’ a research collaboration led by Dawson, brought together communities, academics and heritage managers from Scotland and USA to explore public attitudes to heritage loss as a result of climate change. Their findings, along with the effectiveness of the team’s approach in integrating research with community action has influenced policy in Scotland and the US and provided a model which has been adapted and employed internationally \(R1\).

 Heritage sites are valuable archives of past change and adaptation, but globally, approximately tens of thousands are threatened by climate change and coastal processes. We have pioneered a citizen\-science approach to heritage research, management and action. Our participatory research has 1. directly engaged and brought benefits to over 1,000 people \(individuals and local communities\). In addition, 2. our analysis of crowd\-sourced data is now used by Historic Environment Scotland when prioritising funding. Finally, 3. our methodologies have been highlighted as examples of best practice and adopted by heritage organisations in Britain, Europe and North America. We are, therefore, helping change attitudes towards heritage management in the face of the climate crisis. 

 <ins>1. Individual and community</ins> <ins>benefit</ins> 

 Between August 2013 and March 2020 Dawson and team’s participatory citizen science methods in researching coastal heritage at risk in Scotland \(R3\) led to 536 people \(volunteers\) updating information on the condition of 1,557 coastal heritage sites and 683 people \(volunteers\) involved in research and interpretation projects at 16 threatened coastal sites, each nominated by the communities. Testimonials based upon evaluation interviews with 50 participants \(community members\) report significant well\-being benefits from involvement, most strongly linked to social factors and skills development. For Simon, in the Western Isles, involvement was **“one of the factors that’s pushed me into doing a Master’s degree”**. Pam in Fife said, **“I have to say the research side has been tremendous…I feel like I’ve given something back”**. Involvement for John in the Highlands was **“a big social thing and I think that’s very important”**. As a result of her experience, Jenny in Eyemouth reported **“I’ve actually found a new lease of life with this project and I think that's been very useful as you get older”** \(S1\). 

 Three community projects resulted in the transformation of threatened heritage sites, which created lasting community assets. Faced with the total destruction of a site on  [Sanday, Orkney](https://scapetrust.org/meur-burnt-mound/), Islanders relocated prehistoric structures from a beach at Meur to their Heritage Centre. Digital methods were used by the Friends of  [Eyemouth Fort](https://scapetrust.org/eyemouth-fort/), who oversaw the creation of an interactive virtual reconstruction of their eroding sixteenth\-century fort in the town’s Museum; and the Save the Wemyss Ancient Caves Society preserved the heritage values of nationally significant but endangered local heritage in their ground\-breaking virtual 4D  [Wemyss Caves](https://scapetrust.org/4d-wemyss-caves/) website and an installation in the East Wemyss Visitor Centre. The action by Sanday residents was used in the most recent Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership Report Card 2020 as an example of the “ **importance of community\-driven solutions to the loss of coastal heritage assets”** and “ **indicative of the changing approaches to managing cultural heritage that will be necessary as climate change intensifies”** \(S2\). 

 The examples above show why, in her opening address to the World Archaeology Congress \(Kyoto, 2016\), the President of the Society for American Archaeology singled out Dawson and his team for **“reaching beyond traditional heritage management”** and shifting attitudes towards acknowledging the role of local communities as **“not only first responders but true knowledge producers”** in mitigating heritage loss in the face of a growing climate emergency \(S3\). 

 Recognition of the team’s work with the public is further demonstrated by their projects winning five accolades in the biennial British Archaeological Awards \(BAA\) \- the British ‘Archaeology Oscars’. They won Best Community Project \(in both 2014 and 2018\); Best Innovation \(2014\) and were runner up in Best Presentation \(in both 2014 and 2018: S4\). This number of awards has not been achieved in the BAAs before. 

 <ins>2. National policy and management</ins> 

 The team’s research into identifying and quantifying Scotland’s coastal archaeological resources and developing robust methods for prioritisation has resulted in management recommendations \(R5\) used by Historic Environment Scotland’s Archaeology Grants programme “ **in determining where to allocate resources”**. HES adds that **“we signpost this source of information for potential archaeological grant applications and archaeological contractors**” \(S5\). Both the data produced, and SCAPE’s approach, are described by HES as **“instrumental in the delivery of Scotland’s Archaeology Strategy”** \(S5\). The value of such data in strategic management is recognised by the National Trust’s Coast and Marine Advisor for England and Wales, who has argued that a similar approach should be adopted south of the border, stating that **“the ability to accumulate the type of time\-series data that SCAPE can…could help us sort out, for example, where the priorities lie for understanding the historic environment and cultural heritage features as they are impacted by coastal change”** \(S6\). 

 <ins>3.</ins> <ins>I</ins><ins>nternational</ins> <ins>influence and</ins> <ins>providing a</ins> <ins>model for others</ins> 

 During the impact period, an audience of 10,916 heard about the team’s citizen and community\-based approaches to heritage threatened by climate change in 129 presentations given in village halls up and down the country and at conferences around the world.  This has resulted in an international demand for the team’s expertise. Dawson advised the Cultural Heritage Agency of Iceland on the management of threatened coastal sites and the Director of the National Heritage Agency of Iceland states that **“as a result ... we have formed a group of professionals and volunteers working on the registration of such sites in Iceland”** \(S7\). In Puerto Rico, Dawson’s influence was the catalyst for a nationwide campaign to identify coastal sites at risk and identify actions for resilience \(S8\). In 2019, Dawson was invited to the Faroe Islands to advise the Faroese National Museum and Minister of Culture on mitigation options for eroding coastal heritage, which led to funding for a new project to protect an important site on Sandoy. 

 The influence of the St Andrews team has also resulted in their model being taken up and adapted elsewhere. This was highlighted by the US National Parks Service \(NPS\) in their acclaimed Cultural Resources Climate Change Strategy \(2016\), which states that **“SCAPE has developed multiple citizen science projects to address the challenges of long coastlines, large numbers of diverse cultural heritage sites at risk from coastal erosion, and limited staff and other resources”** and notes that adaptations of their model  include: ALeRT, \(France\); CITiZAN \(England\); Arfordir \(Wales\); and MASC \(Ireland\) \(S9\). 

 Since the NPS strategy was published, two further projects in the USA, closely modelled on the St Andrews approach have been initiated. In 2017, members of the team were invited to a workshop at the University of Maine which resulted in the establishment of the  [Maine Midden Minder Network](https://umaine.edu/middenminders/), a citizen\-science project involving First Nations people, local communities, academics and heritage managers. The team’s long\-standing relationship with the Florida Public Archaeology Network \(FPAN\) and its involvement in the establishment of the  [Heritage Monitoring Scouts](https://fpan.us/projects/HMSflorida.php) \(HMS\) originated with a conference presentation in 2016. The importance of the St Andrews work is described by FPAN’s Director: **“Finding out what you and your colleagues at St Andrews have been doing in Scotland to address climate and heritage underscores, I think, the importance of international participation at conferences, which is where we first learned of your program … I can say thank you without hesitation for your part in making it \[HMS\] not only exist but succeed ... I truly value the collaboration with you, Joanna, and Ellie at the University of St Andrews. This has truly and significantly influenced, in a very positive way, our program in Florida and how we approach heritage at risk from climate change”** \(S10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Project Mirabal is an award\-winning programme of research that has changed how Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programmes \(DVPPs\) are researched, understood, commissioned, funded, regulated, designed and implemented across the world \- particularly in the UK, USA and Australia. These changes have informed: i\) UK policy, specifically contributing to perpetrator sections of the UK Government ‘Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy’ and being used by a range of political and third sector stakeholders to increase the focus on perpetrators in the Domestic Abuse Bill; ii\) in the European Commission, through being the reference point for good practice in measuring the effectiveness of DVPPs under Article 16 of the Istanbul Convention; iii\) effecting changes to DVPP programme delivery in the UK and internationally; and iv\) changing domestic violence practitioner perceptions about measuring success and ‘what works’ for DVPPs.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Crime Survey for England and Wales estimated around 2.3 million adults in England and Wales experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2020. Over a third of all violence crimes are domestic abuse related. Historically, most interventions have been focused on victims and children, for example advocacy and refuges. Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programmes \(DVPPs\) are groupwork programmes, which aim to change the behaviour of perpetrators in order to increase the safety of victims and children. However, their funding, development and inclusion in government policy has been stilted due to contested academic evidence about whether they ‘work’. Previous research has reported mixed findings, with some showing little or no change. The research team believed that these mixed findings could be explained through differences in research design. Project Mirabal was designed to find a way through this impasse. With funding from the Northern Rock Foundation, researchers from Durham and London Metropolitan University with support from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ran a pilot study to understand what ‘success’ meant from different perspectives. The research was conducted with well established, accredited, ‘high quality’ community DVPPs running groupwork programmes for male perpetrators. R1 and R2 describe how we developed six ‘measures of success’ through 73 interviews conducted in 2009 with men attending DVPPs, women partners and ex\-partners, DVPP staff, and funders and commissioners. The six measures covered: 1\) improved relationships based on respect and effective communication; 2\) an expanded ‘space for action’ for women; 3\) safety and freedom from violence and abuse; 4\) safe and positive shared parenting; 5\) an enhanced awareness of self and others; and 6\) safer healthier childhoods. These new measures represented a transformative shift in how the potential impact of DVPPs could be viewed and formed the basis for measuring change in our ESRC and Northern Rock Foundation funded study \(2010\-2015\). A multi\-method approach was used. Participants were perpetrators attending the DVPPs, their ex or current partners, and children. Data collected included longitudinal \(15 months over 5 time points\) structured telephone interviews with 100 women, two in\-depth interviews with 64 men and 48 women near the start and the end of the DVPP, interviews with 13 children, and 105 programme staff and other stakeholders. 

 R3 is the final project report and details a range of improved outcomes relating to the six measures. R3 represents the first multi\-site, longitudinal DVPP outcome study in the UK Physical and sexual violence was not just reduced but ended for the majority of the victims. Improvements were also seen across the other measures, although not to the same extent. Some forms of abuse, such as financial abuse, only improved marginally. Hence, the research did not show ‘perpetrator programmes work’ but instead, due to the expanded measures of success used, a more nuanced picture. 

 R4, R5 and R6 provide a deeper analysis of the qualitative data. They expand on the techniques used by DVPPs, in particular the use and abuse of ‘Time Out’ and how the technique could be adapted to be more relational. The ways in which the challenging of gendered assumptions about masculinity in relationships and parenting also emerged as important in enabling men to change. While the measures of success and the outcome study were able to show the extent to which behaviour changed, the in\-depth qualitative analysis showed how this change happened – with important implications for DVPP delivery.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2010, before Project Mirabal, domestic violence perpetrators were rarely mentioned in policy documents, organisations working with perpetrators struggled to gain funding, and the efficacy of interventions were frequently questioned. Without a UK evidence base on the outcomes for victims and children related to perpetrator attendance at a DVPP, it was difficult to make a convincing argument for policy or funding commitments. 10 years on, in 2020, perpetrators have been included in the Domestic Abuse Bill 2020, nearly 100 organisations have signed a Call to Action for a domestic abuse perpetrator strategy for England and Wales, DVPPs are included in the End Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy 2016\-20, and there is greater confidence and clarity that can be given to policy makers, funders, and multi\-agency partners about the ability of DVPPs to change the behaviour of violent men and improve safety and freedom for women and children. A series of engagement activities including briefing notes, open access journal papers, a website with videos and tools for practitioners \(www.projectmirabal.co.uk\), meetings with policy makers, and collaborations with voluntary and statutory sector organisations over a 10\-year period has meant that Project Mirabal has provided a central contribution to these achievements. 

 Recognition that there was, for the first time, evidence that DVPPs could create behaviour change for some perpetrators was publicly acknowledged the day the final report \[R3\] was launched in 2015 by Theresa May, then Home Secretary, who stated that the findings provided ‘ *valuable insights into the effectiveness of domestic violence perpetrator programmes*’ and announced that the research would support a shift towards addressing the ‘root causes’ of domestic violence \[E1\]. Project Mirabal findings were then used to guide the perpetrators section of the UK Government’s ‘Ending Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy 2016\-20’ \[E2\], which outlined the priorities, actions and investment into initiatives aimed at preventing violence and abuse. The strategy draws directly on R3 in the section ‘Perpetrators: Changing behaviours to prevent abuse and reduce offending’ stating ‘ *Within domestic abuse, there are high levels of repeat victimisation and less than 1% of perpetrators receive a specialist intervention. Previously, the evidence base for perpetrator interventions has been mixed, contributing to a shortage of such programmes. However, local areas are increasingly recognising the importance of tackling perpetrators as the root cause of abuse, drawing on a growing evidence base for their value as illustrated by the recent Mirabal project findings.*’ 

 Respect, the national charity leading the development of safe, effective work with perpetrators, used the Mirabal findings as the primary evidence that DVPPs work for men who are ready, willing, and able to change, and to lobby government and other agencies and make the case for DVPPs.  Respect CEO, Jo Todd, said that she has ‘ *been able to cite Project Mirabal findings with policy makers within the Home Office, the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime and with funders and commissioners to advocate for DVPPs*’, saying that since Mirabal ‘ *it’s clear that this has gone up the priority list’* \[E3\]. Additionally, Respect, working with the Drive Project, \(a partnership between  [Respect](http://respect.uk.net/),  [SafeLives](http://www.safelives.org.uk/) and  [Social Finance](https://www.socialfinance.org.uk/) established to address a gap in work with high\-harm perpetrators of domestic abuse\) were able to cite the Mirabal findings as an example of the ‘ *growing body of research to demonstrate the effectiveness of quality\-assured interventions*’ in the ‘Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Strategy for England and Wales – Call to Action’\[E4\]. This publication, signed by a broad coalition including 65 third sector organisations, police forces/crime commissioners and businesses calls on the UK Government to include a perpetrator strategy as part of the Domestic Abuse Bill 2019\-21. 

 The impact that the Mirabal findings had on providing an evidence base for intervening with perpetrators has been described by Thangam Debbonaire MP as a core reason for the greater inclusion of perpetrators in the Domestic Abuse Bill. Debbonaire used the findings in a meeting with Victoria Atkins MP in her role as Minister for Women, distributing hard copies of the final report \[R3\] to give the academic weight when lobbying for this. In her Commons speech for the second reading of the ‘Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence’ \(Ratification of Convention\) Bill, Debbonaire quoted Mirabal extensively stating ‘ *they \[Westmarland et al.\] found that most men who completed a Respect\-accredited domestic violence perpetrator programme…stop using violence and reduce the instance of most other forms of abuse against their partner. At the start, almost all the women said that their partners had used some form of physical or sexual violence in the past three months. Twelve months later, the research team found that after their partner or ex\-partner had completed the programme, most women said that the physical and sexual violence had stopped—most, but not all*.’ \[E5a\] 

 In a separate testimonial interview, Debbonaire argued that Project Mirabal has been an important factor in formal and informal lobbying for more perpetrator interventions, using it in the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on domestic violence perpetrators, briefing various MPs including front benchers about evidence on DVPPs, and raising DVPPs and Mirabal in Oral questions including in Justice and Home Office. She states: *‘Having such rigorous academic research, it’s not the only reason why we’ve got perpetrators in the Bill – but it wasn’t in at all before and if it wasn’t for Mirabal findings making their way to ministerial eyes and for MPs to use that in internal and external lobbyists then it still might not be.’* \[E5b\] 

 At an international level, Project Mirabal has been hailed as ground\-breaking because it represents a radically different, wider way of understanding and measuring behaviour change. This broader approach \(R1 and R3\) has been cited in international plans, frameworks and policies. The Council of Europe ‘Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence’, which came into force in August 2014, places obligations on member states to take action to prevent violence against women. Article 16 requires state parties to set up or support programmes for domestic violence perpetrators \(Article 16, paragraph 1\). The Council of Europe produced a supporting publication ‘Domestic and Sexual Violence Perpetrator Programmes: Article 16 of the Istanbul Convention’, which provides practical, evidence\-based advice to policymakers and practitioners across all 47 Council of Europe member states on the design of the required intervention programmes. This document highlights the need for defining success in DVPPs and identifies the six Mirabal measures as a means to achieve this, describing them as ‘ *a nuanced and subtle understanding of success*’ which is ‘ *more realistic and grounded*’ and which focus on ‘ *much more than just ending the violent behaviour of the perpetrator*’. \[E6\] 

 The six measures of success influenced the Australian Royal Commission into Family Violence which was established in 2015 in response to a number of family violence related deaths in the state of Victoria. In its summary and recommendations report \(2016\), Project Mirabal is referenced on ten occasions \[E7a\]. The report lists key findings from the six Project Mirabal measures of success and these are acknowledged as having ‘shifted the focus’ of DVPPs \(or MBCPs – Men’s Behaviour Change Programmes in Australia\). The Mirabal finding that the length and depth of programmes was important to creating change was also used to provide empirical evidence to claims made by witnesses to the Commission that programme duration was important. Recommendation 86 of the Royal Commission into Family Violence was that the Victorian Government convene a committee of experts on perpetrator interventions and behaviour change programmes to advise the government on what should be available in Victoria \[E7a\]. Westmarland was one of two international experts invited to join the Commission’s Expert Advisory Committee on Perpetrator Interventions. Westmarland provided advice based on Project Mirabal findings in Commission meetings and presented the findings in person to the Special Minister of State, Gavin Jennings. The Mirabal measures were identified by the Advisory Committee report as an innovative way of providing a consistent way of measuring success of DVPPs concluding that ‘ *A common evaluation framework for perpetrator interventions could address some of the challenges \[with inconsistency of evaluating outcomes outlined earlier in the report\] … and set out some general principles to ensure rigour and consistency in evaluations and better comparison of outcomes*’ \[E7b\]. Committee members were noted as making a vital contribution to the Victorian Government’s family reform agenda, and Westmarland was personally thanked for her expertise and experience which Jennings described as ‘ *invaluable*.’ \[E7c\]. 

 Alongside the high\-level contributions of Project Mirabal to changes in policy there have been a series of direct service level improvements in the way DVPPs actually carry out their behaviour change interventions. The changes stem from the nuance in the findings \(not just ‘they don’t work, or ‘they do work’\) \[R3\], and the new knowledge about how change happens \[R1\-6\]. For example, many DVPPs were concerned about the Mirabal finding that financial abuse only reduced very slightly after attendance on a DVPP. The Domestic Violence Intervention Project \(DVIP\) in London \(the largest DVPP in England and Wales\) arranged a workshop for their staff to discuss how best to respond to this finding, which they described as ‘ *a wake up call*’, particularly given that they report most of their work is not about physical violence but coercive control. The evidence pointed to a need to increase the focus on non\-physical abuse, resulting in the financial abuse part of the manual that the DVPP is based on and, which provides the materials their facilitators all follow, being re\-written \[E8a\]. 

 In Scotland, a national set of programmes called the Caledonian Model work with criminal justice as well as community referrals. Specifically, the Caledonian Model ‘programme theory manual’, the guide which summarises the evidence base and that programme managers and facilitators use to underpin their practice, references Mirabal and lists the six measures in relation the fact that it ‘ *considers men’s programmes as part of an integrated system and a co\-ordinated community response*’ rather than as isolated interventions. \[E8b\]. 

 The ‘Time Out Technique’ is a temporary interruption technique which requires the perpetrator to remove themselves from a situation. There are rules about what the perpetrator should do and not do during the Time Out. Project Mirabal research \[R5\] found that Time Outs were used in different ways, and sometimes misappropriated by perpetrators to extend their controlling behaviour. The National Offender Management Service \(NOMS\), Ministry of Justice, changed their digital media content on the Time Out Technique to take into account Mirabal research including how to reduce the potential for misappropriation \[R5\]. According to Jason Morris, Senior Interventions Design Manager for DVPPs at NOMS, Westmarland ‘ *used her expertise to supervise this piece to ensure that it was as consistent as possible with the evidence\-base.'* This new digital media clip was then rolled out across the National Probation Service and also broadcast on the WayOut TV channel in 50 prisons. 

 Mirabal has brought a greater level of sophistication to understandings of what compromises success and in as such has become the ‘go to research’ that is cited by practitioners, particularly in the UK, Australia, and the US, when the question of whether DPVPs ‘work’ is raised. This is important in ensuring that DVPPs continue to develop to be as effective as possible. Stephen Madill, Senior Social Worker at Safer Families Edinburgh states ‘ *I’ve noticed a difference when you’re able to talk about the Mirabal data and specific items that have led to less cynicism, not so many sceptical looks on people’s faces, and this been a journey for workers over the last 30 years*.’ \[E9a\]. In the USA, New York City Administration for Children’s Services conducted a three\-year demonstration project, providing prevention and clinical services to families who are involved in child welfare and impacted by domestic violence, using ‘ *tools provided by Project Mirabal as the framework for measuring program impact on participants*’ \[E9b\]. Similarly in Australia, Rodney Vlais, policy analyst, writer, researcher and trainer in family and domestic violence perpetrator interventions and intervention systems nationally states that in Australia, ‘ *It would be uncommon for anyone providing a presentation or responding to queries about the effectiveness of men's behaviour change programs without at least mentioning this research and its findings*.’ \[E9c\]. 

 In November 2019 Westmarland was awarded the ‘Ed Gondolf COMPASS Award’ in the USA, which ‘ *recognizes and honors those who have significantly guided and expanded efforts to protect survivors through advancing and evaluating accountable perpetrator intervention research and programming*’ for the ‘ *importance, significance and tangible contribution it \[Mirabal\] has made*’ toward intervention programmes around the world. \[E10\]

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins> **Background**</ins> 

 **NGN deliver gas to 2.7 million homes and businesses** throughout Northumberland, Northern Cumbria, Tyne & Wear, County Durham, and Yorkshire. NGN supply gas from local sites \(offtakes\) connected to the national network. They have a requirement to accurately forecast gas demand annually, daily and hourly. The energy sector in the UK and globally is changing to accommodate greener technologies in line with growing economic, environmental and public health concerns. Operational efficiency and decision\-making can be enhanced through the improved forecasting of gas demand – the core objective of this research project. 

 Historically, NGN used information from Xoserve, the central service data provider for the UK’s gas market, to inform demand predictions. In 2014, NGN selected Newcastle University \(NU\) as a research collaborator and contributed funding \[G1\] **to deliver a more independent, robust, and specific solution and improve the accuracy of the predictions \[E1\].** NU was chosen for their experience in delivering statistics\-based solutions within the energy sector, and their academic expertise in modelling time\-dependent data. 

 <ins> **The research</ins> <ins>challenge**</ins> 

 Gas demand is primarily influenced by weather and work\-life patterns \[P1\]. There are annual and weekly periodic effects and there is a need to nest short term daily predictions within fixed annual forecasts.  Public holidays have a pronounced effect on demand, typically leading to an increase in household usage but a decrease in business use. This effect often spreads into neighbouring days, referred to as a proximity effect. Traditionally, in gas demand modelling, the days over which the proximity effect occur are pre\-specified in fixed windows around each holiday. This is an inﬂexible approach as it relies on an arbitrary decision about the existence, size and position of the windows. 

 \[P1\] describes the Newcastle development of a fully Bayesian approach to the forecasting problem. The modelling assumed a non\-homogeneous hidden Markov model, whose states account for normal, holiday and prior\- and post\-holiday proximity effects, and a state\-dependent vector autogression for demand, with seasonal and day\-of\-week terms and non\-linear effects of a time\-varying composite weather variable. Apart from holidays themselves, which are observed, duration in the other states is hidden. This was modelled as a Markov process with time\-varying transition probabilities depending upon the time intervals from the most recent public holiday and to the next one, and also on the particular holiday type, with Christmas, Easter and other holidays allowed to have different effects.  Time\-varying precision matrices were modelled using the Cholesky decomposition approach developed for a related non\-homogeneous hierarchical Markov model used by Heaps, Boys and Farrow for spatio\-temporal rainfall prediction \[P2\]. Priors were given careful attention and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo applied for estimation. The model was calibrated using high dimensional daily demand data collected over 9 years from each of the two NGN sub\-regions: the North and the North East. 

 <ins> **Improved forecasting**</ins> 

 An evaluation of model accuracy \(predictions vs. actual data\), pre\-Newcastle University research and post\-Newcastle University research, has demonstrated a **significant improvement in accuracy of 10%** \(in the mean absolute daily forecast error\) in the North East region and **13%** in the North region \[E2\]. Another improvement was that the posterior distribution for the states demonstrated different patterns in the identification of proximity days between different public holidays and across different types of customers. This highlights the advantage of not fixing \(allowing uncertainty in\) the identification of proximity days, superior to the traditional, inflexible approach described previously \[P1\]\[P3\]. 

 The Newcastle approach to forecasting provides probabilistic distributions. This provides quantifiable uncertainty \(a probabilistic range\) in the forecasts, rather than simple point forecasts which have limited value. 

 Another feature of the modelling is forecast stability, meaning that small changes in either input covariates or in parameter values do not lead to large changes in forecast distributions. This is important in long\-term forecasting, where failure to enforce stability can lead to volatile or oscillating forecasts with ever\-increasing variances. 

 <ins> **Bi\-annual research implementation**</ins> 

 The modelling and data analysis produce parameter estimates which are used for future demand forecasting. These parameter values are now bi\-annually updated by NGN and embedded within their operational processes to provide a more robust, ten\-year prediction at a daily level.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The statistical research by Newcastle University has delivered economic, operational, and educational **impact on a large geographical scale**. 

 *“There have been three implementations of the research within our systems in 2015, 2017 and 2019.”* \[E1\]. The next application is due in the first quarter of 2021. The bi\-annual implementations have **“…demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy of 10% in the North East region and 13% in the North region”** \[E2\], allowing the network to operate more efficiently and prevent costs \[E1\]. NGN documentation, outlining operating processes, includes details of the statistical methodology embedded within NGN’s forecasting activities \[E3, E4\] 

 <ins> **Impact on capacity bookings**</ins> 

 The gas demand forecasts produced by the Newcastle University research team have impacted upon gas bookings. **NGN has reduced actual gas capacity bookings by 16%**, year\-by\-year, from 612 GWh/day to 514 GWh/day, to match the statistical forecasts \[E1\]. *“Avoiding paying for gas that is not used has resulted in **reduced capacity costs of over £1M**.”* \[E1\] *.  This reduction has enabled NGN to release capacity back to National Grid which can then be allocated to other customers. 

 <ins> **Impact during challenging periods including extreme weather**</ins> 

 The research methodology has been robust during challenging periods, such as unseasonable weather, changeable weather and bank holiday weekends which **enables NGN to avoid charges of £1m per day** \[E1\]. 

 In 2018, the effects of the “Beast from the East”  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world\-europe\-43218229](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43218229) were mitigated as a result of the statistical research. During the commencement of this unseasonable weather, NGN increased their maximum day forecast using the holiday factors. Failure to apply the increase would have resulted in NGN under\-forecasting the North East local distribution zone maximum day estimate. The unadjusted forecast was 245 GWh/day, the increased maximum prediction using the holiday factors \(Newcastle research\) was 258 GWh/day. The actual gas demand on the 1<sup>st</sup> March 2018 was 254 GWh/day.  NGN booked their gas capacity in line with the Newcastle research\-estimated maximum day demand. If NGN had not increased their estimated peak demand and gas capacity being allocated accordingly, overrun charges would have occurred. 

 *“…we have used more accurate and precise forecasts to…ii\) avoid charges during operationally challenging periods such as extreme weather e.g. **overrun charges of £1M** could occur on one date alone if a repeat of the 2018 Beast from the East occurred under the new pricing structure”.* \[E1\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on gas network inspection planning**</ins> 

 The statistical research has had a direct influence on scheduling cost\-effective pipeline inspection and *“… **avoiding wasted expenditure.”** \[E1\]. The research has allowed NGN to identify the optimum times of year to plan and launch pipeline inspections and conduct inline assessments. A more accurate understanding of the demand at a nuanced, daily level has allowed this to occur. Without accurate forecasts, inspection activities would be sub\-optimally executed resulting in wasted expenditure \- confidentiality prevents the presentation of financial cost savings. 

 <ins> **Impact on gas storage errors**</ins> 

 Through more accurate forecasts, the “… **research has mitigate\(d\) gas storage errors, maintaining system balance.”** \[E1\]. Over\-forecasts and under\-forecasts lead to problems within the regional storage system which can lead to detrimental impacts on the national UK storage position. This can result in less efficient systems, unavailability of resources, higher costs and reduced flexibility for the UK energy system. Underestimating or overestimating demand can impact upon the quantity of carbon gas entering the system from facilities such as bio\-methane plants, and hydrogen blending facilities. The effects of over\- and under\-forecasting have been reduced by the Newcastle research, though it is difficult to estimate a direct quantitative improvement. 

 <ins> **Impact on understanding & education: greater confidence and staff development**</ins> 

 The research has had a significant impact on staff understanding and education within NGN. 

 The research methodology allows NGN to make informed decisions and improve situational awareness. **“Management now authorise new demand forecasts with increased confidence, knowing that prior authorisations based on the outputs of the research have been successful.”** \[E2\]. 

 **“The research has educated some NGN staff members in the field of Bayesian statistics and provided an opportunity for continued professional development.”* \[E2\]. 

 <ins> **Establishing UK wide gas distribution improvements**</ins> 

 This research work resulted in the establishment of a UK\-wide project in Autumn 2018 between all the UK gas distribution distributors \(NGN, SGN, Cadent, Wales & West Utilities\) and the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics at NU \[E5\]. The focus of this work was evaluating and improving the analysis of leakage at medium pressure across the UK gas distribution networks to ensure that the methods deployed are both accurate and cost\-effective to the industry. The gas industry benefits from these statistical approaches in helping make the UK’s energy infrastructure low\-carbon, sustainable and secure \[E6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Changes in UK media policy and new patterns of migration across Europe raise urgent questions about how children’s screen content is funded and who it represents. Addressing these issues, King’s research has informed debates and decisions about how public service content for children in the UK should be funded and how producers represent children affected by forced migration. King’s research on funding practices in North America, Australasia and Europe has influenced the policy positions of leading advocacy organisations – the Children’s Media Foundation and Voice of the Listener and Viewer – and shaped funding criteria adopted by the British Film Institute for its new Young Audiences Content Fund. King’s research on European screen content about and for Arab children in an era of forced migration has changed how producers represent Arab and other under\-represented children: impacting commissioning, production and funding. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact presented in this case study derives from two closely interrelated strands of research: Funding Children’s Screen Content and Developing Screen Content about and for Arabic\-Speaking Children in Europe. 

#  Funding children’s screen content 

 The 2003 Communications Act removed children’s screen content quotas on commercial public service broadcasting \(PSB\) in the UK. This led to a decline in commissions and funding by the BBC and commercial PSBs \(ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5\), raising doubts about the continued availability of UK\-originated children’s content. In this context, the launch of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport’s \(DCMS\) *Public Service Broadcasting Contestable Fund Consultation* \(20/12/2016 **–** 19/10/2018\) meant a range of industry stakeholders had an urgent need for research to inform their responses. This particularly concerned ‘contestable funding’, where producers apply for public funds from independent bodies that operate separately from broadcasting institutions. Responding to this situation, King’s research investigated alternative funding arrangements for supporting public service children’s content internationally, to provide new perspectives with which to inform media policy and practice in the UK. Based on industry interviews and policy analysis, King’s research on funding children’s screen content demonstrated: 

-  The distinctive market failure characteristics of domestically\-produced children’s screen content in six countries in North America, Australasia and Europe, each of which necessitate policy interventions. \[1,2\] 

-  Key aspects of best practice for operating a specific fund supporting children’s screen content, by comparing and contrasting the different organisational procedures and criteria for funds of this kind in six countries. \[1\] 

-  That to be effective, separate funds to support children’s content in Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland and New Zealand almost always require other interventions – including output and investment quotas, industry levies and tax breaks – and do not necessarily lead to greater diversity of provision or a greater range of content for children. \[1,3\] 

#  Developing screen content for Arabic\-speaking children in Europe 

 As part of an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) funded project led by King’s \(PI, Post\-Doc\) with the University of Westminster \(Co\-investigator\), the team’s research on children’s media in the Arab world \[5\] was used as the focus for discussions with European screen practitioners and children’s media advocates about the media needs, wants and experiences of Arabic\-speaking migrant children. The project created a space for dialogue with Arab experts, resulting in new research findings generated via co\-produced insights from three workshops in Manchester, Copenhagen and Munich between December 2017 and May 2018. In these workshops, participants discussed 35 examples of European children’s content featuring Arab children and issues concerning diversity and migration. The findings are published in a report \[4\], book \[6\] and journal article \[7\]. The research: 

-  Demonstrated the distinctive children’s media landscape that young Arab migrants in Europe have grown up with, where they rarely see other Arab children on screen. \[4,5,6\] 

-  Identified the ethical considerations involved in enabling children with migration backgrounds to identify with children on screen, without being intrusive. \[4,6,7\] 

-  Revealed the advantages of weaving diversity issues into engaging storytelling. \[4,6,7\] 

-  Demonstrated ways to avoid tokenism and victimhood through attention to scripting, casting and exploring experiences that children from all backgrounds can relate to. \[4,6,7\] 

-  Documented the value of foregrounding children’s perspectives in the development of screen content, where children with migration backgrounds are consulted about their representation and speak for themselves. \[4,7\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

#  King’s research has informed how public service content for children in the UK is funded 

 Since 2017, King’s research has influenced debate on how UK public service content for children should be funded. This culminated in directly informing the funding criteria adopted by the British Film Institute’s \(BFI\) Young Audiences Content Fund \(YACF\). Launched in April 2019, the YACF is now a major contributor to the funding of children’s content in the UK, responsible for £57 million of funding over three years. In its first year it awarded £12.5 million to 17 productions and 59 development projects in accordance with guidelines that were directly influenced by King’s research. At its launch, Steemers was appointed as Chair of the YACF Steering Group of content producers, in recognition of the centrality of her research to YACF and its development. 

 King’s research on the best practices for operating a fund – comparing and contrasting organisational procedures and funding criteria in other countries \[1,2\] – directly informed the BFI’s 2019 draft guidelines for running the YACF as a three\-year pilot fund to stimulate the provision and plurality of programming for children. BFI’s Head of Operations, Partners and Projects explains that the research made “a critical difference to the BFI’s knowledge and approach to the YACF guidelines in taking account of market failure and experiences in other countries, along with the operational set up of the fund” \[A\]. Further explaining the impact on the establishment of the Fund, she states, “King’s research about how contestable funds operate in Ireland, New Zealand and Denmark, in particular gave the BFI real insights into what would work for a specialised children’s fund in the UK. The research was really helpful in pinpointing what didn’t work in these countries, and this allowed the BFI to shape our funding priorities and the YACF guidelines more clearly around quality, innovation, diverse representation, new voices, and plurality of provision in ways that were not always reflected in other funds, but met the YACF’s public service obligations, including for content that the market would not otherwise support – such as content for older children, drama and factual shows.” In these ways, the research was “immeasurably influential in our setting up the Young Audiences Content Fund.” \[A\] 

 In the years leading up to the creation of the YACF, King’s research directly influenced leading advocacy organisations feeding into policy debates over the funding of children’s content: the Children’s Media Foundation \(CMF\) and Voice of the Listener and Viewer \(VLV\). Steemers acted as an expert advisor to both. Key research findings – on how contestable funding without clear criteria does not guarantee greater diversity in provision or greater programme range \[1,3\] – were used by the CMF and VLV in their submissions to the DCMS Public Service Broadcasting Contestable Fund Consultation \[B\]. This directly influenced the creation and design of the BFI’s YACF. Using King’s findings about the distinctive market failure characteristics of children’s content and the efficacy of contestable funds in Ireland and New Zealand \[1,2\], VLV’s DCMS submission argued that any potential fund in the UK should concentrate on “less established producers, non\-animated content and content for older children to promote more diverse content for children, which would not otherwise be commissioned” \[B\]. VLV’s Chair explains that the research was vital in “helping to formulate VLV’s arguments, which were later adopted as priorities for the YACF’s eventual operation.” Without King’s research, the VLV “would not have been able to assess funding in other countries, and its recommendations to the DCMS and British Film Institute would have been less effective in helping to shape the YACF’s eventual framework” \[B\]. 

 CMF’s Director explains that King’s research on funding in other markets “helped CMF thinking on alternative funding, and what needed to be prioritised” \[C\]. Based on King’s insights into market failure and contestable funding in other countries, CMF’s submission to the DCMS also “took the position that the fund shouldn’t just benefit large scale international animation series and that there was a strong argument for addressing market failure, for example in underserved genres, in content for older children and encouraging new players to enter the market.” CMF highlighted these priorities, which were “reflected in the YACF’s guidelines as developed at the BFI.” \[C\] CMF’s Director adds that without King’s findings, “CMF would not have had the overview of public funding mechanisms in other countries, and its evidence to the DCMS would have been less convincing in helping to frame how the YACF should operate to ensure engagement from broadcasters” \[C\]. For CMF, the findings “significantly assisted in delivering the priorities of plurality of supply and a diverse range of content.” \[C\] 

#  King’s research has influenced how producers of screen content portray under\-represented children: enabling new approaches to challenging harmful stereotypes 

 Due to King’s research, six production companies/broadcasters based in the UK, Germany and the US have each adopted new approaches to ethics, diversity, children’s perspectives and the avoidance of stereotypes – reshaping screen content reaching children and families across Europe and Arabic\-speaking countries on multiple platforms. 

 These producers have directly used King’s research to inform their work for children, impacting current and recent productions, development work, new commissions and funding applications. The six companies/broadcasters include experienced independent producers working for the BBC \(Adastra Development, Three Stones Media\) and Channel 5 \(Adastra Development\), German public broadcasters ZDF and KiKa \(Imago TV\), internationally active content providers seeking to reach young Arab audiences \(BBC Media Action\) and children in conflict areas \(Sesame Workshop\). The ultimate research beneficiaries are the many children who watch and engage with these companies’ content in Europe and the Arab world. 

 Each of these six companies/broadcasters attended one or more of the workshops held in Manchester \(2017\), Copenhagen \(2018\) and Munich \(2018\) as part of the King’s led AHRC\-funded project on screen content for migration\-experienced Arab children. Initial impact was signalled in surveys of 76 participants at the workshops, with 75% stating that the workshops definitely changed their minds about content addressing Arabic\-speaking children \[D\]. According to the Managing Director of Adastra Development, a Cambridgeshire production company established in 2005, King’s findings on ethical considerations, children’s perspectives and avoiding tokenism \(4, 6, 7\) “clearly influenced our decision\-making in terms of voices used for development, but also the characters, stories and the nature of the world we presented in our work. The fact that refugee children rarely see anything of their experiences reflected in work designed for their age group was something we very much took on board and will take with us in all future work” \[E\]. 

 Adastra, who have scripted and produced content for all the UK’s children’s channels, used King’s research \(4, 6, 7\)  to inform an Arts Council England project in 2018 with Peterborough Museum, Peterborough Syrian Refugee Action Group and Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association. The findings were used to address diversity and inclusion in drama/puppetry workshops for ethnically diverse children aged 4–7 in Peterborough schools. This successful approach was then carried forward in 2019 into development of a new Channel 5 commission, *Mimi’s World* \(in production\), a 52\-episode pre\-school soap. According to Adastra, King’s research directly influenced their plans to work with children with forced migration experience, “to feed their ideas into development”, and informed and extended the company’s view that “aspiration, not victimhood was an important part” of what children should see represented on screen \[E\]. 

 London\-based production company Three Stones Media used King’s research on diversity and representation in children’s screen content, and the importance of children’s perspectives \(4, 6, 7\), to inform production. According to its company director, the casting process of series three of ethnically diverse pre\-school soap *Apple Tree House* “benefited hugely from concerns about the underrepresentation of Arab characters” with the research bringing “more formal rigour to explore aspects of diversity and inclusion that previously we had only been able to study in an informal manner” \[F\]. The research “strengthened our resolve and also provide\[d\] substantial evidence to support our approaches to inclusion and diversity” – in this case for a show that first launched on the BBC’s CBeebies pre\-school channel and BBC iPlayer in 2017 and is still being repeated, reaching thousands of UK pre\-schoolers. The company continues to use King’s research on children’s perspectives and storytelling for a new project in development for BBC Children’s, with “a complete new approach to story development, scripting and casting that focuses even more on the youth voice” \[F\]. 

 German production company Imago TV and the largest German public service commissioner ZDF both testify that King’s research on Arab children’s media experiences, ethical considerations, inclusive casting and victimhood  \(4, 6, 7\) influenced their approach to diversity in series three of *Berlin und Wir* \( *Berlin and Us*\). This is a six\-part factual series featuring friendships between migrant and German children, first broadcast on ZDF and German children’s channel KiKa in 2019. They state that King’s research findings – on the need to consult children and prioritise their perspectives to avoid stereotyping and victimisation – clarified and confirmed that to “portray refugees in a positive light and consult them” was the right approach \[G\]. The way that the research highlighted the complexities of depicting religious and cultural differences around the wearing of headscarves by girls, for example, “influenced our approach in Series 3” to “other conflict lines” – namely the case of a Jewish girl and a Palestinian boy, where the team decided to focus on the personal experience of each child, rather than using them “in a secondary battlefield of the Middle East Conflict.” As a consequence of King’s research, now other children’s programmes professionals at ZDF “want to take greater account of the perspective of migrant children”, with the ZDF Children’s Department launching “an initiative to bring more diversity” into its programmes and commissioning further series dealing with diversity \( *Strong Kids – Strong Classes*\) \[G\]. 

 Beyond Europe, King’s research informed US\-based Sesame Workshop’s successful USD100 million bid, in collaboration with the International Rescue Committee, to the MacArthur Foundation’s 100&Change programme. This was a bid to fund *Ahlan Simsim* \( *Welcome Sesame*\) *,* an early childhood development programme for refugee families in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. According to Sesame Workshop’s Senior Vice President for International Social Impact, King’s research on the Arab media landscape for children \(5\) “was significant in helping Sesame develop an informed approach during the 100&Change competition, which recognizes the complexities of the Arab media market along with the unique needs and experiences of Arabic\-speaking children and how they are impacted by forced migration. It allowed us to have an up to date and in\-depth understanding of the media landscape in the Middle East to inform our winning proposal and meet the needs of children impacted by crisis and conflict across the region.” King’s research “provided key insights for Sesame Workshop to better understand the complex distribution of children’s media in the Arab world and importance of representation and locally relevant content” \[H\]. The Managing Producer of *Ahlan Simsim*, who attended the project workshops in Manchester and Munich, states that the research \(4, 6\)  provided “ample insights” into the children’s media landscape in the Middle East, proving “very useful in the local creative talent bidding” and for the “framing of our initial creative development process.” The production team continue to refer to the research in developing and communicating “our continued mission” \[H\]. 

 BBC international development charity BBC Media Action, which undertakes work in Lebanon, used King’s published research \[4,5,6\] to inform their approach to young audiences affected by forced migration in the Middle East. The research findings and recommendations were passed onto the BBC Media Action team and have “helped us redraft and review our approach” to Lebanon as well as providing insights on “ethical considerations” that are “key for the successful design of content that prioritises children’s perspectives over adults while also focusing on engaging, child\-focused stories that avoid victimhood” \[I\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study demonstrates how research produced at York St John University resulted in increased recognition of perfectionism as an important public health risk. As a result of this research, perfectionism is now \(1\) included in the curriculum of BTEC Sport and Exercise Science, the largest Further Education sports course in the UK, for the first time, \(2\) is part of multiple national and international mental health and wellbeing education programmes and \(3\) has been added as one of the key focuses of a new Department for Education student mental health taskforce. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Motivation, Performance, and Wellbeing Research Group \(MPAW\)</ins> 

 MPAW is one of the largest groups in the world dedicated to the study of perfectionism in sport, dance, and exercise. The group was established by Professor Hill and Professor Hall \(now retired\) at York St John University. The group consists of five YSJU academic staff and their research students \(currently six doctoral students\), as well as a wider network of former research students in academic posts at other universities \(Newcastle University, Leeds Beckett University, and London School of Economics and Political Science\). The group has produced 83 research papers, 11 edited book chapters, and 84 national and international conference presentations on the topic of perfectionism since 2014. 

 The main focus of the group’s research has been to challenge the common misconception that perfectionism is beneficial for athletes, dancers, and exercisers. Subsequently, their work has expanded to challenge this misconception in other domains, notably in education. The research of this group has shown that rather than being beneficial, perfectionism has numerous negative consequences, that it is increasing, and that it is especially problematic for mental health and wellbeing. 

 The research of the group has also been funded by the Wellcome Trust, Swedish Research Council for Sport Science, Higher Education Academy, National Association for Able Children in Education \(NACE\), HigherHY, Harold Hyam Wingate Foundation, Goalball UK, and the European Commission/Framework 7. The research is highly cited, receives large amounts of media coverage, and a touchstone for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. 

 <ins>Advancing research in sport, dance, exercise and beyond</ins> 

 Members of MPAW were among the first to publish research examining perfectionism in sport and exercise psychology, and are the largest producers of research in this area according to the SCOPUS database. Some of their earliest and most novel work demonstrated that perfectionistic athletes are at increased risk of burnout, and this has subsequently been extended into other groups \(students and office workers **\[3.1;** **3.2;** **3.3\]**. These findings are particularly important given the inclusion of burnout in the International Classification of Diseases \(11<sup>th</sup> revision; World Health Organization, 2018\). Their research has adopted novel approaches to the study of perfectionism and burnout, including sophisticated statistical analyses to model explanatory psychological processes **\[3.1\]**, testing novel models of perfectionism in sport for the first time **\[3.2\]**, using innovative and difficult methodological designs **\[3.4\]**, and conducting the first ever meta\-analysis of perfectionism and burnout in sport, workplace, and education settings **\[3.3\]**. More recently the group published the first meta\-analytical review of the consequences of perfectionism for athletes **\[3.5\]** and, in doing so, highlighted many other adverse mental and physical health outcomes of perfectionism. Finally, and perhaps most notably, the group published a substantial birth\-cohort study that showed, for the first time, that perfectionism is increasing among young people, and has been for the last thirty years **\[3.6\]**. 

 The research of the group has highlighted that perfectionism is a public health risk, and that it is essential that people are aware of the dangers of perfectionism and seek to address it. This case study reflects the group’s success in raising awareness of the health risks of perfectionism in sport, exercise, and other life domains, especially education.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>Impact pathways associated with three impacts</ins> 

 Impact pathways have been engagement with journalists in written and digital media, media production companies, producers of educational resources, organisations/scholarly societies and policy makers. 

 Examples include  [articles](https://theconversation.com/how-perfectionism-became-a-hidden-epidemic-among-young-people-89405) in theconversation.com \(republished in over 150 news outlets around the world and read over 500k times\); a  [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_curran_our_dangerous_obsession_with_perfectionism_is_getting_worse) based \(delivered by Dr Curran, an alumni of MPAW\) based on **\[3.6\]** \(2.5 million views\); written press \(e.g., Guardian, Telegraph, Metro\) and radio interviews \(BBC Radio 5live\); BBC article and accompanying online video \(“ [The dangerous downsides of perfectionism](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180219-toxic-perfectionism-is-on-the-rise)” and “ [When perfectionism goes too far](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/when-perfectionism-goes-too-far/p07hnyq8)” viewed over 12k times\); a cover story for New Scientist magazine \( [Issue 3242](https://www.newscientist.com/issue/3243/)\); consultancy for a television programme on perfectionism hosted by Davina McCall broadcast on the W Channel \(“ [The Davina Hour](https://w.uktv.co.uk/the-davina-hour/article/davina-hour-episode-guide/)”\); direct delivery of workshops \(e.g., NHS, Scottish Gymnastics, Mental Health Foundation\); and invited talks \(e.g., Universities UK, Westminster Insight, and the Department of Education\). 

 Specific impact pathways for three impacts are identified below along with the description of the impact. 

 <ins>Impact 1: Perfectionism added to the BTEC Sport and Exercise Science curriculum</ins> 

 As a direct consequence of the group’s research, perfectionism was included for the first time in the curriculum for the BTEC Sport and Exercise Science, the largest Further Education sports course in the UK. Perfectionism is now included on the curriculum of one of the mandatory units for all awards. The inclusion of perfectionism and its link to the BTEC unit author’s knowledge of MPAW research has been confirmed by testimonial **\[5.1\]**. The updated curriculum has been in use since September 2016 \(in the previous iteration of this curriculum \[2010\] perfectionism was not included\). Consequently, since its introduction, a total of approximately 8,300 BTEC students per year have undertaken the course with this updated content **\[5.2\]**. 

 <ins>Impact 2: Perfectionism added to national and international mental health and wellbeing programmes</ins> 

 Perfectionism has now been incorporated into the curricula of several national and international mental health and wellbeing education packages. This includes the “Student Wellbeing Toolkit” from Epigeum **\[5.3\]**, a large provider of online courses designed to support universities in teaching, research, and wellbeing. The toolkit equips students with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage wellbeing issues they face across their university experience. Based on series of research talks and consultancy, a module on perfectionism was created for the toolkit \(“Am I good enough?”\). The toolkit was launched in June 2020 and has so far been used in nine institutions in the UK and six institutions in Australia. The inclusion of perfectionism in the toolkit and direct link to MPAW research has been confirmed by the senior commissioning editor at Epigeum **\[5.4\]**. 

 Perfectionism has similarly been integrated into the work of the NACE. NACE is a charity aimed at improving provision for more able learners, driving whole\-school improvement, and raising achievement. The charity has over 1,000 partner schools nationally and internationally. As a consequence of consultancy with NACE and commissioned research, addressing perfectionism has now be integrated into the support they provide for student and teacher wellbeing. The inclusion of perfectionism and the link to MPAW research has been confirmed by the CEO of NACE **\[5.5\]**. 

 One final example of this type of impact is the work with the Brilliant Club. The Brilliant Club is an award\-winning university access charity that works across the UK to increase the number of pupils from underrepresented backgrounds progressing to highly\-selective universities. It also delivers the Seren Network Conference on behalf of the Welsh Government which is a national network of schools to support the most able students \(over 150 schools and colleges and over 3000 students\). Perfectionism has been added to the professional development programme/strand of the Seren Network Conference with integration of resources developed by MPAW into practice the main focus \(worksheets, lesson plans and an animated video \[“The perils of perfectionism” viewed 9k times\], **\[5.6\]**\). The inclusion of perfectionism in the professional development strand of Seren Network Conference and link to MPAW research has been confirmed by the education and development director at the Brilliant Club **\[5.7\]**. 

 <ins>Impact 3: Perfectionism identified as a risk factor for student mental health by a new government taskforce</ins> 

 The most notable impact of the research has been on the formation and aims of a new government taskforce created by the Department for Education \(DfE\). The taskforce, known as the Education Transitions Network, which is supported by leading education organisations \(e.g., UCAS, Universities UK, Office for Students\), will develop measures to support students as they start university with the aim of addressing mental health problems. The taskforce has explicitly identified perfectionism as a wellbeing risk factor that needs to be addressed **\[5.8\]**. The inclusion of perfectionism as a risk factor was preceded by a visit from the DfE to York St John University, where they met with Professor Hill, and a subsequent visit and talk by Professor Hill at the DfE focused on MPAW research **\[5.9\]**. Correspondence from the chair of the new taskforce confirmed the link between the research of MPAW and the inclusion of perfectionism as a risk factor to be addressed by the taskforce **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 QMU’s Marie Reid and Maresa Duffy investigated the behavioural consequences of individuals’ dietary intake of free sugars \(sucrose\). Their findings were included in evidence for the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition’s 2015 report ‘Carbohydrates and Health’. Its recommendations led to the UK Government’s \(2016\) ‘Childhood Obesity: A Plan for Action’, to Public Health England’s 2018 ‘Change4Life campaign’, and to revised Government dietary guidance in Scotland and Wales. Their findings also informed the World Health Organization’s \(2015\) guideline on ‘Sugars intake for adults and children’. Reid and Duffy’s research has impacted on public policy and services at national and international levels. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2006 and 2009, Marie Reid and Maresa Duffy of QMU conducted studies into the behavioural effects of sucrose on appetite, mood, and dietary behaviour of overweight and obese women. Previous findings had been inconclusive as to whether individuals’ consumption of free sugars \(sucrose\) directly affected diet and led to weight gain: some findings indicated that consumption directly resulted in weight gain, while other findings suggested that weight gain was not inevitable as individuals compensated for free sugars by reducing sugar intake elsewhere in the diet. Reid and Duffy’s research was conducted to examine further how individuals responded to the addition of sucrose to their diet. 

 In the 2010 study \(\#1\), Reid and Duffy used a single\-blind, between subjects design to examine the dietary behaviour of overweight women \(BMI 25–30\) in response to the intake of free sugars. They provided two groups of participants with soft drinks, sweetened either with sucrose or aspartame \(sweetener\-substitute\), as a supplement to their usual diet. They measured the dietary intake \(via 7 day food diaries\), BMI, mood, hunger, and activity levels \(via activity diary and pedometer\) of the two groups over a four\-week period \(following baseline\). They found that the participants who consumed sucrose\-sweetened drinks reduced their daily energy intake \(including supplementary drinks\) only marginally, by a mean of 0.14 MJ/d as compared to baseline intake. However, participants receiving aspartame\-sweetened drinks reduced their daily energy intake to a greater extent, by a mean of 0.67 MJ/d over the five\-week period. Thus, over\-weight women consuming sucrose\-sweetened drinks reduced their voluntary intake elsewhere in the diet, but such reduction only partially compensated for the increased daily intake of free sugars. By contrast, participants consuming aspartame\-sweetened drinks showed a markedly greater reduction in daily energy intake. 

 In the 2014 study \(\#2\) Reid, Duffy and colleagues used a similar design to examine the dietary behaviours of obese women \(BMI 30\-35\) in response to intake of free sugars, with similar results. In that study, obese women who consumed sucrose\-sweetened drinks increased their daily energy intake over a four\-week period \(following baseline\) by a mean of 0.21 MJ/d. This reflected partial compensation for sucrose added \(blind\) to the diet at the expense of a reduction in reported voluntary intake of carbohydrate and fat. However, participants who consumed aspartame\-sweetened drinks reduced their energy intake by a mean of 0.92 MJ/d, indicating greater compensation elsewhere in the diet for the additional consumption of sweetened drinks. Over the course of the study, energy intake in the diet increased for participants consuming sucrose\-sweetened drinks but decreased for participants consuming aspartame\-sweetened drinks. 

 Findings from these two studies identified a direct link between individuals’ consumption of free sugar in the diet and increase or decrease in daily energy intake. In view of the established link between excessive energy intake and overweight / obesity, the findings point to the attendant risks of excessive dietary intake of free sugars \(sucrose\). 

 Throughout the period of conducting this research, Marie Reid was Professor of Health Psychology and Maresa Duffy was Research Fellow at QMU.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Reid and Duffy’s research has impacted on public policy and services in the UK and internationally. 

  

 <ins>Impact on public policy and services in the UK</ins> 

 Findings from the \(2010, 2014\) studies by Reid, Duffy, and colleagues formed part of the evidence base for a systematic review of high\-quality studies that investigated the relationship between consumption of dietary carbohydrates and health. This review was commissioned by The Food Standards Agency and the Department of Health \(England\) which asked the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \(SACN\) to examine the relationship between dietary carbohydrates and health and to produce public health recommendations. From analysis of the evidence, SACN \(2015, p.81\) concluded that ‘the direction of effect demonstrates that greater consumption of sugars is detrimental to health’, and that ‘the effect is biologically relevant at a population level in free living individuals not subject to energy restriction’. These conclusions led to two SACN dietary recommendations related to sugar \(2015, p.184\), as follows: 

-  The population average intake of free sugars should not exceed 5% of total dietary energy for age groups from 2 years upwards. 

-  The consumption of sugars\-sweetened beverages should be minimised, in both children and adults. 

 These SACN recommendations \(\#1\) have 

1.  been taken up in the dietary advice provided by all UK health departments; 

1.  been incorporated into the healthy eating advice given to consumers; 

1.  led Public Health England to undertake an appraisal of potential policy responses to implement the recommendations \(\#2\); 

1.  informed debate in the House of Commons Health Committee on measures required to implement them \(\#3\); 

1.  resulted in the UK Government producing ‘A Plan for Action’ designed to take forward the recommendations in practice across the public sector, schools, early years settings, families, and elsewhere to reduce significantly England’s rate of childhood obesity over a ten year period \(\#4; \#5\); 

1.  led to Public Health England launching on 2 January 2018 its ‘Change4Life campaign’ that encourages parents to look for ‘100 calorie snacks, two a day max’ to limit their children’s daily intake of free sugars \(\#6\). 

1.  led to the Scottish Government producing ‘Revised Dietary Goals for Scotland’ \(\#7\) and the Welsh Government producing a best practice guideline ‘Food & Nutrition for Childcare Settings’ \(\#8\), both of which reflect the SACN recommendations. 

 Reid and Duffy’s \(2010, 2014\) studies comprised two of the 11 high\-quality studies that were included in the review for the SACN \(2015\) report. The respective increases and decreases in daily energy intake that Reid and colleagues identified were included in the final review and informed the dietary recommendations that ensued. Reid and Duffy’s research has thereby impacted on \(a\) the health and wellbeing of people, as evidenced by changes to public health guidelines, and \(b\) public policy and services, as evidenced by use in policy debates and citation in policy documents. 

 <ins>Impact on international public policy and services</ins> 

 Findings from Reid, Duffy, and colleagues’ \(2010\) study were included in a systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) Department of Nutrition for Health and Development and conducted by Te Morenga and colleagues \(2013\) \(\#9\). The review was commissioned to ‘assess the effects of increasing or decreasing intake of free sugars on excess weight gain’ and thereby to inform development of a WHO guideline. The subsequent 2015 guideline \(\#10\), ‘Sugars intake for adults and children’, makes three recommendations, namely 

 1. WHO recommends a reduced intake of free sugars throughout the lifecourse. 

 2. In both adults and children, WHO recommends reducing the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. 

 3. WHO suggests a further reduction of the intake of free sugars to below 5% of total energy intake. 

 The WHO envisage that the guideline will inform the development of policy and practice relating to dietary intake across the globe. As they state \(p.6\), ‘the guideline will help Member States and their partners in making informed decisions about nutrition policies, programmes and interventions’. 

 Reid and Duffy’s \(2010\) study was one of 30 high\-quality international studies included in the Te Morenga \(2013\) review \(\#9\). Both that review and Reid, Duffy and colleagues’ 2010 study are cited in the 2015 guideline \(\#10\). Reid and Duffy’s research has thereby impacted internationally on the development of public health guidelines, and public policy and services, as evidenced by use in policy debates and citation in policy documents.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 **Changes to online safety** **legislation, education and teacher/coach professional training** have led to young people optimising the benefits of digital technologies and social media for physical activity and being protected from accessing unsafe digital material. We have **stimulated and informed policy change** which has led to the appointment of a national online regulator as well as an **overhaul of the national school curriculum** for Personal, Social and Health Education \(PSHE\). The impact is national, extending to over 7 million youth, *c*.4000 physical activity and health organisations and *c*.100,000 international teachers and coaches. Furthermore, working collaboratively with key organisations \(e.g., ukactive, The Football Association\), **professional standards and best practices have been revised** by the creation of new guidelines, professional training programmes and safeguarding practices. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Our body of work has provided robust scientific evidence on the benefits and harms of the digital age for young people. **The original contribution is that** **the findings are, for the first time, grounded in evidence of youth perspectives**. The specific and novel focus was on co\-producing new knowledge with youth to explain what and how they learn in digital health contexts, and, in turn, the offline educative support they require from relevant adults to maximise benefits and mitigate risks. Overall, the research enhances adults’ abilities to make informed decisions about how to protect youth from health\-related risks and maximise the benefits of the digital age. 

 The main empirical research was undertaken between 2015–2019 in collaboration with: \(i\) **young people** \(n=1691; age 13–18; across the UK\) to examine the types of physical activity, diet/nutrition and body image information young people access and use from social media, apps and wearable devices, and why; \(ii\) **practitioners/professionals**, within a network of 35 international researchers, teachers, health and technology professionals, and policy makers to understand how relevant adults can provide support; \(iii\) 2 **national professional development providers** to influence the content and design of teacher and coach professional development. 

 <ins> **Key Findings**</ins> 

 **Young People** 

1.  **The data revealed new evidence on how digital spaces educate young people**: 5 forms of digital content influenced young people’s learning in digital spaces: peer content \(e.g., selfies\); reputable accounts \(e.g., ‘celebrities’, government\); recommended content \(e.g., YouTube\); commercial content and ‘likes’ influenced young people to engage with health information in different ways. \[R1\] 

1.  **In contrast to previous evidence and popular opinion, findings showed that young people are critical and highly self\-aware users and generators of digital mediums**: Most young people could evaluate the types of content that were relevant to their needs and disregard content that had the potential to lead to harm. Young people were highly self\-aware of their own vulnerabilities and recognised that digital engagement can magnify those vulnerabilities, posing additional health\-related risks. The context in which social media is used is important, where peers, family members and schools are powerful influencers. \[R2\] 

 **Practitioners/Professionals** 

1.  **New evidence is provided on what support young people want and need in schools**: Personal, Social and Health Education \(PSHE\) and Physical Education \(PE\) were identified as primary contexts in which to provide media literacy education that helps young people to navigate age\-appropriate content, and in a way that reaches all young people \(from diverse contexts\). \[R3\] 

1.  **Digital Technology Companies/Social Media were identified as essential for offering online support, and this is often lost in discourse about support and risk**: Social media/technology companies provide online education and include filters and restrictions to protect the safety of younger users. \[R4\] 

 **Professional Development Providers** 

1.  **Findings furthered the importance of focusing on inclusion in teacher/coach professional development**: Professional development provision should focus on **inclusive practices** to help teachers and coaches engage with the complexity and diversity of young people’s digital needs. \[R5\] 

1.  **Findings from youth provided new understandings into safeguarding issues**: Safeguarding issues related to young people’s engagement will ensure that young people receive appropriate support from adults. \[R6\]

 <ins>Impacts on</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>ublic</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>olicy has led to the regulation of social media companies in the UK</ins> 

 **Policy decisions and changes to legislation  have been informed by our research evidence which was important in drafting and developing the intermediate bill on online harms in the UK in 2020 \[R4\]. Our contribution to policy development was pivotal as **we** **were the only academics guiding parliamentarians with evidence co\-produced with young people** and on youth perspectives on digital health learning. 

 Evidence provided by Goodyear to the Chief Medical Officer roundtable on screen time and social media use \[R4\] was explicitly reported in the preceding White Paper \(E1, Box 11\). Based on concerns about online safety for young people outlined in E1, the Online Harms Bill called for the appointment of Ofcom as an online regulator for social media. This directly reflects the oral and written evidence \[R4\] provided by Goodyear in the House of Commons to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Social Media and Young People’s Mental Health and Wellbeing \[E3, paras 17,18\]. This led to the recommendation that social media companies establish a duty of care to include new filters and restrictions on content \[E4\]. 

 This is a shift in policy debate and interest by government, and is significant because our research **highlighted to parliamentarians a new issue of concern**. Prior to this intervention, social media were regulated under the broad category of the Internet, and there was no regulator or legislation of the practices of social media companies in the UK related to online harms. The change has national reach where it impacts on 71% of young people in the UK \(approx. 7.3 million age 10–19; Statista, 2018\), who are reported to be active users of social media \(Ofcom, 2019\). 

 <ins>Impacts on</ins> <ins>l</ins><ins>earning by</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>olicy</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>hanges to the national school curriculum</ins> 

 In 2020, Personal, Social and Health Education \(PSHE\) was made a mandatory subject in 20,202 UK state schools. Furthermore, the content of the curriculum was changed to include a new focus on age\-appropriate digital content, digital literacy, and online safety education — in relation to health, e.g., body image and social media \(Department for Education \(DfE\) 2019\). 

 Both these **changes to educational policy were directly informed by our research** \[R3\] and follow recommendations made by Goodyear to the Science and Technology Committee \(STC\) in the form of written evidence \[E5, para 21\], and in responses made during oral evidence in the House of Commons \[E6, Q298–300; E4, paras 19, 145, 153\]. Based on this evidence, the STC made the following recommendation: 

 We recommend that PSHE education be made mandatory for primary and secondary school children in the next parliamentary session and that the PSHE curriculum delivers an age\-appropriate understanding of, and resilience towards, the harms and benefits of the digital world. \[E4, para 149\] 

 The APPG also made the recommendation that PSHE should be mandatory and include a focus on health\-related harms and benefits of social media use \[E2, para 5.1\]. This statement echoes the oral evidence provided by Goodyear based on R1 to the House of Commons \[E2, paras 3–5\] and documented in a report from the APPG \[E2, key finding, p. 5\]. Finally, The Youth Select Committee recommended that media literacy for body image should be taught in PSHE \[E7, paras 12, 13\], again drawing on written evidence based on R2 provided by Goodyear and Armour. 

 Informed by the research evidence \[R3\], the **statutory guidelines have changed**, so that they now require that pupils should know about comparisons with others online and how using social media can lead to the development of an unrealistic body image \(DfE, 2019, p. 36\), how relationships on social media develop \(DfE, 2019, p. 36\), why age restrictions exist for content and platforms \(DfE, 2019, p. 32\) and the positive impacts of social media on relationships and health behaviours \(DfE, 2019, p. 36\). In addition, the need for teaching different content related to social media for primary and secondary school pupils was accepted \(DfE, 2019\). These changes reached, at a minimum, the 8 million pupils in state school education \(DfE, 2019\). Pre\-2020, PSHE digital literacy and health education were not statutory requirements \(PSHE Association, 2018\). 

 <ins>Influencing professional standards by informing best practice</ins> 

 **Professional bodies have been influenced by our research and have developed best practices and guidelines** for informing and training teachers and coaches who have a responsibility for young people’s health and wellbeing. 

 As an example, ukactive recently **published national guidelines** on healthy lifestyle behaviours, and our evidence \[R1, R2\] on social media and physical activity education were cited as an example of best practice \[E8\]. The guidelines were sent to 4,000 ukactive member organisations \(i.e., physical activity organisations with a typical minimum membership of 100 individuals\), which has subsequently **impacted on how technology is used pedagogically**. For example, the research evidence \[R4\] informed the development of a mobile gaming app by Rocket Impact — a technology start\-up company — to encourage physical activity, which is now commercially available across the UK \[E8\]<ins>.</ins> 

 Similarly, our evidence on inclusion \[R5\] was included in the design of **continuing professional development** with Activity Alliance who changed their professional training/development workshops for teachers to include a focus on inquiry in inclusion \[E9\]. This has impacted on *c*.14,500 UK teachers and *c*.340,000 young people. Guidelines have since been adopted by 30 workshop tutors, who deliver training to *c*.900 teachers per year; this impacts on *c*.50,000 young people. 

 Finally, safeguarding **practices have been changed** at The Football Association \(FA\) to address potential risks for the online safety of youth sport coaches. The FA stated: 

 \[Griffiths’ and Goodyear’s\] body of work \[R6\] helped us to \[… be\] more aware of the need to manage individuals who are over and under 16 in digital spaces \[… and\] define better working practices with regards to education and digital/online safeguarding principles as they relate to Football. \[E10\] 

 This change to practice and has impacted on the learning of over 6,000 international sport coaches from 155 different countries \[E10\]. The FA have since adopted these safeguarding principles for their online training platform that reaches 80,000 football coaches, with 30,000 working with 5–11 age groups \[E10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research concerning the experience, understanding and representation of landscapes, environments, places and spaces, undertaken by Dr Mike Bintley and Dr Sonia Overall has: 

1.  Given audiences new experiences of literature and landscape, using movement to explore text and place; 

1.  Enhanced understanding and experience of Kent’s heritage, including Folkestone’s significant early medieval heritage and St Augustine’s Abbey, part of Canterbury’s UNESCO World Heritage site; 

1.  Supported creative practice and thinking, including bringing together practitioners and providing social connection during COVID 19 lockdowns. 

 Impact has been primarily to the benefit of our Kent communities and local organisations, realised through activities including: *O What We Ben\!* for the Being Human festival \(Bintley/Overall\); Heritage Lottery funded *Finding Eanswythe* \(Bintley\); work with English Heritage at Augustine Abbey \(Overall\); and the development of the creative tools *DriftDeck* and *Distance Drift* \(Overall\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning this case study is concerned with investigating the real and literary landscapes of the past and present. Bintley’s interdisciplinary research on the landscapes of early medieval England in Old English literature and archaeology, examines human interactions with aspects of landscape, place and space in early medieval England. Overall’s research utilises psychogeography, the study of the relationship between place and behaviour, to bring new experiences of literature, landscape and place, and explore the relationship between walking and creativity. Together they have a shared interest in the different ways landscapes \(both real and literary\) are experienced and understood, and the effect this has on how people think and inter/act with their environment. 

 Bintley’s translation of *Andreas* \(2016\) in collaboration with Professor Richard North \(UCL\), was the first scholarly edition and translation of the Old English poem to fully address the work’s representation of an urban landscape, as it would have been understood in the contemporary contexts of post\-colonial post\-Roman Britain. The first edition of *Andreas* for 55 years, this new volume includes a 115\-page introduction re\-positioning the work within nearly six decades’ progress in palaeography, sources and analogues, language, metrics, literary criticism and archaeology **\[3.1\].** Bintley also investigated the settlement landscape of early medieval England and its representation in works of literature, demonstrating how narratives of urban landscapes reinforce early medieval origin mythologies, and how the regeneration and reclamation of Roman places were closely connected with the establishment of authority in the early Church **\[3.2\].** This was further examined in the context of the translation of the relics of St Oswald to the site of the New Minster in Gloucester in the early 10<sup>th</sup> century. Bintley highlights the importance of the surrounding landscape in the siting of the New Minster and argues that the relics of Oswald were brought to Gloucester, not only to consolidate its spiritual importance, but also to appropriate topographical and cultural traditions of the surrounding landscape to establish links to the Christian heritage of Rome **\[3.3\].** 

 Rooted in creative writing practice, Overall’s research offers correlations between psychogeography, exploring the effect of landscape, environment and movement on emotions and behaviour, and the relationship of walking to ideation and writing. It broadens the application of psychogeographical theories, with their curiosity\-driven and disruptive approach, to the fields of literature and creative practice, articulating a working definition of psychogeography and her creative walking practices \(attentive and attitudinal walking\) **\[3.4\] \[3.5\]**. ‘Attentive walking’ was first defined in Overall’s article *Walking against the current* \(2015\) as a method of ‘walking without agenda’ **\[3.5\]**. The application of intention to this practice creates ‘attitudinal walking’, defined by Overall as ‘walks or walking practices employing one or more conscious intentions or attitudes’, allowing the practitioner to see place through a particular mode or lens, or to walk with a specific enquiry or topic in mind. First used in *The walking dead, or why psychogeography matters* \(2017\) **\[3.4\]** attitudinal walking can include constraints, such as instructions to disrupt flow, or the reading of landscape through the lens of a text. Overall’s practices embrace the heightened awareness engendered through walking and psychogeography to enable writers to see beyond the prescribed and familiar, bringing new insights which can then be put to creative use **\[3.5\].** *The Art of Walking* \(2015\) is a collection of creative responses to movement and place, engendered through propositional practice research including attentive and attitudinal walking. It queries what walking\-writing can be, exploring the relationship between walking and creativity, self and setting. Poems in the ‘psychogeography’ section are concerned with spirit of place as well as formal experimentation, with site specific poems drawing on historical and cultural connections to landscape and details of place **\[3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 A strategic focus for impact in this UoA has been the development of relationships within our Kent community, to deliver a wide range of engagement activities to the benefit of our local communities and organisations. Close working relationships within the UoA bring together seemingly disparate research areas around shared concerns. In the case of this study, Overall and Bintley’s collective interest in experience of landscape led to collaboration for the 2017 Being Human festival, bringing together creative writing and psychogeography with Old English literature and archaeology. Direct beneficiaries of impact are primarily located in Kent and include: Heritage organisations; schools and their pupils; creative practitioners, and participants and audiences for activities. 

 **Given audience new experiences of literature and landscape.** Funded by the Being Human festival \(2017\) **,** *O What We Ben\!* \(Bintley/Overall\) mapped the urban landscapes of Mermedonia from *Andreas* **\[3.1\]** and Russell Hoban’s cult novel *Riddley Walker* \(a book set in an imagined post\-apocalyptic east\-Kent and written in a futuristic Kent dialect\), onto modern Canterbury as a site\-specific embodied experience of the texts. Via hard\-copy maps, a companion website, and walking tours, it connected pivotal moments in both texts with historic places and spaces in Canterbury, with movement through the urban landscape guided by Overall’s attitudinal **\[3.4\]** and attentive **\[3.5\]** walking methods **.** Three guided walks attracted approximately 30 participants, with engagement extended via an interactive website **\[5.1a\]** which has received over 2,000 page views \(to 4 Nov 2020\). Participants’ feedback evidences new perspectives on the text describing the experience as being a ‘wonderful imagining of literary and cultural heritage in a meaningful physical setting’; ‘magical unpacking of history, fiction and fantasy’; ‘an on the ground \(literally\) experience of walking the text’; and as having ‘transformed my understanding of both texts’ **\[5.1b\]**. *O What We Ben\!* featured as a walking interview in a 20\-minute segment on BBC Radio 3’s ‘Free Thinking’, one of only three projects included in this programme from 336 Being Human events across the UK. Presenter Matthew Sweet noted how he had previously been unfamiliar with the poem *Andreas* and highlights how this way of ‘wandering’ through the landscapes of 3 cities \(modern Canterbury and those imagined in *Andreas* and *Riddley Walker*\) could ‘slightly demote the importance of the solid world around us, to make us feel a bit more humble about the time and space we occupy’ **\[5.2\].** During the last quarter of 2017 BBC Radio 3 had a weekly reach of 1.96 million \[RAJAR\]. 

  

 Overall frequently produces walking events to the benefit of cultural organisations and participants, often bringing together movement through landscape with literature, utilising attentive and attitudinal walking. These include: *Street Walking* for the POW\! Thanet Festival, a walk with texts that encouraged women to take up public space where 24 participants produced a *Walking Women’s Manifesto* \(March 2019\); *A Walk with Shrines* \(Sept 2018\) for Margate Bookie; and *Walk Like Wells: a dystopian derive \- The War of the Worlds* \(Nov 2016\) for the Folkestone Book Festival. To celebrate the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of *Riddley Walker*, Overall collaborated with Dr Andrew M. Butler \(CCCU\), Dr Paul March\-Russell \(University of Kent\) and Fiona MacDonald \(Feral Practice\) to create the multi\-disciplinary *Sum Tyms Bytin Sum Tyms Bit* \(Oct 2020\) for the Canterbury Festival. This day of screenings, talks, panel discussions, creative interventions, featured invited responses from Riddley fans including Neil Gaiman, Max Porter, David Mitchell and Una McCormack, and included a ‘distanced’ walk by Overall exploring environment through the lens of the novel. It attracted over 70 participants, with feedback noting its thought\-provoking nature and fascinating material **\[5.3\].** 

 **Enhancing understanding and experience of Kent’s heritage.** Overall has utilised her creative walking practices **\[3.4\] \[3.5\]** to encourage new interpretations and experiences of heritage sites. This includes the Heritage Lottery funded *Walking Heritage* \(2016\), a series of walks, workshops and trails in Sandwich, Kent, led by Overall; and a training workshop \(2016\) for English Heritage volunteers at Walmer Castle, Kent, which used psychogeography to encourage creative ways of experiencing buildings and artefacts. Overall was subsequently invited to work with a team of curatorial and interpretation staff from English Heritage with a brief to develop a new interpretation that would provide an improved visitor experience for families at St Augustine’s Abbey, part of Canterbury’s UNESCO World Heritage Site. The abbey is an open\-air site, with ruined walls and little tangible heritage, which previously offered no specific resources aimed at families. The Interpretation Manager \(South East\) at English Heritage writes how, Overall ‘was intrinsic to the development and facilitation’ of a series of family forums, ‘hosting activities and walks, allowing families to interact with the historical content in a ‘hands\-on’ way \[…\] Every element of the WHS history which we discussed was easily adapted into a fun game or a self\-led activity – this allowed our forum to test out many things which would eventually be incorporated into the physical and permanent interpretation on site’ and that her ‘playful approach was a perfect fit for English Heritage’s aims to ‘Bring History to life \[…\] Significantly, the resources at St Augustine’s allow people to now enjoy the site holistically – not just by listening to an audio guide but also by finding different ways to look at, and engage with, our sites. Sonia’s work was incredibly important in bringing this together.’ An indicator of the success of the finished interpretation was given by an increase in visitor numbers from 18,390 per annum in 2016 to 23,000 in 2019/20 and the site’s Key Performance Indicators in relation to overall visitor experience and bringing history to life, comparing favourably with other projects with significantly higher budgets.’ **\[5.4\]** 

 Bintley’s understanding of the key role material landscape exerted over in the early medieval imagination, and the part this played in the establishment of the early Church **\[3.2\] \[3.3\]** was utilised in *Finding Eanswythe*: *The Life and Afterlife of an Anglo\-Saxon Saint* \(2017\-2020\). This interdisciplinary community heritage project based in Folkestone, Kent, was developed by project lead Dr Lesley Hardy \(History, CCCU\), with Bintley and Dr Eleanor Williams \(Archaeology, CCCU\), in partnership with the Canterbury Archaeological Trust \(CAT\) and funded by the Heritage Lottery \(£93,500\). Folkestone has significant early heritage, which has been largely overlooked and poorly understood. Little was known about Anglo\-Saxon princess Eanswythe and the heritage associated with her, despite her purported relics being held in the Parish Church of Saint Mary and Eanswythe, Folkestone; where she was associated with one of the earliest monastic communities in England. Bintley was the period specialist on the CCCU team, and a core member of the *Finding Eanswythe* Research Group, which brought together local non\-professional researchers, university researchers, archaeologists and conservationists, to bring new insights into Eanswythe in her historical and cultural context. Landscape is intrinsic to Eanswythe’s story, with surviving heritage features linked to her including a watercourse \(associated with her miracle of making water run up hill\), a ‘lost’ minster, and the North\-Downs Way. In addition, like the New Minster at Gloucester **\[3.3\]**, the decision to establish an early Church community in Folkestone, would have been influenced by landscape, including prehistoric and Roman features. 

 The project team developed an extensive public engagement programme to communicate findings and build appreciation for Folkestone’s early heritage. This ultimately reached in excess of 3,500 individuals through over 80 activities and projects including workshops, large public events, talks, walks and excavations **\[5.5a\].** The findings of the research group underpinned the project’s exhibition held in 2019, with feedback highlighting the positive impact on local people and their historic knowledge, including: ‘a wonderful trawl through our local history bringing into our time S.Eanswythe’s legacy’; ‘a fascinating insight into the history of Folkestone’; and ‘thank\-you for sharing so much local \(yet unknown to me\!\) information’ **\[5.5b\].** The project’s publication \(2020\), now available from St Mary and St Eanswythe’s, includes a chapter by Bintley locating Eanswythe’s lost minster in the context of the medieval landscape. In 2020 work by the project team, local community members, CAT, Folkestone Museum; and Queen’s University Belfast, confirmed that the relics held in St Mary’s and St Eanswythe’s were ‘almost certainly’ those of Eanswythe, making them the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal house and the earliest verified remains of an English saint. This discovery received widespread coverage including the BBC, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Daily Express and The Independent **\[5.6\],** taking this local community heritage project and the story of Eanswythe to a national audience. 

 **Supporting creative practice and thinking, including bringing together practitioners and providing social connection during COVID\-19 lockdowns.** Overall’s *The Art of Walking* was used by artist Elspeth Penfold with the ‘Walking with The Waste Land’ research group, alongside T.S. Eliot’s *The Waste Land*, to prompt discussions about connections between landscape, walking and poetry, as part of the development of Turner Contemporary’s exhibition *Journeys with ’The Waste Land’* \(2018\) **\[5.7a\].** In 2017, Overall developed *Drift Deck*, playing cards used to encourage attitudinal and attentive walking by facilitating the seeking of sensory detail and introducing disruption **\[3.4\] \[3.5\]**. Penfold went on to use the *Drift Deck* at Churchfields Primary School, Bromley, Kent \(2018\) for a My Creative School project with over 100 members of the school community **\[5.7a\]**. Echoing *Drift Deck*, pupils ‘created a deck of creative challenge cards drawing on the principles of psychogeography’ which enabled the application of ‘creative approaches to rediscover the school environment’ **\[5.7b\].** *Drift Deck* was also used as a development tool in projects by Stephen Donnelly who employed the deck to explore bereavement and grief as part of his performance project *Sore Thumbs* \(2018\), supported by the Arts Council of Wales. Reflecting on the project, Donnelly comments how *Drift Deck* became part of the ‘central framework’ for explorations and ‘a pivotal driver of re\-correlating images, play, memory \[…\] we would pick out a few cards to derail or sensorially heighten our experience’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 During COVID lockdowns *Drift Deck* was developed by Overall into *Distance Drift*, distanced collaborative walking exploring landscape and environment, with participants following the hashtag \#DistanceDrift to receive attentive and attitudinal walking prompts to be followed, indoors or out, in any location. The event began running weekly on Sundays at the beginning of April 2020, with individuals posting images related to prompts. Since its inception \#DistanceDrift has attracted a regular following, with over 375,000 impressions of the hashtag on Twitter and 20,615 direct engagements \(to Dec 2020\); and has run in programmes of the Fourth World Congress of Psychogeography \(Sept 2020\), MargateNOW \(Sept\-Oct 2020\), and CHAT 2020 festival of archaeology \(Oct 2020\), as part of *Sum Tyms Bytin Sum Tyms Bit*. Comments from participants not only highlight the creative benefits, but also the value of involvement against the background of the pandemic.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Graham’s research on the social aspects of bariatric surgery has improved the practice of over 550 surgeons, nurses, psychologists and nutritionists in the UK, Mexico and India. Clinicians better understand the social factors that influence life after surgery, the need for specialised contraceptive support and the role that pharmacists play after discharge. For the first time they systematically address these issues in pre\- and post\-operative care, leading to improved health and wellbeing of 111,000 patients around the world. The work empowers patients to overcome discrimination and challenges the stigma associated with bariatric surgery, giving voice to \- and validating the experiences of \- often alienated individuals.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Obesity is an increasing global health issue, with nearly 30% of adults in the UK classed as obese. Obesity is a stigmatised health condition, which results in a poor quality of life for many people. An increasing number of adults with obesity seek bariatric surgery as a method of weight\-loss and improvement of illnesses associated with obesity, e.g. Type 2 diabetes. Bariatric surgery is commonly perceived as both cosmetic and an easy way to lose weight, and portrayed as cheating, and/or that the surgery does the work and not the person. Currently only a small body of research explores the patient perspective of bariatric surgery. 

 This research, led by Graham, was undertaken in collaboration with Sunderland Royal Hospital, one of the highest volume centres in the UK. A series of qualitative studies examined the patient experience of the impact of bariatric surgery on their everyday lives. Individual face to face interviews were held with patients up to two years post\-operatively, exploring self\-reported issues in detail. 

 The findings show that many bariatric patients who have been stigmatised for their weight go on to be judged further for the method of their weight loss. The mechanisms of bariatric surgery induce rapid weight loss, which may significantly alter a person’s physical appearance, leaving them open to scrutiny over the changes from others. In order to avoid any confrontation and judgment, many people choose not to disclose the method of weight\-loss and resort to lying or avoiding the discussion altogether. This has a significant impact on a person’s life and may hinder social encounters and situations. 

 The findings **\[R1\]** provided three conceptual risk adjustment categories that patients may fall into: Risk Accepters \(accepting of the social risks and comfortable disclosing\), Risk Challengers \(who accept the social risks, but are not compliant with post\-surgical advice\) and Risk Contenders \(who are wary/frightened of social risks and disclosure, and whose adjustment process following surgery is complex owing to ongoing social and clinical issues\). Explicating these categories provides a framework for clinical discussions and for patients to have a non\-clinical framework to reflect on. 

 Findings further showed areas where patient support was provided well **\[R3\]** and illuminated areas where it could be more fully utilised, such as the use of social media and technology **\[R2\]**, along with exploring a potential role for community pharmacies to be involved in patient care, to bridge the gap between hospitals and community and provide long\-term support once patients were discharged. **\[R2, R3, R5\]** 

 The highest proportion of people who seek bariatric surgery are females in their reproductive years, and issues such as contraception, fertility and sexual health are important, but are not widely discussed in surgical environments **\[R4, R6\]**. Further research, based on patient and clinician responses, identified gaps in knowledge and pathways to improve patient care. 

 The research highlights the need for clinicians working within bariatric surgical multidisciplinary teams to be aware of the impact of social changes following surgery and the need to embed these into patient support in clinical environments. The findings have informed further work into sources of support outside the bariatric surgical teams, with published research into the patient\-reported impact on the role of the specialist bariatric pharmacist focussing on how community pharmacists might be utilised to provide additional support for patients in community\-based settings **\[R6\]**.

 **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Context** 

 Bariatric surgery is a widely used intervention; over 1.8m surgeries were performed between 2008\-16 worldwide, and annual numbers show a steep upward trend. Bariatric surgical research and practice typically focus on clinical outcomes such as weight loss and disease improvement, overlooking the impact of non\-clinical factors on patients’ lives after surgery. As one bariatric surgeon says, “ *We as physicians and surgeons are very focussed on the medical changes to our patients after bariatric surgery **\[**… **\]** and seldom stop to analyse and reflect on the impact of the social aspects”  \[S1\]**. There is an implicit assumption that as weight is lost, patients feel better and everything in their lives falls into place **\[S2\]**. Graham’s work for the first time brought patients’ perspectives and the effects of surgery on their everyday lives firmly into multi\-disciplinary bariatric care. 

 **Impact** 

 
Graham’s research was undertaken in collaboration with clinicians and has been disseminated globally through articles in journals and professional publications, academic and practitioner conferences and patient events. Its impact extends from improved professional understanding to improved patient health and wellbeing after bariatric surgery \(see diagram for overview\). The eight clinicians who provide testimonials for this case study estimate that, since 2016, 555 bariatric surgeons, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists and nutritionists in the UK, Mexico and India have changed how they work as a result of Graham’s work **\[see breakdown in Section 5\]**. This includes clinicians based in Sunderland, which has one of the busiest bariatric units in the UK, and Tijuana, where 12,000 surgeries are carried out on patients from Mexico, the USA and Canada per year. They estimate that 2,550 of their patients have benefited from this research **\[see breakdown in Section 5\]**. Extrapolating from a median of 200 patients per clinician, approximately 111,000 patients around the world have benefitted. Graham is embedded in the bariatric surgical communities in the UK, India and Latin America, and these impacts result from purposeful engagement with patients and clinicians before, during and after the research. 

 <ins>Professional knowledge has been enhanced</ins> 

 Bariatric surgical clinicians have a new understanding of the social aspects of bariatric surgery and their huge importance to patients. Practitioners across the care pathway report increased awareness **\[S3, S1, S2, S4, S5, S6, S7\].** One bariatric surgeon in England describes the research’s *“phenomenal impact on our understanding of the importance of taking the non\-clinical aspects of bariatric surgery into our professional practice*” **\[S4\].  A bariatric nurse in England recognises that she didn’t realise how social factors affect patients, and that she *“was unaware of how important to the patients this was.”* As a result of Graham’s research, she says *“I better understand what patients think about in everyday life, and that even the smallest things which most people take for granted \[…\] are much more complex and fraught with risk than I thought”* **\[S2\]**. Clinicians report improvements in their own practice from this knowledge, being able to *“prepare patients for the changes that surgery brings, thereby increasing their quality of life, and giving them knowledge and confidence to deal with situations new to them”.* Graham’s research also identified the need for pharmacists on multidisciplinary teams. As one patient advocate explains, Graham’s research clearly illustrates that *“the information and support provided by a pharmacist, given the changes to medication and lifelong vitamin supplementation, is crucial”  \[S5\]**. 

 <ins>Practice has improved</ins> 

 Bariatric surgical clinicians around the world have used Graham’s research to transform their pre\- and post\-surgical practice **\[S3, S1, S2, S4, S5, S6, S7\]**. A surgeon in Mexico says *“Graham’s work has challenged and indeed changed the way that surgeons think, and has been done in a way that has motivated surgeons like myself to apply her work in our practice and patient care”* **\[S1\]**. For the first time, they have revised protocols for discussions with patients to include the social aspects of bariatric surgery in pre\- and post\-operative consultations. Consultations now cover topics such as how eating in the home and restaurants will be affected and whether they will tell others that they’ve had bariatric surgery, and prepare them to receive and manage negative judgments from others against this method of weight loss. He estimates that 1,000 of his patients, living in Mexico, the USA and Canada, have benefited from this change. A surgeon in India says the research has “ *profoundly influenced the types of conversations I have with my patients*”, confirming that they now discuss non\-clinical aspects of surgery “ *not as a social conversation, but as part of the pre\- and post\-surgical consultations and follow up.*” **\[S7\]**. Another new inclusion in discussions is contraception **\[S2, S8, S4, S6\]**. A UK surgeon describes the change: *“we now provide patients with information on contraception and suitable methods before and after surgery. We have also changed practice so that this is discussed in more detail, and patients are signposted to appropriate contraceptive services as appropriate*” **\[S4\]**. This enhanced awareness has driven expansion of multidisciplinary teams. In 2015 City Hospitals Sunderland, home to one of the UK’s busiest bariatric units with between 400 and 600 surgeries per year, added a pharmacy role into the team, delivering pre\-operative assessment, peri\-operative monitoring, and support for community nurses and GPs. It has since created a second post to manage demand for pharmacist input **\[S4\]**. 

 <ins>Patient care has improved</ins> 

 Clinicians attest that these changes improve patient care; as one surgeon said, *“Graham’s research has positively influenced the UK bariatric surgical community’s approach to patients and many clinical counters are more patient\-focused”* **\[S9\]**. This shift towards patient\-centred care has been acknowledged by other clinicians beyond the UK **\[S3, S7\]**. Graham’s risk adjustment categories are used to tailor consultations to patients’ needs. A Bariatric Surgeon in Mexico says *“This helps us to understand how they may deal with the changes after surgery, and has led to more open and honest discussions with patients, which has resulted in improved care…* \[which has\]… *improved the lives of patients and helped them adjust to life after surgery”* **\[S3\]**. Some clinicians have established support groups for patients in response to the research findings **\[S2\]**. 

 <ins>Patients’ health and wellbeing has improved</ins> 

 Patients report improvements in physical and mental health and wellbeing as a result of these improvements. One says that clinicians’ greater appreciation for patients’ needs has given her *“the right support to change, accept and understand what works to sustain a healthier and happier life”* **\[S10\]**, and another says that the research *“has educated me regarding bariatric surgery, which in turn has impacted my wellbeing, physical and mental health.*” Better pre\-operative care means that patients *“feel more confident about being open about the surgery”* and empowered to be *“honest and **\[**tell **\]** people from day one.”* **\[S10\]** Improved post\-operative care, and access to support groups have reduced patient isolation and increased their understanding and appreciation of themselves as individuals. One patient says that the research *“made me realise I’m not alone, definitely eating better again and having more confidence as well.”* **\[S10\]** 

  

 <ins>Patients’ voices are heard, and their needs and experiences recognised</ins> 

 Conducting qualitative research with patients means that patients’ voices about the social aspects of bariatric surgery are now being heard, with positive effects on their wellbeing. Patients say that it makes them *“feel valued and listened to”*; others highlight the importance of this representation, saying *“It’s important to have someone to be a voice for those who have had or are considering bariatric surgery,”* because *“bariatric patients often feel alienated and uninvolved”* **\[S10\]**. Clinicians agree that these issues are *“often underestimated aspects of bariatric surgery”* **\[S1\]**. By foregrounding patients’ views, Graham’s work *“‘legitimised’ many issues that patients experience, and find difficult to speak about”* **\[S11\]**. A patient advocate says that many people *“assume that weight loss is the main outcome of surgery. Talk to any patient and you will see that quality of life issues and matters that go beyond weight are important to us. \[This\] research incorporates the patient voice \[…\] so clinicians and others gain a more comprehensive understanding of bariatric surgery from the patient perspective”* **\[S5\]**. The result is a change in the dynamics of doctor\-patient relationships. Patients are empowered to be open about their experiences; as one surgeon says, *“patients are more open in their conversations with me, which helps me to support them not only medically, but in a more holistic, patient\-centred approach”* **\[S4\]**. 

 <ins>Stigmas are being confronted</ins> 

 Graham’s research challenges stigmas around surgery as a weight loss method, and has supported patients in overcoming discrimination. One patient says, *“society sees surgery as the ‘easy’ option for obese people,”* and that this research has built the foundations for changing narratives around bariatric surgery to recognise that *“the operation is only a ‘tool’, the operation is predominantly for most patients the ‘easy’ bit.”* Another says *“the research is important as it is helping both bariatric patients and the general public understand why the surgery is so important and it's usually last resort for most patients.”* This has tangible benefits; as one patient says, the research *“has helped me and many others who have had surgery overcome the social discrimination we can feel”* **\[S10\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Collaborative research led by Queen Mary and Baxter, which, in 2010, acquired the Queen Mary spin\-out ApaTech™, which was set up in 2001 to commercialise Queen Mary research, resulted in the UK launch of the synthetic bone graft substitute Inductigraft™ in 2013. Inductigraft has enhanced bioactivity comprising equivalent performance to the gold standard, autograft, and superior performance to other commercial synthetic bone graft \(SBG\) materials and allografts \(treated donor bone\).  It was launched in the US under the trade name AltaPore™, with FDA approval granted for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2017, and posterolateral spine fusion in September 2018. In 2018, a ‘flow’ version of Actifuse™ \(initially launched in 2005 by ApaTech, also based on Queen Mary research\) was launched, which provides a finer fraction of granules for narrow bore application. Approximately 24,000 procedures take place every year using Baxter products with 98.9% fusion rates. The move from autograft to Baxter synthetic bone grafts has led to reduced complication rates and enhanced patient outcomes. In 2019, a Royal Mail stamp, dedicated to the innovation of Actifuse™/Inductigraft™/AltaPore™ SBGs, was issued as part of the British Engineering Stamp collection.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Synthetic bone grafts \(SBGs\) are highly porous materials \(>60% porous\) often consisting of a ceramic with a calcium\-phosphate\-based chemistry and an open foam\-like porous structure, which mimics cancellous bone \(the internal tissue of skeletal bone\). The purpose of a SBG is to stimulate bone healing or regeneration where the skeleton’s natural regenerative abilities are impaired or insufficient. Early SBGs were variable in both effectiveness and reliability due to a lack of understanding of the body’s biological response to these materials and their characteristics. 

 The QMUL spin\-out ApaTech™ was established in 2001, built on the research undertaken under the directorship of Prof William Bonfield and Prof Serena Best, both at Queen Mary until 1999, working in collaboration with Prof Iain Gibson and Dr Hing. The team optimised graft chemistry and structure, and developed novel processing technology to deliver superior synthetic bone graft substitutes, ApaPore™ \(2001\) and Actifuse™ \(2005\), to the clinical market. The company was acquired by Baxter inc. in 2010. Since 2000, Dr Karin Hing at Queen Mary has built on the teams pioneering research, in response to earlier observations of the sensitivity of bone regeneration to graft chemistry, macro\-pore structure and strut permeability. Dr Hing has investigated the mechanisms through which minor fluctuations in SBG chemistry and strut porosity can either enhance or impair bone healing. This has led to work that demonstrates that bone regeneration can be further enhanced by manipulating the exact structural characteristics of the porous ceramic foam. This has led to further refinement of graft structure, resulting in SBGs with enhanced bioactivity, and the clinical launch of Inductigraft™/AltaPore™. 

 Dr. Hing’s work led to the understanding that the sensitivity of bioactivity to chemistry is dependent on both the pattern of inorganic ion exchange and surface selectivity of key proteins, which synergistically direct bone cell recruitment, metabolism and function \[3.1\]. Further research demonstrated that increasing strut porosity in SBGs enables a synthetic graft to stimulate osteoinductive\-like behaviour when implanted ectopically in a recognised model of osteoinductivity, and facilitates faster and more reliable bone regeneration \[3.2\]. This is particularly important in the treatment of patients with impaired bone biology, multi\-level spinal fusions or complicated trauma injuries. This work led to the successful filing of a patent by ApaTech/Baxter \[5.1\]. The launch of Inductigraft/AltaPore was underpinned by studies that \(1\) show efficacy of SBGs with increased strut\-porosity in a critical defect orthotopic model, as both an autograft extender \(using ‘patient’s’ own bone\), as a standalone SBG \[3.3\] and in a challenging spine fusion model \[3.4\] and \(2\) further probe the relative roles of graft chemistry \[3.5\] and structure in enhancing bone growth \[3.6\].

 Inductigraft \(AltaPore in the US\) is a bone void filler intended for gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. These defects may be surgically created or from traumatic injury. The product is reabsorbed and replaced by bone during the healing process. 

 Inductigraft and AltaPore are delivered through Baxter, and are based on the 2003 and 2009 ApaTech/Baxter patents \[5.1\]. AltaPore received FDA approval for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2013 and posterolateral spine fusions in September 2018 \[5.2\]. The Shape version \(malleable putty instead of granules delivered dry or in a sculptable carrier, ABX\) was launched in 2019. 

#  Enhanced patient health and well\-being 

##  Clinical superiority of Inductigraft/Altapore 

 Inductigraft/AltaPore has been clinically reported to have “excellent fusion rates” \[5.3\] according to Michael Mokawem, Consultant Orthopaedic and Spinal Surgeon, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust, with 98.9% fusion rates in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and lateral lumbar interbody fusion surgery. 

 Mr. Mokawem further reported “12 months CT scans showing close to 100% fusion \(1 out of 150 failed\), whereas for other SBGs it would be 80\-92%.” Mr. Mokawem added that the Baxter products’ optimised levels of silicate and pore structures \(to facilitate development of interpenetrating vascular networks\) to “provide a microenvironment that facilitates osteoblasts to start bone formation” and have, thus, more reliable outcomes in surgery. The chemistry \(apatite based rather than tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulphate/calcium carbonate based\) means that these materials do not degrade chemically in the physiological environment. Any remodelling that happens is entirely cell mediated \(use of chemically biodegradable materials can result in complications\). Additionally, unlike traditional growth factor based treatments, Inductigraft/AltaPore is not contraindicated in skeletally immature individuals, which has enabled successful treatment of children and adolescents \[5.4\]. 

##  Improved patient outcomes 

 First, with use of Inductigraft/AltaPore, the surgeon is *“*able to reliably use Inductigraft without the need to harvest iliac crest bone to achieve excellent fusion rates, so eliminating the need for a second donor site with associated risks of infection, pain and complications associated with donor site morbidity,” according to Robert Lee, Consultant spinal surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital Stanmore \[5.5\]. Additionally, the use of SBGs means there is a reduced need for anaesthesia and, thus, reduced surgical risks to patients. This is because without the need to obtain autograft bone \(from the iliac crest\), the operative procedure is shorter so patients are anaesthetised for a reduced length of time. 

 Second, a patient treated with Inductigraft/AltaPore has a greater chance of avoiding reoperation or revision surgery because “the excellent fusion rates significantly contribute to the improvement in patient reported outcomes,” according to Mr. Lee \[5.5\]. Further, patients are typically released from hospital two to three days earlier, which has a positive effect on both the patient’s quality of life and that of their family, friends and work colleagues. 

 Finally, in clinical trials at month 12 post fusion, clinically significant decreases in disability were observed. Patients also reported reductions in pain and an improved quality of life post\-surgery. Motor, sensory functions, reflexes, straight leg raise and femoral stretches were either maintained, or improved in over half of patients \[5.6\]. 

#  Improved health economics \[5.4\] 

 Use of autograft involves two surgeries \(harvesting of the bone followed by implantation\), meaning 

-  The operation itself is prolonged 

-  Autograft harvesting procedures routinely have complications 

 For allograft and autograft, the risk of infection or immune rejection is significant vs SBGs where it is virtually zero. The percentage of patients returning with complications and requiring further surgery is therefore higher for allo/autograft, as, in the case of allografts, the bone has to be treated and sterilised before it is used. The faster bone growth associated with Baxter products also means that there is a reduced need for hardware, for example the insertion of metal supports. 

 The associated cost implications of the above are detailed in the table below: 

| Item | Baxter | Autograft | Growth factor therapy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Material cost /procedure | USD600\-800 | N/A | USD4,000\-8,000 |
| Operation time | 20% less than autograft, an average of 3 hours | \+USD1,000/operation ||
| Recovery time | 2\-3 days less than autograft, saving USD280/day | \+USD840/operation ||
| Complications | 21% less than autograft | \+USD6,000/operation | Potential for complications in 50% of cases |

 Based on approximately 24,000 procedures per year, Baxter products are estimated to save 

-  USD31,000,000 per year when compared to autograft\-based procedures 

-  USD74,000,000 per year when compared to growth factor\-based procedures 

#  Continued use of Actifuse™ \(launched in 2005\) in the current REF time period 

 Actifuse, launched in 2005 and the subject of a Queen Mary REF 2014 impact case study, is continuing to have a health impact. This is now expanding to areas outside of spinal injuries to knee injuries. A clinical study conducted between 2012 and 2015 found that clinical function outcomes after knee surgery using Actifuse vs autograft were comparable 3 years after surgery. The average operative time in the autograft group was 114 minutes, nearly double that in the Actifuse group \(64 minutes\), as using the SBG is a technically less demanding procedure than using harvested cancellous bone from the iliac crest. No complications occurred in the Actifuse group. In contrast, 1/20 patients in the autograft group required revision surgery at the donor site \[5.8\]. 

 In 2018, a ‘flow’ version of Actifuse was launched, which provides a finer fraction of granules for narrow bore application. It is unique in that it is non\-setting when injected \[5.4\]. Actifuse Flow comes ready to use with no mixing or preparation involved and maintains its consistency throughout surgery. The SBG is delivered directly from a pre\-loaded syringe with the ability to start and stop delivery, making use of Actifuse compatible with minimally invasive surgical techniques in addition to more traditional open surgery, increasing potential market size. 

#  Stimulated academic and public interest and attracted national/international recognition 

 In 2014, the Academia/Industry partnership, TERMIS\-EU \(Europe\) and TERMIS\-AM \(Americas\) Industry Committees used Baxter \(and ApaTech\) as a case study to demonstrate that there are a number of mechanisms by which industry can interact effectively with academia to transfer technologies to commercial partners \[5.9\]. 

 Outside of Queen Mary, Baxter products have been used as a biomedical technology ‘Laboratory Bench to Clinic’ case study in the syllabus of various undergraduate biomaterials/bioengineering degree programmes across the country. This includes Kings College London \(delivered to approx. 20 students, in 2017, 2019\) and the University of Manchester \(delivered to approx. 30 students from 2014 to 2019\) \[5.10\] \[5.11\]. 

 
The development of Actifuse and Inductigraft/AltaPore bone graft substitutes has achieved national/international recognition though the issue of a Royal Mail stamp \(priced at £1.60\) dedicated to the innovation of SBG materials able to enhance bone growth. The stamp was released in the British Engineering Stamp Issue \(May 2019\) celebrating seven key British engineering achievements of the last 50 years \[5.12\] and was described by Mr Philip Parker \(Stamp Strategy Manager, Royal Mail\) as a “very well received and successful” \[5.12\] stamp issue.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted by Swansea University has established the global historical significance of the South Wales copper industry and has helped to preserve and develop what is left of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks, one of the last remaining substantial built heritage assets in the lower Swansea Valley. The research has had an effect on the Swansea council development plan and the targeted regional investment programme for the lower Swansea valley. It has changed the awareness and understanding of the copper industry heritage in the communities and schools of the lower Swansea Valley, as well as bringing visitor and broadcaster interest.  It has had an effect on the GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package Copr Bay, SME location on the Hafod Morfa site and copper branding of firms in the area. Overall, the research has helped Swansea to develop a holistic historically aware approach to economic regeneration and place\-making to benefit the capacity of the community and economy in the lower Swansea Valley. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the REF2014 Copperopolis case study was all about establishing the global significance of Swansea as a centre for copper smelting. Since then, Swansea historians have uncovered much more detail about the products made from Swansea copper and the markets supplied by them worldwide. This is part of a new ‘turn’ in writing about the history of Welsh industry which goes beyond understanding places and processes of production, to examining the supply of goods and the demands of customers buying Welsh products \(R1\). By using a range of business and commercial records, Miskell and Bowen have discovered more about the importance of copper in the production of key goods used in textile manufacture, maritime, transport and food and drink industries, and about product diversification over time. This new innovative research has moved the narrative away from conventional themes of mineral supply, processing and investment, towards global markets and patterns of consumption. In doing so, it has established the centrality of Swansea copper to global processes of industrialisation and modernisation. In particular, the research has shown that: 

 In the early eighteenth century, the success of Swansea firms in establishing themselves at the centre of the new British copper industry, was their ability to meet East India Company orders to supply Asian markets with a range of products for domestic and decorative use. \(R3\) 

 The production of small, portable barter items like manillas and guinea rods for West African slave traders via Bristol merchants was also part of the output of the early Swansea firms, but occupied a smaller and diminishing part of their product base. \(R4\) 

 By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the willingness of Swansea firms like Vivian & Sons to invest in new rolling mills and steam engine technology meant that they could respond to growing demand for copper sheathing for naval and merchant sailing vessels, supplying shipbuilders and repairers with customized sheathing of different sizes and weights. \(R2\) 

 By the 1820s Swansea copper was also embedded in the growth of the mechanised textile trade with the firm of Williams & Grenfell dominating the supply of copper cylinders for printing on fabric, to Lancashire cotton manufacturers. \(R.2\) 

 The supply of copper vessels including boiling pans, stills and brewing vats to the food and drink industries provided another important source of demand for copper and saw Swansea firms supplying customers as diverse as London copper smiths who made boiling pans destined for the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, to Irish brewers and whisky distillers. \(R2\) 

 By the early twentieth century, a loss of competitiveness as a location for copper smelting saw the surviving Swansea firms focus more on manufacturing, particularly of copper components for locomotives destined for domestic and overseas railway customers. \(R2\) 

 Throughout their history, Swansea copper firms were well\-informed of — and responsive to — the fluctuating demands of global markets and tailored their products accordingly in order to retain their overseas customers and remain competitive. 

 These key research insights have helped the story of Swansea copper to reach a new range of audiences in the public, private and third sector and have provided a stimulus to the next phase of grant capture and development planning for the Hafod Morfa Copperworks site. This is one of the last remaining built heritage legacies of the copper industry in the lower Swansea Valley, an area once popularly known as Copperopolis.  Bowen and Langlands have worked to preserve the site in conjunction with Swansea Council.  Since 2014 their grant capture has sought to focus on continued site restoration as well as initiating the regeneration potential of this built heritage to the redevelopment of the lower Swansea Valley. \(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The uncovering of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s industrial copperworking heritage continues to inform publicly funded programmes resulting in a profound change in attitude across public, private and third sector institutions. Not only has the research been matched to community and enterprise need in the drawing down of over GBP3,600,000 of grant funding **\[G1 – G5\]**, it has impacted upon planning and regeneration policies **\[C1\]**, attracted SME investment **\[C7\]**, and enriched the cultural life **\[C4, 5, 6, 8, 9\]** of wards in the lowest two quintiles of the Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation. 

 <ins> **Influence on public planning and regeneration policy**</ins> 

 The period between 2008 and 2020, has witnessed a sea change in the approach to economic regeneration in the city **\[C1\]**. In the **Swansea Bay City Region Economic Strategy 2013\-2030 \(2013\)**, not a single reference to heritage nor the historic environment was made. The City and Council of Swansea’s own **Unitary Development Plan \(2008\)** made only a passing reference to the role industrial heritage can play in the tourist economy. Even in the **Swansea Local Development Plan Topic Paper: Culture and Heritage \(2013\)**, ‘heritage\-led’ regeneration consisted of limited opportunities within the tourism and built heritage construction sectors. However, the statutory heritage body of Welsh Government, Cadw, sought the help of the university to provide the underpinning historical research for its 2016 Urban Characterisation report on the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C3\]**. This study identified and set out the significance, distinctiveness and unique historic character of the local region. Concurrently, research undertaken by Swansea University historians heavily influenced the production of the ‘master plan’ produced by heritage consultants Purcell for a ‘copperworks’ enterprise and mixed\-use park **\[C1\]**. 

 The City and Council of Swansea’s **Local Development Plan 2010\-2025 \(Deposit Plan, July 2016\)** drew directly on both of these documents in setting out its ambitions for the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks site and its links to the ‘River Tawe Corridor’, listing a ‘heritage\-led project’ to include ‘restoration of historic buildings’ and a ‘heritage visitor centre’ **\[C1\]**. The renewed historic significance of the surviving monuments created the case for World Heritage Site status, and this impacted greatly on policy and decision makers in the region **\[C1\]**. Listed buildings that had been subjected to neglect for decades, despite many attempts to rescue them, now ‘represent a significant regeneration opportunity’ with proposals for the heritage led regeneration of the site being driven by ‘The Hafod/Morfa Copperworks Project’, a partnership project between the Council and Swansea University **\[C2, C10\]**. This regeneration is now being realised publicly by the **Targeted Regeneration Investment Programme \(TRIP\) 2018**, through which the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks is set to receive over GBP2,000,000 of investment from a total of GBP27,000,000 for the south\-west region **\[C1\]**. Head of Economic Development and External Funding at Swansea Council says: ‘ *This is a major turnaround from 10 years ago when the site was covered in vegetation, forgotten and decaying. It can now look forward to a bright, collaborative future, part of a regional investment campaign, understood by key national and regional investment partners, and a place to live, work and play, celebrating the extensive heritage both of the works itself, and the wider legacy in the Lower Swansea Valley*’ **\[C2\]**. From 2015 through to the present day, Swansea University research staff have sat on the project boards for regeneration projects in the area and attended key decision\-making meetings on a range of issues relevant to redevelopment, restoration and public engagement in the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C10\]**. This has served as a key corollary through which the historic significance and heritage potential of the surviving assets has been communicated, in turn supporting the case for TRIP funding. These funds, traditionally reserved for investment in commercial and economic zones \(such as town centres/high streets\), have been targeted at ‘shell and core’ restorations of the physical heritage assets, in a plan to attract high\-end commercial ‘anchor tenants’ to further stimulate economic growth in the region. 

 In a climate where even in Cadw’s own report on **Valuing the Welsh Historic Environment \(2010\)**, primacy was given to the direct ‘economic value’ of the historic environment, the Lower Swansea Valley is experiencing a shift in approach to one that identifies the route to true sustainable economic growth lying first and foremost in the recognition of the historic significance and sense of place. The significance of Miskell and Bowen’s research has been identified by Cadw and the National Lottery Heritage Fund **\[C3\]**. The historical research that has established the importance to Britain of Swansea’s copperworking industries underpins place\-making policies now being advocated at regional and national governmental levels **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins> **The Cultural Impacts of Historic Significance**</ins> 

 Swansea historians led a sustained collaborative engagement campaign ranging from national events with 6,000 visitors \(The Man Engine Cymru, April 2018\), to National Lottery Heritage Fund\-supported renovation work. This has resulted in far greater public appreciation of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s copperworking industries **\[C4, C9\]**. Not only have these enriched the social and cultural life of a deprived area, but they have served to sharpen a sense of distinctive identity shaped by copper heritage, which has drawn the attention of a number of national broadcasters **\[C5\].** This is also evident from the large number of volunteers and visitors to the site over the past 5 years **\[C4\]**, which includes a group of committed people who have formed the Friends of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks group who take care of the site and offer guided tours **\[C9\]**. One of the group’s founders and current Chair, engineer Tom Henderson outlines the long\-term value of Swansea University’s instigation of the regeneration process: ‘ *the awareness of Swansea's past industrial process that Huw Bowen helped kickstart, \[…\] the archaeology, \[…\] archives searches and the oral histories \[…\] that the friends group have carried out have all helped clear the path to tangible progress in regenerating the former copperworks sites in the lower Swansea valley*’ **\[C4\]**. The success of this research\-informed University and volunteer partnership is set out by the Economic Development Officer, Swansea Council stating: ‘ *The collaboration between the council, university, friends and volunteers has shown that the model works well and can achieve excellent results and prove good value for money. We believe that this model can be used in the future for further phases of restoration*’ **\[C2\]**. 

 Research into the investment of Swansea copper firms in the latest plant and machinery has given impetus to the Musgrave Engine restoration project **\[G3\]**. The Musgrave Engine – the last surviving remnant of the advanced steam\-powered rolling technology in use on the Hafod Morfa site – is now being refurbished and rehoused as a visitor attraction. Involving primary school children in this process has done much to enrich local awareness of this vital cultural asset. As one teacher from Hafod primary says, **‘** *We have also learned a lot from our involvement in the Musgrave restoration project. Outreach workshops, creative sessions and trips are very beneficial to us in our learning*.’ **\[C8\]** 

 <ins> **An Attraction for Regional and SME Investment**</ins> 

 Swansea University’s research on the historical significance of the copper working industries to the Lower Swansea Valley has led ultimately to the iconic metal itself playing a major role in the construction, branding and public communication of a GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package for a new district in Swansea: **Copr Bay.** The landmark construction of the new district will be a copper bridge, and artist and designer Marc Rees notes that it, *‘represents the transition from the past to the future. It symbolizes Swansea’s aspiration to evolve, grow, flourish and become even more exciting but still very much rooted in a sense of place’* **\[C7\]**. The process of public consultation for this project is set to be informed by technologies developed through EPSRC funds allocated by CherishDE to the Hafod Morfa Copperworks as a ‘Resource Constrained Community’ **\[G2\] \[C7\].** 

 The historic significance of the copperworks, and the role the metal played in the emergence of a global distilling industry **\[R2\]**, is a key attraction for **Penderyn**’s desire to build a new distillery and visitor centre on the site **\[C7\]**. Research carried out at Swansea University has established the historic importance of whisky distilling firms as customers of Swansea copper firms, and is set to inform the content, interpretation and display within that visitor centre, creating a new narrative around how the copper goods produced in Swansea went on to have a global impact **\[R2\]**. Drawing on GBP3,500,000 of NLHF investment and an additional GBP4,000,000 of private sector investment, the future of the Power House, one of the site’s most important heritage assets, has been secured for at least another 100 years **\[C6\].** Within, copper equipment and technology will be utilized as part of an industrial process, 15 FTE jobs will be created and a 50,000 visitors will be attracted per annum. 

 An increased affinity for the copper ‘brand’ was exemplified by Swansea City FC’s adoption a copper heritage theme \(2015\) within the hospitality part of their Liberty Stadium \(located on part of the Hafod\-Morfa site\), a process informed by our researchers. A new white and copper playing kit for season 2015\-16 was also launched accompanied by a promotional video drawing directly on research by Swansea historians. Indeed the region is now furnished with a range of SMEs trading on the copper brand, including Copper Bar, Copperfish, Copper Bay Digital, Coppergate and the Copper Jack \- an illustration of how the historic and global significance of copper to the region, a narrative largely promoted by research at Swansea University, has created a brand identity that local businesses take pride in trading on **\[C7\].**

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Purkis’s research has made a significant contribution to reconceptualising understandings of the medieval crusading movement. Most broadly, he has demonstrated **the importance of moving away from study of “The Crusades” as a sequence of discrete military expeditions and towards examination of “crusading” as a normative devotional practice** that was closely related to Latin Christian traditions of pilgrimage and monasticism, and inspired by ideals of Christo\-mimesis \[RO1, RO2, RO5\]. In his most recent work, Purkis has stressed the particular importance of situating crusading as a dramatic expression of Latin Christendom’s pronounced enthusiasm for the veneration of sacred matter — and, correspondingly, its profound anxieties about sacred material loss \[RO3, RO4, RO6\]. 

 Purkis argues that as a religious cultural system that prioritised the accumulation of relics and other forms of holy matter, medieval Latin Christianity was shaped by a central tension: the corporeal absence of Christ himself. To gain some measure of sensory engagement with their god\-man, medieval devotees were therefore forced to rely on interactions with a variety of objects and places with which he was believed to have had direct contact, such as the instruments of his torture and suffering \(e.g. the True Cross\), and the sites of his birth, life and death \(e.g. the church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem\), all of which were believed to retain potent traces of his sacred presence \[RO1, RO4, RO6\]. During the eleventh century, however, as a result of the conquests of the Seljuk Turks, and the collapse of Byzantium’s eastern frontier, it is evident that Latins in the West became increasingly paranoid about the prospect of the irreversible loss and destruction of this sacred material culture in the East. 

 Purkis’s latest research has thus demonstrated that **Latin concerns for the preservation of their devotional objects and spaces was of central importance for triggering crusade enthusiasm**, as was manifest in \(i\) sustained recruitment from 1095 onwards to military campaigns to the eastern Mediterranean; \(ii\) the subsequent establishment and maintenance of custodial colonial lordships in the Holy Land; \(iii\) the extraction and displacement to the West of substantial quantities of holy matter and \(iv\) wider patterns of financial and liturgical support for the crusading movement across Latin Christendom during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries \[RO2, RO3, RO4, RO6\]. Most importantly, Purkis’s recent attention to the materiality of crusader devotion has led him to challenge the longstanding historiographical trope that crusading was *either* stimulated primarily by worldly “material gain” *or* by idealistic “knightly piety”. By way of contrast with both these approaches, Purkis’s key research findings \[KF\] have shown that: 

-  **KF1**: Sacred material gain was fundamental to crusaders and their contemporaries; and 

-  **KF2**: The acquisition and possession of holy objects, such as relics, held significance not only for devotional reasons but also for social, political and economic ones too. 

 In this analytical framework, the interdisciplinary study of crusader material culture \(especially objects that depict or were designed to contain sacred matter\) takes on a renewed significance — and this was the principal research objective of Purkis’s AHRC\-funded *Bearers of the Cross* project \( *BotC*\) and the collaboration with MOSJ. Working collaboratively with MOSJ’s curator and a group of museum volunteers from 2015–2016, the *BotC* project team identified, measured and photographed *c*.1500 objects in MOSJ’s medieval collection. They then updated and improved records within MOSJ’s internal collections management system and published an  [open access database](https://www.bearersofthecross.org.uk/collections/) of these fully revised and illustrated object records via the *BotC* website, accompanied by a series of  [interpretive essays](https://www.bearersofthecross.org.uk/interpreting-the-collections/), videos of the project’s public engagement activities and an online version of the project’s 2017 exhibition \[RO3, RO4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Collections knowledge and accessibility, professional practice, heritage preservation and interpretation at MOSJ** have been enhanced as a result of a sustained collaborative relationship that originated with the *BotC* project. These impacts have transformed how the museum — which is the public\-facing hub for the history and heritage of the global humanitarian charity St John International — **understands, interprets and values its medieval objects and spaces**, which amount to one of the most substantial collections of crusader material culture in the world. 

 **1. <ins>Greater</ins> <ins>knowledge</ins> <ins>and accessibility of</ins> <ins>MOSJ collections**</ins> 

1.  For the first time since the 1950s, MOSJ fully and accurately understands what it holds in its medieval collections. **Greater knowledge of the precise nature of the museum’s medieval collections has been enabled** through the co\-production of a new collections database \[RO3\]. This **knowledge enhancement** **has** **fundamentally changed how MOSJ’s staff and volunteers understand, value and engage with the museum’s objects and spaces** associated with the medieval crusading movement \[S1, S2, S3\]. MOSJ staff had previously relied on incomplete \(and sometimes inaccurate\) records within the museum’s internal collections management system, but since its publication in 2016, the *BotC* collections database has effectively superseded the internal system and become a key tool for the day\-to\-day working of MOSJ’s staff. MOSJ’s curator has said that since its completion ‘the \[ *BotC*\] website — including the open access database, but also interpretative essays, recordings of talks, and blogs — is used daily in my work’ \[S2\]. Recognition of the opportunities that the project’s activities presented for MOSJ’s volunteers to gain greater knowledge and understanding of the contents of the museum’s medieval collections was also shown in 2016, when those who had worked on *BotC* were runners\-up in the ‘Going the Extra Mile’ category at the London Museums Volunteer Awards for their contribution to the production of the *BotC* website and database \[S2\]. 

1.  **Heritage professionals, teachers, students and researchers around the world have gained greater physical and digital access** to MOSJ’s internationally significant collections as a result of the *BotC* website and database \[RO3\]. This widened access has **increased the visibility of MOSJ’s medieval collections** among a range of new audiences, **led to an unprecedented level of national and international engagement** with MOSJ’s collections and forged new working relationships for the museum. Previously, those who wished to explore MOSJ’s medieval collections could only do so by visiting the museum in person; now, high\-resolution images and detailed records of **hundreds of objects are freely available online**. One researcher in the Archaeological Research Department of the Israel Antiquities Authority \(IAA\) has noted that, before *BotC*, ‘The hidden treasures of the Museum of the Order of St John, London were almost a secret’ \[S6\]. By the end of December 2020, however, the *BotC* website had had more than 15,000 users from more than 130 different countries \[S4\], and images of objects reproduced from the collections database have been used in a diverse range of books, journal articles, and undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations \[S2\]. As MOSJ’s director puts it, ‘The higher level of awareness of the collections resulting from the project is \[…\] enabling the Museum to forge new relationships that are facilitating further research’ \[S1\]. The Assistant Keeper of Medieval and Modern Coins at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, has attested to the particular importance of the *BotC* website for heritage professionals: ‘Being able to access hi\-res images and full descriptions of each piece is not only **vital for people working on crusader period numismatics in the UK, but more importantly the collection is now available digitally to the rest of the world**. This is particularly significant for my colleagues working on the Latin East volume of *Medieval European Coinage* who are based in Paris and Jerusalem. If only all crusader collections were so readily accessible’ \[S5\]. On this point, the IAA researcher quoted above has noted that even the IAA does not yet have a comparable resource, and that ‘The *BotC* online database, as a resource available to the general public, has set a desired standard for colleagues in the \[IAA’s\] Coin Department’ \[S6\]. The fact that the *BotC* website ‘democratises \[…\] the Museum’s medieval collections \[…\] allowing free access to all teachers and pupils with an internet connection’ has also been highlighted by one UK schoolteacher, whose pedagogical practices have been enhanced as a result of the *BotC* project’s work: ‘Having now discovered the collections, I will plan further lessons around the objects and I am sure my pupils will enjoy the variety of lessons interspersed with the objects and undertaking image analysis’ \[S7\]. 

 **2. <ins>Change to curatorial practice**</ins> 

 **Fundamental change in how MOSJ’s curatorial staff interpret and display the museum’s collections has resulted from the co\-production of a new collections database** and close engagement with the *BotC* project and Purkis’s research \[KF1, KF2; RO1, RO3–RO6\]. New interpretation and display strategies have become an embedded feature of the Museum’s curatorial practice as a consequence of the deeper understanding of the cultural milieux in which so many of MOSJ’s medieval objects were produced. As MOSJ’s curator puts it, the museum’s generalist staff and volunteers now have ‘\[an\] increased confidence with the historic context of these collections’ \[S2\]. Whereas previously MOSJ’s medieval gallery displays were static, with the objects exhibited being only of tangential relevance to their associated interpretive text, the medieval displays are now changed on a regular basis to reflect invigorated engagement with and understanding of the collection. In the curator’s words, ‘Following the success of the 2017 exhibition *Holy City, Holy War* \[…\] we have been able to move away from interpretation with incidental inclusion of coins, to interpretation that fully engages the visitor with the object’ \[S2\]. Similarly, MOSJ’s director has recently published a book entitled *Treasures: Highlights from the Collection of the Museum of the Order of St John* \(London, 2019\), a new cultural artefact \(to which Purkis contributed\) that includes discussion of the museum’s medieval objects and draws substantially on knowledge MOSJ staff acquired through the *BotC* project \[RO3\]. MOSJ’s director has stated that ‘to be able to unlock the stories behind these objects is incredibly important’ and that *BotC* has ‘improved the way we can interpret our collections for both a physical and virtual audience’ \[S4\]. 

 **3. <ins>Improved</ins> <ins>educational engagement</ins> <ins></ins><ins>resulting from</ins> <ins>improved understanding of</ins> <ins>MOSJ’s</ins> <ins></ins><ins>medieval</ins> <ins>collections and their</ins> <ins>historical</ins> <ins>context**</ins> 

1.  **New and enhanced resources for schools and university groups that bring added value to those studying the history of crusading** have been created. MOSJ Learning & Access staff now have sufficient knowledge about both the specifics of the museum’s collections and the underlying aims and impetus for the crusading movement \[RO1, RO2–4, RO6\] to enable them to develop new resources that speak to the needs of education curricula \[S3\]. This has generated greater and more productive engagements with visiting families, schools and university groups. According to MOSJ’s L&A officer, ‘As a direct result of the \[ *BotC*\] project, objects from this period now feature throughout our formal and informal learning programmes’ \[S3\]. More specifically, and with reference to the particular importance to crusaders of sacred spaces and things \[KF1, KF2\], ‘the wider Museum team now has the resources, and the confidence, to put objects such as crusader coins, stone fragments and a model of the Holy Sepulchre centre stage, with students from Key Stage 3 all the way up to undergraduates’ \[S4\]. This is a significant and important change for MOSJ’s L&A activities given that ‘Christendom, the importance of religion and the Crusades’ has been a suggested focus at Key Stage 3 in the UK’s History curriculum since 2014, and that there is an evident demand for museum\-based and object\-focused learning enrichment opportunities from both schools and universities. Having only engaged with a total of 276 students \(from 13 separate school and university groups\) during the three\-year period 2014–16, as a result of the project’s resource and knowledge enhancements the numbers have increased by nearly 350%: across the three\-year period 2017–19, MOSJ staff engaged with a total of 1,213 students \(from 46 separate school and university groups\) \[S2\]. These engagements have in turn **changed the educational and pedagogical practices of lecturers working at various HEIs around the country**, including London, Reading and Manchester. For example, one professor of medieval archaeology at the University of Reading has attested that as a result of the *BotC* project his students are now ‘able to see and engage with portable material culture in the Museum collection \[…\] \[which has\] significantly improved the experience of the visit’ \[S8\]. 

1.  **Active engagement with schools across the UK during the substantial and continued educational disruption caused by COVID\-19** has been maintained through a set of new online resources co\-produced in autumn 2020 by Purkis and the Museum’s L&A team. These digital resources have **enabled schools prevented from visiting in person to continue to experience MOSJ’s medieval collections**. The *To Jerusalem and Back Again: Objects of the Crusades* resource pack — which includes a 26\-slide PowerPoint slideshow, 21 pages of teaching notes and five interactive worksheets, and focuses on the centrality of sacred material culture within the history of crusading \[KF1, KF2; RO3, RO4, RO6\] — provides History teachers with **new, object\-focused ways to teach the Key Stage 3** topic ‘Christendom, the importance of religion and the Crusades’. One teacher has commented that the resources have ‘very high production values, they contain interesting objects which naturally spark the curiosity of pupils, and they are completely planned and self\-contained so that teachers can simply deploy them without the need for additional preparation’ \[S7\]. Showcasing objects from MOSJ’s medieval collections, the same teacher notes that the *To Jerusalem and Back Again* resource pack ‘points to new ways in teaching the topic’ and enables students ‘not only to link the medieval crusades to debates in modern history about colonialism by exploring questions of sacred material loss and gain, but also \[…\] to understand and access the “medieval mindset”’ \[S7\]. Although produced within the context of, and in response to, the pandemic, MOSJ’s curator has commented that ‘it is a valuable and versatile resource in current times, but also relevant to post\-Covid education \[…\] \[and\] to rebuilding the Museum’s offer and audiences upon resumption of business as usual’ \[S2\]. 

 **4. <ins>Augmented visitor experience**</ins> 

 **The broader MOSJ visitor experience has benefited from improved collections accessibility, changed curatorial practice and improved educational engagement**, with MOSJ’s visitors noting increased interest in, and curiosity about, the medieval past. In questionnaires distributed after the *BotC* lectures in 2016–17, for example, 93% of respondents \(123 out of 132\) said that Purkis’s talks had ‘enhanced their knowledge and understanding of medieval religion’ \[S9\], while one attendee commented that they had heard ‘An excellent, informative, detailed and interesting lecture \[…\] stimulating a drive to investigate the topic further’ \[S9\]. The particular significance of sacred objects and spaces resonated with many of the 8,612 visitors to the 2017 *Holy City, Holy War* exhibition, one of whom wrote that they were ‘really intrigued by the tangible examples of what the Holy Sepulchre meant to crusaders and pilgrims — very powerful’ \[KF1; S9\]. More recently, in September 2019, one TripAdvisor reviewer described how much they had enjoyed visiting a ‘smartly curated museum’ and a ‘treasure trove of history’, noting that ‘The narrative and exhibits are clear, taking visitors through the history of the Order of St John from the crusades, through history to the modern ambulance service’ \[S4\]. Similarly, in November 2019, a visitor from Australia attested to having seen ‘Interesting artefacts but the real treasure for me was the well presented stories — absolutely enthralling’ \[S4\]. 

 **5. <ins>International exchange of knowledge, best practice and interpretation of crusad</ins><ins>er</ins> <ins>material</ins> <ins>culture</ins> <ins>has been stimulated**</ins> 

 **Enhancements to collections knowledge and accessibility, professional practice, heritage preservation and interpretation are being shared internationally** and have been catalysed within the Israel Antiquities Authority \(IAA\) as a direct result of Purkis’s sustained collaboration with MOSJ and the *BotC* project. The instigation of *Francitecture* — a project that will result in an online database of architectural elements from the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem that are now held in IAA storage facilities — was immediately inspired by the production of the *BotC* website and collections database, as the project’s lead researcher explains: ‘ *BotC* \[…\] directly impacted upon the initiation of *Francitecture* \[…\] the improved accessibility to the museum in London is a guiding torch when it comes to enhancing the status of the IAA storage facilities as a primary hub for researchers, scholars and the general public.’ The same researcher adds that increasing awareness of the IAA’s collections among wider audiences \(including heritage professionals, teachers, students and researchers around the world\) ‘now stands as a primary goal for transforming the status of IAA medieval collections \[…\] The example set by *BotC* illustrates how building an effective public outreach component of a research project can result in this transformation’ \[S6\]. Over the next decade, *Francitecture* project staff will work in consultation with Purkis to draw upon the expertise he gained through working with MOSJ to enhance wider knowledge and understanding of its medieval collections. ‘In the current climate of enabling public access to national treasures’, the project’s lead researcher writes, ‘it is our hope that Dr Purkis will be able to contribute his experience to other professionals in the IAA and assist in producing the framework for an equivalent outreach project here’ \[S6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lightweight composite materials have excellent mechanical properties and their use in industrial sectors contributes to zero\-carbon emission targets. In our work, smart composites have been developed where energy harvesting and sensors are directly integrated onto the composite substrate using printing techniques. This avoids the use of external sensing devices such as printed circuit boards or batteries, which may be difficult or impossible to apply in harsh environments. They are particularly advantageous wherever sensing or monitoring is necessary in difficult environments where conventional approaches cannot be used. Impact on wind turbine blade structural health monitoring has been demonstrated through field work with the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult   Economic benefits in this application are estimated at £340\-£500/kW installed capital cost.  Further innovations have been made on the next generation of thermoplastic composites with highly efficient welding, repair, reuse, and recycling developed for extended life cycles.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Multifunctional composites have been developed with novel sensing and energy harvesting capabilities from vibration or solar energies that enable the composite itself to be self\-powering. Building our work on failure mechanisms in composites \(Yu et al 2014, Yu & Soutis 2015, Liu et al 2017\) and energy harvesting \(Jia et al 2019, Shi et al 2017\), methods have been researched that will benefit a wide application of industries, for example in aircraft wings and offshore wind turbine blades that require structural health monitoring and de\-icing *in\-situ*. This aspect of the research has been successfully funded by Innovate UK for the “Smart self\-sensing wind turbine composite blades for structural health monitoring \(SmartBlade\)” project with a total budget of £500k. It will reduce maintenance costs and accelerate the application of offshore wind energy. The project consortium is led by Ilika Ltd, with Professor Yu Shi and his Chester Smart Composite Group \(CSCG\) contributing the design and fabrication of the required smart composites. Field testing was carried out in the Offshore Renewable Energy \(ORE\) Catapult with input data measured by project partner Titan Wind in China. Titan Wind is the Original Equipment Manufacturer \(OEM\) of the wind turbine blade with strong interest to exploit this technology. The University of Chester and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics \(NUAA\) have set up a joint research laboratory initiated from this project, and academic outcomes have been published in peer\-reviewed Journals \(Composite Part B, and Composite Science and Technology\) as well as in leading international conferences. Based on the successful dissemination of this research, the CSCG has set up two further international joint laboratories with Xi’dian University and Xi’an Jiaotong University in China. 

 This project, and subsequent collaborations, has given us the opportunity to undertake further development of our smart composites and its technology, getting us closer to the high technology readiness level \(TRL\) required to meet industrial challenges in collaboration with local large OEMs including Airbus, Toyota, Rolls\-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar\-LandRover. We take the main research responsibility to develop multifunctional composite structures using Chester facilities \(including the smart composite lab, the laser lab, the design suite, the micro\-analysis lab, vibration dynamic lab, and the engineering software for modelling and finite element analysis, etc.\). 

 In related work, the CSCG has been funded through Innovate UK to develop an accurate and lightweight sensing system within wheel kits to *in\-situ* monitor the wheel alignment for zero carbon emission for road vehicles, again making use of energy harvesting and vibration analysis expertise \(project AutoAlign\). The project is led by RL Automotive, with industrial partners Dynamon Ltd and OEM McLaren with Aston University as a further academic partner. We have successfully completed a feasibility study and have subsequently been awarded by £1.5 million for phase 2. Numerical predictions using computational modelling of wheel misalignment effects have been carried out by CSCG, and data and design parameters suggested for hardware selection and integration for experimental monitoring. 

 The team has also worked on coded materials for windfarm safety, as a subcontracted part of a project led by QinetiQ. The key role of the University of Chester in the project is in developing smart composites by printing functional nanomaterials for wind farm security. 

 The CSCG is part of a Horizon 2020 project – INTAKE H2020 RISE – a collaborative project with universities from the UK, Poland, Hungary, Japan and China for the development of multifunctional nanocomposites harvesting different types of energies for applications in space, aerospace, automotive, renewable energy and healthcare. The group’s involvement is in fundamental aspects of the research where Professor Yu Shi will work on the core technology by designing and printing nanocomposites for energy harvesting purposes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The successful outcomes of “SmartBlade” have demonstrated a new generation of integrated smart composites. The smart composite is able to perform self\-structural health monitoring through vibration spectrum analysis, and anti\- and de\-icing, self\-powered by harvesting offshore environmental vibration energy. Key elements of innovation include flexibility in solid state battery and electronics design; development of a composite piezoelectric transducer for sensing, actuation and generation; as well as advanced manufacturing and integration of the functional layers onto the curved composite stack. 

 A case study demonstration has been performed in ORE Catapult in Blyth for field testing of conditional monitoring of wind turbine blades by project lead Ilika. Real wind farm data has been measured at the wind farm of project partner, Titan Wind. The measured vibration data embedded into the wind turbine blade during service was used for testing the energy harvesting for structural health monitoring. The field testing has demonstrated the developed energy harvesting from offshore environmental vibration could keep charging the micro\-battery developed by Ilika and so in turn power monitoring sensors and wireless communication \( [https://www.ilika.com/latest\-news/successful\-stereax\-field\-trial](https://www.ilika.com/latest-news/successful-stereax-field-trial)\). 

 The collaboration of SmartBlade, helped project lead Ilika for the first time to explore the application of their solid\-state batteries to offshore renewable energy. The project has successfully helped them to set up the partnership with Chinese industries Titan Wind and Envision, who have been OEMs with global reputations in renewable energy \( [https://www.ilika.com/latest\-news/new\-partnership\-with\-wind\-turbine\-manufacturer\-in\-china](https://www.ilika.com/latest-news/new-partnership-with-wind-turbine-manufacturer-in-china)\). It also offers a step\-change reduction in the operating costs of wind turbines, with IoT \(Internet of Things\) solutions for the reduction of high maintenance costs and other difficulties in offshore wind turbines. 

 It has been estimated to reduce the operation and maintenance \(O&M\) costs with circa 10% off and increased safety of operation of offshore wind energy, the research contributes towards the continued economic expansion of the primary application sectors. Furthermore, there is a significant contribution towards reduction of pollution and carbon emissions \(20% decrease in 2017, and expected 24% reduction by 2030 and 80% by 2050\), because the smart composite would expand the use of renewable energy by citizens in both the UK and China due to the reduced O&M costs. Overall, in addition to the economic benefits \(estimated reduction of £340\-500/kW of capital costs\), the research has impact on conservation of the environment, improvement in public health, and reduction of pollution and carbon emissions, thereby helping slow the effects of climate change. 

 The first stage of “AutoAlign” has been funded by Innovate UK with automotive SME lead, RL Automotive with UoC where the prototype of concept has been proved to develop a built\-in electronics system to monitor the wheel conditions for reduction of carbon emissions from tyres *in\-situ*. Due to the first stage’s success, the Innovate UK has funded £1.5 million to the consortium to develop this technology towards commercialisation. The success of the first stage attracted OEMs and end users McLaren, Scania, and Tesco to join the consortium, who expected to improve fuel efficiency, extend wheel/tyre life, and reduce carbon emissions by the efficient wheel monitoring of their road vehicles, especially for heavy vehicles such as trucks. The project is estimated to contribute extension of tyre life \(one degree’s wheel misalignment reduces 7% of tyre life\) in truck wheels, saving 30% of vehicles those might suffer from misalignment of wheels. The eventual goal is to reduce the 4\-13% of all PM 2.5 emissions from tyre and road surface wear \(see statement from RL Automotive\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Second World War \(WWII\) stands on the cusp of human memory. As those who had direct experience of it pass away, new challenges arise in the appreciation of the relevance or significance of WWII’s history and archaeology.  Historians at UEA responded to this dilemma with an educational and cultural programme intended to promote the East of England’s WWII social and military heritage. What might have been an exercise in nostalgia rapidly developed into a venture in social history, with diverse and far\-reaching benefits.  Supporting the education of adults and school children, stimulating local businesses, generating economic growth through the visitor economy, promoting wellbeing through occupational therapy, and improving museum resources not least through online media and its involvement in the development of a Tom Hanks mini\-series, our project has not only enhanced cultural heritage but permanently altered attitudes to the region’s past. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Liddiard is an internationally respected figure in the study of military landscapes and an acknowledged pioneer in the archaeology of twentieth\-century conflict zones.  Already renowned for his research on medieval castles and realising that more recent wars had bequeathed a built heritage just as significant but rather less well protected, he has increasingly turned his attention to the archaeology of WWII.  Working from within UEA’s Landscape Group, one of the leading research clusters on designed and built landscapes anywhere in the world, as Co\-Investigator in a  European Union InterReg IV venture on WWII Heritage \(2010−14, total value EUR4,216,110\) Liddiard collaborated with partners in the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, and France, investigating and making more publicly accessible aspects of East Anglia’s WWII heritage.  From this sprang four guidebooks \(20,000 copies distributed to public and heritage outlets\), an award\-winning ‘Walberswick’ Project’ on the East coast anti\-invasion defences of WWII \(an REF2014 Impact Case Study\), two ground\-breaking articles published in 2012 \( **3.1**, **3.2**\), and a monograph by Liddiard and David Sims, *A Very Dangerous Locality: the Landscape of the Suffolk Sandlings in the Second World War* \( **3.3**\). This book was winner of the History section of the 2019 East Anglian Book Awards and described in *Rural History* \(2019\) as *‘a wonderful book … brilliantly combining archival research with field survey’*. 

 East Anglia has particular significance in WWII heritage owing to the presence in the region from 1941−45 of the United States Eighth Air Force: one of the largest such formations ever assembled. While the history of this so\-called ‘Mighty Eighth’ and its contribution to the Allied Strategic Bomber Offensive is well known \(and widely celebrated in the USA, with its own museum in Savannah Georgia\), in eastern England it has left a substantial legacy, in local memory \(now rapidly fading\), in material and archaeological remains \(still too often neglected\), and culturally in a network of volunteer\-run museums. These museums have endeavoured to preserve what can be rescued.  However, they are generally dependent upon amateur enthusiasm, with the need for generational renewal of increasingly pressing concern. 

 In order to meet this challenge, Liddiard served as founding member of a project board and subsequently as academic lead to a Heritage Lottery funded community interest project: *The Eighth in the East*, 2013\-16, which received a grant of GBP575,000, of which GBP74,874 \( **3.6**\) was channelled through UEA, with Rowena Burgess, a social historian also from the Landscape Group, as fellow member of the project board. Centred on the American ‘friendly invasion’, the project’s aims were to promote education, to undertake a programme of archaeological survey and cataloguing, and to support the network of airfield site museums. *Eighth in the East* funded a 3\-year post for a Learning Officer \(Annie Sommazzi, and subsequently Andrew Farrell, both contracted via UEA, both now in permanent employment\) to develop and deliver schools programmes. Liddiard provided academic expertise on archival material, oral history, and archaeological remains.  Nine internships were funded \(again administered through UEA\), with recipients placed chiefly at airfield museums, tasked with cataloguing primary source materials, collecting and stewarding oral historical records, and with supporting community archaeology. Liddiard undertook training of volunteers and on\-site recording. The archival and material remains thus gathered were widely publicized through a variety of media, including academic publications by Derwin Gregory \(Liddiard’s PhD student 2011−15, thereafter temporary Lecturer at UEA, now permanent Lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste University\) \( **3.4**\), and a highly\-regarded project website  [8theast.org/](https://www.8theast.org/), providing guidance to local heritage, an online legacy exhibition of photographs, story boards, podcasts, and blogs. 

 All of this work was undertaken and recorded at a time crucial to the oral history of WWII, before memories of the American presence in 1940s East Anglia entirely fade away.  While the experiences of the American aircrew who flew from the region’s airfields are well\-documented and tend to frame our view of events, *Eighth in the East* chose instead to focus on the ‘hidden histories’ of the otherwise marginalised ground personnel, including African\-American servicemen, and the many East Anglian men and women with whom they interacted.  A region regarded before 1940 as relatively isolated, between 1941 and 1945 became home to many thousands of American servicemen and women, of diverse backgrounds.  The effect here was to generate romance, tragedy, and tension in more or less equal measure.  Of this the only remains still standing are those of airfields and civic/military defence systems.  This evidence can be combined with the oral or written reports of those who were there, many of these reports now most easily accessed through the East Anglian Film Archive, stored in the Norfolk Record Office under joint UEA/Record Office management: an essential partner in the project’s work.  So successful did *Eighth in the East* prove in uncovering neglected aspects of the region’s social and military heritage that it gave rise to a legacy project, headed by Gregory, loosely grouped under the title ‘HQ\-East’, with its own social media outlets and programme of archaeological excavation, tasked in 2017−18 to investigate ‘What the American’s Left Behind in East Anglia’ \(supported by grants totalling GBP34,000, equally split between the UEA ESRC Impact Accelerator Account and the UEA Higher Education Innovation Fund allocation\). Acknowledging the potential benefits of archaeology as occupational therapy, two excavations were conducted on the site of the former airfield at Thorpe Abbotts.  Previously unknown WWII archaeological remains were discovered, written up, and published by Gregory \( **3.5**\).

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

 Through a variety of projects and subsequent spin\-offs, we have sought to contextualize and raise awareness of the East of England’s military heritage.  In so doing, we have benefitted local society and the economy more broadly, recording, enhancing, and disseminating historical records, reaching out to the tourist industry and to other local businesses, and informing those now engaged in dramatizing historical reality. 

 **Volunteers, Citizen Archaeology, Education, and Occupational Therapy** 

 *Eighth in the East* directly engaged 15,969 people, with key beneficiaries involved in the educational programme, including theatrical performances, family days, and exhibitions \(5737 visitors\). Through Liddiard and UEA, a bespoke package of historical resources was developed and disseminated, alongside a programme of outreach, including museum displays, archaeological excavation, and memorial restoration. 375 schoolchildren took part \(far in excess of the project target of 150\), either through classroom/museum activities, or outreach projects \( **5.1**, pp.69, 86\). 

 For both educators and educated this was often a watershed moment in attitudes to history and heritage. The level of engagement amongst schoolchildren drew comment.  As one museum curator put it: *‘The standard of work … was as good as any professional touring exhibition that we've hosted’* \( **5.1**, p.86\). At participating museums, 60% reported an increase in the awareness of their existence, and 40% increased school visits and raised footfall from younger age groups \( **5.1**, p.42\). At Bottisham Museum it was the innovation that struck a chord: *‘No one had thought about an education programme, doing formal lesson plans … People had studied the 8USAAF but not really with a view to teaching it to kids’* \( **5.1**, p.90\). Educational material was also placed online and made accessible via the project website and the *Times Educational Supplement* sites \(at least 5,389 views and downloads, **5.2** and **5.1**, p.88\) **.**  Of the project’s nine interns, all rated the training they received as effective, reported improved self\-confidence, and that it had helped their future careers.  On a practical level, one commented that the experience *‘allowed me to put into practice the skills I’ve learnt at university’*, another that *‘the whole experience was valuable’* \( **5.1**, p.100\). All nine moved on to employment or full\-time postgraduate study. 

 In terms of training, *Eighth in the East* directly engaged 120 volunteers to conduct archaeological surveys on 95 aviation sites \( **5.1**, p.52\), with 72% reporting that they had acquired new skills, 50% that they had subsequently used these skills elsewhere, and 97% rating their training ‘effective’ or better \( **5.1**, p.58\). Supplying local archaeology groups with the expertise with which to secure their futures, Liddiard’s training was cited here as especially decisive.  In the successor legacy project HQ\-East, occupational therapy was a central concern.  In two excavations at Thorpe Abbotts, in collaboration with the American Veterans Archaeological Recovery Programme, training was provided to 19 British and American serving and former members of the armed forces, as well as to family members. Military personnel undertook 462 volunteering hours, 98 of these hours with observation by Occupational Therapists \( **5.4**\). The benefits for those who took part were significant, one medically discharged veteran stating that she had not *‘smiled as much as she did on the excavation for a long time since her injury’*. Another participant reported that *‘these injured soldiers have spent a lot of time feeling ignored and forgotten … and to have you \(Gregory\) acknowledge her thoughts ... really helped with her confidence’* \( **5.3a**\). The Occupational Therapist observers confirmed the transformative effects on well\-being, noting that those taking part found themselves not only using skills learned in the military for new purposes, but developing new capabilities, thanks in part to the *‘accepting and non\-judgemental environment’* \( **5.4, 5.5**\). 

 **Networking, Dissemination, and Service to Museums** 

 The museums also benefitted, not least through the recruitment of new and younger volunteers.  Thorpe Abbotts airfield museum, for example, reports an increased artefact collection, increased awareness, and significantly increased footfall \( **5.3a**\). Through the dissemination of its work, the project and its legacy organisations have become the centre of an expanding network of interest groups, acting as a connector and facilitator in ways not originally envisaged. Global reach is evidenced through social media. By July 2020 \( **5.6\)**, posts on the legacy project HQ\-East’s Twitter feed \(followed by 4,677 individuals located in 89 different countries\) had reached 6,048,685 people worldwide.  A further 1,290,359 were reached via Facebook \(1,126 followers\); whilst 17,322 individuals follow the Instagram account.  A survey of online viewers demonstrates the tangible benefits of this network, with 32% of respondents indicating that they have visited a regional museum as a result of their website use, and a further 44% reporting that the project had changed the way they think not only about the United States Army Air Forces \(USAAF\) in East Anglia but about twentieth\-century heritage sites more generally \( **5.6\)**.  This has brought further benefits to a range of national and regional organisations, not just in heritage but for the local economy. The internationally important American Air Museum \(a subsidiary of Imperial War Museum, Duxford, 2019 footfall 401,287, **5.6**\) uses the project’s site as a principal platform from which to share its collections with the public \( **5.3c\)**.  As reported by the American Air Museum’s Web Engagement Officer, without its own social media accounts, the Museum depends upon Liddiard and Gregory’s site as *‘the way its \(29,000\+\) photos are shared regularly with target audiences around the world’*.  In turn, this has led *‘to corrections and improvements to the Imperial War Museum’s catalogue records’* \( **5.3c\)**. 

 **Local Business, the Visitor Economy, and Advice to Media** 

 As a hub for a range of interest groups, our various projects have promoted historic tourism and facilitated the creation of business networks.  In 2018, we hosted a corporate and educational event at Norwich Airport attended by representatives of 30 local businesses and enlivened by cockpit tours of one of the few still airworthy Spitfires \(MH434, built in 1943\).  Described by Barclays Bank as *‘an exceptional event’* impossible without the project’s support, this brought Barclays *‘new business opportunities in the aviation and technology sectors’* \( **5.7a**\), not least with SaxonAir Charter, whose letter \( **5.7b**\) notes the event’s *‘superb’* organisation, and the unprecedented opportunities arising here for networking and new contacts.  As a result of such enterprise, the not\-for\-profit business\-led private company Visit East of England developed a ‘Friendly Invasion’ tourist package. This resulted in the award of GBP237,000 from the Discover England Fund, towards a GBP387,000 ‘Friendly Invasion’ campaign. By 2019, this campaign was able to estimate a likely future uplift of 40% in US visitors, and the development of high and medium cost tour packages *‘of a kind that had never sold before’* \( **5.8**\). On average, each American tourist spends GBP930 per visit to the UK, excluding flights \( **5.9**\), suggesting a significant boost to the visitor economy. It also brought our project into direct conjunction with what in due course will become an Apple TV Plus miniseries, ‘Masters of the Air’, intended as a third part to the Tom Hanks/Stephen Spielberg WWII series, ‘Band of Brothers’ and ‘The Pacific’.  Gregory was closely involved in discussions here, including presentations of his research to executives from Playtone \(Tom Hanks’ production company\), to the scriptwriter, and to the author of the underpinning narrative \(Don Miller\).  Five thousand copies of a publication produced by Visit East of England, drawing upon our project’s research, with a foreword by the Duke of Cambridge and Tom Hanks, were freely distributed to museums in the US, including the National WWII Museum in New Orleans and the National Mighty Eighth Museum in Savannah Georgia \( **5.8**\), and Tom Hanks is reported to have *‘turned his office into what looks like an Eighth Air Force museum, complete with model airplanes hanging from the ceiling’* \( **5.10\)**.  Planned outcomes have been seriously affected by COVID\-19 with filming, originally scheduled to begin in 2020, twice postponed.  In due course, nonetheless, the heritage central to Liddiard and Gregory’s work is to be broadcast internationally to an audience far larger than anything imaginable when our project was first conceived. 

 With or without Hollywood glitz, our project has benefitted a range of audiences in diverse ways.  In the words of the independent evaluation report for *Eighth in the East*, it has *‘made an extremely positive difference to this history and the people of the East of England \(and beyond\) through training and education, participation and engagement’* \( **5.1**, p.3\).  Inspiring, training, and informing a future generation of enthusiasts, it has helped preserve the memory of an extraordinary socio\-historical phenomenon not just in terms of written or recorded testimony but as a built environment.  In due course, such landscapes may seem to future generations as significant and as iconic as the medieval castle or the once similarly neglected monuments of the Industrial Age.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The impacts created by Professor Martin Charter and The Centre for Sustainable Design<sup>®</sup> \(CfSD\) are in the area of Circular Economy social and business innovation. Impacts are led by new approaches to understanding and developing Repair Cafés: 

-  Farnham Repair Café was set up as a community initiative and ‘living laboratory’ to enable repair at a local level and to develop understanding of the global Repair Café movement’s activities and its participants’ motives. New knowledge amplifies the Repair Café movement’s efficacy as an agent for change. 

-  Farnham Repair Café has saved £105,582 for its visitors, diverting 3.8 tonnes of waste from landfill and preventing 35.5 tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, and it has supported the setting up of new Repair Cafés elsewhere. 

-  The creation of an online Carbon Calculator tool allows Repair Cafés to quantify the CO<sup>2</sup> saved by their repairs enabling the Repair Café movement to make the connection between the Circular Economy and mitigation of climate change. 

 The Repair Café research is situated within broader Circular Economy innovation research by Charter and CfSD which has led or contributed to: 

-  New British and international standards— BS 8001:2017 is the world’s first standard for businesses implementing Circular Economy principles; ISO14006:2020 incorporates eco\-design in environmental management systems for businesses. 

-  Changes in the knowledge base of policy\-makers—including those in the European Commission Directorate\-General Research and Innovation Department, and the European Commission Joint Research Centre—leading to new consideration of the Circular Economy in the policies that shape business and the economy. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Centre for Sustainable Design<sup>®</sup> \(CfSD\), located in UCA’s Business School for the Creative Industries, has a long history of influential research into product sustainability and sustainable innovation. This case study focuses on research and impact in the Circular Economy \(CE\), aligned to the UN Sustainable Development 2030 Goals, in particular Goal 9, Innovation, and Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production. Charter’s research generates insights into implementing CE principles to create a world in which the prevailing economic and social model is to retain value in products, components and materials through reuse, repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing. 

 Charter’s 2019 edited book *Designing for the Circular Economy* \( **R1**\) is the summative output from this research. It draws together advanced thinking on replacing linear models with circular ones and extending product life. The book contains 34 chapters, and in addition to editing the collection, Charter authored/co\-authored 4 chapters on the role of the Repair Café in the Circular Economy and on business models for Circular Economy innovation. 

 Charter, with CfSD researcher Scott Keiller \(now UCA’s Sustainability Officer\), conducted and published the first ever global survey of Repair Cafés in 2014, revealing the activities and motivations of Repair Café participants across the world. The research was further developed in the setting up of Farnham Repair Café \(FRC\) in 2015 as a local community initiative and ‘living laboratory’ of CE social innovation and behavioural change. FRC has focused both on delivering local environmental and community benefits, and on furthering understanding of the Repair Café as a Circular Economy social innovation space. 

 Further global Repair Café surveys and a survey based on FRC were conducted by CfSD in 2016, 2019 and 2020. The 2019 survey was a collaboration between Charter, Erasmus University NL, the University of Manchester, and Martine Postma, founder of the Repair Café community. As well as looking at motivations, it explored the ways in which Repair Cafés are organised, and how they interact and overlap with each other and with other organisations beyond the Repair Café community. The results were launched at the UK’s first ever Repair Café conference, organised by CfSD in 2020. Also launched at the conference was an open\-access online Carbon Calculator tool that allows Repair Cafés to determine the carbon savings from their repairs. This was based in part on data collected at FRC and was developed in collaboration with FRC trustee Stephen Privett. 

 CfSD’s Repair Café research provides case studies and analysis that details insights into the role of repair organisations in the Circular Economy, as described in **R1** chpts 19 & 25. **R2** presents the Repair Café surveys, along with further analysis in a paper in the *Journal of Peer\-Production*. Systematically collecting and analysing data from FRC activities has helped to reveal the nature and effects of Repair Cafés, and the research fills an evidence gap that has existed since Repair Cafés started in 2009. Its insight is the potential of community\-led CE actions for environmental change. 

 Charter’s research into Repair Cafés intersects with other CfSD Circular Economy projects which have worked with SMEs to investigate and promote sustainable development. This research builds on CfSD’s REF 2014 impact case \(and see **R3**\). Since 2014 a developing focus on circular business models has led to CfSD’s involvement in two projects funded by the EU Northern Periphery and Arctic \(NPA\) programme, Circular Ocean \(2015\-18\) and Blue Circular Economy \(2018\-22\), which builds on Circular Ocean’s aims and insights. In Circular Ocean Charter worked with UCA doctoral student Rhiannon Hunt and CfSD’s Scott Keiller. They collaborated with partners in Scotland, Denmark, Ireland and Norway to address the Entrepreneurship strand of the NPA programme, researching how start\-ups and SMEs can reuse waste fishing nets and ropes in new product development. CfSD, although not in the NPA area, was brought into the project to contribute specialist expertise in eco\-innovation and SMEs. Charter and CfSD published 6 research reports and feasibility studies and produced a new Circular\-Ocean\-specific version of CfSD’s *Eco\-innovation Guide for Start\-ups, Entrepreneurs & SMEs* \( **R4**\). The insights from this research are a range of methods to stimulate CE innovation; one such method, the ‘serious game’, is described in **R5**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Dissemination: Repair Café research, pathways to impact** 

 Repair Cafés are part of a ‘maker, modifier and fixer’ movement that looks beyond throwaway culture, encouraging people to repair and reuse broken items. Farnham Repair Café \(FRC\), co\-founded by Charter in 2015 \(in a partnership between UCA, Farnham Town Council and Spire Church\), has held 60 sessions, welcoming 3,022 visitors \( **S1**\). The FRC acts as a living laboratory to undertake and disseminate research; CfSD has completed 8 workshops, webinars and events based on data and experience from FRC activities, including the UK’s first Repair Café Conference \(March 2020\), with 80 delegates.  Over 290 people have engaged with all FRC events \( **S1**\). FRC has featured on BBC TV, BBC radio, Brazilian TV, Taiwan TV and in local press reports and blogs \(including a 2016 post by Charter on the blog of the science journal *Nature*\), demonstrating public engagement \( **S2**\). Farnham Repair Café has direct impacts locally in Farnham, and its experience has been used to stimulate other Repair Cafés both locally and internationally and to create tools to help them evidence their value. 

 **Impact: Farnham Repair Café benefits the local environment, economy & community** 

 The 60 sessions of FRC have completed 1,320 repairs, saving visitors £105,582 by enabling them to continue to use an old product rather than buying a new replacement. As a result, 3.8 tonnes of waste have been diverted from landfill and 35.5 tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions have been avoided \( **S1**\). In addition to these benefits for the environment, the FRC has valuable social benefits for both volunteers and visitors: ‘ *it was good to see volunteers working together to help people’*; *‘a wonderful idea saving us all time, trouble and money’* \( **R2**, 2016 survey\). The latest survey of FRC customers evidences behavioural change in that 33 per cent of FRC’s visitors gain confidence and knowledge to complete a repair on their own \( **R2:** 2020 FRC survey\). 98 per cent of FRC’s customers are satisfied with their visit. Survey data shows that this results not just from successful repairs, but also from the strong sense of community spirit, proving the social benefits of sustainability in the local community \( **R2**: 2020 FRC Survey\). 

 **Impact: formation and development of other Repair Cafés, locally and globally** 

 Charter, CfSD and FRC have encouraged the establishment of other Repair Cafés, providing advice and support, benefitting the Repair Café movement. In November 2020 CfSD invited participants from the Repair Café Conference and a series of webinars held in the summer of 2020 \(‘Managing Repair Cafés’; ‘Repair Café Learning’; ‘Repair Cafés in Lockdown’\) to complete a feedback survey \( **S3**\). Of the respondents who were new to the Repair Café movement, the survey revealed the impact of the conference and webinars in stimulating new Repair Cafés. One respondent reported that attending the conference was *‘transformational’* in motivating him to establish a Repair Café in Epsom; another volunteer \(also from Epsom\) noted that as a result of CfSD events *‘we now have the know\-how and confidence to start our own repair café’* \( **S3**\). Delayed by COVID\-19, Epsom Repair Café commenced in early 2021. Other respondents reported their concrete plans to establish Repair Cafés in the near future \( **S3**\). Respondents to this feedback survey who were already involved in running Repair Cafés also reported positive change; the ‘Repair Cafés in Lockdown’ webinar inspired at least 4 Repair Cafés that had closed during the COVID\-19 outbreak to re\-open using online, ‘click and collect’ or drop off/pick up models \( **S3**\). Earlier evidence \( **S1**\) shows how FRC encouraged and supported the formation of new Repair Cafés locally at Alton, Bordon and Basingstoke. 

 In 2019 Charter was invited to visit National Sun Yat\-sen University in Taiwan by the Co\-PI of a Social Responsibility research project at the University, who had encountered Charter’s Repair Café research in *Designing for the Circular Economy* \( **R1**\). Charter worked with NSYSU staff and students and local community groups on projects to establish Repair Cafés \( **C1**\). In 2020 he returned to Taiwan to take part in a programme of activities that culminated, \(later than planned due to COVID\-19\), in the launch of the Southern Taiwan Repair Café Alliance, establishing the first Repair Cafés in this new global territory \( **C1**\). 

 **Impact: providing a knowledge base to advocate for Repair Cafés worldwide** 

 FRC trustee Stephen Privett used data from FRC and other Repair Cafés to develop a methodology for calculating CO<sup>2</sup> emissions saved by successful repairs, demonstrating that Repair Cafés provide the potential to mitigate an average of \-24 kg CO<sup>2</sup>e of greenhouse gas emissions per completed repair. Based on this method, an online Repair Café Carbon Calculator was launched by CfSD/FRC at the Repair Café Conference in 2020. From April – December 2020 it was used 988 times on the FRC website, providing a simple tool to benefit the Repair Café movement by enabling Repair Cafés across the world to prove their efficacy. 

 The Professor at NSYSU Taiwan notes how the Taiwanese Repair Café Alliance has adopted the Carbon Calculator, as *‘it is clear that we need systematic data to show the impacts of repair activities’* \( **C1**\). In the November 2020 feedback survey a number of volunteers from other Repair Cafés reported on take up of the Carbon Calculator. At least 7 had adopted the calculator since its launch or were planning to use it: *‘we will be updating our recording methods and using the online calculator to see the savings our individual café makes’; ‘the calculations of the impact that the repairing has had on the environment is really motivating’; ‘we can use the repair data to make a better case for repair’* \( **S3**\). 

 The Director of the Repair Café International Foundation \(RCIF\) reinforces how the Carbon Calculator allows Repair Cafés worldwide to *‘better quantify the CO<sup>2</sup> emissions associated with repairs’,* noting that, *‘this is a useful resource for RCIF in helping to create the links between circular economy, repair, and climate change’* \( **C2**\). This source also notes how CfSD’s Repair Café surveys *‘have significantly helped increase the understanding of the Repair Café movement worldwide’* \( **C2**\), showing that Charter and CfSD have changed understanding of the environmental and social benefits of the Repair Café model. Charter and CfSD’s Repair Café research influences policy\-makers looking to implement alternatives to ‘take, make, waste’ economic models. The Repair Café research in **R2** is cited in a 2016 UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POST\) policy briefing, *Designing a Circular Economy* \( **S4**\). Charter’s work to collect data on repairs at the FRC, and the second Repair Café Survey \( **R2**\) are discussed in the United Nations Environment Programme report, *Redefining Value: the Manufacturing Revolution* \(2018\) \( **S5**\). 

 **Dissemination: wider Circular Economy research, pathways to impact** 

 The Repair Café project forefronts Charter and CfSD’s broader research into the Circular Economy. This research has been disseminated in multiple ways: the CfSD has run annual Sustainable Innovation conferences since the late 1990s, which to date have attracted more than 2,700 delegates from 50\-plus countries. Since 2018 it has staged 22 free webinars on all aspects of Circular Economy innovation. As part of the Circular Ocean project, Charter has run workshops based on his eco\-innovation and CE methodologies including a ‘Net Hack Challenge’ to develop new products from waste nets and ropes, and a ‘Chem Hack Challenge’ to work with contaminated nets. He has also co\-delivered a new application of the EU Scenario Exploration System \(‘serious games’\) as a mechanism to enable stake\-holders to address the problem of waste nets and ropes \( **R5**\). CfSD and Charter deliver training to private and public sector bodies across the globe, and Charter is a Chinese Government High Level Foreign Expert at Renmin University and team leader of the EU\-China Ecodesign and Standards Cooperation Project. These pathways ensure that the research has been influential in changing thinking about Circular Economy innovation, and is taken up by beneficiaries including EU policy makers and international standards bodies. 

 **Impact: changing the approach of policy\-makers in the EU, China and globally** 

 In 2019 Charter was commissioned by the European Commission to lead research for a report evaluating how CE principles were reflected in funded research and innovation projects \( **C3**\). The Policy Officer who commissioned Charter states that he did so because of his research in *Designing for the Circular Economy*, his work with *‘citizen\-oriented initiatives’* and his record as *‘one of the top experts in CE’* \( **C3**\). The report makes recommendations for developing EU CE policy, embedding CE principles in future R&I funding. The Policy Officer describes how the report’s findings feed into implementation of *‘follow\-up actions to the new Circular Economy Action Plan, on packaging, consumer empowerment, green claims, and on sustainable product policy’* \( **C3**\). In 2020 Charter was commissioned by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to write the report *The Role of the G20 in Support of the Circular Economy*, for Italy’s 2021 G20 Presidency. This has been disseminated to policymakers in Italy, and globally via CfSD webinars. As team leader of the EU\-China Ecodesign and Standards Cooperation Project, Charter exchanged best practice on ecodesign with Chinese policy\-makers in the Ministry of Industry & Information Technology \(MIIT\). The EU Project Manager on this project notes that his research is *‘well\-known’* in MIIT, and the project saw a linking of CE policy to *‘major flagship policy areas’* with *‘consequent increase in interest on the part of the Chinese government’* \( **C4**\). 

 **Impact: influencing standards organisations, and through them, businesses** 

 Charter’s research in eco\-innovation and CE has also led to his role in drafting national and international standards to shape how Circular Economy and ecodesign principles are implemented, benefitting businesses and shaping policy \( **C4**\). Charter was invited to serve on the British Standards Institute panel that drafted BS 8001:2017, *‘the world’s first practical framework and guidance . . . for organizations to implement the principles of the circular economy’* \( **C5**\). In 2020, Charter was elected UK head of delegation to ISOTC323, focused on the development of four international CE standards. Charter was Chair of the International Standards Organisation’s panel of international experts that developed ISO14006:2020. This is a revision of the 2011 standard \(also convened by Charter\) that sets guidelines for incorporating ecodesign into Environmental Management Systems \(EMS\). The new standard includes detailed alignment to revisions in ISO14001:2015 \(EMS\) and ISO9001:2015 \(Quality Management Systems\) and to IEC62430:2019, another new design standard on ecodesign, for which Charter also served as the UK ISO expert. The Sub\-committee Chair for ISO environmental management standards notes that ISO14006 is *‘excellent guidance to environmental managers on how to manage ecodesign’* \( **C5**\). It is a guidance standard for use with the master standard for EMS, ISO14001; this has 350,000 certifications worldwide, indicating, as noted by the Chair, the reach of this impact \( **C5**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Academic research on conflict prediction at Essex involves ongoing collaborations and consultations with non\-academic partners. Our research on prediction led to us being commissioned to provide monthly forecasts of armed conflict for the Political Instability Task Force \(PITF\), a US government\-sponsored initiative on how to anticipate political instability. We have also participated in other events on forecasting with early warning/action initiatives from national and international organizations in the UK, Germany, and West Africa \(ECOWAS\). The ongoing interest and investment have shown that the specific prediction methods are helpful to the end users, even if the specific ways this informs their practice cannot be publicly disclosed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case study is based on a large body of research conducted at the University of Essex on the causes of conflict and conflict modelling, and how these insights can be used to improve prediction of conflict as well as more fundamental contributions to the methodology of prediction and conflict research. 

 With regards to fundamental models of conflict distributions, Clauset, Young, and Gleditsch \(2007\) \[R1\] examined severity\-frequency distributions in conflict, focusing on data of terrorist attacks and their lethality, and how terrorist attacks appear to follow a power law where the number of casualties is inversely proportional to frequency. Our results have been used to forecast the likelihood of future severe terrorist events, such as the risk of a new 9/11\-magnitude attack over a decade. 

 Buhaug, Cederman, and Gleditsch \(2014\) \[R2\] show how out\-of\-sample prediction of civil war can be improved by paying particular attention to factors reflecting groups and potential actors \(i.e., horizontal inequality and grievances\), and how these outperform standard models of civil war that are based on country characteristics. This research project started in 2005, but applications to prediction and comparison with existing prediction models became a major focus in 2011. Based on the results in Buhaug et al. \(2014\) \[R2\], Chiba and Gleditsch \(2017\) \[R3\] extended the grievance and inequality forecast model with information from real time generated events data, providing dynamic monthly forecasts of conflict onset and termination. These form the basis for our sustained engagement with Leidos and the Political Instability Task Force, who receive monthly updated predictions. 

 Outside civil war and terrorism, Gleditsch and Ward \(2013\) \[R4\] show how focusing on issues and conflict management can improve out\-of\-sample forecasting of interstate disputes. Based on this, we were commissioned to write a report on forecasting models for interstate conflict for Leidos and PITF. 

 With regards to the duration of conflict and improving the methodology of prediction, Pilster and Böhmelt \(2014\) \[R5\] considered how out\-of\-sample forecasts can be used to evaluate models of the duration of insurgency campaigns, and applied their results to predict the duration of Syrian civil war. Chiba, Metternich, and Ward \(2015\) \[R6\] emphasized how predictions can be improved by integrating models of duration dependence, reflected in time to onset, duration, and recurrence

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Academic research on improving out\-of\-sample conflict prediction with statistical models conducted by research at Essex has led to ongoing collaborations and consultations with various end\-users. 

 The most direct impact of this research is a sustained commission to produce monthly forecasts of armed civil conflict onset by Leidos for the Political Instability Task Force \(PITF\) \[S1, S2\]. The PITF is a US government\-sponsored initiative on how to anticipate political instability and violence that brings academics together with intelligence analysts, and Leidos is a private company contracted for the project which work extensively with the United States Department of Defence, Homeland Security, and the United States Intelligence Community. PITF uses the best available academic research and presents the findings available to practitioners from the US defence and intelligence communities. The PITF is widely known and many researchers participate in meetings or funded activities, although the specific ways the US government and the intelligence community use the findings are not made publicly available. 

 The monthly updates provided by Leidos are based on models that have emerged through the efforts to improve country\-year forecasts of intrastate armed conflict \(as defined by the Uppsala Armed Conflict Data project, a leading public data source, see  [https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/\#d3](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)\), by looking at indicators of groups, potential actors, and motives in Buhaug et al. \[R2\]. These led in the first place to a commissioned report on whether these forecasts could be improved further and be made more dynamic, now published as Chiba and Gleditsch \[R3\]. These models use machine\-coded event data to update the initial risks as given by pre\-existing structural covariates to produce monthly risks of conflict onset and prospects for termination of disputes. The ongoing interest and investment indicate that the specific predictions and methods are helpful to end users, and we have been told that the models were among the best performing in their evaluation. A PITF manager has provided a letter to confirm our participation, although she cannot provide details on how the material has been used by the sponsor. The Research Director at Leidos, the main contractor for the US Political Instability Task Force states: 

 “Your work has been extremely useful to us as we continue our efforts in instability analysis and forecasting. This is particularly true regarding the project you completed using event data to provide 6\-month forecasts of civil war. The current work you are doing on spatial modelling of instability is likely to provide an essential piece to the puzzle we deal with when trying to understand the regional spread of instability.” \[S3\] 

 Beyond our work with Leidos for PITF, we have also participated in various events on conflict forecasting with early warning/action initiatives from national and international organizations. There is a great deal of interest in more systematic approaches to prediction and a growing recognition that self\-professed experts rarely provide specific predictions and do not have the ability to predict future events they often claim to do. As such, this line of research can help improve best practices for conflict prediction and risk assessment, which will facilitate making the world a better place or at least avoid the overconfidence that has contributed to many intelligence failures in the past. Gleditsch was invited to a consulting meeting for the UK Cabinet Office’s Risk Assessment Unit. Gleditsch, Chiba, and Böhmelt have given presentations on conflict forecasting at the NATO Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre \[S4\]. Gleditsch has given a talk on predicting transnational spillovers from civil war at the UK MOD. Finally, Gleditsch has participated in two workshops organized by the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intended to inform their own prediction efforts PREVIEW. Gerhard Almer, head of division S05 Early Warning and Strategic Foresight states: 

 “The research that you and colleagues have carried out on conflict prediction … has played a significant role in improving PREVIEW’s conflict prediction approaches.” \[S5\] 

 These meetings have included participants from many international institutions and regional organizations with early\-warning or action units, including the Economic Community of West African States \(ECOWAS\), who invited Gleditsch to a workshop to evaluate and offer suggestions to improve their ECOWARN model in October 2019 \[S6\]. 

 Finally, the original research on frequency\-severity distributions in Clauset et al. \[R1\] continues to be used to estimate the likelihood of severe events \(e.g., is a 9/11\-magnitude attack an implausible “black swan,” given the existing data on record?\) and evidence for changes in conflict over time \(see e.g.  [Peace by the Numbers: A Debate](https://www.oneearthfuture.org/research-analysis/peace-numbers-debate), and  [Retool AI to forecast and limit wars](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07026-4)\). 

 This research is used under conditions of secrecy attached to intelligence and military agencies. In the UK, the MOD Defence Science and Technology Lab \(DSTL\) has indicated that they have made extensive use of this body of research and that this was “useful,” but they are unable to provide further details \(including to us as researchers\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 A series of projects by Sussex researchers have enhanced policymakers’ understanding of the importance of creativity to economic competitiveness. Locally, the research led directly to the creation of a hub – ‘FuseBox’ – that has supported hundreds of businesses and boosted skills. The research also underpinned Brighton & Hove City Council’s successful case for the Greater Brighton City Deal, which is delivering £170m in investment to support the city’s businesses. Nationally, the research findings have transformed key policy and funding actors’ understanding of the economic impact of combining arts and humanities with science, technology, engineering and mathematics \(STEM\) skills. Examples include influencing the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s £80m Creative Industries Clusters Programme, and the recommendations in a report commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\) to invest a further £500m in creative industry clusters.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The UK’s rapidly\-growing creative industries employ more than two million people, making an increasingly important contribution to the UK economy. Although it has been long understood that creative industries tend to cluster in particular locations, there was previously a lack of robust evidence about the economic impact – or the drivers of growth – of these clusters. 

 **Brighton Fuse** \[ **R1**\] was a two\-year research project \(2011\-2013\) funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) – carried out by the Universities of Sussex and Brighton, in collaboration with industry partner Wired Sussex – to provide deep understanding of the factors shaping the development of creative industry clusters. Based on a large\-scale survey of almost 500 firms, led by the University of Sussex, and interviews with 77 local entrepreneurs, artists, academics and stakeholders, the project studied the creative, digital, and IT \(CDIT\) industry cluster in Brighton & Hove, analysing its economic contribution, measuring its performance in terms of growth and innovation, and identifying opportunities and challenges. The objective of the study was to inform strategies to make the cluster more competitive and to provide a blueprint for high\-growth, creative digital businesses on both local and national scales. 

 One of the most important findings was the significance of creative skills for innovation and growth. The survey found that 45% of entrepreneurs in CDIT firms in Brighton and Hove had an arts and humanities background. Most importantly, the combination – or ‘fusion’ – of artistic and creative skills with technical expertise was found to be a major factor in business success. The project identified two types of businesses – *‘fused’* and *‘superfused’* companies – which combined arts and humanities skills with STEM skills to a certain or a great extent, respectively. These firms performed strongly, growing at more than twice the speed of ‘unfused’ firms and ten times faster than the UK economy overall. They also continuously innovated their business models, services and products. 

 These findings have been verified and expanded upon by two other projects. **Brighton Fuse 2** \[ **R2**\], also funded by the AHRC, examined the contribution of individual CDIT freelancers through a series of 32 in\-depth interviews and two focus groups. It found that – like the firms studied in **R1** – many freelancers working in the creative industries combine creative and technical skills in their work, demonstrating that the concept of ‘fusion’ can be applied at an individual as well as a group level. 

 The 2014\-16 **Fusion Effect** project, commissioned by UK innovation foundation Nesta, analysed the arts and science ‘fusion’ effect at a national level and beyond the creative industries \[ **R3, R4**\]. Using official UK data on innovation and firm capability, the researchers studied companies across the UK which used both arts and science skills. The report provides evidence that ‘fused’ firms play a major role in the UK economy. These firms make up only 11% of non\-micro firms, but generate 22% of employment and 22% of turnover. Importantly, companies that harnessed both arts and science skills were found to outperform their competitors. Other things being equal, they grow 6% faster in terms of employment, demonstrate 8% higher sales growth than STEM\-only firms, and are 3% more likely to bring radical innovations to market. 

 Together, the researchers’ insights have brought new subtleties to the knowledge and skills agenda, which can often be oversimplified by focusing on the need for more STEM graduates. 

 Research into the UK’s creative industries is ongoing. The University of Sussex is a partner in the Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre \(PEC\) and is leading the work strand on innovation and creative clusters. The flagship data collection initiative of the PEC, Creative Radar, is based on an extended version of the Brighton Fuse methodology and questionnaire. The first Creative Radar report explored the phenomenon of creative micro\-clusters \[ **R5**\], drawing on the insights from the Brighton Fuse report. At time of writing \[February 2021\], a follow\-up of the Creative Radar survey is in the field looking at creative businesses’ response to the Covid\-19 pandemic.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

####  4.1 Supporting and growing the creative industries in Brighton & Hove 

 As a result of recommendations from the Brighton Fuse research \[ **R1**\], the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) supported a pilot programme – ‘ **FuseBox**’ \[ **S1**\] – a Brighton\-based innovation centre that provides digital, creative and tech entrepreneurs with access to spaces, facilities, opportunities and expertise. The pilot led to the creation of ten new businesses \[ **S1**\] and FuseBox is now an established hub in the city. Led by the Wired Sussex regional network, it provides support for hundreds of individual entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises, and large corporations including Legal & General and American Express, helping to mitigate the skills barriers highlighted by the Fuse projects. Phil Jones, Managing Director of Wired Sussex, explains the importance of the research in the development of FuseBox and the organisation’s other projects: 

 *“*The research provided us with a detailed in\-depth understanding of the way that technology companies use creativity to generate added value. For us, the most important direct impact of the research has been the development of the FuseBox. As its name suggests, the FuseBox is a conscious attempt to turn the research into a highly impactful and value\-generating business entity. Very overtly building on the insights from the Brighton Fuse research, the FuseBox underpins access to state\-of\-the\-art technology with a highly developed creatively\-driven culture.” \[ **S2**\] 

 Jones goes on to state that the research “has provided the framework to much of the activity that Wired Sussex undertakes to support digital, media and technology businesses both locally and nationally” and that it was “undoubtedly the genesis for several significant projects delivered by FuseBox”. 

 These projects include the **Brighton Digital Catapult Centre** – one of four regional centres established to help innovators bring digital services and products to market, in order to make UK businesses more competitive and productive. Jones explains that “the successful proposal to host a regional centre used the Brighton Fuse research as its evidence base” \[ **S2**\]. The Brighton Digital Catapult Centre is led by the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership, which has also been strongly influenced by the Brighton Fuse research, as outlined in its Strategic Economic Plan 2014: “We will build on the recent Brighton Fuse report to address skills development in the CDIT sector.” \[ **S3**\] 

 Other successful projects stemming from FuseBox include: 

-  The Brighton Immersive Lab, which offers access to mixed reality testing and showcasing spaces and has helped accelerate the growth of the regional VR/AR sector. Jones states that the Lab “embodies the Fuse approach by applying creative practices to a range of emerging technologies”. 

-  The ESRC\-funded FuseBox 5G testbed project – the first in the UK designed to be used by SMEs – became the model used by the DCMS to establish its national Testbeds and Trials Programme. 

-  A joint DCMS\-funded project with partners including Brighton Dome, that is working with the music industry to explore how to use emerging technologies to create, produce and experience musical content in innovative ways. 

 As Jones explains, “the success of the FuseBox has also inspired other organisations to apply the Brighton Fuse research in their activity”. For example, Chelsea Football Club’s Chelsea Entrepreneur Programme uses the Fuse\-derived model developed at the FuseBox to help jobseekers start their own business, while American Express \(one of the early supporters of FuseBox\) introduced retail developer Redevco to ideas from the Fuse research as part of a ‘store of the future’ project, which looked at how technology will disrupt the physical retail sector. The relationship subsequently led to Redevco investing in and redeveloping part of the Lanes shopping area in Brighton. \[ **S2**\] 

 The Brighton Fuse project was also used extensively to support Brighton & Hove City Council’s successful City Deal bid *,* **“**providing the underpinning evidence for Brighton and Hove’s £170m City Deal in 2014” \[ **S1**\]. Through the City Deal, the UK government provided £170 million to create 8,500 jobs and grow technology businesses. The government’s policy paper on the City Deal acknowledges the significant influence of the Brighton Fuse research: 

 “Brighton’s creative\-tech cluster has emerged from nothing over the past decade and now boasts over 1,500 high\-value businesses... The Brighton Fuse research highlighted this sector’s outstanding performance and held up Brighton as a new model for developing “superfused” businesses.” \[ **S4**\] 

 The paper also highlights the wider influence of Brighton’s City Deal, stating that it “will share knowledge and intelligence about supporting creative\-tech business, based on its Fuse model growth, with government departments and other local authorities.” \[ **S4**\] 

####  4.2 Inspiring national policy and investment in creative industries 

 As well as having a direct impact on business success, the research has influenced funding decisions for the creative industries by inspiring policymakers, at both a local and national level. Speaking in support of the Brighton Fuse project at the project findings event in 2013, the Rt Hon Ed Vaizey, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Culture and Creative Industries, set out his ambition to replicate the success of the Brighton creative cluster across the country: 

 “The Brighton CDIT cluster is clearly a great success story and I welcome this study that looks at the factors underpinning its success. We are living in an increasingly convergent world where the earlier distinctions between arts and digital technologies are blurring. The creative industries have always been early adopters of new technologies and I want to see similar clusters thrive right across the UK.” \[ **S5**\] 

 In March 2014, the AHRC exhibited the Brighton Fuse project as an example of high\-quality research in its Creative Economy Showcase. In his keynote address at the event, the Rt Hon David Willetts MP \(then Minister of State for Universities and Science\) emphasised the significance of the project, stating: “The fascinating Brighton Fuse project... has a very important lesson for us”. He went on to describe how the project’s identification of the success of super\-fused businesses was providing inspiration for government policy: 

 “This \[superfused business\] is a business that brings together technology, business acumen and of course creative and artistic activity creating content. If we can bring all that together, you clearly do have quite extraordinarily successful companies and organisations growing more rapidly than other companies across the country, and even more rapidly than other companies in the creative industries… Here in the UK we are very good at combining innovative IT with new creative content. And I think that is the future and it’s something that we want to promote.” \[ **S6**\] 

 AHRC’s 2017 report highlights the influence of Brighton Fuse on the development of similar regional projects \(Bristol and Bath By Design, and Creative Fuse North East\) and states that “the legacy of the AHRC’s ground\-breaking Brighton Fuse project \(2011\-2013\) continues to be felt” \[ **S6**\]. 

 Building on this momentum, the Business and Culture Secretaries commissioned Sir Peter Bazalgette to conduct an independent review into how the UK’s creative industries can underpin future prosperity. Bazalgette’s 2017 report \[ **S7**\] sets out areas where, as part of the Industrial Strategy, government and industry should work together to develop a Sector Deal for the Creative Industries. Citing evidence from both the Brighton Fuse and Fusion Effect research \[ **R1** and **R3**\], the report’s key recommendation was to adopt a regional cluster\-led approach to support creative industries, supported by a £500 million Creative Clusters Fund. This recommendation was taken up in the Creative Industries Sector Deal, which included an £80m Creative Industries Clusters Programme to support arts and humanities\-led research and innovation in UK creative clusters. \[ **S8**\]

#  1. Summary of impact 

 The University of Manchester’s isolation of graphene has led to an array of products incorporating graphene, which deliver a range of performance improvements, including composite strength and wear resistance, heat management, noise dampening, low material weight, high electrical conductivity and microbial resistance. Graphene is a key component in some of the world’s bestselling cars, running shoes and smartphones. Graphene has been fundamental in the development and performance of numerous products that have dominated their individual markets. Within this impact period: 

-  Inov8 has sold \[text removed for publication\] running shoes worldwide \[text removed for publication\], with their graphene enhanced G\-grip soles. 

-  The automotive giant Ford has incorporated up to ten graphene components in the engine compartments of their Mustang and F\-150, including fuel rail and engine covers, to improve thermal management, mechanical endurance and reduce engine noise and vehicle weight.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2004, research conducted at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) demonstrated the existence of free\-standing two\-dimensional crystals, including graphene, boron nitride and an array of dichalcogenides and complex oxides **\[1\]**. This went against the Mermin\-Wagner theorem, which stated that non\-zero temperature thermal vibrations would destroy any 2D crystal at large distances \[Mermin N. D., Phys Rev 176, 250 \(1968\)\]. Isolation techniques, initially achieved by rubbing layered nano\-crystals against a solid surface **\[1\]**, and later by mechanical exfoliation **\[2\]**, offered a simple, cheap and reliable approach for isolation of these 2D materials. This, combined with the promise that the new class of 2D materials would offer a wealth of new physical phenomena for application across a range of industries, led to significant interest in the field. 

 Interest in graphene was further accelerated when Geim and Novoselov demonstrated that graphene’s electrical properties offered ballistic transport \(negligible resistivity to the passage\) of charge, a linear current\-voltage \(I\-V\) relationship, and could sustain huge currents **\[2\]**. These properties made graphene a target for research in semi\-conductor related industries where performance improvements of silicon\-dominated technologies were plateauing. 

 In 2016, Iliut *et al.* demonstrated that graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide flakes could be incorporated into elastomer latexes for composite production by dip or film casting **\[3\]**. The resulting thin\-film graphene composites demonstrated significant enhanced strength and elongation relative to pure latex elastomer. It was also shown that uniform dispersion of graphene within the matrix, control of graphene particle size, amount of graphene, and appropriate tailoring of the graphene\-polymer interface were essential for positive reinforcement.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 UoM has had direct and indirect influence on global advancement of graphene\-related products. This includes the initial isolation of graphene **\[1, 2\]** \(without which no impact at all from products could have occurred\), and direct development of graphene products to the benefit of specific companies **\[3\]**. 

 Products available on the market that explicitly use graphene to increase strength and wear whilst reducing overall weight of their composite components include: motorcycle and bicycle helmets \(e.g. MOMO FGTR Graphene 1.0 jet Helmet, Catlike Mixino\); bicycle tyres \(e.g. Vittoria Corsa G\+ Clincher graphene road tyre\); cycle shoes \(Catlike Whisper line\); bicycle wheels and frames \(e.g. Vittoria Qurano, Dassi Interceptor frameset\); fishing rods \(e.g. Century Graphex Lure \); golf balls \(e.g. Callaway Chrome Soft Truvis Red Golf Balls\); tennis racquets \(e.g. Head Graphene Touch Speed Lite\); wristwatches \(e.g.RM 50\-03 chronograph\); earphones \(e.g. MediaDevil BC\-01, Zolo Liberty and FiiO F3\); thermal rubbers \(AvanGRM rubbers\) and cars \(e.g. Briggs Mono R sports car, Ford F\-150 and Mustang \(discussed below\)\) **\[A\]**. 

 This case study uses examples from three companies to describe the extent of the impact from using graphene in their products, detailing the improved performance achieved in each case These examples are: 

##  4.1 Innov8 running shoes 

 Publication **\[3\]** drew the attention of Inov8 Ltd who, in 2017, engaged in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with UoM to explore the benefits of graphene composites for the outsoles of sports footwear **\[B\]**. The graphene\-enhanced composite developed from this KTP \[text removed for publication\] was commercialised as the G\-grip outsole, as part of the G\-series and other footwear products launched by Inov\-8 for challenging pursuits such as fell running, ultra\-marathons and high\-intensity training. 

 The first running shoes to feature G\-grip were launched in June 2018, followed by hiking shoes in Dec 2018. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

##  4.2 Ford insulating foams 

 Automotive giant Ford, in collaboration with Eagle Industries and specialist graphene supplier XG Sciences in the USA, has formulated a range of graphene\-doped polyurethane products for under the bonnet parts **\[Ci\]**. Graphene serves as a nucleating agent, producing a more reliable urethane structure made up of more consistent and smaller bubbles. The reduced density of the doped foams lowers the mass of polyurethane required for the product, offsetting the cost of the graphene and making adoption of the improved product cost neutral **\[Cii\]**. Dopant levels of less than 0.5 weight% graphene lead to foams with a 30% improvement in heat endurance, 17% reduction in noise transmission, 20% improvement in mechanical properties and an increase in compression strength between 20–30% **\[Ci\]** when compared to traditional non\-graphene equivalents. The company’s senior lead for emerging materials confirms the importance of graphene; “ *It is a win–win for everybody: the customer gets a quieter car with a more heat\-durable under\-hood foam*” **\[Ci\]**. 

 By the end of 2018, the Ford Mustang and F\-150 both incorporated up to ten graphene components around their engines, including fuel rail and engine covers, to improve thermal management, mechanical endurance and reduce engine noise and vehicle weight **\[Ci, Ciii\]**. Improvement of these features, crucial to reliability, fuel efficiency, performance, assurance of safety, and marketability were all achieved without additional material cost **\[Ci, Cii\]**, and have been used in the \(approximately\) 1,500,000 mustangs and F\-150s sold since the end of 2018 **\[Ciii, Civ\]**. 

##  4.3 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 Further products utilising graphene for its heat dissipation properties include: ski jackets \(e.g. Colmar G\+ Raptor\), solid\-state drives \(T\-Force Cardea Zero M.2 PCI\-E\), graphics cards \(MSI RTX 3000\), concrete additives \(e.g. GS Graphene concrete modifier\), air conditioners \(The Elesia Air Cooling Unit EL\-ACU\-1000\) and heated mattresses \(Xiaomi blankets\) **\[A, G\]**. 

 Alongside these examples other products have reached the market exploiting additional properties of graphene. These include microbial resistance, exploited in antimicrobial coatings \(GrapheneCA antimicrobial coating **\[G\]**\) and electrical conductivity. This has been developed in a range of products including: inks \(GRAPHINK, Cambridge Graphene inks **\[G\]** and Vorbeck materials inks **\[Aii\]**\), antistatic bags for protection of electronics \(GXT\-EST bags **\[G\]**\) and diagnostic sensors \(Nanomedical Diagnostics NHS Agile biosensor chip **\[Ai\]**, VIS\-SWIR linear array detectors **\[G\],** CN2 Nanobioelectronics Q\-Sense GO **\[Aii\]**\). 

##  Summary 

 The three companies provide examples of the reach of impact from using graphene in their products; all three have resulted in the improved performance capabilities of products.  Using estimates for total cumulative graphene production revenue \(just for the material itself\) within the window 2013 to 2020 **\[H\]**, and using a conservative estimate for product mark\-up of a factor of 100, the total revenue generated, in this REF period, from products containing graphene would be in the range of between GBP5,000,000,000 and GBP50,000,000,000.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted by Leeds Beckett University \(LBU\) drove the design and delivery of a residential recovery course for wounded, injured and sick \(WIS\) serving military personnel, producing significant and sustained improvements in positive mental health and well\-being. Over 4000 WIS personnel have benefitted from attendance. Research evidence provided by LBU also underpinned the decision of The Royal British Legion \(TRBL\) to invest £27 million to fund this recovery course for 10 years and elicited policy changes in the British Army and Royal Air Force to mandate attendance of the Battle Back course for their WIS populations. Impacts are now evident beyond serving personnel \(e.g., military veterans, junior soldiers and spinal cord and brain injured rugby union players, their families and carers\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2009, the UK Ministry of Defence \(MoD\) was experiencing an increase in the number of personnel requiring recovery support due to physical wounds, injuries or mental ill\-health. Specifically, those so severely affected were downgraded from their current military job role due to their injury or illness and were placed in the MoD recovery pathway. 

 In reaction to the increased need of the MoD to provide additional support to their recovering personnel, TRBL commissioned LBU to research and design a supportive recovery programme in the form of a residential Multi Activity Course \(MAC\), utilising the concept of adaptive adventurous activities and health and well\-being coaching. It involved consultations with expert practitioners and academics as well as a review of existing literature. This research provided extensive insight into the considerations needed around the key elements of an experience that could create the opportunity for effort\-driven, custom built challenges which may facilitate personal development and growth. It documented important considerations around: the activities & sports, physical connectedness, the environment, the staff and importantly the opportunity to process meaning from the experience **\[1\]**. This research created the blueprint for the pilot courses at TRBL’s Battle Back Centre. 

 Since then, research from LBU has contributed key information regarding the design, development and effectiveness of recovery provision for these individuals. Since the start of the audit period in August 2013, this work has directly impacted the availability, quality and effectiveness of a five\-day residential recovery programme for over 4,000 WIS armed forces serving personnel. 

 Eleven pilots were completed with 76 participants. Each course had a research process built into it. Information was gathered from consenting participants and staff to inform the development of subsequent courses, one week to the next. The consolidation report of the evaluation of the pilot courses provided recommendations for future courses, including how an intentional theoretical underpinning could be used to guide the delivery of courses, specifically to help facilitate participants achieve meaningful, authentic and healthy outcomes **\[2\]**. The introduction of self\-report quantitative scales for participants regarding their mental well\-being and psychological needs were also recommended and subsequently introduced. This facilitated an assessment of changes in scores between the start and end of the course. Use of these scales in pilots 10 and 11 showed, on average, a 25% improvement in the cohort’s mental health and well\-being **\[2\]**. Collecting quantitative measures of participants’ mental well\-being was routinely implemented after completion of the evaluation of the pilot courses. Evidence\-based impact on positive mental health and well\-being has therefore been provided for 24 courses per year with a capacity of up to 24 WIS participants from August 2013 until the end of 2020. 

 Between 2012\-2015, 971 participants showed an average significant increase of 15.9% in positive mental well\-being over the duration of the course **\[3\]**. More individualised, qualitative research was also conducted during this period. The courses were found to stimulate a balance of present\- and future\-oriented psychosocial outcomes for the participants, through which they rediscovered aspects of themselves that had been lost through their injury or illness and helped them move forward with their lives, adopting new, future\-oriented activities **\[4\]**. LBU’s narrative inquiry research evidenced a prominent transformation of participants’ personal narrative during the courses. These transformations included positive consequences for the health and well\-being of those participants **\[5\]**. Findings suggested that, in the short\-term, involvement in the course had numerous individual positive outcomes which improved the psychological well\-being and development of the participants.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1 Sustainably improving the mental well\-being of recovering armed forces personnel** 

 The primary impact evidenced in LBU’s research is the positive influence the recovery courses have had on the mental well\-being of the 4,142 national and international WIS participants. There is a complex and wide range of health issues amongst the attendees. As such, it is considered that all participants may be ‘adults at risk who are unable to safeguard their own wellbeing’, as defined in the 2014 Care Act. Many nationalities serve in the UK armed forces. The courses have supported recovering WIS personnel of British, Nepali, Canadian, US, Ghanaian, Irish, South African and Fijian nationality. 

 In 2016, LBU began a longitudinal study into the long\-term impact of the courses on the participants mental well\-being and their health\-related behaviours. Participants are invited to contribute research data at four time points over the 12 months after attending a course \(2 weeks, then 3, 6 & 12 months\). Between 2017\-2018, 759 participants reported an average increase of 33% in their mental well\-being scores by the end of the course **\[A\]**. This was an 83% greater relative increase than seen in participants between 2012\-2015 \(18%\). This indicates that not only have the courses been consistently beneficial but that the significant impact on well\-being has increased over the period of the study. The repeated well\-being measures provided by participants showed a statistically significant and sustainable improvement in their scores in the 12 months following the course. The average mental well\-being scores of the contributing participants was significantly higher at every time point after attending a course than the average score before the course **\[A\]**. An increase in a person’s well\-being score of at least 3 scale points represents a meaningful change for an individual. The average increase over 12 months for course participants is 5.2. 

 The attribution of the course to these improvements in mental well\-being was considered through additional research questioning; 89% of respondents indicated that the personal impact of the MAC was “Positive or Mostly Positive” 12 months after attending. 75% reported making “changes in their day\-to\-day life since attending 12 months ago” **\[A\]**. 40% of these changes related to improvements in having a “negative mindset”, “worrying about things out of their control"", ""bottling things up"", ""being hard"" on themselves or ""avoiding thoughts and feelings"". 15% had stopped ""finding excuses"" and were now ""taking responsibility for their recovery"", ""stopped isolating themselves"" and/or ""feeling less self\-pity"" **\[A\]**. 

 LBU have also shown the long\-term impact of the course on participants’ ability to make changes in their day\-to\-day life through the lens of psychological well\-being **\[B\]**. This research identified that elements of the course satisfy the participants basic psychological needs of competence, relatedness and autonomy. The behaviour changes reported by 97 participants six months after the course were predominantly aligned with improved psychological well\-being **\[B\]**. This meaningful change in mental well\-being and positive behaviour is exemplified in these example quotes from participants, 12 months after attending a course: 

 *“The Battle Back course has probably saved my life. What I have been through in the last 18 months is probably hard to believe.”* 

 *“I cannot express adequately, how the experience helped me. It literally saved my life. This was down to the amazing people who run the course, I'll always be grateful to them, thank you.”* 

 *“Please keep encouraging WIS to go \- it was the most enjoyable and influential part of my recovery journey”.* 

 **4.2 Informing The Royal British Legion’s strategic approach to funding recovery support for WIS armed forces personnel** 

 LBU’s research into the design and delivery of supportive programmes for recovering military personnel gave TRBL an academically informed design to work from in the delivery of the first pilot courses and, working with the WIS personnel, MoD and coaching staff, an evidence\-based refinement of the course was co\-produced. Antony Baines, Executive Director of Operations at The Royal British Legion explained *“the kind of research that went into the initial pilot to establish the courses and then the evaluation of the subsequent pilots were both critical in terms of the Legion committing long term funding”* **\[C\]**. The evaluation of the 11 pilot courses identified the initial effectiveness of positively influencing the recovery of the participants and led to TRBL committing £27 million to the Battle Back Centre **\[C\]**. This commitment created 5,760 places for beneficiaries to participate in recovery courses over 10 years. 

 LBU’s ongoing longitudinal research on the recovery course continues to feed into TRBL’s annual strategic decisions to support the armed forces in funding the Battle Back Centre. Like many commissioning organisations, evidence of efficacy and value for money are important to TRBL to confirm if something is worthy of continual investment and helps them to make informed decisions on future spending priorities. Antony Baines, Executive Director of Operations at The Royal British Legion corroborates: *“When you look at Battle Back over a period of eight years, it actually makes quite an impact having all that evidence. \[LBU’s\] research gives you a real solid base to be able to make funding decisions from and it feeds into the way in which we strategically review our services \[and\] into the long\-term strategy of the Legion in terms of where it spends its money and where I think it's going to get the most impact”* **\[C\]**. 

 **4.3 Informing policy change in UK armed forces recovery pathways** 

 When the courses first became available for WIS army personnel, attendance was optional. Personnel Recovery Units \- who manage the recovery of the WIS personnel \- identified when attending may benefit an individual’s recovery and encouraged attendance. Research into the positive impact the pilot courses had on the participants was made available to the Army Recovery Capability. This is the department that manages all UK Army WIS personnel.  In 2012, they mandated attendance on the MAC course at The Battle Back Centre for all Army WIS personnel. The Commanding Officer at the time of the policy change explained that *“Evaluation and research information from Battle Back about the positive effects that these MACs had on participants was made available to the ARC, and informed the ARC’s decision to mandate the course. This resulted in a formal policy change for ARC personnel in 2012: The MAC was then made an integral part of the Army’s “Recovery Pathway*” *for all serving WIS and moved to ‘full operational capacity’: 24 one\-week MACs annually for up to 24 participants on each course*” **\[D\]**. As a result of compulsory attendance for army WIS \(the largest population of the armed forces\), the reach of the significant impact on WIS personnel was increased for the audit period due to larger cohorts regularly attending the course. 

 The impact of LBU research on UK armed forces recovery policy is further evidenced in the decision of the RAF to mandate the course for their WIS in 2017, which at the time had 238 personnel in recovery; the number of WIS personnel in the RAF had increased every year since 2014 and had more than doubled since 2010. This decision further increased the reach of the impact to all individuals in another WIS population. Wing Commander Mike Bowditch explained how LBU research informed that decision. *“In my role when I am making decisions about how we are going to direct and implement policy the existence of evidence plays a key role.  We used the research studies from Leeds Beckett University at the time as a key reason for us mandating the requirement to attend the Battle Back course.  The evidence in the studies confirmed the anecdotal evidence we had from talking to our Service People who attended the course that it had a substantial impact on their outlook on life, reframing their negative perceptions of their injuries to be more positive and resulted in massive improvements to their mental health and wellbeing.”* **\[E\]**. 

 **4.4 Impact beyond in\-service military personnel** 

 **Policy change at TRBL to start funding veterans’ courses and the positive impact they have on attendees** 

 Impact on policy \- Until 2017, recovery support was only delivered to those WIS personnel who were still in\-service. Considering the future potential for supportive courses, TRBL decided to commission the delivery of bespoke courses for military veterans. Explaining the rationale behind that decision, Antony Baines said *“The consistency of the research has helped the Legion carry on funding MACs but it also gives confidence to look at expanding the remit into things like veterans’ courses*” **\[C\]**. LBU research from the initial veteran courses gave the Legion the *“assurance to agree funding and carry on”* **\[C\]**. 

 Impact for veteran participants – On average, the veteran participants’ mental well\-being scores were below the national average upon arrival to the course. Data from 105 participants showed an average increase of 49% in their positive mental well\-being by the end of the course, bringing this average up to 11% higher than national average as a result of attending the Battle Back course. Since May 2019, veterans have been invited to take part in a long\-term follow up study to understand the impact the course has had on their life since attending. To date, 34 veteran participants have contributed to this follow up research which has identified a sustained increase of 24% in their mental well\-being scores three months later. 

 **Policy change at the British Army Foundation College to run two Multi Activity Courses per year as part of junior soldier training** 

 Having read LBU’s research, as well as witnessing the impact of the courses during his time at Army Recovery Capability, the now Commanding Officer of the British Army Foundation College, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hall, believed junior soldiers may also benefit from this type of course. He used LBU’s research evidence to gain permission from Army Regional Command for such courses for junior soldiers to be delivered. *“The previous \(LBU\) research that I read was very influential in my decision to try and support courses for junior soldiers because I thought I can sell the argument, not just based on my recommendation, but actually pointing to facts and figures”.* **\[F\]**. The impact of the pilot course on the twenty\-one 16–18 years\-old junior soldiers was researched by LBU. The soldiers reported an average increase of 19% in their mental well\-being scores. One soldier said *“I now feel 100% ready to seek out things I’m not confident in, do them, gain confidence in that and move on to the next thing for me to develop”.* 6 months later, another said *“For those that are sceptical about it all, all I have to say is that I am proof that it works\!”* 

 Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hall further corroborated the impact of LBU research: “ *Your report came in and it added objectivity to what we hoped and suspected would be a really worthwhile course. That then allowed me to go back to my Chain of Command as well as Commander of The Initial Training Group and say, I think we've proved it, you can't argue with the objective nature of the report, we'd like to get this established on a permanent footing, expand it and find the time within training to send them on it.”* **\[F\]**. Two courses per year have now been agreed in perpetuity, allowing 48 junior soldiers to benefit annually; a decision based on LBU research. 

 Follow up research evidenced that fewer junior soldiers who had attended the course were considering leaving the army. The financial impact that has on the MoD was explained by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hall, *“the greatest impact you could have on the Army's quality and quantity would be to retain a Harrogate junior soldier and that's what your research has contributed to. Given that costs for training can be up to £90k per head, a reduction in wastage of 11 recruits equates to a financial saving of just under £1 million.  For the first course we expected to lose 60% of that cohort and I think in the end we only lost less than 20%. The only difference between that cohort and the previous cohort was that they had been through the Battle Back course, so you can link the two together”* **\[F\]**. 

 **Supporting spinal cord and brain injured participants, their families and carers** 

 The Rugby Football Union’s Injured Players Foundation \(IPF\) is a charity serving those who have been catastrophically injured playing rugby. Their welfare officer was aware of the positive impact the recovery courses have for WIS military personnel and felt that their clients could benefit from similar supportive courses. LBU’s experience in researching the courses showed the IPF they could gain an understanding of the effects a course may have on their client’s well\-being. Dr Karen Hood, Director of the IPF said *“If the previous research had shown there was no measurable improvement in individuals’ self\-esteem, mental wellbeing, quality of life, then it would have been inappropriate for us to progress”* **\[G\]**. Karen went on to explain that LBU research from the pilot IPF course *“immediately gave us proof of concept, the fact that this is a type of programme that we should be continuing with and that in itself is hugely valuable”* **\[G\]**. The IPF have decided to fund a course every year since the first in 2017. To date, 27 spinal cord and brain injured participants, members of their family and carers have benefited.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Stirling research by Bell and Blanchflower has played a crucial role in the major shift to the use of broader measures of labour market slack in monetary policy decisions made by the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve over the last seven years. 

 Pre\-2008, central banks regarded the unemployment rate as the main indicator of labour market slack. Interest rate decisions were therefore heavily influenced by unemployment rates. Since 2008, unemployment has not been a reliable measure of labour market slack. Bell and Blanchflower have shown that *underemployment* is a more appropriate measure: acceptance of this by central banks has led to changes in their definition and policy focus of full employment and lowered inflation risk assessment. 

 The ultimate impacts of this shift have been widespread, positively affecting the health of the UK and US economies, stocks/bonds valuations, and currency stability, therefore benefitting millions. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Stirling’s Bell and Blanchflower’s research into the 2008 Great Recession revealed the disproportionate and ‘scarring’ effects of unemployment on those aged 16\-24 years old. During the Great Recession unemployment among the young rose at a greater level than any other demographic group, moreover the research \( **R1**\) showed that the young were far more likely to experience *underemployment*, that is they were willing to work more hours but the market was failing to demand extra working time from them. Because monetary policy was based on mechanisms that focused on a narrow measure of labour market slack \(i.e. only unemployment\), this policy was increasing underemployment and unemployment by setting interest rates too high. These trends were shown to be amplified for those with a low level of qualifications and those from minority ethnic backgrounds. 

 These findings led Bell and Blanchflower to further explore the phenomenon of underemployment \( **R2**\) by developing an ‘underemployment index’ for the UK context using individual data from the Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey. The development of this alternative measure of labour market slack was further refined in research commissioned by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in the US \( **R3**\). This included recommendations on how the index could be developed for the US using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

 The research continued to develop the underemployment index to account for governments’ changing monetary policies and changes to the unemployment rate within the UK \( **R4**\). The index was applied to European countries using Eurostat Labour Force Survey data \( **R6**\) and continued to calculate and track the UK index and use it to argue that the Bank of England should not raise UK interest rates \( **R5**\). Each index uses aggregated data on individuals’ desired hours of work to provide an alternative to the unemployment rate to measure labour market slack. The definition of the index ensures that when net desired hours of work are zero, \(the number of extra hours desired by the underemployed equals the reduction in hours desired by the overemployed\) the index matches the unemployment rate. 

 Overall, the key finding \( **R1** \- **R6**\) that relates to the impacts presented below was that there was extensive underemployment of labour within the UK economy during the Great Recession. This took the form of workers wishing to work longer hours without expecting any increase in their hourly wage. But employers were not offering additional hours, leaving workers in a weakened bargaining position. This provided a key explanation of the dramatic slowdown in wage growth during, and after, the recession. Although the economy gradually recovered and unemployment fell substantially, wage growth remained stubbornly low. The indices we developed for European countries \( **R6**\) showed that unemployment and underemployment in several of these countries followed similar patterns before and after the recession. Thus, compared with past experience, wage growth was stunted, even though unemployment rates, in most countries recovered to their pre\-recession levels and in some approached post\-war lows.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The ultimate beneficiaries of our underemployment index have been, and will continue to be, the UK and US population, particularly young people seeking employment. The wider public have benefited because raising interest rates would have increased the risk of further slowing recovery after the Great Recession. Such a slowdown would have adversely affected businesses through falling demand, households through lower incomes and government through falling tax revenues.  Benefits to these groups were transmitted through the Monetary Policy Committee \(MPC\) of the Bank of England which sets UK monetary policy, focusing principally on interest rates; other central banks \(including the US Federal Reserve\), some taking their lead from a the BoE, have also been benefited from our research through their enhanced understanding of underemployment and its role within their respective labour markets, leading to policy changes and corresponding benefits for populations. In these cases, the ultimate beneficiaries are the populations of the relevant countries. 

 Adam Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, former MPC member, and adviser to numerous central banks including the Federal Reserve, states that the shift toward the inclusion of our measure of underemployment \( **R1**\- **R6**\) represents a monetary policy “revolution” \( **S1**\). Posen explains that this shift: 

 “changed the definition and policy focus of full employment; second, it lowered the assessment of inflation risks for the advanced economies for an extended period. This has an effect on a series of policy decisions affecting millions of people, the health of the economy, the valuation of savings in stocks and bonds, and the stability of currencies, with impact on politics, and will continue to do so for some years to come.” \( **S1**\) 

 These positive economic changes brought about by central banks relied on only a “handful of evidence\-based research publications” \( **S1**\), including **R1** to **R6**. As Posen states, “Without Bell and Blanchflower’s ground\-breaking research on underemployment … central banks might not have changed their minds on this absolutely critical set of measurements and concepts” \( **S1**\). 

 The primary mechanism through which our research entered policy was via its inclusion in debates within central banks. For example, the MPC’s minutes of a meeting held in December 2018 make reference to “Net desired hours, an indicator of underemployment, had been about zero since the start of 2018, suggesting little in the way of slack on this margin” \( **S2**\). Since our index developed the concept of “net desired hours”, it is clear that the MPC had considered it as a relevant measure to be taken into account when coming to their decision. The Bank of England’s further and regular use of our underemployment index in analysis of the state of the labour market is demonstrated by reference to it in the Bank’s quarterly “Inflation Report”, which informs members of the MPC prior to them making decisions. Underemployment was mentioned in the Feb 2015 \(cites **R3**\), Nov 2015 \(cites **R3**\), Nov 2016 and Nov 2017, Aug 2018 and Nov 2018 inflation reports \( **S3**\). The Nov 2015 Inflation Report specifically referenced our work citing a paper that we wrote for the Peterson Institute for International Economics which was intended to explain how underemployment might be measured in the USA. Further evidence of impact on the MPC came from a speech \( **S4**\) arguing for a different interpretation of our data by a hawkish member of the MPC, Martin Weale, which references **R2**. As Posen summaries, our research “materially influenced the public and confidential discussions of monetary policy set by the Bank of England and by the Federal Reserve in the second half of the last decade” \( **S1**\). 

 The research continues to have wide\-ranging international impacts. For example, the shift in monetary policy underpinned by our research has seen its latest development in the Federal Reserve’s August 2020 revised  [Statement on Longer\-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm). The essential place of our research in this is testified to by Posen \( **S1**\). 

 Our argument that interest rates should not be increased has also entered public debate, as seen by reference to, and support for it, by well\-respected journalists. For example, Larry Elliott, in The Guardian wrote: 

 “Unemployment is at its lowest since 1975, so earnings growth should be picking up. If it isn’t there can only be two realistic explanations: the inflationary surge will eventually happen and has simply been delayed; or there is more slack in the labour market than the headline The Bank goes for the former explanation: two of the world’s leading labour market experts – David Blanchflower and David Bell – believe the latter. In two forthcoming papers \[i.e. R5 & R6\], the pair say that traditional Phillips curve models need recalibrating to take account of underemployment.” \( **S5**. Guardian July 8th 2018\) 

 The international application of our index has also significantly increased its exposure and role within policy deliberations, with, for example, the Office for National Statistics commenting on its attributes \( **S6**\). \[Redacted from publication at request of stakeholder\] \( **S7**\). 

 **Summary** 

 Bell and Blanchflower’s research has undoubtedly been and continues to be crucial in central\-bank level debates and civic discourse on underemployment and interest rate decisions in the UK, Europe, and North America. It has therefore underpinned key national and international policy debates and decisions, with positive benefits for millions across the world.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by McMahon and Hansen underpins major changes to the Bank of England’s communication and education strategy designed to ensure that policy messages reach a broader range of people with the aim of building “ *awareness, engagement understanding and trust”* and in so doing improve policy effectiveness. The research identifies the channels through which central bank communication about the economy may have long\-lasting effects. Moreover, they establish that by reaching out beyond their traditional audience of economists and financial market specialists to engage with the wider public, central banks can increase the effectiveness of monetary policies and enhance trust in the institution. This has led the Bank of England to adopt a new ‘layered’ approach to its key policy publications, targeting social media and non\-experts as well as the financial markets. Alongside the transformation of its communications, the Bank of England has significantly expanded its education and outreach activities engaging directly with the public through school and community forums. 

 A number of other central banks are emulating the lead taken by the Bank of England and producing simplified communications for a non\-specialist audience. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Hansen and McMahon has pioneered the use of tools from computational linguistics to understand communication and decision\-making in central banks. Their work examines the impact of central bank communications internally – on the quality of decision\-making by policy\-makers – and externally – on the financial markets and on the perceptions of the wider public. 

 In a key contribution to the field, with Prat \(Columba University\), computational linguistic algorithms are used to examine the effects of greater transparency on the deliberations of central bank decision makers. Using evidence from the natural experiment arising from the decision to publish transcripts of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee, they establish that greater openness as to how the committee arrives at their decision can improve the quality of decision\-making by providing additional incentives for committee members to work to find appropriate policies **\[R1\]**. 

 In related research, Hansen and McMahon analyse the alternative channels through which central bank communications may affect market yields in both the short and the long run **\[R2\]**. Using computational linguistic methods to extract narrative and numeric signals from a series of Bank of England Inflation Reports, they establish that the policy narrative conveyed in the text drives changes in inflation expectations and long\-run interest rates, even after controlling for the report’s quantitative content. A key finding is that the language used to explain the forecasts and the Monetary Policy Committee’s interpretation of the data affects long\-run outcomes and that the channel through which this operates is mainly through the narrative description of the risks and uncertainties around economic conditions. **\[R3\].** 

 McMahon has extended this analysis to other country settings. As China increasingly opens to international capital flows, the need for international understanding of its financial system and policies is growing. In research with Alfred Schipke \(International Monetary Fund\) and Li Xiang \(Halle Institute for Economic Research\), McMahon examines recent developments in the communication policy of the People’s Bank of China \(PBoC\), as well as setting out some of the changes needed in order to begin the transition to international standards of transparency **\[R4\]**. 

 Building on this research, McMahon has turned his attention to the ways in which central bank communication may reach beyond economists and the financial markets to influence the perceptions of the wider public. Survey evidence suggests that trust in central bank actions declined during and following the financial crisis of 2008, and has yet to fully recover. Moreover, public understanding of monetary policy measures remains low, particularly among the young, the less well\-educated, and those with low incomes **\[R5, pp1\-2\]**. In joint research with Andy Haldane \(Chief Economist, Bank of England since 2014\), McMahon undertakes a controlled experiment to examine how different types of Bank of England communication affect an individual’s expectations about the future values of key economic variables. Their results show that communications that are more easily understood can not only increase the effectiveness of monetary policy by anchoring inflation expectations, but also contribute to improved perceptions of the institution **\[R5\]**. Further work by McMahon, with Haldane and Macaulay \(Oxford DPhil Economics, 2017\-2020\) emphasises the importance of going beyond just clear explanations **.** Presenting both theoretical and further empirical evidence, the results make clear that central banks, and other policymakers concerned with the need to build institutional trust, need to create strategies for engagement and education in tandem with clear communication initiatives **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, central banks have faced mounting criticism and 

 mistrust of their actions and influence, leading some critics to suggest limiting their degree of operational independence over monetary policy. Andrew Haldane, Chief Economist at the Bank of England, in a 2017 speech highlighted the need for these institutions to *“rebuild trust among a wider set of societal stakeholders, more distrustful and diffuse than ever previously”* **\[E1\]**. These challenges have led central banks to rethink how, and with whom, they engage, and to reach out beyond their traditional audience of financial markets participants and policy makers to the general public in an effort to rebuild trust and broaden support for independent central banks and their policies. The research by Hansen and McMahon provided the Bank of England with the analytical framework and empirical basis to develop a communication strategy to meet these objectives. 

###  Impact on Bank of England Communications and Outreach Programmes 

 As part of its Vision 2020 Strategic Plan, the Bank of England devised new communications and education strategies, designed to “ *ensure that our policy messages reach a broader range of people and have impact”* with the aim of building “ *awareness, engagement, understanding and trust, in order to ultimately make our policies more effective”* **\[E2a, pp.15\-17\]**. *“Michael’s research,”* writes Haldane *, “has provided the intellectual and academic foundations of this new approach to communications and education by the Bank and more widely. Michael has served as a consultant as the Bank developed this programme”* **\[E3\]**. 

 McMahon’s “ *research and expertise has been a significant catalyst and contributor to the Bank’s thinking and practice on communication over a number of years”  \[E3\]**. This has involved adopting a new layered approach to key publications. All layers are based on the same underlying analysis but targeted at different audiences, with an ‘announcement’ layer intended to be shared via social media; a visual summary which makes use of graphics and simpler language and targeted at a non\-expert, general audience; and the Monetary Policy Summary intended for a more specialist economics audience **\[E2a, p.25\]**. This approach was piloted in the Inflation Report of November 2017 and an early evaluation of the experiment by Haldane and McMahon **\[R5\]** provided evidence for its effectiveness in increasing public understanding and perceptions of Bank policies. Further evaluation, by the Bank of England’s Behavioural Insights Team, confirmed that the new visual summary’ *“improved public understanding of Bank messages compared to the traditional Monetary Policy Summary”* and had a positive effect on peoples’ trust in the information **\[E4, p.2\]**. Consequently, the Bank of England has made these new communications a permanent part of their toolkit and further expanded their use to include more accessible versions of the  Financial Stability Reports, as well as the Monetary Policy Report \(formerly the Inflation Report **\[E2b, pp.6 & 23\]**. 

 Following the policy recommendations set out in **\[R5\]**, the reconfiguration of the Bank’s publications has been accompanied by an enhanced programme of education and outreach. This includes a schools’ programme with a range of classroom resources, which by the end of 2019 over 1,800 schools had registered for, and over 300 school visits were conducted by bank staff in the same year **\[E2c, p.64\]**. In November 2018, the Bank of England launched its Citizens’ Panels programme intended to give policy makers the opportunity to engage directly with the people they serve. Since the programme’s launch, the Bank has held 17 Citizens’ Panels across the UK, set up an online community to keep in touch with those who attend, and introduced monthly online surveys. In 2019, the Bank expanded this to target 16\-24 year olds and recruited its first youth forum, created in partnership with the British Youth Council **\[E2c, pp.64\-65\]**. 

###  Ongoing Impact at the Bank of England 

 The Bank of England’s Independent Evaluation Office \(IEO\) recently completed a review of the Bank’s quantitative easing \(QE\) programmes, including an examination of the bank’s communications around QE as part of the Bank’s wider strategy around public\-facing communications. As part of the review process McMahon was consulted by the IEO and his research *“has informed the IEO’s recommendations of how best to talk about QE to the public. In particular, his research on the Bank’s new “layered” communications shed light on the content and ways of delivering messages that could best enhance public understanding and trust in QE \(Haldane and McMahon \(2018\), Haldane & McMahon, 2020\)”* **\[E5\]**. The IEO’s final report on QE was published in January 2021 and a focus of their recommendations is on building public understanding and trust in QE. To this end, they recommend further expanding the use of the ‘layering’ approach to key publications relating to QE, and providing accessible responses to the debates around QE arising at Citizens’ Panel events and Governor Q&As **\[E6, section 4.1\]**. 

###  International Impact 

 The Bank of England is widely perceived to be a pioneer in adapting its communications to engage with wider audiences **\[E7, p. 3 & fn 7, p 21\]**. Its ‘layering’ approach has *“since been emulated by other central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve in the US and the ECB \(European Central Bank\) in the euro\-area”*  **\[E3\]**. McMahon’s research and expertise has also provided valuable inputs to the work of the central bank of Indonesia on building and evaluating its credibility **\[E8\]**. 

 In April 2018, McMahon and Schipke presented their research findings on China’s Monetary Policy Communication \(subsequently published as an IMF Working Paper **\[R4\]**\) to a joint conference of the IMF and the People’s Bank of China \(PBoC\) held in Beijing and attended by senior officials of the PBoC and the Ministry of Finance **\[E9\]**. Among their policy recommendations to improve communications with financial markets was the provision of timely information, in one place in both Chinese and English, and regular press conferences **\[R4, p.23\]**. Later in 2018, the financial press noted a significant increase in the number of statements issued by the PBoC in English. This was followed by the launch of a revamped English\-language website in January 2019. As reported by *Financial News* website, “ *Previously only 2% of the Chinese site’s content was available in English, whereas the new English site covers almost every major aspect of policy*” **\[E10a\]**. Both Bloomberg news and Central Banking websites connect the more transparent communications policy of the PBoC to the recommendations of McMahon et al **\[R4, E10b&c\]**. 

 McMahon’s wider influence is supported by his role as the founding Director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research \(CEPR\) Research and Policy Network on Central Bank Communications \(RPNCBC\). This initiative was launched in October 2018 by McMahon with Christine Graeff, then Director General Communications at the European Central Bank, as co\-director. The RPNCBC is a vehicle for discussion and idea\-sharing intended to link researchers from different specialisms and connect them in a two\-way dialogue with policy\-makers and practitioners through workshops, blogs etc. **\[E11\]** 

###  Summary 

 *“My judgement”,* writes Haldane, *“is that Michael’s research and insights on these topics have not only led to him being widely regarded as one of the world’s leading experts in these areas; they have also had a very significant impact in shaping practice, radically, within the central banking community, at the Bank of England and beyond…He has provided the academic underpinnings of a wholly new approach to central bank communications that appears to be increasingly effective and important at a challenging time for central banks.”* **\[E3\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Based on their research into the characterisation of atmospheric aerosols, University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) researchers developed low\-cost Optical Particle Counters \(OPCs\) that measure airborne particulates at high resolutions. These were patented and commercialised by UK SME Alphasense Ltd; since 2015, 18,420 units have been integrated into air quality monitoring systems in 70 countries. This delivered significant economic impact: at least £53.2m in associated commercial revenues and 32 new jobs. The OPCs were used by the UN Environment Programme to map air pollution hotspots in the developing world and by World Athletics to monitor the impact of poor air quality on athletes’ health and performance. They were key to the establishment of comprehensive air quality monitoring networks by city authorities for more effective regulation and stronger public health protection, including three cities in China with a combined population of 24 million. Their affordability democratised access to air quality monitoring for citizen groups in five countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Accurate characterisation of atmospheric aerosols improves our understanding of how particulate matter affects air quality and the climate. However, accuracy has traditionally come at a prohibitive cost. About a decade ago, high\-resolution OPC instruments, which used light\-scattering technologies to count and size airborne particulates, typically cost in excess of £10,000, constraining the creation of air pollution monitoring networks capable of addressing what the World Health Organisation has defined as a ‘public health emergency’. 

 Between 2000 and 2011, researchers in the Particle Instruments and Diagnostics Research Group, led by Kaye and funded by NERC, the UK Met Office and the US National Science Foundation \[ **G1\-G5**\], were focused on the development of complex aircraft wing\-mounted cloud analysis instruments capable of the *in situ* identification, classification and sizing of atmospheric cloud particles such as ice crystals, microdroplets and mineral dust. The so\-called ‘SID’ \(Small Ice Detector\) probes provided data on the abundance, size and shapes of these atmospheric particles that profoundly affect cloud radiative properties – a primary source of uncertainty in climate change modelling. Critically, to avoid affecting the particles being measured, the SID instruments had to be ‘open\-path’ designs \[ **3.1**\], i.e. free from mechanical obstructions such as aerosol sampling tubes onto which droplets could impinge or ice crystals shatter. The Group’s aerodynamic and aerosol behaviour modelling ultimately resulted in wing\-mounted instruments that used two complex optical assemblies to spatially define a ‘virtual’ measurement zone in free space at the nose of the instrument, and a third to determine a particle’s size and shape. These instruments \(SID\-2 and SID\-3\), have since been successfully deployed by atmospheric scientists on more than 50 campaigns by the UK’s FAAM research aircraft \[ **3.2**\- **3.4**\]. The SID\-2 was the first device to successfully measure and classify high altitude atmospheric particles down to micron sizes \[ **3.4**\]. 

 In 2010, the Group applied the SIDs’ open\-path sampling principles to the design of OPCs for a ground\-based sensor network to study air quality at Heathrow Airport, as part of a NERC\-funded consortium led by the University of Cambridge \[ **G5**\]. The project required a network of sensor nodes to measure gases and particulates around the airport’s perimeter for a 15\-month period, but at the time there was no affordable solution for monitoring particulates. The challenge was two\-fold: firstly, traditional OPC designs were based on air pumps to draw in ambient aerosol. These pumps required protection from particle contamination \(a frequent cause of failure\) by an upstream particle filter. These filters would become blocked on a monthly basis and require manual replacement, an activity the Heathrow authorities would not accept. Secondly, conventional OPCs could suffer water damage by sampling fog droplets, not uncommon at Heathrow. 

 The pumpless, open\-path measurement protocol employed in the SID aircraft probes was, in principle, the ideal solution. However, the wing\-mounted SID designs were far too large and expensive for use at Heathrow, so the UH Group undertook extensive optical and aerodynamic modelling of various designs. The final design, later patented worldwide in 2015 \[ **3.5**\], was based on a unique geometry of custom\-designed elliptical mirror and dual\-element photodiode detectors, creating a ‘virtual’ particle measurement zone in free space, unencumbered by mechanical structures. It represented a breakthrough in OPC technology, offering accuracy approaching that of high\-end commercial instruments but at a small fraction of the cost, weight and power requirement. Critically, its design allowed long\-term unattended operation. 

 The OPCs were deployed at 42 locations around Heathrow, running continuously for 15 months without manual intervention, delivering 110 million particle size profiles and confirming their commercial viability as low\-cost, high\-quality sensors. The ‘Heathrow project’ demonstrated that major sources of air pollution outside the airport perimeter in fact originated from traffic emissions from central London \[ **3.6**\]. Consequently, the commercial potential of the OPCs was recognised by Alphasense Ltd, the sensor company that had provided the pollutant gas sensors to the Heathrow project. Alphasense licensed the technology from UH in 2013 and have since funded Kaye’s group to carry out further research for OPC design and performance improvement.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Having established itself as one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of gas sensor technologies, UK\-based Alphasense Ltd sought to expand into the particle monitoring field. In September 2013, the company signed a licensing agreement with UH to commercialise the patented OPC technology. Reliant on the expertise of Kaye’s group in optical and laser light\-scattering techniques, Alphasense commissioned UH to produce 150 OPC\-N1 prototype devices and design the algorithms required to assess particulate matter \(PM\) and convert particle size and count data to PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> for air quality monitoring. The prototypes were sold into the UK, US and Europe as core components that could be incorporated into commercial air quality monitoring systems. Customer feedback verified that the low\-cost OPC\-N1 units provided PM data comparable to that from existing OPCs, which were many times more expensive. 

 UH’s technology had opened up a market that was previously unachievable; the OPC’s low cost made the sale of monitoring systems capable of measuring PM commercially viable and, unlike other OPCs on the market, it was designed for unattended operation in inaccessible locations such as rooftops and trunk roads \[ **5.1**\]. Demand grew rapidly and Alphasense accelerated production, bringing the OPC\-N2 to market in early 2015. Growth was aided by independent evaluations confirming the efficacy of the OPC’s field performance, which were published in peer\-reviewed journals from 2017 onwards \[ **5.1**\]. With further research support from Kaye’s group, the company released the OPC\-N3 in March 2018, which, for the same price, extended the device’s capabilities to pollen and spore monitoring. 

 **Economic impact via revenues for SMEs in UK and overseas – and the wider supply chain** 

 At the end of 2020, Alphasense had sold 18,420 OPC\-N2 and OPC\-N3 units at £285 each, with sales rising to an average of \~500 per month. The OPCs have generated Alphasense £5.2m in revenue from sales in 70 countries, directly creating seven jobs at the company and making a significant contribution to its business performance \[ **5.1**, **5.2**\]. A further two FTE research roles have been created and sustained at UH through \~£100,000 a year in development funding from Alphasense. The product profit margin peaked at 64% in 2018. The company’s 2019 strategic report \[ **5.2**\] read: “ *The results for the year reflect further growth in turnover of 16% … Recently developed new products* \[referring to the OPCs\] *continued to perform well as concerns about air quality, especially in the Far East, led to impressive demand*.” Summing up the strategic importance of the OPCs, Alphasense’s Technical Director said: “ *Alphasense had concentrated on gas detection for 21 years but for the last seven years we have focused on developing our capability in particle monitoring, which has allowed us to cover all critical measurements in air quality at a time when air pollution has risen to the top of policy and media agendas* \[ **5.1**\].” 

 The majority of Alphasense’s customers over the impact period were commercial companies that manufactured and sold air quality systems and networks. Without the OPC, these products would not have come to market \[ **5.1**\]. Thus, UH research has resulted in economic impact via the wider supply chain. Its customers range from large companies, including GRIMM Aerosol, Bosch and Thermo Fisher, to SMEs, including South Coast Science and Atmospheric Sensors Ltd in the UK and QuantAQ in the US. Other significant customers are Kunak Technologies and Libelium, both based in Spain, and Sail Hero, the largest provider of air quality systems in China. According to Alphasense’s Technical Director, the OPC\-N3 has allowed these companies to enter or establish a competitive advantage in a global air quality monitoring market projected to reach $6bn in 2025 \[ **5.1**\]. Based on its own data, Alphasense reports that at least £48m in commercial revenues were generated and 25 sales, manufacturing and engineering jobs were created and sustained over the impact period through third\-party sales of integrated systems \[ **5.1**\]. As an example of how an Alphasense customer has benefitted from the OPCs, GRIMM Aerosol selected the OPC\-N3 for a new range of mid\-cost PM instruments after finding it outperformed competitor sensors; the company deployed the OPC\-N3 in a German government\-funded project to establish a smart air quality network in the city of Augsburg. Having long manufactured high\-end air quality monitoring reference and validation systems, the mid\-cost instrument means GRIMM has the capability to offer a fully integrated network comprising three tiers of instrumentation, increasing its market share and enabling urban authorities to widen their air quality sensor networks \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Supporting the establishment of air quality monitoring networks in major cities to address the health impacts of air pollution and better inform citizens** 

 In June 2014 the UN Environment Assembly, the world’s highest\-level decision\-making body on the environment, adopted a resolution to ‘strengthen the role of the UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\) in promoting air quality’. In September 2015, UNEP unveiled a low\-cost air quality monitoring device in September 2015, which the UN said could ‘ *revolutionise air quality measurement in developing countries and help prevent deaths from air pollution that claim seven million lives each year*’ \[ **5.4**\]. The incorporation of Alphasense’s OPC, based on UH’s research and patented technology, allowed the device to measure harmful particulate matter; its low cost ensured the device’s viability \[ **5.4**\]. UNEP’s Executive Director said its device cost $1,500 per unit, allowing governments to establish countrywide networks of monitoring stations for $150,000 \- $200,000 – less than the cost of just a single monitoring station \($250,000\) at that time \[ **5.4**\]. UNEP published the blueprint for its UNEP Air Quality Monitoring Unit, specifying the use of the OPC\-N2, ‘ *as a global public good*’ to ‘ *enable governments and organisations to purchase, assemble or fabricate the units themselves*’ \[ **5.4**\]. UNEP launched the Unit in Nairobi to map the city’s air pollution hotspots before deploying the system in 30 cities in developing countries \[ **5.4**\]. 

 City authorities around the world are using Alphasense’s OPCs via the purchase of integrated air quality monitoring systems, in which the OPC\-N3 is necessary to measure PM data \[ **5.1**\]. As an example, Chinese SME Shenzhen Cambri Environmental Technology purchased \~800 OPCs from Alphasense, integrated them into their own air quality monitoring instruments and supplied them to city authorities in three Chinese cities \(Shenzhen, pop. 12.5m; Dongguan, pop. 8.25m; Rizhao, pop. 2.8m\) for measuring hyperlocal air quality \[ **5.5**\]. Through the OPCs, environmental protection bureaus at these municipal governments can identify key sources of particulate emissions and enforce regulation where appropriate, e.g. if a factory is breaching emissions limits or operating without a license \[ **5.5**\]. Shenzen Cambri reports that the availability of the OPCs has facilitated the rapid growth of the company; since its formation in 2018 it has created 25 jobs \[ **5.5**\]. 

 In the US, Massachusetts\-based start\-up QuantAQ, a spin out from MIT, uses the OPC\-N3 in its integrated air quality monitoring system Modulair™\-PM \[ **5.6**\]. Example use cases \[ **5.6**\] include monitoring indoor air quality in Georgia Institute of Technology’s classrooms during the Covid\-19 pandemic to guide decisions around the resumption of in\-person teaching. The Modulair is being used at several airports \(e.g. Boston Logan International Airport\) to measure emissions and their impact on local communities; citizen\-led activist groups are collaborating on these projects. The US National Park Service is using it to monitor the impact of wildfires on air quality. 

 **Facilitating UN\-World Athletics collaboration to raise global awareness of air pollution, protect athletes’ health and study the impact of poor air quality on athletic performance** 

 In May 2018, World Athletics \(then IAAF\) announced a five\-year partnership with UNEP to install air quality monitoring systems at all of its 1,000 outdoor athletics tracks. The collaboration aims to study the correlation between poor air quality and athletic performance; to identify the best times for events to be held based on pollution levels; and to create greater global awareness of the wider importance of air quality monitoring. The IAAF awarded the contract for the provision of the air quality monitoring devices to Spain’s Kunak Technologies, a key customer of Alphasense. The first stadium air quality monitor \(using the OPC\-N3 to measure particulate matter\) was installed in Monaco in September 2018, providing real\-time, publicly available data. Monitors were then installed over an 18\-month period in Addis Ababa, Sydney, Mexico City and Yokohama \[ **5.7**\]. On launching the programme, the director of UNEP’s Global Environmental Monitoring System Unit said: *“The IAAF partnership provides practical insight into the use of low\-cost sensors, so it can be the first step to build capacity at city\-level networks, bringing together science for policy; using evidence\-based air quality assessments to develop better urban policies* \[ **5.7**\].” Air quality monitoring has since become a central element of World Athletics’ *Sustainability Strategy*, which pledges carbon neutrality by 2030. In August 2020 Kunak’s system captured air quality data along the Tokyo Olympic marathon course in Sapporo, a year ahead of the scheduled race itself \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Democratising access to air quality monitoring devices for civic activism on pollution** 

 The low cost of OPC technology has helped open up air monitoring to citizen\-led science projects designed to empower communities and pressure governments to act on air quality. US\-based Safecast describes itself as a global volunteer\-centred citizen science project working to empower people with data about their environments. Twenty of the organisation’s *Solarcast* air quality sensors, incorporating an Alphasense OPC\-N2, were deployed around Los Angeles in September 2017 \[ **5.8**\]. Three months later, when Southern California experienced serious forest fires, Safecast moved a number of these sensors “ *to help give people an idea of what they might be breathing and where to go to avoid increased exposure*”. The Arvin Air Quality Project is a citizen science project run by the Central California Environmental Justice Network across the city of Arvin which has some of the worst air pollution levels in the country. Having purchased air quality sensors from LA\-based technology company Valarm, which were built around the Alphasense OPC\-N2, the project deployed sensors across Arvin and real\-time data was published on a dedicated website \[ **5.8**\]. From 2018, the Open\-Seneca initiative deployed citizen science networks of low\-cost air quality sensors \(using Alphasense OPCs\) in Cambridge, Buenos Aires and Mendoza, Nairobi and Belo Horizonte. Local stakeholders have taken ownership of the sensor networks for long\-term sustainability \[ **5.8**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sheffield’s innovative research integrating tissue culture techniques with ocular surgery has led to a new treatment for blindness caused by ocular burns, called simple limbal epithelial transplant \(SLET\). To date 1,291 children and adults, across 14 countries in Asia, Europe, North and South America, have had their eyesight saved. SLET removes the need for dedicated clinical grade tissue culture facilities, results in improved patient outcomes and treatment accessibility, and a 90% reduction in treatment costs \(INR400m saved in India\). Furthermore, by providing new skills and treatment strategies to ophthalmologists, SLET has enabled them to treat more patients since August 2013 than with existing procedures over the past 20 years. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Limbal stem cells ensure the avascularity and transparency of the cornea whilst preventing conjunctival epithelium cells \(the white of the eye\) from growing over the cornea. Limbal stem cell deficiency \(LSCD\) involves dysfunction or loss of these stem cells, ultimately resulting in blindness. Chemical and thermal burns are a primary cause of LSCD. In the EU, this only occurs in 30 people per million; in developing countries this domestic and workplace hazard is far more common and, for example, is estimated to have affected 1.5 million adults and children in India. 

 Since the 1990’s, LSCD has been treated with conjunctival\-limbal autograft \(CLAU\) which is a simple procedure but has a high risk \(16%\) of eyesight loss in both healthy and damaged eyes, and cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation \(CLET\) which is more complex and expensive procedure \(a single European CLET treatment in costs £80,000 \+VAT\). 

 In 2003, research by Sheffield’s Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering research group, led by Professor Sheila MacNeil, investigated the treatment of skin burns and non\-healing wounds without the need to grow layers of epithelial cells. MacNeil showed that transferring sub\-confluent populations of keratinocytes using an acrylic acid coated silicone carrier dressing worked as well as culturing cells into a continuous stratified layer **\[R1\]**. The dressing was successfully commercialised \(MySkin\) and proved to be a simpler and more robust method for delivering patient's own skin cells from the laboratory to patients in the clinic **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Based on these insights and collaborating with India’s leading ophthalmology hospital, LV Prasad Eye Institute \(LVPEI\), MacNeil and Deshpande conducted research with synthetic alternatives to the human amniotic membrane used as a temporary dressing to deliver patient’s cultured limbal stem cells to the cornea **\[R4\]**. During this time, MacNeil questioned the need to culture the limbal stem cells in a laboratory and hypothesised the possible transplantation of small pieces of tissue from the healthy eye directly into the affected eye of unilateral LSCD sufferers **\[S3\]**. MacNeil’s prior experience of successfully translating the Sheffield skin repair research from the benchtop to the clinic now led to the development of a new approach to LSCD that essentially mitigated the risk of CLAU and the costs of CLET. 

 Working in close collaboration with LVPEI clinicians, MacNeil’s novel approach SLET was developed into a new surgical procedure. A tiny 4 mm² strip of limbal tissue is harvested from a patient’s healthy eye, subdivided into 8\-10 stem cell explants, and evenly distributed over an amniotic membrane. When placed onto the damaged ocular surface the cells grow into a continuous epithelium. This technique eliminated the need for *ex vivo* expansion and a second surgery associated with CLET, and it was quickly translated, by LVPEI, into a first\-in\-human trial \(6 patients\). Sight was restored within 42 days, with visual acuity improving from worse than 20/200 \(legally blind\) in all affected eyes to 20/60 \(near normal vision\) or better in four eyes.  These outcomes were comparable to CLET, but 2\-3 weeks faster and using half the theatre time **\[R5\]**. Figure 1 shows clinical photographs of a recipient’s eye before and after surgery.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sheffield’s research enabled the clinical uptake of a pioneering new treatment for blindness. SLET surmounts major socio\-economic and technical barriers associated with conventional techniques, increasing treatment accessibility for sufferers in developing countries. The World Health Organisation highlights that blindness causes removal from the workforce, deteriorating mental health, limited mobility, increased risk of accidents, and restricts child development. Restoring sight ameliorates these impacts for any individual and their dependants. 

 Chair of Regenerative Ophthalmology at the LVPEI in India stated *“This technique is now very much the standard of care in India. \[...\] The simplification of the technique has meant that it is more accessible to more centers and surgeons and hence more patients”* **\[S1\]**. The Director of the Ocular Surface Center at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in the USA commented, *“it can be done anywhere in the world as a same\-day surgery, you don’t need fancy instruments or ex vivo expansion in a lab”* **\[S2\]**. The Director of Innovation at Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital in New Delhi, India stated, *“there are less than 3 hospitals in India with established clean rooms suitable for CLET, whereas SLET is available to any hospital with trained surgeons”* **\[S3\]**. 

 Impact on the health and well\-being of people 

 Based on the enhanced clinical outcomes from the initial clinical study **\[R4\]** and the costs associated with CLET that limited patient access **\[S1**, **S3\]**, the LVPEI decided in 2013 to perform SLET instead of CLET **\[S1\]**. A recent review verified the enhanced outcomes with statistically significant higher anatomical success rates with SLET \(78%\) than CLET \(61%\) **\[S4\]**. 

 The LVPEI sees approximately 100 new patients every year **\[S5\]**. Importantly, new patients can be treated promptly with SLET, whereas when the LVPEI used CLET, the number of patients was limited to the number that the cell culture laboratory could handle. To date, LVPEI has undertaken more than 750 SLET treatments and the Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital has undertaken 70 SLET treatments **\[S1, S3\]**. 

 The international visibility of the success of SLET has led to its further uptake. SLET was voted the best limbal stem cell transplantation technique at the US ASCRS\-ASOA symposium in 2016 **\[S6\]**. A review of published clinical studies during the REF period reported outcomes for 92 patients in 13 additional countries spanning Europe \(the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Turkey, and Russia\), North America \(USA, Mexico, and Canada\), South America \(Brazil\), and Asia \(Thailand, China, and Japan\) **\[S7\]**. In a 2020, blind survey of the Ocular Surface group of ophthalmologists and the Kera\-net group, 135 different respondents from 17 countries reported a total of 1,291 SLET procedures, which was equivalent to the number of CLET and CLAU procedures combined \(172 and 1,134 respectively\) **\[S8\]**. 

 Economic impact 

 The research has enabled substantial cost savings for healthcare providers and patients. In India, cost is a major determinant of access to a treatment and costs are ultimately borne by the charity of the hospital **\[S3\]**. Table 1 summarises per patient total treatment costs of CLET and SLET at the LVPEI in 2020 **\[S1\]**. 

|| Total treatment cost | SLET cost saving per patient |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|| CLET \(INR\) | SLET \(INR\) | \(INR\) | % | \(GBP\) |
| Adult | 533,184 | 53,518 | 479,666 | 90% | 4,931 |
| Children | 564,337 | 69,136 | 495,201 | 88% | 5,091 |
| Average | 548,761 | 61,327 | 487,434 | 89% | 5,011 |

 *Table 1. Total treatment costs and saved costs per patient at the LVPEI for CLET and SLET. \(INR97=GBP1\)* 

 By adopting SLET over CLET, the LVPEI operating budget saves approximately INR49m annually, allowing more patients to receive treatment. Over the REF period, the application of Sheffield’s research has allowed the LVPEI and Dr Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital to realise combined savings of INR400m for the 820 patients they have treated. 

 Impact on healthcare practitioners 

 LVPEI’s active dissemination of the research via collaborative working, publications and presentations at meetings, and the provision of five annual international training workshops in India and Sweden \(2015\-2020\) has led to the uptake of the SLET procedure and enhanced the knowledge, expertise, and skills of clinicians **\[S9, S1, S3\]**. According to the results of the aforementioned survey **\[S8\]**, over 95% of surgeons were confident using SLET and commented that it is convenient, cost effective, efficient, reliable, and reproducible; 93% of surgeons stated that they preferred SLET over the CLET.  In addition, only 8% of the surgeons had access to the specialist facilities required for CLET. SLET has overtaken CLET as the preferred treatment for LSCD and helped more patients in the 7\-year REF period than CLET has in the past 20 years. 

 Overall, the global adoption of SLET has led to the restoration of eyesight of over 1,291 adults and children, with better clinical outcomes than traditional techniques, and at a 90% cost saving, ensuring broader access to treatment. It has influenced the practice of healthcare practitioners in 14 countries worldwide.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2006, researchers at the University of South Wales \(USW\) have conducted research that examines geographical variations in accessibility to a range of public and private services. This research has **1\)** supported activities of the Welsh Government, providing the evidential base that guided the selection of areas used to pilot their new childcare provision policy **2\)** prompted an on\-going evaluation into the use of these tools for calculating future Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation scores used to allocate programme funds across Wales **3\)** supplied National Sports Bodies such as Welsh Gymnastics, and the charitable organisation Tenovus Cancer Care, previously unobtainable levels of detail on revealed patterns of accessibility to current and future configurations of service delivery points.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2006, research conducted at the University of South Wales \(USW\) has focussed on enhancing small area accessibility estimation models in order to examine geographical variation in a range of public and private services. This was driven by a need to understand spatial and social inequalities in the provision of essential services and suggest ways in which this can be more accurately measured and monitored. From 2010, this has involved the incorporation of transport barriers and service competition initially using proprietary \(ArcGIS<sup>TM</sup>\) and latterly open source \(QGIS, PostGIS\) Geographical Information System \(GIS\) tools. Building on research originally concerned with varying the types of demand\- and supply\-side measures used within accessibility models, we conducted sensitivity analysis on the implications of using alternative approaches based around dasymetric population estimation models \( **R1**\). Much of this research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) under Phase 1 \(2009\-2013\) of the Wales Institute of Socio\-economic Research Data and Methods \(WISERD\) initiative: a multi\-university, cross\-disciplinary institute involving Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, South Wales and Swansea universities. Researchers in USW have developed innovative GIS approaches to aid further understanding of spatial variations in the social and economic geography of Wales. Initially this involved the application of accessibility models to a wide range of facility types, such as post offices, health facilities and public libraries, to examine the impacts of changes in network configuration at the national level since 2010 \( **R2**\). 

  

 Current models are traditionally based on assumptions of access to private transport – our research has for the first\-time created techniques to also consider public transit systems leading to multi\-modal approaches to determining access \( **R3**\). Utilising public web services reporting transport timetables across the UK, this research has extended ‘floating catchment area’ \(FCA\) methodology based on gravity model approaches to consider the implications of calculating access to facilities using enhancements to ‘traditional’ FCA approaches. Subsequently, research funded by Sport Wales in 2015, involved incorporating such enhancements within bespoke Add\-In tools developed for ESRI’s ArcGIS<sup>TM</sup> Desktop GIS. This has been used by both the Welsh Government and Sports Governing Bodies in Wales to gather evidence regarding the most appropriate places to allocate funding to sporting infrastructure. Follow\-up funded research commissioned by the Welsh Government in 2017 updated findings with a new database of sport facilities collected on behalf of Sport Wales which enabled a longitudinal study of changing patterns in provision. The use of these tools has been subsequently extended to consider primary health care services, allowing a multi\-modal examination of spatial variations in access to GP practices \( **R4**\). 

 Research conducted in the Second Phase of the ESRC\-funded WISERD Civil Society \(2015\-2019\) initiative investigated the potential for incorporating extensions to the basic FCA approach to measure spatial accessibility within UK government policy\-relevant indices of deprivation \(using the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation \(WIMD\) as a case study\). The WIMD is the official measure of deprivation used to rank Lower Super Output Areas \(LSOAs\) according to their relative deprivation levels, across eight types of deprivation to produce an overall index. It is used to inform policymaking, allocate resources, and plan levels of service provision at local level and is updated every four to five years. Our research, in relation to the 2014 version of WIMD, contributed to on\-going methodological debates surrounding its construction and has demonstrated how adopting alternative computational approaches might impact on those communities identified as the ‘most deprived’ \( **R5**\). This in turn has implications for place\-based funding mechanisms targeted at particular areas. The models developed permit the inclusion of potentially more sophisticated approaches to measuring access to services than those currently adopted which rely on simple proximity or service density approaches \( **R5**\). In another applied study, research was funded in 2017 by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales \(CSSIW\) in relation to a Welsh Government ‘flagship policy’ regarding free childcare. This applied USW\-developed accessibility tools and models to provide enhanced insights into the existing availability of childcare services. Previously very little was known about detailed geographical patterns of childcare provision in Wales. Our research accounted for supply\-side factors \(such as total opening hours of centres\), and demand \(the distribution of working families with children in the appropriate age groups\), and both were moderated by the impacts of distance. We investigated variations in childcare capacity across Wales in relation to the Welsh Government pledge \(2017\) to provide 30 hours\-a\-week free early education and childcare for working parents of three and four\-year\-olds \( **R6**\). To understand patterns in the availability and accessibility of existing childcare capacity in Wales, detailed modelling was undertaken to create, for the first time, maps revealing childcare provision at highly detailed spatial scales \( **R6**\). 

 Most recently these models have been extended to operate in open\-source GIS environments, initially through a Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship \(KESS\) PhD studentship with Tenovus Cancer Care \(2016\-2019\) and subsequently a similarly funded studentship with Sport Wales \(2018\-2021\). These projects have led to the further development of tools and support materials to measure geographical accessibility to cancer screening and support services using QGIS/PostGIS. It also resulted in the analysis of recreational opportunities within a client\-server architecture that allows both model building and results dissemination to take place remotely via a web browser interface.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Through the application of network\-based GIS tools developed by USW researchers, policy officers within the Welsh Government, Welsh Gymnastics, Sport Wales and Tenovus Cancer Care have been able to strategically plan their activities to better support the delivery of the services they provide. The following projects have been funded by the ESRC through WISERD unless otherwise stated: 

 **USW research informed the Welsh Governments’ policy on Childcare Offer for Wales.** 

 **R6** informed the decision\-making process regarding the implementation of the policy and guided the selection of initial pilot areas. Findings that were obtained using our modelling were published in a Welsh Government report that mapped childcare supply across Wales in relation to potential demand by calculating the number of children \(aged under 4\) within a reasonable travel distance of registered childcare settings against mid\-year population estimates \( **S1**\). This provided the Welsh Government with a sound evidential base for childcare policy making in Wales – for example where the research identified insufficient childcare, this was used by the Welsh Government to evaluate whether parents are able to easily find suitable local childcare \( **S2\)**. This also gained widespread public interest and media attention in Wales; for example, it was featured on the BBC News Website in November 2017 \( **S3**\). The Head of Policy Analysis for the Childcare Offer in the Welsh Government \( **S4**\) stated that GIS\-based analyses: *“have been of value to Welsh Government in providing a real contribution to the evidence base for childcare policy making in Wales. The identification of areas across Wales which have a lack of childcare supply against potential demand has enabled Welsh Government to focus some of the early implementation areas of the childcare offer for Wales to test whether this is experienced by parents on the ground. In participating areas where there this work has identified insufficient childcare; Welsh Government will evaluate whether parents are able to easily find suitable local childcare. The work has raised further research questions for the childcare policy team to consider in terms of what drives this mismatch in supply and demand and whether stimulation of the sector is required to increase childcare capacity in those areas. The maps have been useful to present to stakeholders in gaining recognition of the variance in childcare supply across Wales and the subsequent issues the Childcare Offer for Wales may face during implementation.”* 

 **Policy discussions around accessibility to sporting facilities in Wales were influenced by USW research.** 

 Software tools developed by USW researchers have been used by National Sporting Bodies such as Welsh Gymnastics/Gymnasteg Cymru since 2015 \( **S5**\). This is the national governing body for gymnastics with a membership of over 20,000 and with 97 affiliated clubs caters to 60000 7\-16 years old participating in gymnastics in Wales. The use of our GIS tools has provided greater insight into current and projected levels of provision and enabled them to assemble a detailed evidence base upon which to base policy implementation at localised scales. As a result of our accessibility research, such bodies are now using information regarding spatial patterns of provision in gymnastics facilities to inform their facilities management strategy. They also have used it to better understand social inequalities in access amongst population groups that traditionally have had poor levels of engagement in recreational activities. Presentations have been made in 2018 and 2019 to the Governing Body of Welsh Gymnastics based on our accessibility research. This enabled them to understand the use of facilities and current gaps in provision for those social groups, including ethnic minority communities in urban areas of Wales, at a perceived disadvantage in accessing gymnastic facilities as well as for those ‘elite’ athletes aiming to participate in international sporting events such as the Commonwealth Games. Sport Wales, the national body responsible for developing and promoting sport and physical activity in Wales and the main adviser to the Welsh Government on sport, used \(and continues to use\) this tool to help decide where public sector funding should be invested to deliver the greatest benefit to local communities \( **S6**\). As these tools become more widely available, there is also the potential for further collaboration between organisations charged with promoting sports participation and those concerned with health. 

 **USW research influenced public policy debate on the use of alternative approaches to incorporate accessibility within the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation.** 

 The methods we developed on our research using WIMD \( **R5**\) were included in consultation documents published by the Welsh Government \(WG\) that considered alternative approaches to updating the 2019 version of WIMD \( **S7**\). The Social Justice Statistician with responsibility for the construction of the WIMD \( **S8**\) said that this *“research prompted debate about the role of alternative supply\-demand network\-based GIS approaches amongst Welsh Government officials and others in the Access to Services Domain expert group in the lead up to the implementation of WIMD 2019. The published journal paper and a presentation from the WISERD team to the expert group led to a wider appreciation of the impact of adopting such models within the WIMD methodology*.” Our research has shown how different transportation modes can be incorporated into FCA based accessibility models using a wider range of services. The Social Justice Statistician \( **S8**\) added that based on these refinements of the approach for assessing service accessibility *“there was strong support for continuing to explore this method for potential use in future indices, including the production of a parallel set of outputs using the 2SFCA method following WIMD 2019. WG officials responsible for producing WIMD are keen to continue working with the WISERD team on the above, to enable us to assess the implications of adopting an alternative approach on future Access to Services domain data for future editions of WIMD. The potential impact of this would be better quality data for the Access to Services domain of WIMD, through service access figures that takes into consideration the geographical distribution of all supply sites found within a reasonable travel time/distance. WIMD has a wide range of uses across many sectors to inform research, service provision and funding.”* 

 **USW research provided valuable insight to policies geared to optimising local provision of cancer care services in the Welsh community.** 

 This study commenced in October 2016 and has developed open source tools and support materials to measure geographical accessibility to screening and cancer support services in Wales. Previously, Tenovus Cancer Care, a cancer charity that supports cancer patients and their families and the biggest Wales\-based funder of cancer research with a staff of around 200 and over 2000 volunteers, had not considered GIS approaches to optimise the locations of their cancer services. Our models have enabled important insights into how their two Mobile Treatment Units can best be used to support the capacity already provided at fixed locations where patients receive treatment. This allowed the research team in Tenovus Cancer Care to investigate the impact of alternative spatial configurations of cancer services to enable more patients to be treated closer to home. This creates maximum reach and impact as well as alleviates the pressure of travel for those who must journey to and from a cancer treatment facility. The Director of Research and Support at Tenovus Cancer Care \( **S9\)** stated that: *“With the numbers of people being diagnosed with cancer and so requiring treatment rising year on year, the work conducted, particularly the GIS maps produced, are giving us some really important insights into how the Tenovus Mobile Treatment Units can be used to help alleviate capacity in fixed locations where people receive treatment.”*
