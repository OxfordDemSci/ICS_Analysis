###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There are still more than 144,000 disappeared victims of Franco’s repression, second only to Cambodia according to the UN. However, due to the pervading ‘pact of silence’ agreed in Spain, they are virtually ignored by the Spanish state, and there is no official support for processes of repair and reparation. Dr Ruth Sanz Sabido’s research on cultural memory and the Spanish Civil War has: 

-  Given victims and their families across Spain a platform to express their experiences and present and preserve their narratives; 

-  Raised awareness of the victims’ experiences, bringing their narratives to audiences in Spain, Mexico and the UK, challenging state\-sponsored versions of history; 

-  Established a local movement in Arroyomolinos de León \(Andalucía\), dedicated to exploring the past, including locating and exhuming a mass grave highlighted by the research.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Following the Spanish Civil War \(1936\-39\), the repressive measures imposed during Franco’s dictatorship immersed Spain in a spiral of fear and silence that continued long after the dictator's death in 1975. The ‘pact of silence’ that was observed during the transition to democracy through the 1977 Amnesty Law \(still in force today\) committed everyone to ‘forgive and forget’, advancing the idea that ‘the three\-year conflict was an unavoidable fratricidal struggle in which both sides committed all types of aberrations, equally and on the same level’ **\[3.1\]**. Sanz Sabido’s research argues that this transitional strategy became integral to the official state\-sponsored stance and to dominant cultural discourse, which normalised the reference to the ‘Civil War’ as a war that was waged across the country, omitting the fact that this was, to begin with, a fascist military coup. In turn, this simplistic view promotes ‘the suggestion that nobody in particular should be made responsible for the consequences’ **\[3.1\]**. As a result, perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, torture, expropriations, forced labour and the theft of babies walked free to live side\-by\-side with their victims, who remained silent and in fear for decades. 

 Drawing from Memory Studies, Orality and Critical Ethnography, Sanz Sabido developed and applied a theoretical and methodological framework, ‘Critical Ethnography of Memory’, to break this silence by recovering the subjugated, ‘local memories’ of the conflict, as remembered by those who experienced it. Comparing these suppressed narratives to dominant discourses, the framework offers a counter\-mechanism to the ‘perpetual erasure of the memory of the defeated’ by articulating the experiences of people who would otherwise remain inarticulate **\[3.1\] \[3.2\].** Sanz Sabido applied this framework to one rural Spanish community, Arroyomolinos de León \(Andalucía\). The research draws insights from the collection and analysis of longitudinal ethnographic data with 22 participants involving multiple interviews during eight fieldwork trips over a three\-year period \(2013\-2016\). Access was also gained to a local archive to examine thousands of historical files documenting over 40 years of local practices and culture. The analysis unearthed previously marginalised voices and events that took place in this community in the 1930s and early 1940s, and evidenced that the expression of memory was an important site of socio\-political struggle. Through investigating the interplay between local and national levels of memory, Sanz Sabido found that the lived experiences in this community did not correspond with those promoted by the official ‘Civil War’ discourse, highlighting the importance of the local context. A key finding was that, in fact, 'there was no war’ in this village, only fascist repression. The local context was also shown to be pivotal in the levels of these repressive practices, which varied between communities. For example, while thousands of women were killed across the country, in this community the eight women who had been sentenced to death were eventually pardoned. Nevertheless, local women were subjected to other forms of repressive practices that remained silenced for decades. The research also found that, while the anti\-fascist side did not kill anyone, the fascists executed more than 40 men, 18 of whom are still buried in a mass grave in a neighbouring village \(Cala\) **\[3.1\] \[3.2\]**. 

 Following this detailed critical ethnographic study, Sanz Sabido developed a more in\-depth understanding of the multiplicity of local experiences by extending her approach to localities across Spain, revealing a wider range of hidden narratives and silenced voices. This resulted in the development of an online archive and documentary film, both known as *Herencias del 36* \(Legacies of 1936\) **\[3.3\] \[3.4\]**. To develop the documentary, 60 interviews were conducted with victims, victims’ relatives and volunteers in A Coruña, A Fonsagrada, Ponferrada, Astorga, Valderas, Salamanca, Madrid, Barcelona and Seville. Collectively, the publications, archive and film include contributions from nearly 70 Spanish villages, towns and cities. Underpinned by ‘Critical Ethnography of Memory’, these outputs demonstrate that the Spanish Civil War was not a monolithic event characterised by a simplistic ‘Civil War’ narrative and provide a counter\-mechanism to resist the imposition of the victors’ history. A development of this research is ‘Remembering what we have not lived: Postmemory Analysis of Franco's violence in Spain’ \(Sanz Sabido\), supported by a British Academy/Leverhulme Small Grant. This project analyses how we remember trauma and conflict when we have not directly experienced it, and the role of the media in the representation and dissemination of contentious pasts.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Sanz Sabido’s application of her Critical Ethnography of Memory to the lived experiences of the Spanish Civil War has benefitted the victims of Francoist repression and their families, giving them a platform to express previously repressed memories and preserving and presenting these narratives. It has brought these memories to audiences in Spain, Mexico and the UK, allowing individuals to add their voice to counter\-narratives of state\-sponsored versions of events. It resulted in significant changes in the way the community and local administration of Arroyomolinos de León, Andalucía \(population c.1,000\) addressed the legacies of the conflict, galvanising them into collective action to explore and address the past. This included the establishment of a movement dedicated to the location and exhumation of a mass grave, which featured in all narratives uncovered in the village **\[3.1\]**. Sanz Sabido’s research has resulted in this community recovering the ‘memory of our village’ and allowed them to ‘repair the damage, recover the dignity and do justice’ \[Translated from Spanish\] **\[5.1\]**. Impact was realised through individual participation in the research, engagement with the media, and dissemination of *Herencias del 36*. 

 **Victims have been given a platform to express their previously silenced stories and to preserve and present their experiences, and contribute to narratives of the Spanish Civil War**. The archive created by Sanz Sabido includes 142 contributions from across 68 villages/towns/cities and 5 war battles, including text\-based submission, photographs, videos, and letters, alongside clips from the 60 interviews undertaken for the documentary. The preservation of these stories is time critical, with many who lived through the conflict now being deceased. *Herencias del 36* has given victims an opportunity to express themselves in ways that they had not previously been able to, and had not known how to. In many cases, this was the first time individuals had talked to anyone about their experiences of the war and subsequent repression. Sol Gómez Arteaga, who contributed to the archive and whose father’s story was told in the documentary, writes: ‘Every act of Memory is always an act of reparation, and the possibility of providing details in a documentary such as *Herencias del 36* is undoubtedly one such act. \[…\] I have the firm belief that it is essential that everyone can get to know what happened, because this will open the road to the justice and reparation that have been denied for so long.’ \[Translated from Spanish\] **\[5.2\].** Paqui Maqueda, President of the Memory Association ‘Nuestra Memoria’, writes in relation to impact on individuals contributing to the archive: ‘This work gives them the opportunity to describe, out loud, the extent of the horror they suffered after they lost their loved ones, but it also gives them the opportunity to make them present, to make them visible, to declare that they have not forgotten them, that their memory is still present’ \[Translated from Spanish\] **\[5.3\].** 

 Memory Associations exist across Spain in response to the state’s failure to address the consequences of Franco’s repression, campaigning for official state recognition and support for programmes of exhumation and identification. These associations have been an integral part of *Herencias del 36*, arranging screenings of the documentary, putting victims and relatives in contact with Sanz Sabido, and communicating information about the project. Associations involved in the development of the film and archive include the national association ARMH \(Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory\), ARMH\-C in Barcelona, Asociación Salamanca Memoria y Justicia, Todos los Nombres, Nuestra Memoria \(Andalucía\) and Memoria Democrática de Andalucía in Seville. Additionally, the International Brigades Memorial Trust has also contributed to the archive. Commenting on the wider significance of *Herencias del 36*, Paqui Maqueda, President of the Memory Association Nuestra Memoria, writes: ‘This documentary is a beautiful and resounding narrative \[…\] to support the struggle of relatives and memory associations. \[…\] At times like the ones we are currently living in Europe, where fascism is once again advancing fast \[…\] documentaries like *Herencias del 36* are necessary, essential tools in the anti\-fascist struggle.’ \[Translated from Spanish\] **\[5.3\]** 

 **Raising awareness of the victims’ experiences and challenging state\-sponsored versions of the history of the Spanish Civil War.** The project has received coverage in the Spanish media in articles highlighting victims’ stories and discussing the consequences of the 1977 Amnesty Law and the lack of state support for repair and reparation. There has been coverage in *La Marea* \(18 Jul 2016 – monthly circulation c.18,000\); *El Español* \(18 Jul 2016 – c.11,000 paying subscribers\); *La Opinión A Coruña* \(17 Jul 2016 – c.580,000 unique user per month\); and *Andaluces Diario* \(1 Jun and 19 Jul 2019\). *El Español* published the story of Miguel Galán, the first testimony added to the archive and suggested to the journalist by Sanz Sabido **\[5.4\]**. Ongoing interest is demonstrated by an article published in *Astorga Redacción* \(30 Aug 2019\), which references the documentary and quotes one of the participants **\[5.4\]**. The documentary has been screened 7 times \(between 2017 and 2019\), in 5 locations in Spain \(often hosted by Memory Associations\) and in London at the Human Rights Action Centre \(2019\), to total audiences estimated to be in the region of 300. Significantly extending its reach, in 2020 it was selected for the Human Rights section of the Hispanic\-American film festival Contra El Silencio Todas las Voces \(Mexico City\). Originally scheduled for May 2020, and postponed until Sept 2020 due to COVID 19, *Herencias del 36* was broadcast on Mexican national public network Channel 14 \(20 Sept 2020\) which has an average monthly net reach of over 16,000,000. In 2020 it was also selected for the international FICNOVA Film Festival, an initiative commemorating the United Nation’s International Day of Nonviolence, and shown at the Espiello International Festival of Ethnographic Documentary \(Huesca, Spain\) as part of their Historic Memory cycle **\[5.5\].** 

 Feedback collated at screenings demonstrates enhanced awareness of the history and the victims’ experiences and recognition of the need to support processes of justice and reparation. The importance of the narratives to wider society is also recognised, with feedback including references to learning from this past. Comments include: 

 ‘Cathartic for the participants \[…\] important that people can establish what happened’. 

 ‘It was a very powerful film, especially because of the direct testimony. I didn’t realise that there is a lack of central government funding’. 

 ‘It showed that by discovering memories of the horrors of the Spanish Civil War, people can find some form of closure. Such films help remind people that fascism can easily rise again in a seemingly static democracy’. 

 ‘I was unaware of much of this history before seeing the film. It is so important to hear this story as we all need to learn from this appalling and tragic history, so as not to repeat it.’ 

 ‘I consider it therapy. For them and for all of us’. 

 ‘It is important to make this known by everyone. Associations need to work together to reach objectives and put pressure on institutions and politicians, so this is taught in schools’. **\[5.6\]** 

 **Significant changes in the way the community and local administration of Arroyomolinos de León addressed the legacies of the conflict.** Coverage of Sanz Sabido’s research in the Spanish media brought it to the attention of the local administration in the village. Ensuing interest resulted in the local council organising *Jornadas de Memoria Histórica* in Arroyomolinos de León *,* a two\-day public event on Historical Memory. These events have been held every year since 2017, with the exception of 2020 due to COVID\-19 **\[5.7a\]**, with Sanz Sabido attending in 2017 and 2018. Attended by around 50 people annually, they bring together victims and their families with local and regional politicians and representatives from memory associations. They include sessions replicating the ethos of *Herencias del 36*, where attendees can share their life stories in a public safe space, coming together for individual and collective healing. The local administration commented after the first event: ‘If you had to look for words to define what was lived yesterday, it would be those of emotion, feelings, relief, freedom, rest, gratitude’ \[Translated from Spanish\] **\[5.7b\]**. A further indication of the significance of these events in the region is the coverage received in the local press, with the second event being reported on in *Huelva Red* \(10 Aug 2018\); *Huelvahoy.com* \(9 Aug 2018\); *Diario de Huelva* \(9 Aug 2018\); *Onub Actual* \(9 Aug 2018\); and *La Vanguardia*, *Andalusia* \(9 Aug 2018\) **\[5.7c\].** 

 These events prompted the local administration, in cooperation with the provincial and regional governments, to explore the possibility of locating and exhuming one of the mass graves Sanz Sabido’s research highlighted \(Cala’s 18\), **\[3.1\]** **\[3.2\]** which resulted in a dedicated movement to this end. On the UN International Day of Enforced Disappearance \(30 Aug 2017\) the President of Huelva Provincial Council met with the families of the victims to give the Council’s support for the exhumation and formal identification of Cala’s 18 victims. At this meeting, the Mayor of Arroyomolinos said it was time ‘to give voice to all who suffered’ and that they owed it to their ‘ancestors and to the history of the village.’ **\[5.8a\]** In October 2018, the Junta de Andalucía \(regional government\) issued the legal instructions to commence the process of locating, exhuming and identifying the victims of the Cala’s 18 grave **\[5.9\]** with work formally beginning in November 2018 **\[5.8b\]**. Arroyomolinos de Leon’s Councillor for Culture writes that Sanz Sabido’s research ‘was key in the creation of the first Jornadas de Memoria Histórica in Arroyomolinos de León, which became the starting point for the ensuing Jornadas and all the work that has been conducted to locate the mass grave in the cemetery of Cala \[…\] The first public event attracted the attention of Andalusian authorities, and this made their commitment to help the relatives stronger, leading to the beginning of the process to find and exhume the mass grave \[…\] We want to thank Ruth Sanz Sabido for her interest and work, without which it would not have been possible to do what we have done to recover the memory of our village, repair the damage, recover the dignity and do justice.’ **\[5.1\]** \[Translated from Spanish\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The findings and recommendations from our research into collaboration and adoption of innovation in small agri\-food businesses have directly impacted on the content and development of food policy and strategy within Northern Ireland and across Europe. Our research recommendations have been adopted by policy makers in Bulgaria and Norway, leading to new measures in regional development strategies that have directly enhanced the innovation capacity of micro size agri\-food producers \(i.e. less than 10 employees\) **\(I1\)**. Within Northern Ireland our research has directly led to the inclusion of measures on inter\-firm cooperation into the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs \(DAERA\) Rural Development Programme **\(I2\)**.  Recommendations for a more co\-ordinated multi\-actor approach have been embedded within Northern Ireland’s Food Strategy Framework and our research has directly led to the formulation of a “Model Local Food Policy” for Northern Ireland councils **\(I3\)**. 
","
 **2.  Underpinning Research** 

 The case study refers to a body of related research projects since the early 2000s employing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to address innovation and networks in small businesses and more recently those within the agri\-food sector. 

 The valuable contribution that small enterprises \(producers\) make within rural and peripheral regions to local food production has been widely acknowledged. The food sector generally is associated with incremental forms of innovation \(for example product adaptations rather than new products to the market\) and characterised by barriers to innovation, which include limited resources for R&D, and a lack of engagement with support agencies.  Growing attention has been paid in the rural studies literature to “alternative food networks” and “short supply chains”, where the production and consumption of food are more closely connected, for instance through farmers’ markets and other sales channels outside the conventional supermarket model. The importance of network building within this context has been highlighted: networks involving government support agencies and third level institutions are critical to sustainable rural development. However there has been relatively little research into how food producers engage with, and benefit from, networks for innovation and particularly the nature of relations between producers and support agencies; our research projects addressed this gap. The overall aim of the research was to explore how small firms innovate and how innovation may be supported by government and other public agency networks, in an agri\-food context. Thus the research had a strong industry and practitioner focus. 

 Early work by McAdam \(2004\) identified the need for network development in order to enhance innovative practice within small firms in peripheral locations such as Northern Ireland **\(R1\)**. This theme was later developed by McKitterick, Quinn, McAdam and Dunn \(2016\) in their research into innovation network development in the context of small food enterprises **\(R6\)**. 

 McAdam \(2013\) argued that developing radical innovation in terms of new products/services within small firms in peripheral regions would need further policy and support intervention. This is due to innate SME limitations, such as lack of resources and skills, which are further limited by locational factors **\(R2\)**. Nonetheless, a further study by McKitterick, Quinn, McAdam, and Dunn \(2016\) challenged existing assumptions on the nature of innovation in micro size agri\-food businesses by identifying radical forms of innovation in practice, for instance new products in categories such as craft cider, baked goods and cheeses **\(R6\)**. This study found that relationships with informal networks such as family and friends, international sources and other businesses, rather than formal Government support networks, were instrumental in delivering innovation outputs in the form of new products. Informal business connections between micro food producers can emerge out of formal business support programmes and can be instigated by the participants or the business support advisors. While the research raised questions about the effectiveness of Government support for regional innovation, insight was provided into the critical role played by Government in fostering social capital and knowledge exchange and in acting as a bridge to informal networks. 

 A theme across a number of the underpinning research studies is the policy challenge in providing tailored and targeted support rather than generalised training and development \( **R1, R3, R4, R5, R6**\).  McAdam and Dunn \(2014\) identified the need to target support programmes according to the life cycle stage of the agri\-food SME network **\(R3** and **R5\).** Quinn, McKitterick, McAdam and Dunn \(2014\) recommended that tailored support would be needed to address the specialist needs of specific food categories such as artisan cheese **\(R4\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 A summary of the evidence of impacts and indicators is provided in Table 1 at the end of this section.  In Table 1, and in the text that follows, case letters and numbers in bold refer to evidence in Section 5. The **reach** of the impacts was evident through the direct influence our research has had on the development of economic policy at local, regional and international levels. The **significance** of the impacts, or how much difference our research has made to beneficiaries, is now outlined. 

 **I1 – European Regional Development Strategies** 

 Our research insights have had a significant impact upon policy development and stakeholder engagement across European regions, leading to changes in products and processes. Our earlier research on innovation in small firms \( **R1** and **R2**\) informed our work with European local authority partners through the INTERREG IVC LOCFOOD project \(2012\-2014\). From this project we identified best practices across 12 European regions: Northern Ireland; Valencia \(Spain\); Sofia \(Bulgaria\); Nordland \(Norway\); Litija and Kranj \(Slovenia\); Canton of Jura \(Switzerland\); Örebro and Västerbotten \(Sweden\); West Macedonia \(Greece\); Marche and Rimini \(Italy\) **\(C10\)**. These best practices were exchanged at a conference and series of policy\-maker workshops we co\-organised \(with Down District Council\) at Ballynahinch \(Northern Ireland\) in June 2014 to engage directly with policy makers at local and regional government levels **\(C3, C10\)**. The conference \(entitled “Making Small Producers Part of the Bigger Picture”\) was attended by 64 industry stakeholders including politicians, local authority representatives \(from Northern Ireland, Norway, Greece, Slovenia, and Sweden\), food businesses, trade associations and policy makers from Northern Ireland’s government departments **\(C10\)**. 

 Leading on from this conference, the research findings and recommendations from the LOCFOOD project \( **R4** and **R6\)** have had a transformative impact upon policy development and stakeholder engagement. As examples, two of the  regions, Sofia \(Bulgaria\) and Nordland \(Norway\), are presented in more detail. 

 We provided an evidence base for the Euro Perspectives Foundation \(EPF\) to support its policy development role for innovation and economic development within Sofia and at the national level more widely. Within the Sofia region our recommendations to EPF from the research and the best practice conference and workshops **\(C10\)** directly led to: 

-  the development of a short supply chain business model for small food producers through the establishment of farmers’ markets in Sofia **\(C1\)**. 

-  the development of measures on innovation in the food chain as part of the Regional Development Strategy \(2014\-2020\) **\(C1, C6\)**. 

-  new product development and business development opportunities for micro size food producers **\(C1, C6\)**. 

 By 2017, the Bulgarian short supply chain business \(farmers’ markets\) model for small food producers provided market access and increased sales for 25 small food businesses through direct access to consumers **\(C1\)**.  Within the same timeframe, our research findings informed the development of measures on innovation in the food chain within Sofia’s regional development strategy \(“District Strategy for Development of Sofia Region 2014\-2020”\). This led directly to transformational changes through the introduction of new products/processes in 42 small food businesses **\(C1, C6\),** including for example the organic production of goji berries. 

 In addition, in Norway we collaborated with Nordland County Council \(NCC\), the second largest of Norway’s 19 counties. The research recommendations contributed to the development of a new regional strategy for local food within Nordland \(“Strategy for Tourism and Experience Industries in Nordland 2017\-2021”\) **\(C2, C7\)**. NCC’s Deputy Director of Economic Development stated that: *“The direction and knowledge provided by Professor Quinn and his colleagues at Ulster University contributed vital input to NCC regional plans”* **\(C2\).** As a direct result of our research, NCC adopted our recommendation that a single organisation should co\-ordinate and manage information across the supply chain to improve communication and develop a better understanding of the industry: “ *One of the best examples of initiatives we see as a result from the LOCFOOD project in Nordland is a stronger connection between the three main public organisation\(s\) – Nordland County Council, Innovation Norway and the County Governor of Nordland… The need for a joint working group has proven to be of vital importance in this process”* \(email correspondence with NCC’s Industry and Development Manager, **C7**\) **.** The direct impact of our research recommendations in Norway is also evident at firm level in that the research provided direction for project support to approximately 100 businesses within the Nordland region **\(C2\).** Therefore, within both regions our research findings have directly led to the development of projects to stimulate the local food sector and have stimulated stakeholder activity.  As such the research has had a significant impact on the development of European regional food strategies. 

 **I2 – Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme** 

 There has been a clear impact at a regional level through government \(DAERA\) support for micro size food producers where, specifically, our research evidence \( **R3, R4, R5, R6\)** informed the development of the 2014\-2020 Rural Development Programme \(RDP\) and the Agri\-food Co\-operation Scheme **\(C3, C4, C8\)**. In particular **R5** and **R6** identified the need for intermediary organisations such as regional government agencies to stimulate innovation and assist collaboration between small \(micro size\) food businesses **\(C3\)**. Critically, at the “Making Small Producers Part of the Bigger Picture” conference and workshops in June 2014, the LOCFOOD project \(2012\-2014\), led by Professor Quinn, provided examples of best practices of cooperative activity in 11 other European regions that subsequently supported the establishment and strengthening of supply chains through collaboration **\(C4\)**. The conference was attended by DAERA policy makers who took part in the policy development workshops **\(C10\).** The best practices exchanged at the conference **\(C10\)** informed DAERA policy makers on their development of the Rural Development Programme, and specifically the content of a new policy measure on Agri\-Food Co\-operation \(Measure 16 \- Co\-operation, sub measures 16.3 and 16.4, **C8**\). The research was key in identifying micro firm cooperation as an area requiring support “ *as previously there was little evidence in this area and the best practices have helped in* *defining the types of projects that might be delivered”* \(email correspondence with DAERA Agri\-Food Policy Advisor, **C8**\). This has been supported by a testimonial from DAERA’s Assistant Director, Sustainable Agri\-Food Policy where she states that our research expertise has been utilised to provide *“a valuable source of evidence in support of the policy development process, both in defining the need for enhanced cooperation among micro businesses and identifying the benefits of co\-operation and shared resources. In addition, it has provided examples of co\-operative activity in other regions that has supported the establishment and strengthening of supply chains through collaboration”* **\(C4\)**. 

 **I3 \- Local Food Policies** 

 Within Northern Ireland, the findings from the LOCFOOD project have informed local council policy on the development of the local food sector **\(R4, R6\)**. The exchange of international best practice from the “Making Small Producers Part of the Bigger Picture” conference and policy\-maker workshops in June 2014 **\(C3, C10\)** identified key issues in regard to improving the policy environment for supporting the growth of artisan and micro size food producers in Northern Ireland. This was viewed by the Economic Development Manager at Newry, Mourne and Down District Council as “ *a particularly valuable exercise in helping to build local momentum and securing central government support for 2016 as Northern Ireland Year of Food and Drink”*, and one which provided a major platform for putting in place further policy to assist the agri\-food industry **\(C3\)**. The research led to the formulation of a “Model Local Food Policy” for Northern Ireland councils in 2014 \( **C9\)**, which assisted local councils in “ *taking an active role in the 2016 Northern Ireland Year of Food and Drink \(initiative\), providing identification of mechanisms for improved support for the local food sector, e.g. business development; tourism; local markets; procurement etc.*” **\(C3\)**. Elements of the “Model Local Food Policy” have been adopted by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council \(i.e. aligning support for artisan and micro businesses with tourism policy by ensuring that local food provision/sales opportunities are a key element of council events\) **\(C3\)**. From 2018 through to 2020, this evidence **\(R3, R4, R5, R6\)** has formed the basis for policy recommendations to DAERA on the development of a Northern Ireland Food Strategy Framework **\(C5** and **C9\)**.  In particular, the research findings from the LOCFOOD project \( **R4** and **R6**\) identified the lack of a co\-ordinated approach to communication across the public sector regarding the support that is available for food producers and, crucially, how small food producers may access that support. According to the Head of Future Food Policy at DAERA, the subsequent recommendation for a more co\-ordinated and integrated multi\-actor approach has been embedded within the policy and is “ *at the core of what the Food Strategy Framework is seeking to address”* **\(C5\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Scientific innovation is linked to technological breakthroughs. Recognising that standard commercially available equipment was unable to deliver the scientific objectives of current and future research programmes, the Astrophysics Research Centre \(ARC\) at QUB teamed\-up with Oxford Instruments’ Andor Technology to develop the Balor imaging sensor and synchronisation platform. The impact is two\-fold. First, this partnership has allowed Andor to expand into the large\-format detector market and increased their revenue by more than GBP3,000,000 since September 2019 alone. Second, striking Balor\-enabled solar images have generated significant press and industry coverage, engaging new audiences in Solar science and helping to accelerate Andor’s leading position in the global scientific camera market.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prof. Mathioudakis and Prof. Keenan work in the Astrophysics Research Centre \(ARC\) in Queen’s University Belfast \(QUB\). They performed the underpinning research that both revealed the need for new large\-format, high\-cadence scientific CMOS \(complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor\) devices and guided their development. Prof. Mathioudakis was the academic lead on the collaboration with Andor. 

 Studies of the Sun and its outer atmosphere have always been the source of notable physical insights. From the discovery of helium, first made in the solar atmosphere, to the identification of nuclear fusion as a power source for stars and the unexpected physics of neutrinos, our nearest star is a unique source for our understanding of the Universe in its many forms. The Sun is the most important astronomical object for humankind, with solar activity driving space weather and having profound effects on climate and communications. Its atmosphere and interior provide a working example where structures and dynamics can be studied over an enormous range of spatial \(100km – 100,000km\) and temporal \(seconds to months\) scales. The Sun provides a vantage reference point where the complex interplay between the plasma and the magnetic field is visible and can be studied continuously at unprecedented detail. 

 Research in ARC has proved the existence of Alfvén waves in the lower solar atmosphere **\[R1\]** and discovered the smallest magnetic flux cancellations in the photosphere **\[R2\]**. Alfvén  waves and magnetic flux cancellations are key to understanding the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s outer atmosphere. First, spectropolarimetric data was inverted to obtain the magnetic energy dissipated and it was compared to the radiative losses **\[R3\]**. Next spectral imaging was used, alongside radiative hydrodynamic models to disentangle the physical processes in rapidly evolving events and solar flares **\[R4, R5\].** This established strong evidence for ubiquitous compressive waves in the Sun's chromosphere **\[R6\]**. This research, however, has also emphasised the need to push the limits of solar instrumentation, and highlighted the requirement for a new generation of large format, high\-speed camera equipment. 

 As a result of their research pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible with existing instrumentation, QUB researchers have played a central role in defining the science specifications for the next generation of solar telescopes, such as the US\-led Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope \(DKIST\) and the European Solar Telescope \(EST\). These are unique facilities that will revolutionise the field. Key advances that will be offered by these instruments are ultra\-high spatial \(25km\) and temporal \(millisecond, ms\) resolution, photospheric and chromospheric imaging spectroscopy, vector magnetometry, plus infrared coronal magnetometry. Prof. Mathioudakis is a member of the DKIST instrumentation team, a board member of the European Association of Solar Telescopes, and a member of the EST Science Advisory Group. The requirement for large format, high cadence detectors became apparent. 

 Profs. Mathioudakis and Keenan have partnered with Andor Technology to realise this vision and develop the detectors for these telescopes. This project was funded by an STFC grant for GBP1,900,000 to QUB in January 2015 \(PI: Mathioudakis\) and H2020 grants of GBP50,000 in June 2015 and October 2016 \(PI: Mathioudakis\). This research resulted in QUB leading the development and supply of all the optical cameras that equip the US DKIST telescope. The resulting product, named Balor, has been taken to market by Andor. Balor is the largest\-format, high\-cadence scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor camera commercially available. This development will allow Oxford Instruments/Andor to maintain a leading position in the high\-tech market. It opens new technological markets and also provides growth and diversity in existing markets.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Andor Technology \(now within Oxford Instruments\) is a spin\-out company from QUB. Over the past 12 years, researchers from ARC in QUB have worked closely with Andor on the development of several scientific cameras and instruments for astronomical applications. This partnership involved the specification, testing and evaluation of both hardware and software to achieve microsecond\-accuracy synchronisation across several camera platforms. This improved Andor’s understanding on a number of technical issues allowing novel solutions to be applied to camera products such as the Neo, Zyla and Marana of the sCMOS range and four models of the iXon EMCCDs. This success helped Andor gain a leading position in the scientific camera market on a global scale, particularly in the growing area of astronomy. 

 However, as outlined above, the demands of research have outstripped the capabilities of these detectors. This created the need for innovative technological breakthroughs to enable the next generation of scientific investigations of the Sun. In order for Andor to maintain and grow its current global lead, it must match the pace of development. This is only possible by working closely with frontline researchers that are leading the charge into new scientific territory. 

 “*Balor was initiated through the solar physics research programmes undertaken at Queen’s University Belfast, and developed in collaboration with staff in the Queen’s Astrophysics Research Centre, University College London, Armagh Observatory, Northumbria University, University of Glasgow, University of Sheffield, University of St Andrews, University of Warwick and the US National Solar Observatory, from funding provided by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, part of UK Research and Innovation*” **\[S1\].** 

 By partnering with QUB for this project, Andor gained access to numerous research groups in the UK, allowing them to develop a good understanding of the market\-place \(as a company it would only make sense to pursue a project with a sustainable user base\). As outlined by Dr. Colin Coates, Head of Product Management for Physical Sciences and OEM at Andor, this research\-led approach has generated an international success story: 

 “*Balor was formally launched in Sept 2019 and to date we have sold almost 30 units across a range of countries, including USA, UK, China, Korea, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, amounting to > £3m revenue*.” **\[S2\].** 

 This new breed of large\-format, high\-cadence cameras **\[S3\]** has also been deployed on the DKIST. DKIST is a USD400,000,000 facility, constructed by the National Solar Observatory in Hawaii, USA. It operates in the optical and near\-infrared wavelength ranges and will be the pre\-eminent ground\-based solar telescope for the foreseeable future. DKIST has 4 main instruments that will operate in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and QUB led a consortium of 8 UK universities and Andor to deliver the detector equipment for all 4 instruments in the visible. QUB’s lead role in this was highlighted in the STFC Innovations Club newsletter in 2015 **\[S4\]**.  For DKIST to meet its scientific objectives the cameras had to cover a large field\-of\-view at the diffraction\-limited resolution of the telescope and at very high temporal resolution. The specific scientific objectives require large\-format \(16,000,000 pixels\), highly sensitive cameras obtaining approximately 60 high\-fidelity images of the Sun every second. The leading role of QUB in the development of Balor and its relevance to DKIST is outlined by the Head of Product Management for Physical Sciences and OEM at Andor **\[S3\]**: 

 *“The joint UK funding initiative spearheaded by QUB, through which the UK designed and supplied Balor detectors to the new DKIST solar telescope in the USA, provided the necessary commercial and financial stimulus to support a challenging and innovative technology development that opens up new scientific possibilities across astronomy and beyond. Furthermore, QUB Astrophysics offered invaluable technical and usage expertise that proved critical at various stages of development and as well as taking a leading role in both alpha and beta testing.”* 

 As Richard Morgan reports for the BBC *“Experts have said it will enable a new era of solar science.”* **\[S5\].** The telescope came online in mid\-2019 and, through the QUB\-driven Balor system produced stunning images of the Sun in late 2019 \(Fig 1\) **\[S6\].** 



 **Fig 1. \[S6\]** *“The highest resolution Solar images have been captured by Andor Balor sCMOS cameras at the largest solar telescope in the world”* \(Note Texas to scale\) “ *The images were taken with the newly released 16\-megapixel Andor Balor sCMOS camera, which was developed as part of the telescope project which involves a research consortium with key driving from **Queen’s University Belfast**”* **\[S7\].** Image credit NSO/AURA/NSF. 

 The impact generated by this was immediate. The ability to relate the size of features on the Solar surface to the size of states in the US captured the public’s imagination, with popular science articles appearing in newspapers with a huge circulation such as the **New York Times**: 

#  “*These images show the Sun’s surface in greater detail than ever before. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope released the highest resolution observations of the sun’s surface ever taken. These cell\-like structures — each about the size of Texas — are the signature of violent motions that transport heat from the inside of the Sun to its surface”* \[ **S8**\]. 

 From a broader impact perspective, it is important to note that a movie of the data in Fig. 1 is available in **\[S5\]** and **\[S8\]**. The ability to make videos of solar dynamics not only allows researchers to study the Sun in real time but provides a crucial new modality for educating and inspiring the general public about the work that is performed in our universities. This is made possible by the ability of each camera to generate approximately 2.5 Gbytes of data per second. This capability has revolutionised the use of large\-area sCMOS cameras for the acquisition of scientific data. This was driven directly by the need to obtain high resolution spectropolarimetric data in real time \(a requirement revealed in **R1** to **R6** above\) and its development and testing were performed by QUB researchers. 

 In addition, it is crucial to acknowledge the impact of this ability to reach into mainstream media for Andor Technology’s strategy to accelerate their growth in international markets. 

 The solar astronomy market alone is substantial, given the continued investment in existing solar facilities in Europe, US, India and China. A significant part of this market is migrating towards the next generation of sCMOS detectors which offer faster speeds and lower noise. Non\-solar applications include: near\-Earth object detection, speckle interferometry, lucky imaging and other projects related to high\-time resolution astrophysics. It is important to recognise that the unit volume of the large area sCMOS market size will not be as high as that of the current breed of mid\-range sCMOS cameras developed for microscopy and optical electron microscope instrumentation applications. However, the large\-area astronomy detectors are typically priced significantly higher than mid\-range detectors \(in excess of GBP100,000 per unit\), so a lower\-volume market yields an appropriate business case. In the longer term, it will be worthwhile adapting the camera platform for high\-speed X\-ray detection applications, including protein crystallography and computed 3D X\-ray tomography. Andor introduced the Balor camera to the market in September 2019 and has sold units to 7 different countries, generating a revenue of over GBP3,000,000 for the company. Their target is for the Balor platform “ *to contribute over £7 million per annum to Andor’s revenue and the UK economy within the next 3 years*” \[ **S2**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Ford at the University of Bristol has had two major impacts on protecting UK employment rights. 

 \(1\) He produced a key Report in 2016 for the TUC setting out the threat to workers’ rights from Brexit. This strongly influenced the stance of the TUC, major trade unions and the Labour Party in the Brexit referendum and demonstrably affected political debate in the media and Parliament. The Report continues to underpin the position of the TUC, Labour and major unions on Brexit and workers’ rights. 

 \(2\) Ford’s research underpinned key lines of argument advanced before the Supreme Court in the successful *UNISON* challenge to the introduction of hefty claimant fees to access employment tribunals. The Court decision has required reimbursement of up to GBP30 million in past fees and meant around 20,000 additional workers are able to bring claims each year.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ford’s research at the University of Bristol has addressed both substantive and procedural deregulation of employment rights. His work on Brexit and labour rights was one of the most significant scholarly interventions on this issue during the Brexit debate, identifying the precise risks posed to substantive domestic labour protections by a 'hard' Brexit. It took the form of a written Advice for the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) \[3.1\], produced between January and March 2016, drawing on many years of research in the area. It demonstrated the crucial importance of the complex array of EU laws protecting key employment rights, contrasting them with the weaker and more fragile protections in domestic law. Through an analysis of recent government policy papers and consultations, it was able to provide evidence\-based predictions of the EU law\-based rights that would be most vulnerable to being watered down in the event of Brexit, including holiday entitlements, worker health and safety and protections from some forms of discrimination. That research underpinned two further articles which analysed the issues in more detail \[3.2, 3.3\]. 

 In 2013, UNISON, the UK’s largest trade union, launched a challenge against the introduction of large fees for workers accessing employment tribunals, a form of procedural deregulation. Between February 2016 and February 2017, Ford researched and drafted the Written Case produced for the Intervenor in the Supreme Court, the Equality and Human Rights Commission \(EHRC\). \[3.4\]. There were two key elements to the research. First it analysed the correct legal test for when an interference with access to the courts would be unlawful as a matter of domestic law, EU law and under the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\); this involved extensive research into every decision of the European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice on court fees. The Written Case argued that, under the ECHR and EU law, an individual’s ability to pay was a relevant but not a determinative factor. Second, it analysed empirical evidence to demonstrate that tribunal fees breached the standard required by the ECHR and EU law. Ford analysed sources, such as the official tribunal statistics, large\-scale surveys of Employment Tribunal applications and empirical work on tribunal conciliation. He was assisted with the statistical analysis by Stuifzand, also of the University of Bristol. This analysis led to the striking finding that, even on the Government’s own assumptions, around <ins>18,000</ins> individuals did not bring claims each year owing to fees. 

 The UNISON challenge was successful: in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the fees were unlawful and unconstitutional. Following this judgment, Ford wrote up the research that underpinned the written Case, in an article which also considered the broader implications of the *UNISON* judgment, for a leading peer\-reviewed journal \[3.5\]. The article exposes the vulnerability of the theoretical assumptions used by the UK Government to justify fees and distils the legal principles under domestic and international law relevant to assessing whether a fees scheme is unlawful, exploring the distinction between systemic delivery of rights and individual access to the court under EU law and Article 6 ECHR. It was described by the President of the Employment Tribunals, 2014\-2020, as “ *required reading for any politician, minister, policy\-maker, civil servant and legislative draftsman concerned with protecting \(or, conversely, restricting\) access to justice in courts and tribunals*” \[5.7\]. The article explains the legal threshold any future fees scheme in employment tribunals would need to cross and how the position differs pre\- and post\-Brexit. It is therefore likely to be highly relevant to any future fees scheme. It also provides some indication of the huge importance of the *UNISON* judgment for access to justice in general.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over the last forty years, the UK has witnessed an erosion of labour rights through national policies of substantive and procedural labour market deregulation. A key brake on that process of deregulation has been the guarantee of fundamental rights through the Council of Europe and the EU. Ford's work has been pivotal in supporting the continued role of this European 'floor of rights' in resisting substantive and procedural deregulation. First, Ford’s work had a substantial impact on the stance of the TUC \(representing 48 UK trade unions\), major trade unions and the Labour Party on the substantive deregulation of workers’ rights threatened by Brexit. Second, Ford’s research underpinned key arguments made before the Supreme Court, which successfully challenged procedural deregulation in the form of draconian Employment Tribunal fees. 

1.  **Informing political debate around Brexit and workers’ rights.** Ford’s Advice for the TUC on the substantive threat to workers’ rights from Brexit \[3.1\] directly influenced the TUC’s stance of supporting ‘Remain’ in the referendum, as reflected in the General Council Report for 2016 \[5.3\] and a letter to the Financial Times from TUC General Secretary, Frances O’Grady, the latter stating: “ *Last week the TUC published an independent legal opinion on Brexit and workers' rights ... Michael Ford QC's opinion makes it abundantly clear that no EU\-derived workplace right would be completely safe post\-Brexit*.” \[5.4\]. As O’Grady later commented: “ *The quality of the analysis contained in the opinion, combined with Professor Ford’s standing in the legal profession, ensured that the opinion carried significant weight with both journalists and policymakers*” \[5.1\]. The TUC disseminated Ford’s Advice to its member unions and referred to it in press releases, Twitter, and a video on YouTube, resulting in wide coverage in the press, including in the *Independent*, *Financial Times,* and *New Statesman* \[5.4\]. A House of Commons Library briefing paper for MPs referred to it as “ *the best discussion of the potential employment law consequences of Brexit*” and it was cited in parliamentary debates \[5.5\]. As well as the TUC and its members, it influenced the approach of the Labour Party in the referendum. As Sir Keir Starmer, now Labour Leader, then Shadow Brexit Secretary, comments: 

 “*The Advice…had a significant impact on Labour Party policy running up to the Referendum, and the warnings we issued of a potential “bonfire” of workers’ rights in the event of a leave vote. It provided the background material to substantiate that claim, and I referred to it in speeches I gave prior to the Referendum. The warnings in the Advice also prompted a Private Members’ Bill, promoted by the Labour MP Melanie Onn and supported by me, which attempted to give a measure legal protection to EU\-derived rights after Brexit, but which was predictably talked out by Conservative MPs*” \[5.2\]. 

 The Onn Bill, however, helped keep pressure on the Government on the issue and provisions protecting workers’ rights post\-Brexit were included in the Government’s original EU \(Withdrawal Agreement\) Bill in October 2019. Moreover, as promised in the revised Political Declaration between the UK and EU, the Trade Agreement between the EU and the UK reached in December 2020 \[5.6\] contains pledges ‘to strive to increase’ protection for labour rights and not to ‘weaken or reduce’ current levels of protection for labour and social rights in a manner affecting trade’ \(Article 6.2\). Subsequently, the British Government stated that it had no plans to dilute workers’ rights, post\-Brexit \[5.6\]. 

 Ford’s work continues to be seen as the key reference point for trade unions and the Labour Party on these issues. As O’Grady puts it: “ *The quality and importance of Professor Ford’s work*” means his research “ *continues to form the bedrock for TUC analysis of workplace rights in the context of the UK’s exit from the European Union*… *it is ‘regarded as the “go\-to” document for staff at all levels of the TUC, and in the wider trade union movement and beyond, when working on issues relating to Brexit and workers’ rights*” \[5.1\]. Starmer confirms that “ *Michael’s Advice remains highly relevant whenever there are policy discussions and political debates about workers’ rights after Brexit. Its high quality of analysis means it remains the key text to refer to in this area*” \[5.2\]. 

 **\(2\) Resisting procedural deregulation: protecting access to justice in the UNISON case** UNISON relied solely on EU law in the initial stage of its judicial review challenging fees of up to GBP1,200 for workers wishing to take their employers to court. However, a senior EHRC lawyer confirms that it was Ford’s submissions for the EHRC which originally argued that fees could also interfere with the right of access to a court enshrined in Article 6 of the ECHR and the analogue but undeveloped common law right \[5.7\]. These arguments in the event proved decisive before the Supreme Court \(SC\), which, in 2017, overturned three courts below, upheld the arguments and declared that employment tribunal fees were unlawful. 

 Ford’s Case for the EHRC \[3.4\] was described by a QC involved in the case as “ *of the highest quality and well\-researched, meaning that* \[its arguments\] *were particularly convincing. This proved to be especially helpful to the Claimant, UNISON, in what was a difficult case, but one of great constitutional importance*” \[5.7\]. Ford’s Case had three impacts on the way the case was reasoned and argued. First, it was a significant reason why the arguments based on the common law and Article 6 ECHR could be raised before the SC in the first place, as confirmed by lawyers for EHRC and UNISON \[5.7\]. Second, as the solicitor for UNISON explains, Ford’s arguments in the Case “ *were picked up and developed by Dinah Rose QC*”, the lawyer acting for UNISON, in her submissions to the SC \[5.7\]. 

 Third, the judgment of the SC adopted or drew on Ford’s EHRC Case in several places. For example, Lord Reed in his leading judgment drew on material in the Case at paras 42\-44 to explain the low level of awards made by Tribunals and the claims before a Tribunal that often result in nil or very low damages \(judgment, paras 31\-34\) \[5.7\]. In other places, Lord Reed’s judgment lifted material directly from the EHRC Case as follows: para. 33 of the judgment echoed para. 45 of the Case; paras 35\-37 of the judgment \(discussing the low level of tribunal awards\) is drawn from paras 47\-48 of the Case; para. 40 of the judgment, on the drop in claims of small value, largely echoes para. 44 of the Case; paras 43\-44 of the judgment, setting out how few claimants obtained remission from the fees, draws on paras 35\-36 of the Case. Moreover, in the words of the solicitor for UNISON, paras 47\-48 of the judgment, giving Lord Reed’s assessment of the ACAS valuation survey evidence on the effect of fees, “ *drew heavily”* on Ford’s Case \(paras 23\-26\) and *“formed the basis of* \[Lord Reed’s\] *second reason for holding that fees were an unlawful interference with access to justice \(judgment para. 93\)*” \[5.7\]. 

 Finally, an important section of the judgment found that the fees were in breach of Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is closely modelled on Article 6 ECHR \(paras 105\-117\). In making this finding, Lord Reed accepted the argument made in the Case at paras 8\-9 and 30\-38, also advanced by UNISON, that ability to pay was not the sole relevant factor. In particular, Lord Reed relied at para. 115 on the decision in Kniat v Poland  as demonstrating this point, which is the very case cited and explained in Ford’s Case for the EHRC at paras 9 and 30. As a senior solicitor for EHRC summarises: “ *in several respects Lord Reed in his judgment drew directly”* on arguments in the Written Case *“on the low levels of awards in the tribunal, the poor record on enforcement, the limited effect of exceptional remission and how ability to pay is not the sole relevant legal factor*” \[5.7\]. 

 The impacts of *UNISON* itself were momentous: it is generally agreed to be the most important employment law decision of the past 50 years, since it directed affected the ability to seek effective redress for almost every statutory employment right in the UK. First, all Tribunal and Appeal Tribunal fees paid from when fees were introduced on 29 July 2013 until the date of the judgment had to be repaid. These amounted to 74,000 fees repaid, at an estimated cost of GBP33 million \[5.10\]. Second, a very significant number of employment tribunal cases that had been dismissed because of non\-payment of fees were reinstated \[5.10\]. 

 Third, and most significant of all, fees ceased to be payable from the day of the SC judgment. This led directly to a dramatic increase in claims. According to the official statistics, in the three years from 2014/15 to 2016/17, when fees were payable, the mean number of single claims per year was 16,787 \(an average of 1,398 per month\). After the judgment, from August 2017 to June 2020, the average was 3,067 single claims per month – more than double \[5.8\]. Therefore, more than 20,000 workers a year now bring tribunal claims which, but for the SC judgment, would never have been brought. Fourth, the effects of the decision extend beyond employment: it is being relied on in other cases concerned with access to courts or tribunals, such as *R \(Law Society\) v Lord Chancellor* \[2018\] EWHC \(Admin\) 294 \(a challenge to restrictions on criminal legal aid\). It will constrain and guide future government policy in relation to fees and other impediments to tribunals or courts in all jurisdictions, as the former Lord Chancellor Dominic Raab explained to the Justice Committee of the House of Commons on 19 December 2017 \[5.9\]. 

 The research underpinning Ford’s Case, as summarised in output \[3.5\], was referred to by Shantha David, the solicitor for UNISON, when she gave her evidence to the House of Commons Justice Committee. Pointing out how Ford’s arguments directly resonated with Lord Reed in the Supreme Court, she said: “ *I recommend* \[his\] *article… in the Industrial Law Journal … He points to the fact that employment tribunal claims promote labour standards. In the rush to reduce costs, the Government lost sight of the benefits of individual* \[employment tribunal\] *claims as a means of promoting labour standards. Lord Reed, as you will recall, identified that as important and said that individual tribunal claims had public benefits, not just for those individuals but for society as a whole*.” \[5.9\]. David concludes that the *UNISON* decisions “ *had enormous implications for the thousands of claimants denied access to the employment tribunal because of fees, for the upholding of labour standards in all workplaces, and for impediments to access to the courts in all spheres*.” \[5.7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Professor Kilduff at Swansea University on passive heat maintenance and morning priming exercise has transformed the competition day strategies of practitioners in the elite and professional sports domain. These strategies have led to significant performance improvements for elite power\-based athletes and improved movement and performance indicators for international team sport athletes. Within the impact period, this research has been successfully incorporated into competition day preparations for athletes competing at the Commonwealth Games \(Glasgow 2014 and Gold Coast 2018\), Winter Olympic games \(Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018\), Summer Olympic games \(Rio 2016\) and Rugby World cups \(England 2015 and Japan 2019\). In addition, Team GB are currently implementing these procedures in preparation for the upcoming Olympic Games in Tokyo \(2021\) and Beijing \(2022\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In the context of elite sport, the smallest margins can often make the difference between winning and losing. Sports have several windows of opportunity for practitioners to implement strategies that positively impact performance on competition day. Research led by Professor Kilduff at Swansea University, in collaboration with UK and International sporting partners, has identified two unique opportunities: 1\) the application of **morning priming exercise** to enhance afternoon/evening performance \[ **R1 and R4**\], and 2\) the application of **passive heat maintenance strategies to attenuate the decline in muscle temperature between warm\-up and start of competition, as well as during intervals, leading to enhanced subsequent performance **\[R1, R2, R5 and R6\]**. In both cases, this important, novel programme of research, conducted in truly elite athletes, has developed and provided an evidence\-base for competition day strategies that have been implemented to enhance elite performance on the International stage. 

 **Morning Priming Exercise \[R1, R4\]** 

 The concentration of key hormones, including testosterone, are known to be important for performance in elite power and team\-based athletes. However, testosterone exhibits a circadian rhythm with concentrations peaking in the morning and subsequently decreasing throughout the day. This has important implications for elite performance during afternoon and evening events. Research at Swansea University, conducted in elite athletes, demonstrated how different modes of morning exercise can offset this decline in testosterone concentrations, and thereby enhance subsequent power\-based performance during the afternoon \(countermovement jump by \~4% and repeated sprint performance by \~2% **\[R4\]**\). 

 **Passive Heat Maintenance** **\[R1, R2, R5 and R6\]** 

 Muscle and whole\-body temperature are also important for elite athletic performance. During team sports, there are periods between the warm\-up and competition start, and during intervals, where body temperature can decrease and therefore negatively impact subsequent performance. Swansea University research demonstrated the efficacy of a passive strategy \(wearing a survival jacket\) to offset the decrease in core body temperature observed in elite Rugby Union players during these ‘heat loss windows’ **\[R2, R5, R6\]**. The application of this intervention improved lower body power output \(increase of \~3%\) and repeated sprint performance \(increase of \~2%\) compared to control following both a simulated half\-time period **\[R2, R6\]** and following a simulated period between warm\-up and start of competition **\[R5\]**. In addition, **\[R2\]** showed that combining a passive heat maintenance strategy with a short active ‘re warm\-up’ was more effective for preserving lower body power output and repeated sprint performance compared to either strategy in isolation. 

 More recently, significant funding awarded to Professor Kilduff and Dr Bezodis from the English Institute of Sport and the Welsh Government **\[G5, G6 & G8\]** has facilitated unique research to enhance the underpinning technology used in these passive heat maintenance strategies. This research has developed advanced functional nano and micro\-materials \(e.g., graphene\) into printable, flexible coatings that offer a uniform heat distribution and can be embedded into the bespoke clothing garments required by elite athletes **\[R3\]**. 

 **Combined Competition Day Strategies \[R1\]** 

 **\[R1\]** demonstrated the positive impact of combined pre\-competition strategies \(passive heat maintenance and morning “priming”\) on skeleton bobsleigh performance time \(increase of 3.5% on their key sprint performance indicator\) in elite British skeleton athletes preparing for the Olympics.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact and the underpinning research being described in this impact case study are primarily a reflection of Professor Kilduff’s overall contribution in developing and driving the competition day performance preparation domain and in particular his pioneering ability to translate these findings from controlled research situations to real world elite sporting environments. Notably, prior to Prof Kilduff’s research, no passive heat maintenance or morning priming exercise strategies were being used, which highlights the novelty, reach and significance of the impacts achieved. Professor Kilduff’s strategy for achieving such impact is to ensure his work has an applied performance solution focus through continued engagement with key stakeholders at all stages of the research process, as evidenced by the letters of support and significant industry funding associated with this case study. The above strategy has led to the underpinning research having a significant impact on practitioners from a wide range of elite and professional sports, by developing optimal competition day strategies that have been exploited for valuable performance gains.  These novel strategies are unrivalled in providing significant changes to practitioners’ competition day practice at the very highest level of international competition. Ultimately, the research findings have underpinned current preparation strategies for numerous top international rugby teams \(e.g., New Zealand and French Rugby Federation\) and elite Winter \(e.g., Skeleton Bobsleigh\) and Summer \(e.g., Team GB\) Olympic sports teams, ultimately playing a key role in contributing to their recent successes at the Commonwealth Games \(Glasgow 2014 and Gold Coast 2018\), Winter Olympic Games \(Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018\), Summer Olympic Games \(Rio 2016\) and Rugby World Cups \(England 2015 and Japan 2019\). 

 **Impact at the Commonwealth Games** 

 The research findings on passive heat maintenance have been applied to enhance performance by competitors for Team Wales in a significant number of sports, at both the Glasgow \(2014\) and Gold Coast \(2018\) Commonwealth Games. The impact of this work is evidenced by the quotes below. 

 National Performance Director for Swim Wales **\[C1\]**: 

 “**Professor Kilduff’s** research underpinned our competition days strategies centred around warm\-up, passive heat maintenance and morning priming, this research coupled with the expertise of our coaches and performance staff had a significant impact on two of our most successful overall commonwealth games performances. **Professor Kilduff’s** research has had important significance and impact on our practice at Swim Wales.*” 

 Head of Coaching and Performance \(2012\-2018\) for Welsh Athletics **\[C2\]**: 

 “**Professor Kilduff’s** research focusing around the application of passive heat maintenance strategies to elite athletes and specifically it’s application during “heat loss” windows in competition allowed us to gain a performance advantage over our competitors. Probably the best example of this was during the women’s pole vault final where the temperatures were between 15\-16 degrees Celsius with heavy rainfall during an evening session in Glasgow. **Sally Peake used the heat maintenance techniques as part of her competition strategy to great effect and saw her win the silver medal; finishing well above her ranking and even attempting a National record despite the poor weather conditions**.”* 

 **Impact on the Winter and Summer Olympic games** 

 This research has also had a significant impact during the Summer \(Rio 2016\) and Winter \(Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018\) Olympic games, as evidenced by the following excerpts from letters of support: 

 Director of Performance Innovation \(English Institute of Sport\) **\[C3\]**: 

 “*The impact his research has delivered in the area of warm up and ‘competitive readiness’ in elite athletes has directly impacted applied practice and performance on GB’s winter and Summer sport programmes through the implementation by our expert practitioners. This research work has been incorporated into the preparation and competition day strategies for Sochi \(2014\), PyeongChang \(2018\) and Rio \(2016\). In addition, athletes and coaches from a high number of Summer and Winter sports team are currently revisiting this performance priority in preparation for the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020 and Winter Olympic Games in Beijing 2022. Specifically, his research \(papers listed below\) around the application of passive heat maintenance during competition day heat loss windows has transformed our competition day strategies and these changes have led to significant performance gains for our athletes*.” 

 Further support for this comes from the Head of Performance Innovation and Applied Research \(British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association\) **\[C4\]**: 

 “*The research conducted directly within our World Class Performance athletes has allowed our athletes physical performance on the world stage to make tangible improvements. Over the years this work has led to significant improvements in our start time KPI test \(see Cook et al below paper for quantification\). This has had a dramatic impact on overall performance and end ranking.*” 

 A further advancement in this area is our work around printed wearables for passive heat maintenance and the Director of Performance Innovation, English Institute of Sport **\[C3\]** states: 

  

 “*In addition, the recent work we have supported \(grants below\) in collaboration with **Dr Bezodis** and Professor Claypole around the development of a graphene based printed heater will give us a significant performance advantage in our training and preparation strategies and is providing a bespoke performance solution to a major performance issue our sports identified. Approximately 60% of our sports will be using this advancement in wearable heated technology during either the training phases coming into the games and on competition days at the games, based on initial testing it is clear it will have a significant impact on their performances.”* 

 **Impact on International Rugby** 

 Finally, Professor Kilduff’s work in the area of passive heat maintenance and the influence of morning exercise on afternoon performance has had significant reach and impact on the international rugby stage. 

 The Heads of Performance and Strength and Conditioning coaches from 6 of the top 11 international rugby teams \(World rankings \(2016, 2019\), the Rugby Football Union, New Zealand Rugby, Italian Rugby Federation, Australia Rugby, Georgia Rugby and the French Rugby Federation **\[C5\-10\]**, together have stated the following, which clearly highlights the adoption and impact of our work described above. 

 *“ **Professor Kilduff’s** research into the application of passive heat maintenance \(between the warm\-up and start of competition, during half\-time and for our match day substitutes\) and also the use of game day primers has helped transform our game day preparation’s and I feel this is now an extremely important part of our performance programme.”* 

 The Head of Performance for the French Rugby Federation **\[C5\]** went further and stated: 

 “*Since implementing our competition day strategies based on his work, we have consistently seen improvements in our movement characteristics \(as assessed by GPS\) and key performance indicators \(as assessed by performance analysis statistics\) at the beginning of the game and immediately after the half\-time break. We are confident these improvements are down to the implementation of the passive heat maintenance and priming strategies outlined \(key papers listed below\) in **Professor Kilduff’s** research.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young \(MODY\), is a form of diabetes caused by mutation in a single gene that requires an expensive genetic diagnosis. It is difficult to recognise, so the majority of MODY patients are misdiagnosed as the more common Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.  Misdiagnosis matters because MODY has specific treatment requirements and importantly these patients do not need insulin injections. The Exeter ‘MODY calculator’ helps clinicians select patients who should have diagnostic genetic testing by giving a probability of MODY based on clinical features. It has been **used to improve diagnosis over 170,000 times in 187countries** and is **recommended in national and 3 international guidelines**. In the UK alone, 74% of clinicians referring for genetic testing report using the calculator. By increasing the number of patients with a correct MODY diagnosis the calculator leads to **better treatment and clinical care, improving outcomes for patients and saving money for the NHS**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 People with diabetes need to know which subtype of the disease they have in order to receive the best treatment. Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young \(MODY\) is distinct from the commoner Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes as it is caused by a mutation in a single gene \(ie. monogenic\). MODY accounts for 3.6% of young\-onset diabetes **\[3.1\]**, amounting to more than 25,000 individuals in the UK alone. Exeter pioneered research into MODY, working in this field for over 20 years, and has led much of the work into the diagnosis, treatment, and management of this disease. A diagnosis of MODY is only confirmed by a genetic test, but this testing is expensive \(about £650 per patient\) so its use is limited. Therefore, approaches to help target testing at those most likely to have MODY have been needed. 

 **2.1.  Identifying patients with MODY is challenging** 

 The vast majority of patients with MODY are misdiagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, with over 80% of cases estimated to be undiagnosed in the UK in 2010 **\[3.2\]**. Clinicians have limited experience of MODY as it is far less common than Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and was only recently recognised \(first genetic cause reported in 1992, NHS diagnostic testing did not commence until 2000\). It can be difficult to distinguish from other forms of diabetes as many of the features overlap. Traditionally, MODY was defined by age at diagnosis below 25, strong family history of diabetes, and evidence of non\-insulin dependence, but these criteria miss over half of MODY cases **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.2. Developing a calculator to determine the likelihood of MODY** 

 To improve the detection of MODY in clinical practice Dr Beverley Shields led the development and validation of a probability algorithm for MODY, which incorporates clinical features such as a patient’s sex, body mass index, glucose control \(HbA1c\), and age at diagnosis, in order to calculate the likelihood of them having MODY **\[3.3\]**. Combining information from multiple clinical features was highly effective in discriminating MODY from other forms of diabetes. The model was translated into an online calculator and app that enables users to input routinely available clinical characteristics and obtain an immediate probability score. This helps clinicians decide whether to send for molecular genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. 

  

 **2.3. A diagnosis of MODY influences treatment** 

 Exeter researchers have demonstrated that patients with MODY do not require insulin injections and can successfully stop them **\[3.4\]**. Specific treatments are indicated depending on which MODY gene is found to be the cause. In individuals with MODY caused by mutations in the *HNF1A* gene, patients can be successfully treated with sulphonylurea tablets **\[3.4\]**.  In a second subtype, caused by mutations in the *GCK* gene, patients can discontinue pharmacological treatment without any deterioration in control of blood sugar **\[3.5\]**.  In addition, patients with *GCK* MODY who are not treated for 50 years have no greater risk of microvascular or macrovascular complications than people without diabetes, confirming that pharmacological treatment is unnecessary **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1 MODY probability calculator has improved diagnosis of MODY** 

 The impact on improving diagnosis is seen in the referrals for UK genetic testing for MODY. The MODY calculator is very widely used by UK healthcare professionals with 74% of UK referrals since August 2014 stating that they have used the calculator **\[5.1\].** The referrals that have used the calculator are more likely to receive a positive diagnosis of MODY than those who do not use it \(32% v 24%, p=0.001\) **\[5.1\].** The number of cases of MODY diagnosed in the UK has increased threefold since the online calculator/app has been made available to clinicians and 3860 individuals have now received a genetic diagnosis. 

-  **MODY probability calculator is widely used in clinical practice worldwide** 

 The value of the MODY calculator to clinical decision making is best demonstrated by its widespread use worldwide.  Exeter’s online MODY calculator can be accessed for free on computers and mobile devices via the Exeter Diabetes Research website \( [www.diabetesgenes.org/exeter\-diabetes\-app](http://www.diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app)\) **\[5.2\]**. Since February 2015, the website calculator has had been used over 170,000 times, with 65% of users of the calculator being from outside the UK **\[5.3\]**. The MODY probability calculator has been accessed by people from 187 countries across 6 continents **\[5.3\].** 

-  **Mobile phone App incorporating the MODY probability calculator is extensively used.** 

 An App developed for use on mobile phones to help clinicians get rapid access to the MODY probability calculator in clinic has been extensively used. The calculator is available as part of the Diabetes Diagnostics App on both iOS and Android platforms and has been downloaded over 14,000 times in over 70 countries worldwide. **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **MODY probability calculator is a CE marked device** 

 The calculator constitutes a medical device and has a CE marking that demonstrates its compliance with strict regulations. CE marking involved a rigorous process of clinical evaluation, thorough software testing, user testing, and risk mitigation and thus provides reassurance of quality to healthcare providers **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.2. Recommended in national and international guidelines** 

 The MODY calculator is widely recommended for clinical use in national and international guidelines to ensure the correct diagnosis is made for young people with diabetes. The calculator is promoted in four independent guidelines: the 2019 World Health Organisation guidelines for the Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, the 2020 Association for British Clinical Diabetologists \(ABCD\) Standard of Care guidelines, the 2020 American Diabetes Association’s position statement on paediatric diabetes, and the 2018 International Society of Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes \(ISPAD\) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines **\[5.5\]**. 

 The 2020 NHS UK National Genomic testing criteria for monogenic diabetes use the MODY calculator to identify which patients with diabetes should have NHS diagnostic genetic tests as an appropriate and accurate approach to identify patients most likely to have monogenic diabetes **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.3. Outcome for patients with MODY has improved, as a result of correct diagnoses** 

  

 The significance of the MODY calculator is that it helps patients get the correct diagnosis, and this means patients get the right treatment plus other important clinical benefits: 

-  **Improved treatment** – The clearest improvement in treatment is to be able to stop insulin and maintain excellent glucose control in the commonest subtypes of MODY.  Patients with *HNF1A\-*MODY or *HNF4A*\-MODY are very sensitive to sulphonylurea tablets and those diagnosed with the *GCK* subtype of MODY require no pharmacological treatment. In a prospective observational UK wide study carried out by the Exeter team, 78% of MODY patients on insulin successfully stopped their insulin treatment with no deterioration in blood sugar control **\[5.7\]**. 

-  **Improved clinical care** –Patients diagnosed with *GCK\-*MODY are at no greater risk of microvascular or macrovascular complications than the non\-diabetic population, even 50 years after diagnosis and consequently they do not need any clinical follow\-up **\[5.8\]**. 

-  **Family member follow\-up** – As MODY is a genetic disease and runs in families, a diagnosis of one individual can help determine the cause of diabetes in other family members. A recent audit **\[5.1\]** identified that a median of 3 further family members are referred for genetic testing following each diagnosis of a MODY index case. Eighty six percent of these family members subsequently receive a genetic diagnosis for their own diabetes and are able to modify their treatment. 

  

 **4.4. Cost savings to the NHS** 

  

 The MODY calculator is saving money for the NHS by reducing the numbers of expensive inappropriate genetic tests and by helping patients get better cheaper care once a diagnosis of MODY is made. 

 Using the MODY calculator, which is free and easily accessible, allows a rapid assessment by a non\-expert healthcare provider to assess if testing or referral to secondary care is appropriate.  In the UK with the assistance of the MODY calculator the positive diagnostic rate for NHS testing is 32% almost 10x higher than the 3.6% that would be seen with non\-selective testing. By targeting testing at only those at the highest probability of MODY, fewer expensive genetic tests are negative, increasing value for money. The ability of the MODY calculator to do this is why it is now incorporated into the NHS UK National Genomic testing criteria for monogenic diabetes **\[5.5\]**. 

 Targeted MODY testing using the calculator helps increase the diagnosis of monogenic diabetes which saves the NHS money by reducing the cost of treating and monitoring raised blood glucose levels and avoiding the additional expense associated with treating diabetes complications. A health economic model published in 2015 from the Exeter team, showed that a targeted testing approach based on using the MODY calculator in all patients diagnosed with diabetes under 30, could save the NHS £20\-40 million due to the substantial savings from change in treatment over the lifetime of patients **\[5.8\]**. Correctly diagnosing *HNF1A* MODY in a patient previously thought to have Type 1 diabetes can result in considerable direct cost savings ranging from £400\-£2300 \(mean £660\) per year, because they can be treated with tablets in place of insulin therapy. Diagnosing *GCK\-*MODY results in substantial savings as treatment, monitoring and healthcare appointments are not needed for the remainder of a patient’s life.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Scene from Edward's Boy's production of John Ford's The Lady's Trial, 2015 



Hopkins brought new awareness and understanding of the idiosyncratic theatre of John Ford \(1586 to circa 1639\) to contemporary audiences through performances, education, translation, and discussion. Her research influenced a wave of new performances of four Ford plays by the Royal Shakespeare Company, Stratford\-upon\-Avon, the Globe Theatre, London, and Edward's Boys \(King Edward's School, Stratford\-upon\-Avon\). The productions were part of the John Ford Experiment, which set out to test on contemporary audiences and theatre spaces plays by Ford not performed since the 17th century. The twenty performances of the four productions attracted large audiences \(collectively of around 7,500 people\). Her research informed the first Russian translation of a Ford play, Perkin Warbeck, published by Andrey Korchesvskiy in *Sovremennaya Dramaturgia* \( *Modern Dramaturgy*\), a journal subscribed to by Russian public libraries and theatres. She created new Ford learning\-resources for A\-level students and teachers \(via *Massolit*\). Finally, her work engaged a wider public with Ford at varied cultural venues. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ford is academically canonical, yet to a wider public overshadowed by Shakespeare, Johnson, and Marlowe, and with most of his plays having rarely been performed in modern times. This was the situation addressed by the distinguished companies participating in the John Ford Experiment \(Globe and Edward's Boys\) and in parallel by the RSC productions: would Ford's rarely performed plays work in the modern theatre? While sufficiently close in time to Shakespeare to be bracketed with him, Shakespeare is not a good model for understanding Ford. His theatre disconcerts by coupling an abstract, Latinate style with shocking violence, disturbing topics, highly implicit contexts, and ambivalent perspectives. 

 Hopkins' research on Ford has changed the understanding of his biography and dramaturgy, including through work on his complex relationships to patrons, Catholic thought, politics, intertexts and contemporaries, all of which play a part in his oblique theatre \( **R1**, **R2**, **R5**, **R6**\). Hopkins also reinterprets him as a political dramatist as much as the psychologist he was once considered \( **R3**, **R4**\).The research began with a PhD thesis, ‘John Ford and his Circle’, which became a book, *John Ford’s Political Theatre* \(Manchester UP, 1994\). Since then Hopkins has written eight book chapters, thirteen articles, and nineteen notes on Ford's plays. It was in the light of her expertise on Ford that she was invited by Professor Brian Vickers \(editor of the Oxford University Press *Collected Works of John Ford*, 2012\-17 and 2015 Sam Wanamaker Fellow\) to support the John Ford Experiment, and independently the RSC productions. 

 The six underpinning outputs below advanced knowledge of Ford in the headlined fields. 

 **R1.** <ins>Dramaturgy</ins>. This article analyses the interpretation of Ford's drama in the exceptional number of productions of his work in a two\-year window \(2014\-16\), a phenomenon at the heart of this case study. It discusses how productions responded to Ford scholarship, including that of Hopkins, and highlights the strangeness of his theatre for contemporary audiences. It includes research on Ford and the Italian prince, wife\-murderer and composer Carlo Gesualdo \(1566\-1613\), whose harmony was as idiosyncratic as Ford's dramaturgy. It revisits research first published in the RSC Programme Note for *Love's Sacrifice* in 2015, adding original insights into the relationship between Ford's aesthetics and Gesualdo's music to Hopkins' earlier discovery that the play was based on Gesualdo's life story \(1988\). 

 **R2**. <ins>Dramaturgy</ins>. This guide was edited by Hopkins and has her 'Introduction' and authoritative ‘Critical Backstory' informed by her whole contribution to Ford scholarship and includes her original essay, *' 'Tis Pity She's a Whore* and the Space of the Stage', which argues that Ford used stage\-space/s to play off abstract and symbolic conceptions of life \(theological, moral\) against physical and material experiences \(bodily, sexual, civic, household\), with the latter subversively seen as the more compelling. 

 **R3**. <ins>Politics</ins>. This monograph explored the politics of drama dealing with the dangerous topic of monarchical succession between 1561 and 1633. The final chapter argued that Ford revived the Elizabethan history play in Charles's reign to question the relationship between legitimacy and authority, so that *Perkin Warbeck* \(1634\) may subversively invite the audience to imagine that the supposed pretender was genuinely one of the Princes in the Tower. **R4** continues work in this vein, arguing that Ford's Perkin Warbeck has intertexts with two plays by Massinger showing that these texts were models for Ford as ways of \(survivably\) dramatising the politics of succession. 

 **R5**. <ins>Intertexts</ins>. This is the first modern edition of The Lady’s Trial \(last substantive edition, 1811, lightly revised 1827 and 1870\). There is a new corrected text and full modern editorial apparatus, which draws throughout on Hopkins' research on Ford's oeuvre. Hopkins' substantial introduction includes new material on the play's revisiting of Ford's own works and its rewriting of Othello to show its accused heroine, Spinella, vindicated. 

 **R6**. <ins>Patrons and Contemporaries</ins>. This article explores Ford's interest in Italy and Venice, constructing new understandings of how his treatment of those places links to a complex circle of patrons and contemporary personalities \(including Philip Sidney, Kenelm Digby and Venetia Stanley\) and literary texts \(especially by Jacopo Sannazaro\). While focusing on *'Tis Pity She's a Whore,* it also refers to the four plays at the heart of this case study: *Love's Sacrifice*, The Lady’s Trial, Perkin Warbeck, and *The Fancies, Chaste and Noble*.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 New knowledge and understandings of Ford have had benefits for theatre directors, audiences, a translator, Russian readers of drama, A\-level pupils and teachers, and a wider public, changing perceptions and giving new contexts through the activities described below. 

####  Generation of New Understandings of Ford for Theatres and Audiences 

 The RSC drew on Hopkins' research on *Love's Sacrifice* for the production itself \(12 performances, 21 April to 24 June 2015, overall audience of around 5000\), as well as in her commissioned RSC Programme Note. The director and programmes editor requested 'something that touches on Gesualdo – both something about him and his life/work, but also of course how it might fit in with the themes and characters of the play' \( **E1**\). The note argued that the story and themes of *Love's Sacrifice* are rooted in the story of Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa, composer and wife\-murderer. This was the first performance of the play since 1631, and the director’s vision was influenced explicitly by this origin story, which was also noted in reviews, while the video trailer for the play emphasised this angle in its sub\-title: 'based on a true story' \( **E2**\). Hopkins' work on Ford's Catholic sensibilities also influenced the production style: 'steeped in ritual and patterned movement in a way which is profoundly Catholic'. Reviewers, including The Telegraph, The Independent and The Guardian, thought the play a notable revival for the stage canon: 'eminently stageable'; 'nuanced take on a difficult play' \( **E3**\). 

 Hopkins' research was also used in Globe Education's Rarely Played programme note and public seminar for their Read Not Dead reading of *Love’s Sacrifice*, at Gray’s Inn \(15/02/2015; audience of circa 200\). The programme note has now been included in the Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre archive created and marketed by Adam Matthew digital resources. The cast included senior members of Gray's Inn and raised their awareness of Ford's own legal training and his dedication of this play to his cousin, also John Ford, a member of Gray's Inn. Hopkins led the Rarely Played seminar for Globe Education’s Read Not Dead reading of *Perkin Warbeck* in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse \(28/06/2015\), and wrote the programme note which argued that the play saw Henry VII as de facto king, but Warbeck as de jure monarch. She led the Rarely Played seminar for Globe Education’s Read not Dead reading of *The Fancies Chaste and Noble*, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse \(6/9/2015; audience of circa 50\), which used her work on the idiosyncrasy of Ford's theatre to account for this particularly oblique play, with its exceptionally laconic style. 

 Hopkins' Revels edition of *The Lady’s Trial* was used by Edward’s Boys for their performance of the play \(the first known since 1638\), seen by circa 1500 people across its six performances at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, King Edward VI School, Stratford, Queen Mary Grammar School, Walsall, and the Globe's Wanamaker Theatre. A recording is available on DVD \(47 copies sold in the UK, 8 overseas\). Audience feedback included: ' *my answer to your invitation to consider … whether this play is worth reviving is an emphatic ""yes""* '. The director said: '\[Hopkins'\] *edition is exemplary in its authoritative detail and clarity; the introduction and notes proved particularly valuable … since it was no longer possible to ask questions of Ford, the next best thing was to email Lisa after many rehearsals'* \( **E4**\). Hopkins wrote the programme note for this production and gave a talk at a Globe Education Study Day on Ford linked to the performance at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, September 2015. The Head of Globe Education acknowledged Hopkins' contribution: *'Thank you for all you did in support of the Ford season, culminating in your brilliant lecture … It was packed with information and ideas*' \( **E5**\). Audience feedback through questionnaires included: \[liked\]: *'the Gesualdo connection'*; *'clear explanation of problems to be addressed in performance'; '\[liked\]: 'elucidation of political elements'*, *'the placing of Perkin in the context of Shakespeare's history plays and Scottish history*' \( **E6**\). Hopkins wrote up both the John Ford Experiment and the Edward’s Boys' *Lady’s Trial* in a piece called ‘Body and Soul’ for *THE Culture* to share insights yielded by these stagings with an audience beyond Renaissance scholars \( **E7**\). 

####  Making Ford available to Russian Readers 

 Hopkins helped bring Ford to Russian readers by advising on the first Russian translation of *Perkin Warbeck* and writing an introduction giving a context for this new audience, particularly relating her work on Perkin Warbeck to the contemporary Russian pretenders \(the three False Dmitris\). The translator said that research by Hopkins 'revealed the wide historical and cultural context of the play, allowing for better stylistic decisions in the translation. I also greatly benefited from the personal communication with Hopkins who helped me setting up the overall understanding of the play and the epoch of Perkin Warbeck'. The translation and introduction were published in “ *Sovremennaya Dramaturgia*” \(“ *Modern Dramaturgy*”\), a quarterly magazine focusing on the theatrical repertoire. Many Russian public libraries subscribe to this journal, as well as theatres nationally, and a wider public interested in drama \( **E8**\). 

####  Enhancing A\-level Learning Resources on Ford 

 The inclusion of *’Tis Pity* on the A level syllabus led Hopkins to record a new lecture on the play for Massolit, which provides online A\-level learning resources \(2016\). The lecture drew on her work on stage\-space and on analysis of the recent Ford productions. The lecture has been watched 2,037 times since 2016, making it the second most popular non\-Shakespeare play on the site, and a number of log\-ins represent teachers showing the lecture to a class. \(E9\). 

####  Introducing Ford to a Wider Public 

 Public engagement included three talks which introduced Ford’s plays in the context of local and particular interests \( *Perkin Warbeck* at Tullie House Museum, Carlisle, the Lit and Phil in Newcastle; *The Witch of Edmonton*, part\-authored by Ford, to the 1152 Club, Kirkstall Abbey, Leeds; total audiences of circa 100\). Questionnaire responses praised material: *'about relationship between Scotland and England*', \[historical\] *attitudes towards the border'*; *'Ford's attitude to the monarchy'*, *'history of Perkin Warbeck'* \( **E10**\). 

 This overall programme of public engagement brought about a wide new awareness and understanding of the significance and value of Ford's theatre on stage and page for varied contemporary audiences and helped fulfil one of the aims of the John Ford Experiment and RSC productions: to show that his plays could and should be part of the contemporary theatrical as well as academic canon.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Jenny Phillimore and Dr Lisa Goodson have **transformed refugee integration policy and practice** and **contributed to more effective integration of refugees** into host societies through: 

1.  **re\-framing the UK Government’s Indicators of Integration**, the framework used to shape integration policy, practice and measurement by Government departments including the Home Office and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government; 

1.  **improving the design, quality and efficacy of the Community Sponsorship Scheme**, the UK Government’s flagship scheme to support the resettlement of vulnerable refugees and demonstrating the viability of the sponsorship model within Europe; 

1.  **improving the experience of refugees through upskilling of practitioners**, transforming the evidence base, building organisational capacity and improving access to services, and influencing co\-production practices outside of the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The population of refugees in the UK and across Europe has expanded over the past four decades. At the end of 2019, there were 133,083 refugees and 61,943 pending asylum cases in the UK \(UNHCR 2020\). The aim of refugee integration is to enable refugees to achieve their potential, protect their human rights, prevent marginalisation and foster social cohesion. The challenges of integrating refugees are significant and require substantive financial investment: the UK Government alone spent over £300 million on integration from 2008–2018, while the EU’s European Refugee Fund III \(2008–2013\), just one of multiple EU\-wide and national programmes, was valued at €628 million. 

-  Following a two\-decade long programme of research conducted with civil society, policy and academic partners, Professor Jenny Phillimore and Dr Lisa Goodson have challenged the conventional wisdom shaping integration policy and practice: that integration is the sole responsibility of refugees. Their programme of research has identified good practices, whilst uncovering what does not work. Additionally, it has provided insight into how to improve integration policy and practice, and associated outcomes \[R1\], and has changed practices in organisations working with refugees \[R2\]. Goodson’s development of a Community Practitioner Research Methodology established criteria for building the capacity of organisations working with refugees to collect evidence to support the development and effectiveness of refugee integration services \[R2\]. 

 **Key research findings** 

 **F1.** The ability of refugees to settle depends upon host communities’ willingness to interact with them \[R3\]. Integration is undermined when refugees are not welcomed, experience racist harassment and/or are excluded from decision\-making processes \[R1, R2\], and a lack of social networks leads to high levels of isolation and poor outcomes \(health, employment, language progression\). By contrast, refugee integration is more successful when host communities offer ready\-made social networks \[R4, R5\]. Employment provides a ready\-made social network and a mechanism to practise language skills \[R6\]. 

 **F2.** Social and personal networks, with ‘people like me’, are key to the successful integration of refugees \[R3\]. Rather than social bonds *between* refugees being anti\-integrative \(as per the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s Integrated Communities Strategy 2019\), *lack* of such networks undermines refugee integration \[R3, R4\]. Such networks are a vital source of social support for new refugees, and integration outcomes are better if refugees can form reciprocal relationships with other refugees \[R5\]. Supportive relationships between refugees improve access to services, enable emotional support and overcome language barriers \[R1, R3, R5\]. 

 **F3.** The Community Sponsorship Scheme \(CSS\), the UK Government’s flagship scheme to enable communities to sponsor the resettlement of vulnerable refugees, is sustainable in rural and urban areas. Sponsorship by communities provides a viable model for introducing refugees into new parts of the UK and Europe \[R4\], offering benefits for volunteers and the wider community \[R4\]. In less diverse areas, CSS enables contact between refugees and local people, and has the potential to transform attitudes to refugees and local organisational practice \[R4\]. 

 **F4.** Community Sponsorship volunteers offer refugees social capital that supports refugee participation in education, language learning and employment. Volunteers are motivated by different emotional drivers \[R4\] and reciprocity between volunteers and refugees underpins successful refugee integration \[R5\]. Recommendations to improve the outcomes of CSS covered areas include matching families to appropriate groups, improving volunteer support and streamlining application processes \[R4\]. 

 **F5.** Initiatives designed for and with refugees improve the likelihood that integration outcomes will be successful \[R1, R3, R6\] by ensuring that new and complex needs are fully understood \[R2\]. Local organisations are invaluable in supporting refugee integration \[R2, R3, R5\] and building their capacity through community research as a community engagement method can enable collation of local and experiential knowledge to form ‘community knowledge’. Such knowledge can be used to build organisational capacity to improve integration outcomes, bridging gaps between refugees, service providers and policymakers, and ensuring refugee needs are designed into policy and practice.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Working closely with policymakers, civil society organisations, and host and refugee communities, Phillimore and Goodson have **transformed refugee integration policy and practice** locally, nationally and internationally in three core areas. 

1.  <ins> **Shaping the Home Office’s Indicators of Integration framework and UK refugee integration policy**</ins> 

 Phillimore’s research evidence **directly shaped the UK Home Office’s refugee integration policy** by influencing the revision of the Indicators of Integration framework \[C1a, C1b; R1, R3, R5, R6\]. This is the only policy framework used by Government departments and local authorities to support approximately 20,000–25,000 refugees annually, and influences the UK government budget allocation via the Controlling Migration Fund and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund totalling over £338 million in the UK since 2008. The framework has shaped the scope and monitoring of the UK’s new £10 million refugee integration programme, the Refugee Transformation Outcome Fund \[C2\]. 

 Phillimore was one of three academics invited by the Home Office Head of Research and Policy to revise the UK’s Integration Indicators. She has embedded **good refugee integration practices in Home Office Policy** through co\-authoring the framework’s theory of change \[C1c\] and introducing over 100 new Indicators into the framework based on her findings \[R1, R3, R5, R6\]. The Indicators have become key benchmarks at national and local level, being described by the Minister of State for Immigration as “a key resource for integration practitioners at all levels, offering a common language for understanding, planning, monitoring and measuring integration, and supporting better and more tailored integration services” \[C1a, C1b\]. They include tackling racism \[F1; R1, R3; C1a\], adding social care and maternity care \[R1; C1a\], and including self\-employment for the first time \[R1, R3, R5, R6; C1a\]. The Indicators now include explicit references to the importance of diverse social networks \[R3, R5; F1, F2\], in order to **improve refugees’ social inclusion**. All additions enable users of the Indicators and associated documents to plan, provide and monitor initiatives addressing the full gamut of refugee and community integration needs \[C1d\]. The Head of the Home Office Policy Analysis Team emphasised the importance of Phillimore’s research stating “between 2017 and 2019, we have benefitted from your knowledge and expertise \[...\] and your work in revising the Indicators to produce new materials to ensure that the range of new tools now available to support the development of integration strategies are \[…\] accessible \[…\] to a range of different stakeholders.” \[C1b\]. Phillimore’s work underpins new local and national good\-practice sections for each indicator \[C1a, C1b, C2\] and she has subsequently co\-developed an Indicators training programme with the International Organization of Migration which builds the capacity of local authorities and civil society to use the Indicators \[C3\]. 43 local authorities and 17 civil society organisations have attended the programme. 

 Following Phillimore’s intervention, policymakers’ understandings of integration processes have shifted to acknowledge the role of receiving communities and Government \[R3, R5\]. The UK Immigration Minister points out that “integration also depends upon everyone taking responsibility for their own contribution, including newly arrived residents, receiving communities and government at all levels” \[C1a; R3\]. 

1.  <ins> **Improving the efficacy of civil society and practitioners at local, regional and international levels**</ins> 

 The programme of research **has improved the** **quality and efficacy of the UK’s Community Sponsorship Scheme \(CSS\) which has led to enhanced benefits** for refugee families and associated communities. CSS is overseen by the Home Office and the charity Reset, and is funded by the Home Office and philanthropy. Reset supports charities and community groups to participate in CSS, with 500 refugees being resettled as part of CSS since 2016. Reset’s Co\-director stated that Phillimore’s “research findings have emphasised and encouraged us to focus our efforts on a range of key issues” \[C4a; R4; F3, F4\]. The Home Office “immediately develop\[ed\] an action plan based on \[her\] recommendations” \[F3, F4; C4b; R4\], which enabled evidence\-based improvements to the CSS built on Phillimore’s recommendations, including **improving application processes** and **matching refugees and CSS groups** \[F3; C4b\]. 

 Capacity building through sponsorship was further increased through **improvements in the recruitment, retention and training of volunteers**. New training developed by Phillimore was provided to groups involved in the UK sponsorship scheme, including a summit that reached 50% of UK groups. One group leader stated that the research “helped \[them\] to understand the best ways to manage a group of volunteers and \[…\] how important it is for us to retain volunteers through building morale” \[C4c; R4\]. **Reset’s effectiveness has also been improved** by demonstrating gains both to refugees and volunteers from sponsorship \[F3\] through a programme that increased the number of sponsorship groups by 100% and thereby the capacity for resettlement. Capacity was also enhanced by Phillimore’s research presented in accessible formats \(e.g. ‘how to’ briefs\) which have been used for local education and training \[C4a\]. 

 The Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative \(GRSI\) have used Phillimore’s research \[F3\] to **encourage and support the adoption of Community Sponsorship internationally** \[C5; R4\], including: 

-  **Establishing and expanding community sponsorship** outside major urban areas, reducing xenophobia and improving outcomes for refugees \[C5; F3\]; 

-  **Reconfiguring monitoring and evaluation approaches to sponsorship** internationally through developing an approach combining qualitative and quantitative results \[F3\]; 

-  Expanding community sponsorship internationally by securing **political support at a Ministerial level in at least one European country** \[C5\]. 

 The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration \(2020\) cites Phillimore’s research \[R4; F3; C6a\] stating it demonstrates that the sponsorship model is viable with the Migration Policy Institute using the findings to highlight the positive impacts of resettling refugees to rural areas in Europe \[R4; F3; C6b\]. 

 **3. <ins>Upskilling organisations and practitioners leading to improved services for refugees**</ins> 

 Goodson has **improved responses and support for integration and resettlement** of refugees by capacity building in local organisations and communities, and demonstrating what works. This has been achieved through upskilling practitioners and developing a rigorous evidence base. She has **supported resettlement NGOs to identify collaborative ways of working** across diverse backgrounds \[F4, F5; R6\]. New training for 389 professionals and volunteers from across the public, private and voluntary sectors emphasised service delivery for vulnerable groups including Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme \(SVPRS\), unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children \(UASC\) and refugee families with no recourse to public funds \(NRPF\). Outcomes for participants included increased confidence, improved practice and extended support networks \[C7a\]. The materials were later developed into a ‘Syrian Refugee Toolkit’ \[C7b\]. 

 Goodson has also developed the capacity of local volunteers to become researchers and enhanced the evidence base through co\-production \[R2\]. The Community and Practitioner Research Programme \(CPRP\) has trained 179 individuals to collect robust data which can be used to enhance policy decisions on refugee integration and specialised interventions \[R2; F4; C8a–c\]. CPRP research: 

1.  Led to funding being secured for a new refugee Mental Health Hub at the Wolverhampton Refugee and Migrant Centre, which has **supported over 13,000 migrants** to date, ensuring that all refugees using the service are triaged for mental health and case workers are offered mental health support \[C8a\]; 

1.  **Developed the** **only assessment tool** for evaluating the resettlement needs in the ‘best interests’ of unaccompanied children \[C8b\]; and 

1.  **Expanded Hope Project’s legal work** \[C8c\], specifically in relation to client\-focused interventions providing support during the process to apply for leave to remain. 

 CPRP approaches have been emulated internationally by universities in Europe and Australia. The University of Bochum established Stadtteillabor \(City Lab\) based on learning from research underpinning the CPRP approach \[F5\] and with the direct support of Goodson. The Director of City Lab stated that “insights about the IRiS CPRP model directly influenced the development and establishment of a similar Community Research programme at the University of Applied Health Science at Bochum” \[C9\], which has established “a new relationship between the university and a marginalized urban community” and which received a Ministry commendation \[C10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mangroves are a critical ecosystem, under significant pressure, providing a host of ecosystem services with an estimated value of US$25 trillion annually. Aberystwyth University \(AU\)’s Earth Observation and Ecosystem Dynamics \(EOED\) Research Group led the scientific development of and technical implementation for mapping and monitoring mangrove forests globally through the Global Mangrove Watch \(GMW\). These GMW datasets form the reference mangrove extent for the UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\), tracking progress towards Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG\) 6.6.1, which aims to halt degradation and destruction of water\-related ecosystems. The GMW mangrove extent maps have also been used by NGOs and governments to monitor mangrove extent, in turn informing mangrove restoration and protection. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2014, AU’s Earth Observation and Ecosystem Dynamics \(EOED\) Research Group has focused on quantifying, understanding, and addressing local to global environmental change through Earth Observation \(EO\). This research has led to the Global Mangrove Watch \(GMW\) datasets, which focus on providing standardised and consistent global mapping of mangrove extent and change for multiple epochs to address a major global data and knowledge gap. 

 Mangroves are a highly dynamic biome where extensive changes occur over short temporal baselines \[3.2; 3.5\] due to anthropogenic disturbance \(e.g., aquaculture ponds\); natural events \(e.g., storms\) and processes \(e.g., erosion and deposition\); and climate change \(e.g., dieback\). Mangroves are critical for local communities across their range, as they provide essential ecosystem services such as coastal protection, harvestable wood, tourism, fisheries, and carbon sequestration. As an illustration, it has been estimated that there are 4,100,000 fishermen directly dependent on mangroves, predominately within developing countries. However, despite being needed urgently, maps depicting global changes in extent were not available. 

 The GMW was initially established in 2011 by Richard Lucas \(AU\) and Ake Rosenqvist \(soloEO\) as part of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency \(JAXA\) Kyoto and Carbon \(K&C\) Initiative to demonstrate the application of JAXA’s L\-band radar \(\~25 cm wavelength\) in climate science, conservation, and international conventions. In response, AU academics, led by Pete Bunting \[3.8; 3.9; 3.10\], developed the techniques and software to produce a new global baseline of mangrove extent for 2010 \[3.3\]. The challenge was primarily focused on separating mangroves from other land covers given the large variability in the contexts where mangroves are found globally, particularly following anthropogenic disturbance, but also to efficiently scaling data processing to handle the \~20 Tb of input data. The GMW has predominately relied on Synthetic Aperture Radar \(SAR\) data from JAXA. SAR allows cloud\-free monitoring but has less discrimination of mangroves from other vegetated land covers than optical \(visible to shortwave infrared wavelengths\) data. Therefore, AU also generated a 2010 composite of 15,000 optical Landsat images to enhance the global mangrove baseline mapping. 

 To support the generation of mangrove change layers from the 2010 baseline, AU subsequently developed a new map\-to\-image change approach \[3.4\], which allowed processing at large spatial scales and automated processing chains. Using this approach, mangrove changes from the 2010 baseline were identified using the JAXA L\-band SAR data, as these were also demonstrated as ideal for detecting changes in mangrove extent; lost, gained or stable \[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. For 1996, data from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite \(JERS\-1\) was used, mapping a mangrove extent of 142,005 km<sup>2</sup> ± 1,280. For between 2007 to 2009 and 2015 to 2018, data from JAXA’s ALOS PALSAR and ALOS\-2 PALSAR\-2 were used respectively, with 135,927 km<sup>2</sup> ± 1,276 of mangrove extent mapped for 2016. From 1996 to 2016, globally, mangrove forests were lost at a rate of \-0.22% per year \(Figure 1\). However, work at AU has also shown that since 2010, annual rates of mangrove forest loss had reduced from \-0.23% between 1996 and 2010 to \-0.09% between 2010 and 2016. 



 Figure 1. Global distribution of mangrove gains and losses from the GMW datasets, 1996 to 2016. 

 In addition to the GMW historical annual change maps of mangrove forest extent, the importance of identifying mangrove loss in near\-real\-time has also been highlighted \[3.1\]. To realise near\-real\-time GMW alerts, AU developed a new software system \[3.7; 3.9; 3.11\] that automates the download and analysis of the satellite imagery. Before this development, no software was freely available in the public domain to support such automated analysis. The change alerts are generated using Landsat 8 and Sentinel\-2 optical imagery through Normalised Difference Vegetation Index \(NDVI\) thresholding, with a scoring system used to confirm changes across multiple observations. The alerts have been generated for the African continent since 1 January 2020 and are released monthly via the Global Mangrove Watch web portal, developed by Wetlands International and released to the general public on 27 July 2020. The research continues with on\-going funding provided through donors to Wetlands International and The Nature Conservancy and will be expanding the geographic coverage of the monthly change alerts and further improving spatial detail and the generation of annual maps for other years.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Global Mangrove Watch \(GMW\) has provided global 25 m resolution maps of mangrove extent, making it possible to identify changes that are significant to local communities, but doing this with global coverage and impact. Maps for three epochs, mid\-1990s, 2007\-2010 and 2015\-2016 have been calculated, along with monthly change alerts for the Africa continent, from 1 January 2020. The GMW maps were released on 21 October 2018 at the Ramsar Congress of Parties \(COP\) and launched on the UN Open Data Viewer \(ODV\), from where they can be downloaded \[5.1; 5.2\], whilst also visualised on the Global Forest Watch \(GFW\) web portal; \[5.3\]. As of December 2020, the GMW data was the second most downloaded dataset on the ODV, with 7000 downloads \[5.4\]. 54% of which were by non\-academic organisations, including governments, non\-profits, and consultancies. 

 The GMW maps, showing changes in the extent of mangroves through time, have informed public policy and influenced decisions at many levels; internationally, through the UN SDGs \[5.4\], the actions of national governments, including Myanmar, Fiji, and Indonesia \[5.4; 5.5\], non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) including the World Wildlife Fund \(WWF\) \[5.4\], Wetlands International \(WI\) \[5.6\] and The Nature Conservancy \(TNC\) \[5.7\], and Industry, for example, through the Proteus Partnership \[5.4\]. 

 The United Nations Environment Program \(UNEP\) adopted the GMW dataset as the historical mangrove extent baseline for reporting against SDG 6.6.1 \[5.4; 5.6\]. SDG 6.6.1 aims to halt the degradation and destruction of water\-related ecosystems and aid the recovery of those already degraded. For this purpose, the UNEP launched the SDG661 app \[5.8\], which uses the 25 m GMW data, to represent mangrove ecosystems, providing nation states with accurate, high resolution, time\-series data on aquatic ecosystems \[5.4; 5.9\]. 

 GMW datasets have supported national governments and NGOs \[5.4; 5.5; 5.6; 5.7; 5.9\]. As highlighted by the UNEP Officer \[5.4\], many countries have limited capacity to process satellite sensor data. The GMW datasets, therefore, enabled all countries to benefit from such technologies, by providing up\-to\-date mapping information to inform their decision\-making, which they would not have otherwise have had access to. For example, the GMW datasets were used in Fiji to assess mangrove extent changes, ecosystem services, and to sustainably manage mangrove forests \[5.4; 5.5\]. The GMW data also enabled the WWF to leverage ‘ *innovative financing*’ for a business\-led waste management project in Fiji \[5.5\]. The Government of Myanmar integrated the GMW data within their Wetland Inventory, and Madagascar National Parks has used the GMW data to aid the sustainable management of their fisheries \[5.4\]. 

 Within Indonesia, the country with the largest extent of mangroves, the GMW datasets were used by various government bodies, in conjunction with the WWF to inform policy including informing management of the Marine Protected Areas \(MPAs\) \[5.5\]. MPAs with large mangrove losses were subsequently prioritised for increased conservation effort. A Senior Marine Scientist at the WWF\-US reports that the GMW data are ‘ *invaluable*’ enabling ‘ *much more prominent attention*’ to be bought to the plight of mangrove ecosystems \[5.5\]. 

 The Global Mangrove Watch layers were invaluable in informing the mangrove component of this work \- allowing national trends and provincial trends in mangrove extent and protection to be calculated. The availability of the Global Mangrove Watch data enabled mangroves to receive much more prominent attention in this work than would have been possible otherwise. \[5.5\] 

 From 1 January 2020, AU provided, in collaboration with Wetlands International \(WI\), monthly alerts of mangrove loss across the African continent \[5.6\]. These alerts are being used by WI staff to monitor mangrove changes on the ground and to track their success in decreasing the spatial extent and frequency of mangrove loss \[5.6\]. For example, within Guinea\-Bissau, the GMW monthly alerts identified mangrove loss areas that were previously unknown to WI staff. This enabled WI, through targeted field visits, to identify and understand the causes and introduce preventative actions \[5.6\]. AU also worked with WI to train their staff and local government agencies, in Tanzania in 2018 and Senegal in 2019, to use and validate the GMW datasets \[5.6; Figure 2\]. This included educating staff in the use of mobile apps and small drones to monitor and record changes in mangrove ecosystems \(e.g., changes in mangrove forest extent, mudflat erosion, and canopy cover\). WI field staff have subsequently used these technologies to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their field surveys, for example when monitoring mangrove restoration sites \[5.6\].

 On 27 July 2020, a new Global Mangrove Watch portal \(https://www.globalmangrovewatch.org\) \[5.2; 5.6; 5.10\] was launched by WI, TNC, AU and soloEO and made freely and openly available to all with support of the Global Mangrove Alliance \[5.10\]. The portal disseminates information on the state of mangroves globally, including the monthly alerts produced by AU. Mangrove extent data produced by AU is the key dataset within the portal to which all other products \(e.g., above, and below ground biomass\) are defined. Using the GMW data, TNC has produced a mangrove restoration potential map \[5.7\], which helps identify locations where mangrove restoration could be undertaken \[5.6\]. Being globally consistent and high spatial resolution, the GMW datasets have demonstrated local impact on individual catchments, regions and nations while also providing global impact defining the extent of mangrove ecosystems globally.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The UK Trade Policy Observatory \(UKTPO\), an interdisciplinary research centre led by economists at Sussex, has played a central role in the design of UK trade policy after Brexit, grounding the debate in robust data and realistic scenarios. Building on long\-standing expertise in international trade and applied econometric analysis to inform rapid\-response research on key issues, the UKTPO has provided rigorous and accessible analysis in the form of reports, videos, events, media commentary and responses to inquiries and consultations. These have helped to shape parliamentary discussions, public debate and government decisions. Many approaches to post\-Brexit trade policy by central government, devolved administrations and the opposition reflect the powerful influence of UKTPO research, including a policy statement by the Prime Minister. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The vote to leave the EU was a huge shock in a country with limited official, media or academic capacity to analyse market integration and trade policy, and followed a referendum characterised by a lack of clear information. Sussex, which has long specialised in international trade, responded rapidly by establishing the UKTPO in late June 2016 to provide immediate authoritative analysis to help reconfigure UK trade policy. The UKTPO assembles the country’s largest collection of academic expertise on the world trading system, with specialists in economics, law, international relations, business and management. This case focuses only on the economists’ research. 

 Brexit requires a wholly new set of trading relationships. The UKTPO’s ability to navigate these credibly derived from the breadth of its prior research, which covered most aspects of trade policy. UKTPO fellows \(not all represented in publications listed here\) had published over 190 journal articles from 2000 to June 2016, including in one top\-5 and several 4\* journals. 

 Brexit was unforeseen and the dissolution of deep trading arrangements is almost entirely unresearched. Moreover, the Brexit timetable was much shorter than the typical research project. Hence the requirement was to apply existing evidence and expertise to the new circumstances and get results out quickly and accessibly to inform debate and policy formulation. The body of research underpinning this case combines work conducted prior to 2016 \(and is thus not Brexit\-specific\) and after June 2016 \(published in more policy\-focused outlets\). The former include: 

 **\[R1\]** shows that membership of a free trade agreement \(FTA\) leads to improvements in partners’ terms of trade. The corollary is that leaving an agreement \(like the EU\) will almost certainly worsen the terms of trade and lead to significant losses of economic welfare. 

 **\[R2\]**, the first study of how accession to the European Economic Community affected the distribution of UK manufacturing jobs, with migration to the south and east as UK\-Europe trade grew. Similarly, Brexit will have heterogeneous regional effects. 

 **\[R3\]** shows the importance of distance, cultural affinity and policy restrictions in the determination of mergers and acquisitions in services sectors. Maintaining flows of foreign direct investment in the face of Brexit\-induced business frictions is a major objective of government policy. The UKTPO used insights from this paper in analysis \(published and presented privately to FCO\) of a potential UK\-Korea FTA. 

 UKTPO publications focused more directly on immediate trade policy questions include: 

 **\[R4\]** addresses the likely job losses from Brexit at the level of 122 manufacturing sectors, estimating that all forms of Brexit will raise prices for UK consumers and producers and reduce exports; it will reduce output in all but the few sectors that sell mainly into highly protected UK markets. There are significant differences between high\-tech and lower\-tech sectors. 

 **\[R5\]** estimates the effects of Brexit on jobs at regional and constituency levels. Its innovation is to analyse commuting patterns and so estimate job losses by residence rather than just workplace. 

 **\[R6\]** set out, in 2016, the negotiating challenges facing the UK under Brexit, including challenges of Rules of Origin in an FTA with the EU, the need for a transition period, the need to roll\-over the Generalized System of Preferences, the case for joining the Trans\-Pacific Partnership and the fact that tariff\-rate quotas would hinder renegotiation in the World Trade Organization \(WTO\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The UKTPO’s central objective has been to guide the formulation of UK trade policy in a way that delivers the best achievable outcome from Brexit and post\-Brexit trade policy. While politics has ultimately dominated decision\-making, the Observatory’s broad\-based engagement has strongly influenced post\-Brexit trade policy by shaping debate and facilitating public scrutiny. It has widened understanding, changed attitudes and improved capacities among policymakers – and thus influenced policy indirectly as well as contributing to policy directly, including the ’prevention of harm’. 

 **Shaping the debate** 

 In addition to academic outputs and frequent public events, from June 2016 to 30 December 2020 the UKTPO published 51 briefing papers, 187 blogs on its own website \(over half a million total views\), and a range of multimedia outputs on trade policy: infographics, podcasts and animated videos. UKTPO researchers have written numerous guest blogs and contributed to hundreds of media articles through their publications and interviews each year \(214 in 2020 with a potential combined audience of at least 1.14 billion, based on official audience and readership figures for each media outlet \- **S1**\). The animated videos have been used by third parties to explain trade: e.g. ‘Which?’ used them in its National Trade Conversation and commented “Your videos really helped people to understand the issues” \( **S2**\). UKTPO research has contributed to informing public understanding of trade policy challenges, often being the first to introduce key issues to the public. The Department for International Trade’s \(DIT\) chief economist wrote “We value UKTPO’s contribution to raising standards, which adds significantly to the quality of public discourse on trade and on trade policy” \( **S12**\). 

 **Providing public scrutiny** 

 Since June 2016, UKTPO fellows have submitted written or oral evidence to four government consultations and 37 UK parliamentary inquiries on trade issues. These submissions have been cited in several of the resulting committee and House of Commons Library Reports. The latter’s report on services trade made 27 references to UKTPO analysis \( **S3**\). UKTPO inputs have been acknowledged \[text removed for publication\] as influential, highlighting issues of concern to parliamentarians, aiding the scrutiny of policy proposals and contributing to their analysis of trade policy **\[R3, R6\]**: 

 \[text removed for publication\] **\(S4a\)**. 

 \[text removed for publication\] \( **S4b**\). 

 Key contributions to scrutiny include: 

 <ins>The difficulty of signing trade agreements</ins>: The UKTPO has consistently noted the challenges of merely rolling\-over existing trade agreements – and challenged UK Government announcements about them. Only seven out of 40 that needed rolling over had been signed by the initial Brexit Day \(29 March 2019\) and none replicated the status quo precisely. \[text removed for publication\] \( **S4a; S7: D, F, G**\) **.** 

 <ins>The costs of ‘no deal’ for manufacturing industry</ins>: The UKTPO published detailed modelling results of the effects of ‘no deal’ **\[R4\]**. This led to a project with EURIS, a trade association of manufacturers with a combined turnover of around £148 billion and 1.1 million employees, to help members comprehend the challenges and engage with government to explain the importance of frictionless trade with the EU for UK manufacturing. Much of this was done privately, but the final report was discussed with ministers and received strong media attention \( **S1**\). The Legal Director of BEAMA \(Legal Advisor to EURIS\) remarked: 

 “**UKTPO’s work on this project was extremely valuable, indeed essential in allowing the EURIS trade bodies and their members to understand … the enormous challenges which fundamental changes in international trading terms would present. Further it also allowed EURIS to present this analysis to the UK government … and achieve significant changes to government policy to mitigate the damage that a full severance of UK alignment with EU structures would cause” \(S5, S7: L\).** 

 <ins> **The local effect</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>of Brexit on jobs</ins>: Building on \[R2\], the UKTPO estimated the effects of Brexit by constituency and region \[R5\]; the results were discussed extensively in the media \(S1\) and were mentioned six times in Parliament \(S7: M, O, Q, S, T, V\).** 

 <ins>Northern Ireland \(NI\)</ins>: Winters submitted Expert Witness Evidence to the Scottish Court of Sessions in November 2019 showing that 75% of imports into NI would be subject to tariffs defined by the EU rather than the UK. The UK Government’s eventual response was to propose an Internal Market Bill that abrogated that part of the Withdrawal Agreement. Subsequent analysis for the Welsh Government explored the effects of the NI Protocol on Wales and underpinned that Government’s decision to refuse consent for the Withdrawal Act in January 2020 \( **S6a**\).

 **Influencing policy** 

 UKTPO research has been cited in Parliament 31 times \( **S7**\) and regularly used by DIT. DIT’s chief economist wrote: 

 “at the working level, colleagues make substantial use of the wide range of briefing papers and blogs which UKTPO have published…. We have good access to expertise and thought leadership … of the UKTPO… These sessions strengthen the advice that we forward to senior officials and ministers as the basis for policy decisions, such as drawing up priorities in negotiations of trade agreements”, and “We know we can rely on high\-quality analysis but also a solid understanding of the policy framework we operate within. Crucially, within DIT we often talk about whether our own analysis will pass ""the UKTPO test"" when it gets into the public domain: notwithstanding our highly collaborative relationship, we know UKTPO will be first to challenge our analysis if we do not maintain the same high analytical standards” \( **S12**\). 

 <ins>Transitional arrangements:</ins> The UKTPO outlined the need for a transition period in October 2016 \(Briefing Paper 2 and **\[R6\]**\) and explicitly noted that it needed to replicate current conditions. Following private meetings with the UKTPO, the opposition made the case “to stay inside the single market and abide by all EU rules during the transitional period and possibly beyond” \( **S8b**\). Subsequently, the Government accepted the former as policy in July 2017 \( **S8c**\). 

 <ins>Customs Union:</ins> This was a contentious issue in the debate about what kind of Brexit should be pursued. In  [February 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/25/labour-backs-staying-in-eu-customs-union-keir-starmer-confirms), following further meetings with the UKTPO, Labour argued for seeking a customs union in the long run. During spring 2019 the debate and cross\-party talks revolved almost entirely around Labour’s demand that the future trade arrangement with the EU include a customs union. Referring to these discussions, \[text removed for publication\] \( **S8a**\). 

 <ins>Trade policy with developing countries:</ins> In September 2016, the UKTPO explained the overwhelming case for continuing ‘Everything But Arms’ trade preferences for least developed countries. In July 2017, the UK Government stated its intention to do so in accordance with UKTPO recommendations \( **S9a**\). \[text removed for publication\] \( **S9b**\). 

 <ins>Freeports</ins><ins>:</ins> Widely publicised UKTPO research has shown that Freeports offer little prospect of significant economic benefits for the UK. This “help\[ed\] shape thinking surrounding freeports” in the Scottish Parliament \( **S7: Y**\), which subsequently defined policy “that it would turn down Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s offer of introducing free ports in Scotland” \( **S10**\). 

 <ins>Export Restrictions</ins><ins>:</ins> UKTPO research on export restrictions \(Briefing Paper 40\) was the first to describe a reciprocal trade bargain for COVID\-critical goods whereby WTO members commit not to increase import restrictions on medical goods after the COVID crisis abates and, in return, exporters constrain \(not abolish\) their ability to limit exports of such goods. This, and many of the practical details provided in that paper, was adopted as UK policy \( **S12**\), and was described in the following terms by the UK Prime Minister in his speech to the UN General Assembly: 

 “So I would urge every country to take a fifth step and lift the export controls wherever possible – and agree not to revive them – and cancel any tariffs on the vital tools of our struggle: … The UK will do this as soon as our new independent tariff regime comes into effect on 1st January and I hope others will do the same” \( **S11**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bowel cancer screening is estimated to save around 2,400 lives per year and reduces NHS costs. Sheffield research evaluated different options for the bowel cancer screening programme including the optimal design for repeated Faecal Immunochemical Test \(FIT\) screening. This research directly informed the 2016 UK National Screening Committee recommendation to replace the guaiac occult blood test \(gFOBt\) with the FIT. UK roll\-out of FIT screening began in 2017. Moving to FIT results in higher participation \(59% to 66%\) and higher levels of detection. Projections suggest that moving from gFOBt to FIT enables a lifetime reduction of cancer related mortality of 8%. The overall net monetary benefit is estimated as £107.3m.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer with approximately 41,000 diagnoses and 16,000 deaths each year in the UK. Bowel cancer screening has reduced morbidity and mortality. The School of Health and Related Research \(ScHARR\) at the University of Sheffield has been working with the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\), Public Health England and UK National Screening Committee \(NSC\) since 2004 to support evidence\-based policy making in bowel cancer screening. 

 Bowel cancer screening is a complex intervention with multiple components. Sheffield research focuses upon the development of mathematical models of the bowel cancer screening system, including disease natural history, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance, and the application of these models to inform policy decisions. Between 2010\-2012 ScHARR undertook a reappraisal of bowel cancer screening options on behalf of NHS Cancer Screening Programmes. This involved collaboration to incorporate data from clinical trials and routine screening data. Model results suggested that screening strategies involving Flexible Sigmoidoscopy \(FS\) or FIT may produce additional benefits compared with the existing biennial guaiac occult blood testing \(gFOBT\) screening strategy as they are both more sensitive tests. The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest quality\-adjusted life year gain was 55. Strategies which combined FS and FIT showed further benefits and improved economic outcomes. These results were not obtainable from trials alone and required our modelling \[R1, R2\]. 

 FS screening for 55\-year\-olds \(in addition to repeated gFOBT\) was introduced in 2013 under the name ‘bowel scope screening’. Due to capacity constraints bowel scope screening is not yet available in all areas of the UK. Uptake was low at 43% and there were some differences in detection rates compared to the trial setting. 

 In 2016 Sheffield researchers were funded by the UK NSC to undertake further research drawing on data from the bowel scope screening programme. The first research phase considered the cost\-effectiveness and endoscopy capacity requirements of a variety of different screening options incorporating FIT \[R3\], based on modelling using ScHARR’s validated model \[R4\]. The second phase of the research developed a new version of the model which uses a patient level simulation approach to enable evaluation of the impact of screening on health inequalities and the evaluation of targeted and personalised screening strategies. 

 Our analysis showed that FIT is a cost\-effective test to use in the bowel screening programme. The ideal age to start is at 50/51 years, recommended screening interval was two years and the FIT threshold should be 20 µg/g \(or as low as possible with available colonoscopy capacity\) \[R3\]. 

 The key constraint limiting further optimisation of the UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme \(BCSP\) is NHS colonoscopy capacity, with screening referrals to colonoscopy competing with cancer investigations and surveillance in the symptomatic and previously treated populations. In light of this constraint, the British Society of Gastroenterology \(BSG\) commissioned a review of surveillance guidelines, resulting in the 2018/19 guidelines for surveillance post\-polypectomy/colorectal resection from the BSG, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland \(ACPGBI\) and Public Health England \(PHE\). A systematic review was undertaken by ScHARR to support this Guideline development and found that patients with low risk adenomas are not at increased risk of bowel cancer compared to patients with no adenomas detected at colonoscopy. Dr Whyte acted as a Member of the BSG guideline development group playing a key role as the only health economist in the group \[R5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sheffield research provided key evidence to inform national policy recommendations and implementation of bowel cancer screening in the UK. Refining and optimising bowel cancer screening programmes from gFOBT to FIT enables the NHS to save costs, reduce cancer morbidity, save lives and in some cases prevent potential harm associated with screening. 

 Change in policy and practice 

 Our work on optimising the design of the FIT based screening programme directly informed the recommendations of the UK NSC. In January 2016, the UK NSC recommended a change to the primary test used in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme from gFOBt to FIT \[S1\]. In August 2018, following further review of the evidence, the UK NSC recommended that FIT is offered at 50\-74 years at as low a threshold as possible \[S1\]. Sheffield research is directly cited in the evidence used to inform these recommendations \[S1\]. 

 The introduction of FIT into the screening programme provides further opportunity to detect and prevent more cancers. The benefits of using FIT are that: 

-  it is easier to use and can be measured more reliably using a machine rather than the human eye; 

-  the increased sensitivity enables FIT to detect more pre\-cancer lesions; 

-  FIT requires a single faecal sample and is more acceptable to people invited to screening; 

-  FIT is a cost\-effective alternative to gFOBt \[S1\]. 

 Following the recommendations of the UK NSC, FIT was rolled out across the UK \[S2\]: 

-  In Scotland, FIT replaced gFOBt as the test for bowel screening in November 2017 \(ages 50\-74, threshold 80 μgHb/g faeces\). 

-  In England, FIT was introduced in June 2019 \(ages 60\-74, threshold 120 μgHb/g faeces\). 

-  In Wales FIT started to replace gFOBt through a phased roll out, with 1 in 28 people receiving the new kit from the end of January 2019, \(ages 60\-74, threshold 150 μgHb/g faeces\). 

-  In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health announced on 11 April 2019 to roll out FIT from early 2020, \(ages 60\-74\). 

 Improving patient health outcomes and cost savings to the NHS 

 The ‘Report of the Independent Review of Adult National Screening Programmes in England’ \(October 2019\) for NHS England indicates that bowel cancer screening is estimated to save around 2,400 lives per year. In 2017/18, 4.4m people were invited for screening with 2.5m people screened. This represents an increase in bowel cancer screening since 2016/17 \[S3\]. 



 *Source: \[S3\] Report of the Independent Review of Adult National Screening Programmes in England, p.65* 

 Data from the first 12 months of FIT screening in Scotland showed an increase in uptake from 55.4% for gFOBT up to 63.9% for FIT. In Scotland the biggest improvement in participation with FIT has been amongst those living in the most deprived areas – up from 42.0% to 51.8% \[S4\]. FIT has the potential to reduce health inequalities due to higher uptake in more deprived subgroups. 

 Data from the first 6 months after FIT screening began in England, indicates that between 1 July 2019\-30 September 2019 that the proportion of men and women aged 60\-74 invited to participate in bowel cancer screening that adequately participate is 67.5% and between 1 Oct 2019\-31 December 2019 this is 64.5% \[S5\]. Uptake from the first 6 months is in line with earlier predictions made in the modelling. 

 The impact on patient outcomes cannot be fully demonstrated in a short timeframe as screening that results in the prompt removal of precancerous conditions may prevent the future CRC \(colorectal cancer\) incidence and mortality. However, our model predictions for England show that the move from gFOBT to FIT \(with 40% also offered Bowel Scope screening\) is predicted to be associated with a net monetary benefit of £107.3m; quality adjusted life year gains, 4,006; lifetime reduction in bowel cancer 8%; lifetime reduction in CRC mortality, 8%; reduction in late stage incidence, 8% \[S6\] 

 Surveillance of persons following screening colonoscopy 

 The British Society of Gastroenterology \(BSG\) adenoma surveillance guidelines were updated in November 2019 and are NICE compliant. The new guidelines recommend a reduction in surveillance for persons who are at a low risk of CRC. These new guidelines will reduce unnecessary colonoscopies and harm, save NHS money, and free up endoscopy capacity to be better used elsewhere. It is possible that by reducing the endoscopy requirements for adenoma surveillance and symptomatic referrals could enable expansion of the FIT screening programme. 

 While it is still early to assess the direct effects of the new guidelines, modelling undertaken by St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust provide an estimate of the potential cost savings and capacity that could be generated, *“Implementing the 2019 guideline will lead to an annual cost saving of £75,159 to £87,699, depending on the number of patients <45 years old offered colonoscopy surveillance, and generate capacity for 177 to 207 additional colonoscopies per year”* \[S7\]. 

 Informing international policy and practice 

 Sheffield research is included in the International Handbook of Cancer Prevention by the International Agency for Research on Cancer \(IARC\) of the World Health Organisation, 2019. The IARC Handbooks evaluate the published scientific evidence of cancer\-preventive interventions and provide authoritative information about cancer research \[S8\]. 

 Dr Whyte contributed to the World Endoscopy Organization \(WEO\) international delphi consensus process which led to the publication of Principles for Evaluation of Surveillance After Removal of Colorectal Polyps \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Middlesex University Business School’s research into workplace exploitation led by Clark, produced robust evidence on the scale of the issue of the non\-payment of wages by employers, amounting to £3.1 billion annually. Use of these findings by organisations seeking to advance the interests of vulnerable workers initiated widespread political and media discussion of this previously ignored issue. This impacted political debate through Early Day Motions and parliamentary questions and the work of the Director of Labour Market Enforcement \(DLME\), and stimulated further policy\-oriented research. Findings directly impacted government employment rights policy through the ‘Good Work Plan’, specifically in relation to: \(1\) enforcement of entitlement to holiday pay for vulnerable workers; \(2\) improvements to payslip entitlement and information provision on payslips; and \(3\) greater effort to pursue directors evading employment obligations. This improved enforcement of entitlement to unpaid wages directly benefitted over 2 million of Britain’s lowest paid workers.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Non\-payment of wages was scarcely researched in Britain when this research project began. A programme of research undertaken in the Business School at Middlesex since 2005 focused upon the challenges of effective regulation in low paid sectors of the labour market. This included work by Croucher on enforcing the National Minimum Wage \(NMW\) commissioned by the Low Pay Commission and its impact on low paying sectors \[3.1\], research by James on supply chain regulation \[3.2\], and by Blitz on migrant workers in the shadow economy \[3.3\]. 

 Findings here demonstrated the particular challenges faced by vulnerable workers in low paid and informal working and the necessity for effective enforcement alongside mandatory regulation. Croucher’s work successfully argued for increased recognition of the right to NMW, and via work with the Low Pay Commission, contributed directly to the introduction of tougher enforcement and penalties where underpayment took place. Clark’s previous work \(at the Working Lives Research Institute, London Metropolitan University\) analysed the regulation of labour market intermediaries in relation to labour trafficking and similarly identified the need for stronger enforcement regimes. The development of research into the non\-payment of workers adopted the approach developed in the NMW project of combining scholarly publication with efforts to influence policy and practice more directly. In 2015, Clark successfully gained funding from the Trust for London for a two\-year project on *Unpaid Britain.* As PI on this project, Clark combined academic research skills with a background in trade unionism, which included expertise in providing advice and advocacy to low\-paid workers and experience as a member of the original Board of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority \(GLAA\). 

 *Unpaid Britain* combined secondary analysis of labour market statistics, archival research of Employment Tribunal judgments and documents at Companies House, with semi\-structured interviews, and case studies. The research was guided by an invited expert Project Advisory Group \(PAG\) including academics Professor Bridget Anderson \(University of Oxford\) and Professor Phil James \(Middlesex\), and participants drawn from the GLAA, trade unions \(Unite and GMB\), NGOs and providers of legal advice providers \(e.g. Citizens’ Advice Bureau and Thompsons Solicitors\). 

 The principal findings of the *Unpaid Britain* report \[3.4\] included: 

1.  An estimation of the scale of unpaid wages in the economy each year of £3.1bn, comprising £1.3bn of unpaid wages and £1.8bn of unpaid holiday pay; a scale of ‘wage theft’ far greater than previously thought. At least 2 million workers faced underpayment in the UK each year; 

1.  1 in 12 workers received no payslip and a major growth in the provision of electronic payslips had given rise to further complications for many low paid workers; 

1.  Some employers adopted methods to achieve underpayment which included: the misclassification of workers as self\-employed; unpaid periods at the beginning or end of shifts; under\-counting of hours; non\-payment of holidays; delayed payments; unlawful deductions from pay; pretended ignorance of regulations; and cessation of pay, either deliberately or inadvertently, around impending insolvency; 

1.  Owners and directors rarely faced investigation and a pattern of repeat offences by certain employers was evident. This included companies being wound up and relaunched under new names \(‘phoenixing’\), and litigation and contractual strategies to evade paying wages in full; 

1.  Failure to enforce the recovery of unpaid sums and an effective lack of enforcement with regard to unpaid holiday pay. National Minimum Wage \(NMW\) arrears when detected often took years to be paid and only 52% of awards won by workers via Employment Tribunals were paid in full; 

1.  A lack of clarity over which state enforcement bodies enforced the non\-payment of wages. For the non\-payment of holiday pay, this led to existing state enforcement bodies neglecting this issue and failing to act in an integrated manner; 

1.  Young workers in particular were poorly informed of their rights or how to enforce them. 

 The report made a number of recommendations. These included: improved enforcement against non\-payment of holiday pay and the non\-provision of payslips and the introduction of deterrent policies; providing improved access to advice and advocacy particularly for low paid and vulnerable workers; creating stronger measures to recover unpaid sums; introducing tougher sanctions against company directors and the use of “phoenixing” where employment obligations are purposefully evaded; increasing training in employment rights for students; and ensuring that existing state enforcement bodies took responsibility for paying workers identified NMW arrears and collecting them from the employer. 

 Subsequent work developed the analysis of the challenges of enforcement and wage recovery in more detail, including further work identifying the different business models pursued by employers based on the non\-compliance of workers’ rights \[3.5\]. Further research examined employment issues of young people in full\-time study, with results from a pilot study demonstrating the long hours being worked by commuter students and their lack of awareness of basic employment rights \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Raising public debate on unpaid wages 

 At the time the research was funded, the issue of unpaid wages had been almost totally neglected in employment research within the UK. The final project report was launched at a major conference in November 2017, with over 100 non\-academics attending including employers, trade unions, professional associations, regulators, journalists and, lawyers and an address from the UK Director of Labour Market Enforcement \(DLME\). Further dissemination took place through presentation of findings to the DLME, the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) Labour Market Directorate, the Employment Law Advisors Network and sectoral committees of the union Unite. A widely read project blog \( [www.unpaidbritain.org](http://www.unpaidbritain.org/)\) launched in 2017, which included practical advice for workers seeking to recover unpaid wages, continued to receive an average 60 views per day in 2020. 

 The increased public interest in working practices following the publication of the Taylor Review in 2017, resulted in the *Unpaid Britain* report receiving widespread media coverage, including detailed reports by *The Guardian* of both interim and final reports. Public discussion of the issues raised by the report led to the tabling of an Early Day Motion \(EDM 670, Dec 2017\), signed by 73 MPs. This stated: “ *That this House notes with deep concern the findings of the recent research report by Middlesex University Business School, Unpaid Britain: wage default in the British labour market, that at least two million workers experience non\-payment of wages or holiday pay each year*”, and called for stronger enforcement on this issue \[5.1\]. The report led to Parliamentary Questions put by the Leader of the Green Party on 20<sup>th</sup> December 2017, and was directly cited in support of a private members’ Bill in a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 26 October 2018 \[5.2\]. Clark was also an advisor to Channel 4’s *Dispatches* investigation into labour exploitation involving room cleaners working in Premier Inns, with the resulting television programme watched by over 2 million viewers. 

 The originality of the insights of the *Unpaid Britain* research directly generated further research on this previously neglected topic. For example, the NGO Latin American Women’s Rights investigation of Latin American migrant women in cleaning, hospitality, and domestic work, drew on the *Unpaid Britain* report to produce findings on non\-wage payment \[5.3\]. Two novel indicators of abuse used in the *Unpaid Britain* project \- the proportion of Labour Force Survey respondents reporting no “paid holiday” entitlement, and the proportion of Family Resource Survey respondents reporting not being given a payslip – were directly incorporated into further BEIS commissioned research in 2019 \[5.4\], as well as the Resolution Foundation’s three\-year investigation into workplace enforcement initiated in 2019. The finding that working, full time students were particularly badly treated on issues of wage non\-payment, led to further work by Clark and colleagues on this issue \[3.6\], leading to the launch of a new employment rights service for Middlesex University students in 2021. 

 The findings of the *Unpaid Britain* report informed the actions of a range of governmental and non\-governmental bodies, nationally and locally. The report’s recommendation for the need to provide more practical advice and advocacy, with a key role for non\-governmental bodies on the issue of unpaid wages, informed the Legal Action Group in the launch of their online employment advice service in February 2019 \[5.5\]. Local impacts were exemplified by the “Weymouth & Portland Action on Wages” group, partly created in response to the report, whose Chair stated: *“The report and its findings made a significant impact on those present and shaped an agenda for action on poverty wages in the area”* \[5.6\]. 

####  Influencing government policy on employment rights and their enforcement 

 The enhanced public debate generated on unpaid wages created a context in which the *Unpaid Britain* findings impacted directly upon government policy and practice, resulting in over 2 million of Britain’s lowest paid workers directly benefitting from improved publicity and enforcement of entitlement to unpaid wages. A House of Commons Environment Audit Committee’s report noted that: “ *Researchers from Middlesex University working on the Unpaid Britain project have argued that consequences for non\-payment of holiday pay and minimum wage are so weak that they do not present a sufficient deterrent to employers with many continuing to reoffend.”* \(HC 981, 15 November 2018\) \[5.7\]. Significantly, the Director of UK Labour Market Enforcement \(DLME\), cited the *Unpaid Britain* report’s findings in evidence to House of Commons select committees \[5.8\], as well as in his own 2018/19 enforcement Strategy document. The DLME stated: 

 “*One of my tasks as Director of Labour Market Enforcement is to estimate the extent of wage underpayment. The key source on this issue is Clark and Herman \(2017\)… Clark and Herman’s £3.1 billion \[of unpaid wages\] is around 4% of their \[workers in the bottom three deciles of the wage distribution\] wage bill. The £3.1 billion figure is equivalent to around £470 per worker for the 6.6 million workers in the bottom three deciles. One of my recommendations in Strategy 1 published May 2018 was that HMRC or another state body should have responsibility for enforcing holiday pay. This recommendation was accepted \(December 2018\). Therefore Nick Clark has had a profound impact on the welfare of British workers”* \[5.9\] *.* 

 In 2018, the Government produced their “Good Work Plan” \[5.10\] which responded to the DLME’s recommendations.  Here the government committed to a wide range of policy and legislative changes to create an enforcement system ‘fair and fit for purpose’. It included a number of specific recommendations from the *Unpaid Britain* report, namely: \(1\) a government plan to enforce entitlement to holiday pay for vulnerable workers; \(2\) improvements to entitlement to, and additional information on, payslips; and \(3\) greater effort to pursue directors “phoenixing’ in order to evade employment obligations. As part of the response to vulnerable workers not receiving holiday pay, BEIS led the government’s major public awareness campaign on this issue in 2019, with officials consulting Clark over strategy design. The resulting holiday pay rights campaign included new guidelines, an online entitlement calculator to make it easier for employers and workers to calculate holiday pay, and an emphasis upon the responsibility of businesses to ensure workers receive the correct pay. Throughout the campaign material, *Unpaid Britain’s* estimate of £1.8bn in unpaid holiday figured centrally, along with a supporting statement by Clark \[5.11\]. 

 A further key finding of the *Unpaid Britain* report was the lack of clarity over which state body had responsibility for enforcing the payment of holiday pay, highlighting the lack of integration between existing labour market state enforcement bodies. This directly informed the government announcement of a consultation exercise, which ran between July and October 2019, to examine the possible merging of existing state enforcement bodies into one fully fledged labour market Inspectorate. Proposals to improve enforcement featured in the Queen’s Speech of 14 October 2019 and are currently under development, so as the DLME observed: *“Nick Clark may indirectly have also been a catalyst for such an Inspectorate”* \[5.9\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Rupert Read has a long track record of research in the field of environmental philosophy. Developing and building on this work over the census period, Read came to focus on the ways in which we ‘value’ nature and calculate risks in environmental policy but also in other areas of politics and economics. In particular, he has argued for the value of the ‘Precautionary Principle’ \[PP\] and its application in policy. Read’s research reinterprets the PP to improve its effectiveness in reducing harm in situations where ‘full’ scientific evidence is not available. This research has challenged conventional wisdom about risk and stimulated debate among a range of stakeholders and, through direct engagement, it has had a demonstrable and significant impact on British government policymakers and Parliamentarians. It has helped them to question and improve public policy, and it has led to changes in policy frameworks shaping UK government actions as evidenced by, for example, alterations in working definitions used by The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\). 

 Read’s work in environmental philosophy has made an influential contribution to the media, most notably the BBC \(changing the BBC’s policy on reporting climate change following a sustained campaign across social and print media\), and to civil society campaigns \(most notably Extinction Rebellion\). Consequently, and through Read’s public advocacy, his philosophical research has helped to shape and inform public attitudes and values, enabled challenges to established norms and practices and raised awareness of serious and irreversible risks. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Read’s research reveals the ethical necessity of acknowledging the extent of ecological and climate crisis. Drawing originally on the Wittgensteinian tradition \( **3.1, 3.5**\), he developed a critique of technocratic and ‘scientistic’ ways of thinking while proposing new ways of understanding our responsibilities to the planet and to future generations. This research led to novel interdisciplinary collaborative work with the academic economist \(and former MEP\) Molly Scott Cato \( **3.2**\) and with the public intellectual and specialist in Risk Engineering Nassim Nicholas Taleb \( **3.3\)**. Drawing on this work, with AHRC funding for a Research Network, Read brought together philosophers and other academic specialists with stakeholders from organisations such as Friends of the Earth and Natural England, accountants and politicians. The network’s research showed the inadequacy of valuing nature by reducing it to economistic measures and the potential importance of the PP as an alternative to the influential ‘ecosystem services’ approach. 

 In order to make the PP more effective, Read’s work has narrowed the scope for when it comes into play, allowing for the corollary to be drawn: that the PP should be taken to *bar* any route that may reasonably be regarded as issuing in serious and irreversible risks. This argument takes into account the important *asymmetries* at play: risks of ruin \(e.g. ecological collapse\) should be considered weightier than opportunities for benefit, firstly, because no potential benefit, however great, can compensate for a risk of ruin or collapse; and secondly, because those subject to risk are rarely identical with those potentially benefitting from, or those making, the decision \( **3.3**\). Read’s research thus reframes the PP as an insistence that such risky routes be barred and that other − often more innovative − routes be sought out \( **3.4**\). 

 A second insight from Read’s work comes from questioning the ‘scientism’ \( **3.1**\) that can result if decision\-making gets forced into the mould of model and evidence. Noting that many scientists are more worried about producing ‘false positives’ as opposed to ‘false negatives,’ Read highlights how this reduces and dangerously delays the chance of reckoning with potential threats \( **3.4**\). These scientists can then appear to argue plausibly against precaution, invoking ‘sound science’ and criticising so\-called ‘alarmism’. A precautionary approach can and should restructure our modes of decision\-making away from the hegemonic emphasis on ‘evidence\-based’ thinking. It is reckless to insist upon an evidence\-base sufficient to motivate a proposed course of action if, by the time the evidence is in, serious and irreversible harm may have been done. Read’s research applies this thinking to complex systems such as climate science \( **3.6**\) studies, where a full evidence base is even now not available, genetically modified organisms \( **3.3**\) and other novel substances. In applying this precautionary standard, Read’s work with Taleb \( **3.3**\) argues that the alleged evidence\-base for the safety of various proposed courses is moot since on the timescale appropriate to the decision \(e.g. natural timescales\) the alleged evidence is often statistically insignificant. Absence of evidence of harm is thus not evidence of absence of harm. In cases like climate science, it is the latter that should be demanded, and in its absence, precaution should reign.

 4. Details of the impact 

 Read’s arguments about the risks and challenges of climate crisis and about the power of the Precautionary Principle have challenged the conventional wisdom of Parliamentarians, policy makers and other stakeholders, informing practice and leading to changes in processes of policy formation, evaluation and decision\-making. His arguments have reached a wide public audience, improving awareness, stimulating widespread debate about environmental policy planning and motivating political engagement. 

 Read’s ‘Debating Nature’s Value’ \( **3.7**\) AHRC\-funded Research Network brought researchers together with practitioners from a wide range of groups including Friends of the Earth, Natural England and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales \(ICAEW\), and resulted in a submission of evidence to Environmental Audit \(UK Parliament\) in February 2018. With the ICAEW as partner, the project secured AHRC Follow\-On Funding \( **3.8**\) to develop impact on Parliament and on the policy process, including meetings with Parliamentarians in Westminster. 

 **Impact on Government and Parliament** 

 In October 2017, Read and UEA colleague Prof. Tim O’Riordan briefed key parliamentarians at the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for Limits to Growth on the merits of applying the PP to the Great Repeal Bill, which would transpose EU law into domestic law as part of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. The meeting was attended by twenty MPs and Lords. After the briefing, Read and O’Riordan were invited to circulate an official APPG note \( **5.3**\) on embedding the PP in policymaking post\-Brexit. Together, their briefing and note had a direct influence on \[\*redact\*\] \[\*redacted\*\] questioning of Secretary of State Michael Gove at the Environmental Audit Committee. \[\*redacted\*\], formerly Labour’s Environment spokesperson, commented \( **5.3**\): 

 *“Dr. Read has helped me navigate the tricky waters of the Precautionary Principle in the last few years, by providing briefings and, in particular, with his presentation to the Limits to Growth All\-Party Parliamentary Group, which helped me prepare for the tough line of questioning of Secretary of State, Michael Gove, that I undertook soon after that at the Environmental Audit Committee”.*

 While directly advising Government, Read also presented his research to the House of Lords in a series of three briefings, commissioned by the APPG on Agroecology \( **5.4**\). This led to his drafting \[\* redacted text \* redacted\] *speech* in a key debate on Brexit, trade and environmental principles, in May 2019. In \[\* redacted text \*\] words \( **5.3**\): 

 *“\[Read’s\] tireless work on the \[Precautionary Principle\] has greatly helped my own work \(e.g. in the speech he drafted for me in the key Lords debate on the topic\) and the work of other Parliamentarians”.* 

 The compromise settled on by the House of Commons was very similar in nature to one Read had called for in a blogpost \( **5.2**\) that appears to have influenced the Secretary of State in the same way Read’s APPG note had previously. This interpretation of what happened is directly supported by \[\* redacted text \*\] testimonial \( **5.8b**\) on Read’s influence upon him: 

 *“Rupert Read’s work has been a lodestar in offering a joined\-up ‘green’ philosophy. His work has been especially important to me in setting out a rationale for the retention of the Precautionary Principle as Britain leaves the EU. In particular, the report that Read co\-authored in 2017 on this matter influenced my thinking \(and alerted me to key sources\) for how best to retain the Precautionary Principle in the post\-Brexit environmental architecture”.* 

 \[\* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \*\[\* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* \* redacted text \* redacted text \*\] This was the first declaration of a climate emergency by a national Parliament in the world and was the first huge success of XR towards attaining its demands. 

 \[\* redacted text \*\] sums up the ways that Read has given specific technical help to Parliamentarians *and* had a broader impact upon the entire debate \( **5.3**\): 

 *“Rupert Read has become a ‘go to' thought\-leader for all things precautionary. And, in this era of ecological emergency, there could be little that’s more important. Read’s way of formulating the Precautionary Principle helps bring out how decisive the Principle is − or should be − when it comes to existential threats, such as climate, especially, now presents. His written and oral presentations to the APPG Limits to Growth on the Precautionary Principle helped me and Parliamentary colleagues to get clear on the strong salience of the Principle to the wording of the 'Great Repeal Bill’ in particular: i.e. to what it would take to prevent the Principle from being gutted by the Brexit process. This in turn helped me clarify my thoughts in the same ballpark when it came to questioning the Secretary of State \(Michael Gove\) on 1 Nov. 2017, in the Environmental Audit Committee. These are just examples; I could give others. Read’s advice and thinking in this domain is ongoing and I expect to be availing myself of more of it in the coming years, especially \(though not only\) in relation to the post\-Brexit environment”.* 

 Read’s influence has spanned the entire political spectrum. \[\* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text  redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \*\] 

 **Impact on the BBC** 

 In the summer of 2018, as Read’s work on the PP was becoming more influential, he led a campaign for the BBC to change its policy on reporting anthropogenic climate\-change: specifically, to give up its policy of using climate\-deniers as ‘balance’. Read argued that it was reckless to pretend that the debate over climate was still ‘wide open’, pointing out that, even if it were, precautionary considerations are decisive given there is an existential risk in play. 

 Read’s tweet on this went viral: it was retweeted 42,000 times and seen by 8,000,000 people \( **5.6**\). Read was commissioned to write an article for *The Guardian* \( **5.6**\), explaining what had happened. Drawing on his existing research and impact\-activities, Read’s article presented a strong case for the utility of the precautionary principle in policymaking; the article was shared 10,000 times \( **5.6**\) and viewed approximately 1,000,000 times. 

 The BBC then reached out to Read in several ways, \[redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \*\]. This led to Read co\-ordinating a major multi\-signed letter on the topic \( **5.6\)**, also published in *The Guardian,* and again featuring the PP prominently in its reasoning for why it is reckless and inappropriate to ‘balance’ ‘debates’ on dangerous anthropogenic climate change with climate deniers. The open letter was co\-signed by climate scientists and public figures, including Jonathon Porritt, Peter Tatchell, George Monbiot, and elected Parliamentarians from Labour, the LibDems and Greens. 

 Read’s letter resulted in the BBC changing its policy \( **5.8c**, **5.8d**\): a month later, Fran Unsworth, BBC director of news & current affairs, issued a briefing note saying, “ *Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often”* \( **5.6**\). The new advice from the BBC told staff: *“You do not need a ‘denier’ to balance the debate”,* exactly what Read’s campaign had demanded earlier that summer **.** \[\* redacted text \*\] \( **5.8c**\), now the BBC’s leading wildlife programme\-maker, commented: 

 *“It’s common\-knowledge across the BBC that Prof. Rupert Read played the pivotal role in getting the BBC finally to stop seeking ‘balance’ from climate\-change\-deniers, in 2018. In this matter, Read has been not only an intellectual showing leadership on climate and precaution, but one who has turned that leadership into significant impact on the world beyond the academy. Like many others at the BBC, I’m grateful to Read for that”.* 

 **Impact on civil society campaigns and public understanding** 

 Read’s thought\-leadership on precaution has influenced XR itself \( **5.8a**\): he got the PP highlighted in XR’s science\-communication \(especially its recent document Emergency on Planet Earth\), and in the main XR talk *“Heading for extinction and what to do about it”,* which is a template talk given repeatedly on video and in person to different audiences *.* 

 Both directly through his own work \(appearing on Radio 3’s *Freethinking* and The World Service’s *The Forum* to discuss precaution\) and through his work with XR, Read has been able to have an impact on public understanding. He has appeared as a panellist on flagship BBC programmes such as *Question Time* and *The Today Programme*. Furthermore, through a series of viral YouTube videos he has reached a wide audience of nearly 1,500,000 people explaining and promoting understanding of both the risks of climate breakdown and the importance of the PP. As noted already by \[\* redacted text \*\] in her testimonial, quoted above, it is evident how Read has thereby impacted upon an entire climate of public opinion.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Essex research on a key set of non\-cognitive and socio\-emotional skills in schoolchildren led to changes to school curricula and the introduction of new financial literacy programmes in Turkey. Alan’s research and rigorous evaluations of innovative educational programs implemented in under\-privileged schools in Turkey, led the Ministry of National Education to launch a similar nationwide curriculum in primary and post\-primary schools to improve non\-cognitive skills through the Design\-Skill Labs. Work with ING Bank Turkey led to the introduction of a financial literacy programme for schoolchildren while Alan’s research was drawn upon by the World Bank to cultivate socio\-emotional skills amongst students in North Macedonia.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 There has been widespread concern over poor school outcomes and widening achievement gaps in most countries where educational policy actions tend to face challenges in engaging families of low socioeconomic strata. A growing body of research shows that certain attitudes and personality traits, also referred to as “non\-cognitive skills,” are strongly associated with achievement in various economic and social domains. 

 Since 2013, Alan’s research \[R1\-R6\] at Essex has evaluated channels through which economic outcomes of disadvantaged children \(with a particular focus on girls\) can be improved in the classroom environment. The aim of the research was to improve a key set of non\-cognitive skills in children of different age groups in a classroom environment by their own teachers. This research brings together academics, the public sector \(Turkish Ministry of National Education \[MoNE\]\), the private sector and NGOs involved in education and issues regarding achievement gaps across gender and socio\-economic strata. 

 An initial study, a randomized evaluation of a unique educational intervention involving 2500 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grade elementary school students in Turkey, which was carried out in collaboration with ING Bank as part of a corporate social responsibility project, looked at patience in relation to student achievement outcomes \[R1\]. The intervention, designed by Alan, aimed to improve the ability to imagine future selves, and encourage forward\-looking behaviour using a structured curriculum delivered by the children’s own, trained teachers. It was shown that treated students become more patient in intertemporal decisions in incentivized experimental tasks and this effect persists for over a year after the initial intervention. This research also provides strong evidence that the specifically designed curriculum that aimed to foster forward\-looking behaviour in children improves behaviour in classroom as assessed by behavioural grade. 

 Further work carried out in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of National Education evaluated another of Alan’s innovative educational interventions focused on “grit” \[R2\]. This research, involving over 3000 elementary school students, demonstrated that a program, which fosters grit and instils a growth mind\-set in children, significantly improves test scores, and that this improvement can persist for as long as 3 years after the implementation of the program. The method used to evaluate grit in this study, known as the “Alan\-Ertac Grit Measure” is now considered to be one of the most reliable inventories to elicit grit for a multitude of purposes and is used in several World Bank projects and by researchers in economics and psychology. 

 The research provides evidence that low\-cost educational interventions directed at elementary school students designed to improve non\-cognitive skills can have substantial impact on outcomes such as grades and behavioural conduct at school. Given the pivotal role of non\-cognitive skills for academic achievement and labour market success, this evidence has important implications for policy.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Alan’s research and expertise led to her involvement as a key academic advisor on the importance of socio\-emotional skills and key non\-cognitive skills for institutions, banks and policy makers in Turkey and Macedonia. Collaborating with ING Bank, the Turkish Ministry of National Education and the World Bank, Professor Alan developed training materials, implemented and evaluated unique and innovative educational interventions to foster key non\-cognitive and socio\-emotional skills as an indispensable element of children’s academic success. 

 **Changes to the National Curriculum in Turkey** 

 Alan’s research on the role of non\-cognitive skills in success alongside the application of grit measurement methodology, the ‘Alan\-Ertac Grit measure’ \[R2\] led to the implementation of a new education policy to restructure primary and secondary education in Turkey to foster socio\-emotional and non\-cognitive skills such as patience and grit through a nationwide change to the curriculum. 

 The research, impact evaluations and RCTs, which involved designing and implementing unique curricula and teacher training practices to improve key socio\-emotional skills in socioeconomically disadvantaged elementary school children, shows that programmes which foster grit and instil a growth mind\-set in children, significantly improve student attainment and behaviour \[R2\] \[S1\]. The intervention was a low\-cost way of fostering non\-cognitive skills in the classroom and thus offers a solution for reducing achievement gaps where educational policy actions aiming to enhance family inputs face challenges in engaging families of low socioeconomic strata. This research directly influenced the design and subsequent delivery of a new element in the curricula for primary and secondary schools to teach non\-cognitive skills and prompted the Turkish Ministry of National Education to amend their overarching curriculum with the introduction of ‘Design\-Skill Labs’ \[S2\]. 

 The Turkish MoNE sets out in its 2023 vision that the curriculum is restructured as a series of flexible and modular structures, linked with skill sets, in an integrated manner across all levels. Based on Alan’s research and intervention \[R2\] a key part of this is the national rollout of the Design\-Skill Labs, which form part of the teaching in classrooms and affect the built environment with schoolyards re\-designed to transform them into spaces with real life experiences \[S3\]. The amendment to the curriculum is set to continue from primary into secondary education, Goal 2 of the 2023 Vision: Design\-Skill Workshops will be established at schools so that the knowledge gained can be translated into living skills \[S4\]. 

 Turkey's Education Vision 2023 published by the Ministry of National Education states: 

 *‘Design\-Skills Labs will be established at all schools for the development of the interests, talents, and character of our children. The curriculum will emphasize production, doing, interaction and deepening instead of revolving around testing and lecturing. Design\-Skill Labs will serve as the instrument of such a curriculum approach. The Design\-Skill Labs began as a pilot during 2019\-2020. They will help students experience a process of self\-revelation in which they can take time to think, design, and produce*.’ \[S4 p25\] 

 **Improved financial literacy through the ING Bank Orange Drops programme in Turkey** 

 Essex research on fostering key non\-cognitive skills such as patience and self\-control \[R3\] led to Professor Alan’s involvement with ING Bank’s Orange Drop financial literacy programme for children aged 8 and 9. Alan led the development and implementation of this financial literacy programme, which educates Turkish schoolchildren about the importance of saving and aims to make positive change in communities \[S5\]. 

 Alan’s research \[R5\] identified and developed a number of key skills around ‘patience’ and ‘grit’ and she led an interdisciplinary team of experts who focused on each of these skills in isolation to develop a novel curriculum for each. 

 Following the initial Orange Drop intervention led by Professor Alan a change in behaviour was reported. The ING Annual Report of 2017 states: 

-  Students became 21% more patient after the program. 

-  Students learned to be future\-oriented and to wait for bigger gains. 

-  While boys were less patient than girls at the beginning of the program, a stronger change in behaviour was observed in boys afterwards, and boys became 23% more patient. 

-  A positive relationship was established between patience in spending and academic success. 

-  The impact on relatively poorly achieving pupils in school was a more pronounced 36% \[S6\]. 

 This programme is the first single financial literacy education and social responsibility project by ING for Turkey's elementary school students, and encourages positive behavioural changes addressing low personal rates of saving and the lack of financial literacy. Since ING has been running Orange Drops, 1,213 teachers have taught the programme in 329 schools, benefiting 38,835 schoolchildren \[S7, S8\]. 

 **Cultivating non\-cognitive skills in students in North Macedonia** 

 Professor Alan was invited to be an academic advisor for the second phase of a World Bank funded project in North Macedonia \(titled ‘Learning By Doing’\) cultivating socio\-emotional skills in 8<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade students. Building on existing research \[R1, R3\], as well as the successful interventions on grit and perseverance in Turkey, Professor Alan contributed to the design of a unique curriculum on socio\-emotional skills which concentrated on expanding the existing program and introduced a unique mentorship component in the second phase \[S9\]. Alan generated intervention materials to be used in schools in North Macedonia that focused on socio\-emotional skills developed to close gaps in education and labour markets \[R4, R6\]. Professor Alan designed and ran the evaluation, the measurement instruments and analysis of the intervention programme between February 2019 and May 2019. The objective of Learning By Doing was to implement a mind\-set intervention as part of the current high school curricula to cultivate growth mind\-sets and students ability to set goals and act on their intentions amongst 8<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade students in a subset of schools in North Macedonia. 

 The World Bank confirm: *‘In light of her expertise and success implementing interventions at scale, Professor Alan was invited to collaborate with the World Bank team on the second phase of a socio\-emotional skills program in North Macedonia…Initial results show significant and positive impacts of the intervention on deliberate practice beliefs, growth mindset, curiosity and frustration tolerance for the average student…Results led to the government to start a third phase of work \(postponed due to Covid\-19\) focussing on teachers practices’* \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Three interconnected projects have allowed Garrington and curator, artist, and archivist collaborators to develop new audiences for the rich expedition\-related archives and art collections of the UK. Together they have used the concept and talking point of ‘heroism’ to shift the ways that archives and collections are accessed, displayed, and understood. Research regarding expeditionary history and its literary records led to events and exhibitions that changed public perception of and engagement with British exploration, with impact in the areas of \(1\) curation, \(2\) conversation, \(3\) careers, and \(4\) communities. The projects created new artistic and curatorial practices and paradigms with lasting effect on National Galleries Scotland, Royal Geographical Society and Mountain Heritage Trust; they provided new ways for young people to tackle difficult conversations regarding body image and identity, particularly in Personal and Social Education \(PSE\) contexts; they influenced the practice and career trajectory of two commissioned artists; and they facilitated local community involvement in the interpretation of archive acquisitions. Beneficiaries therefore included: museums, galleries, and archives; practising artists; and public audiences of all ages, but in particular the 16 to 18 age group. This work attracted commercial sponsorship from the outdoor brand Montane in addition to funding from Arts Council England \(ACE\) and the Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Consideration of how expeditionary mountain experience might best be rendered in written forms led to R1, the first academic piece to study in detail the mountaineer George Mallory’s letters to Marjorie Holmes, held at the Royal Geographical Society \(RGS\). Garrington was invited to write more about letters as a vehicle for mountain narratives for the *Alpine Journal* \(established 1863\), part of a drive to return literary scholarship to its place in the Alpine Club’s journal of record \(R2\). R1 and R2, as well as the wider body of mountain work outlined below, led to a more nuanced appreciation of heroism ‘on the hill’ \(i.e. in mountaineering practice and its literary record\) and thence the ways in which heroism is depicted and recorded in archives and portrait collections. Briefing senior staff at National Galleries Scotland \(NGS\) about this research led to the co\-curated ‘No Heroes Any More?’ online exhibition \(2018\) and its related schools workshops and PSE classes, focusing on issues of gender identity, body image, and bravery. R1 and R2 also provided the underpinning research for a ‘pop\-up’ exhibition in the Great Hall of the RGS, considering ‘The Heroic Body on Expedition’ \(2016\), which displayed prints made for the first time from 1920s Everest expedition glass plates that were not previously available for public viewing. A sold\-out Durham Book Festival event with poet/author Helen Mort brought consideration of the anti\-heroic and sensory engagement with mountain environments to a broad public audience \(2018\). New archive/artist/gallery connections were made, using mountain archives that were crucial to the preparation of R1 and R2, forming long\-term collaborations in ‘The Hero Project,’ ‘Savage Arena,’ and ‘Scaling the Heights’ exhibitions and related events \(below\), directly influencing the sites of artistic interventions by Stephen and Kate Livingstone. S. Livingstone’s multi\-year engagement with mountain cultures has been the result, while K. Livingstone has developed new artistic techniques in response to time in the archives \(E10\). Garrington’s research regarding the British Everest expeditions of the 1920s \(R1; R2\) resulted in the incorporation of Bentley Beetham’s photographic collection in S. Livingstone’s practice, including the reinterpretation of some images previously mislabelled \(E10\). Garrington’s research into George Mallory and his posthumous reputation \(R1; R2\) also shed light on Tasker, whose renowned expeditions with Pete Boardman have frequently seen them compared to Mallory and Sandy Irvine c. 60 years before. Tasker’s own interest in mountain literature was revealed by Garrington’s research to be rooted in early twentieth\-century writing; topics central to the ‘Savage Arena’ exhibition, and the re\-evaluation of Tasker as a consciously literary writer of mountain accounts, as attendees observed \(E5\). 

 Garrington’s wider mountain work in the 2015\-2020 period, which has led towards her forthcoming monograph *High Modernism: A Literary History of Mountaineering, 1890\-1945*, includes: a presentation at Kendal Mountain Festival \(2015\), where she has also contributed to programming \(2015,’16,’17\); the ‘Writing Mountains’ third\-year undergraduate module at Durham University \(2016\-present\); work on the advisory committee for the ‘Performing Mountains’ \(AHRC\) project led by Prof. Jonathan Pitches \(Leeds\) \(2017\-2019\); 15 academic and public engagement talks around the world, including a broadcast for the BBC Proms \(2018\); and an interdisciplinary panel on ‘Performing the Archive’ at the ‘Performing Mountains’ conference \(2018\). She was the first academic to complete a joint Visiting Research Fellowship between the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh, and the Mountaineering and Polar Collections of the National Library of Scotland \(2014\-2015\). Garrington has been consulted by the BBC on mountain\- and exploration\-related programming, including the recent BBC2 ‘Icons’ series.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 The projects considered here include: 

 **‘The Hero Project’** \(funded by the AHRC\) in collaboration with the RGS and NGS, including the online exhibition ‘No Heroes Any More?,’ co\-curated with young people aged 16 to 18, which reinterpreted the NGS’s newly digitised collections, as well as a major international conference \(including the ‘The Heroic Body on Expedition’ exhibition, above\) at the RGS. 

 **‘Savage Arena: The Legacy of Joe Tasker’** \(funded by the HLF\) in collaboration with the Mountain Heritage Trust \(MHT\), which interpreted and displayed a newly acquired archive relating to the renowned mountaineer, leading to exhibitions at Ushaw College, Durham \(Tasker’s former seminary\), Keswick Museum in the English Lakes, and Preston Park Museum, Stockton. 

 **‘Scaling the Heights’** \(funded by ACE\), in collaboration with artists Stephen and Kate Livingstone, which staged artistic interventions at 11 major mountain/geological archive collections around the UK, leading to an exhibition at the Oriental Museum, Durham, touring to Keswick Museum, accompanied by a programme of public events and ‘pop\-ups’ to bring mountains to the widest possible audience. 

 Impact was achieved in the following areas: 

####  1. CURATION: Developing new models 

 ‘The Hero Project’ team \(PI Garrington, with politics and history colleagues from Aberdeen and Birmingham universities\) worked with NGS to formulate a new model of curation, holding workshops in five Scottish schools to debate and to make art about the concept of the ‘hero’ \(E1\), drawing out the attitudes of young people aged 16 to 18, and co\-creating with a team of those pupils an online exhibition, ‘No Heroes Any More?’ \(E4\). Deputy Director and Chief Curator of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery \(SNPG\), Edinburgh, Imogen Gibbon stated that this project ‘was invaluable for NGS in exploring the historical and contemporary significance of the idea of the “hero” in relation to the national collection of portraiture,’ and that ‘\[Garrington’s\] research on mountaineers and adventurers established a framework’ for the project \(E3\). The exhibition displayed pupils’ artwork alongside the newly digitised collections of the NGS that had inspired them, while the questions, surveys, and links for further information were informed by topics raised in workshop discussion. Pupils were also involved in image selection, tone, labelling, and the design/look of the exhibition itself, which was then produced by a commercial third party – the first time that the NGS had consulted young co\-curators in this way \(E3\). Gibbon notes that ‘The Hero Project’ has ‘helped serve as a model for subsequent outreach projects and exhibitions which have sought young people’s views,’ including *The Art of the Future* \(2018\) and *Beings* \(2019\) \(E3\). The exhibition now functions as a resource for teachers \(in PSE, art, geography, history, and beyond\) or young people browsing independently, and has been accessed by 500 school users since launch \(E3\). Gibbon reported that the project ‘delivered the aims of the NGS Audience Framework: to grow, broaden, engage and retain our audiences,’ and further that ‘all elements of the project will have a lasting legacy on our continued research into the collection,’ citing recent work on a ‘Heroes and Heroines’ gallery at the SNPG, NGS advisory work on the ‘Hall of Heroes’ at the National Wallace Monument \(Stirling\), and the intention to use a hero\-focused approach in forthcoming work on the historic SNPG Great Hall and its murals \(E3\). 

 The ‘Scaling the Heights’ exhibition used innovative creative practices, centred upon vintage Action Man figures restaging Himalayan mountaineering expeditions of the twentieth century on the shelves of significant mountain archives \(in doing so, ‘performing’ the archive\), and being filmed and photographed for later exhibition display in the form of artists books. This offered a model of how the work of an artist might be used to engage with archival material in unprecedented ways, in turn encouraging audience interest in the resulting art works, the archives, and their literary holdings, as well as developing the artist’s practice in new directions \(see below\). At the Oriental Museum and Keswick Museum sites, Garrington and S. Livingstone curated a historically informed art exhibition in museum contexts. They presented their findings via a ‘Performing the Mountain Archive’ panel at the international ‘Performing Mountains’ conference \(2018\). ‘Scaling the Heights’ was a featured image in the UK Government’s The National Archives annual poster summarising innovative national activity in 2019. Visitors to the Oriental Museum called the exhibition ‘beautifully displayed’; ‘informative and fascinating’; ‘a neat way to link climbing with literature’; ‘a new way of looking at mountaineering and \[…\] journeying’ \(E9\). At Keswick Museum, the exhibition attracted 14,127 visitors \(E9\). 

####  2. CONVERSATION: Initiating ‘difficult’ discussions in the classroom 

 ‘The Hero Project’ established heroism as a vital launching\-point for discussion in school subjects including PSE, pedagogical approaches for which are currently under review by the Scottish Government as part of its ‘Mental Health Strategy 2017\-2027.’ Both pupils and teachers reported the value of the ‘hero’ topic, encouraging discussion about national and personal identity, body image, celebrity culture, and our relationship to historical figures at a time when ‘hero’ discourse is again on the rise. Frances Moffat, Head of Art at The Gordon Schools \(Huntly\) praised the ‘No Heroes Any More?’ exhibition as a discussion\-prompting resource that ‘creat\[ed\] a dynamic debate linking historical figures’ to those currently in the ‘public eye,’ and remarking that ‘many of the issues \[raised\] have become almost prophetic’ \(E3\). Pupils asked to reflect on their use of the exhibition in 2020 noted that it made national collections accessible on your phone; ‘gives people a greater understanding of the reasons behind things in galleries’; through displaying pupil\-produced artwork, offered the chance to see other young people ‘progressing in their skills’; and ‘was a good way to modernise art and include \[…\] young people’ \(E2\). This helped the NGS to respond to the ‘key strategy driver’ of Partnership \(with collaborators and schools\), contributed to its ongoing Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Review of the national collections, and led towards the prioritisation of ‘identity and portraiture’ in the current NGS Research Framework \(E3\). 

####  3. CAREERS: Shaping artists’ skills development and trajectory 

 The ‘Scaling the Heights’ exhibition sought to introduce play and imagination into the presentation of mountain stories, suggesting that climbing, if only in the mind, is available to all, a concept that united Garrington and collaborating artists Stephen and Kate Livingstone \(E10\). The exhibition appeared at the Oriental Museum, alongside archive material and ephemera borrowed from the MHT and RGS, in Autumn 2018, toured to Keswick Museum between February 2019 and January 2020, and appeared in ‘pop\-up’ form at several climbing walls and health centres in the North East between 2018 and 2019. The visual appeal of the miniature mountaineers, promoted through an Instagram account, influenced other artists, and in 2018 *The Guardian*’s *Review* magazine featured a front cover of doll figures mountaineering on book stacks, under the title ‘Scaling the Heights.’ The outdoor kit company Montane promoted the Action Men ‘climbing’ in one of their stores, and in 2018 used them at a trade show to provide the centrepiece to their display, featuring them on their own social media accounts, showing that artistic interventions in the history of mountaineering can support commercial aims. S. Livingstone had not worked on mountain topics prior to his collaboration with Garrington, but in response to her research he developed ‘Scaling the Heights,’ a supplementary project for Keswick Museum \(‘The Lost Tent’; funded by ACE\) that used her work on Everest 1924 photography of Bentley Beetham, and a wider practice of mountain\-inspired artists books. He states Garrington’s research had ‘a big impact upon my own ideas and upon the scope and ambition of the project.’ In addition, ‘the question of heroism shaped the way I began to examine the relationships \[…\] occurring within two\-man high altitude climbing teams’ \(E10\). 

 As well as creating pathways to funding via ACE and Montane \(his first commercial sponsorship\), collaboration with Garrington resulted in ‘a multi\-dimensional piece of work which enabled me to develop a wide range of new skills and creative methods,’ as well as supplying inspiration ‘to carry out in\-depth reading and research into new and very fertile subject matter’ \(E10\). S. Livingstone reports that he will continue to work on mountain topics as a result of this project, including a substantial forthcoming collaboration with The Bowes Museum and the Bentley Beetham Trust to commemorate the 1924 Everest expedition centenary \(E10\). K. Livingstone developed a new printmaking technique, based on Japanese Suminagashi, inspired by a trip with Garrington to the Mountaineering and Polar Collections of the National Library of Scotland, viewing Everest\-related scrapbooks, and the marbled endpapers of their historic Graham Brown mountain collections. Her prints, picking up colour palettes from Garrington’s research materials, were displayed as part of ‘Scaling the Heights’ at the Oriental Museum. Although not advertised for sale, the set of ten prints were all purchased during the exhibition run, showing the commercial appeal of her new mountain archive\-influenced art practice, which she calls ‘a new and exciting direction’ \(E10\). 

####  4. COMMUNITIES: Reaching and involving diverse audiences 

 The three projects aimed to celebrate mountain archives and expedition\-connected art collections and to widen and diversify their audiences using heroism as a point of debate. The innovations of ‘Scaling the Heights’ supplied a ‘way in’ for those interested in mountain topics, but unsure whether mountain culture was ‘for them.’ 81% of responding visitors to ‘Scaling the Heights’ at the Oriental Museum stated that they had learnt something new about mountains and mountaineering. 86% of visitors answered ‘yes’ or ‘maybe’ when asked if they would now be more likely to visit one of the archives used in the creation of the exhibition. Meanwhile, 81% of visitors would be more likely to seek out books about the expeditions depicted; 82% of visitors planned to read more about mountains/mountaineering; 82% of visitors were more likely to head outdoors for an adventure of their own, inspired by the Action Men. Most importantly, 84% of visitors recorded feeling that ‘the history of mountaineering is relevant to me,’ although, as one respondent put it, ‘I didn’t think it would be before I came\!’ \(E9\). Interviews with visitors at the Oriental Museum registered the value of researcher/artist collaborations \(‘by working with somebody else who’s in a different field from you, you suddenly discover all these new and amazing things so \[to\] see the way they’ve worked together was very interesting’\), and commended the opportunity to access such an exhibition in the North East \(‘I think it’s just very special to have it here in Durham. \[…\] It’s quite unusual to have something which is obviously three years in the making \[…\] \[I’m\] very grateful.’\) \(E9\). 

 The ‘Savage Arena’ exhibition allowed the Joe Tasker Collections, newly acquired by the Mountain Heritage Trust, to be supplemented and clarified via information from family members, Ushaw College \(where Tasker trained for the priesthood prior to his mountaineering career\) and its alumni, and the local North East community, which in turn informed revisions to labelling and accession information \(E8; pp. 6\-7\). Combined with Garrington’s research regarding Tasker’s place in a lineage of mountain literature \(see above\), these efforts change our understanding of his body of work, and contribute to a forthcoming biography of Tasker by leading mountain writer Ed Douglas. ‘Savage Arena’ was the MHT’s first substantial academic collaboration, demonstrating that their extensive holdings could be brought to public audiences, and strengthening their relationship with Keswick Museum \(E8; p. 11\). The collaboration between Garrington and the MHT also provided a mobile exhibition to assist in promoting the work of the Trust in ‘non\-traditional’ exhibition spaces such as climbing walls and festivals \(E8; p. 12\). 36,059 visitors saw the exhibition during its tour \(E7\) assisted by BBC radio coverage \(E6\), with visitors saying ‘the reminiscences of those Joe influenced \[…\] were too beautiful. I cried several times’; ‘a great homage to his life’; ‘loved the connection with the storytelling’ \(E5\). Further, it allowed Ushaw College to commemorate one of its most famous alumni, and school friends, staff, and family members to mourn a mountaineer whose body was never found. 

 The three projects of this case study have therefore curated, discussed, performed, made, and interpreted innovatively, with benefits for individuals \(including creative practitioners\), lasting changes for newly diverse audiences, and long\-term strategy shifts for major expeditionary and cultural institutions.

###  **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Waiton has delivered impact in the areas of the ‘policing’ and criminalisation of everyday life, with particular reference to the Scottish context. 

 Waiton’s research identified the development of ‘risk’\-based practices in Scotland that undermined the autonomy of families. This research contributed significantly to the repeal of the Scottish Government’s Named Person initiative, which breached human rights laws on privacy, lacked a clear definition of ‘wellbeing’, and unreasonably expanded state intervention into the family unit. The Supreme Court ruled against the Named Person initiative in July 2016. 

 Waiton’s research showed that Football fans were being over\-criminalised as a result of the targeted and prejudicial nature of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in Scotland.  His research contributed significantly to the repeal of the act in March 2018 on the basis that the act excessively expanded the criminalisation of language and discriminated against football fans.

###  **2. Underpinning research** 

####  **Overview** 

 Waiton’s research provides original and significant insights into the ‘policing’ and criminalisation of everyday life. His work stems from the observation that life is increasingly policed by public authorities \(in particular the state\) which progressively expand their policing processes into various areas of social life, subsuming a broader range of normal, everyday social actions and relations under categories of deviance or even crime. The idea that the state becomes increasingly involved in the micro\-management of everyday life, is what the German sociologist Habermas called the ‘colonisation of the lifeworld’. 

 Waiton’s qualitative research combines wider sociological theories and action research with public service users and stakeholders to study the ‘policing’ and criminalisation of everyday private life. It combines a socio\-legal analysis with political sociology to address the construction of social problems of everyday life, engaging stakeholders and newly formed, sometimes temporary, social movements. Waiton’s research also has international relevance at a theoretical level through its conceptualisation of the ‘new class’ \(understood here to be the new political and cultural elites and the bureaucracy that sustains it\), their changing values and subsequent changes in the nature of the state and to law. This new managerial form of governing enacted by the ‘new class’ focuses on micro\-management of relationships in society and has been assisted by the largely unquestioned rise of therapeutic responses, focused on the emotional well\-being of the public as a basis for creating a better society **\[3.1\]**. 

####  **Named Person Scheme** 

 The Named Person scheme was a Scottish Government initiative to give every child in Scotland an assigned named person from birth who would be responsible for helping the child get support if and when they needed it. Whilst predicated on increasing the well\-being of children in the country, this initiative is an example of the state micro\-management and colonisation of everyday life, with policy makers becoming increasingly concerned about the relationship between parents and children. The Named Person initiative would have transformed the basis of data sharing and in part, state intervention, from a risk/welfare framework to one based on the far broader idea of early intervention to ‘promote the wellbeing’ of all children and young people. As a new universal approach to child safety and children’s services more generally, the potential impact of the Named Person scheme on families and professionals working with families across Scotland was significant. A range of parent and professional groups opposed this expanding role of the state into family life. 

 Waiton’s research highlighted the developing ‘risk’\-based practices emerging in Scotland that undermined autonomy through a therapeutic governing of families **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. The work interlinked theoretical arguments with participation research developed with parents’ groups.  Waiton developed a conceptual understanding of the ‘well\-being state’ through a documentary analysis of family policies, with specific reference to the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014 **\[3.3\]**. This research builds upon Waiton’s approach to ‘amoral panics’, the growth of risk management in family policies, and the development of professional ‘experts’ of parenting. It examines how parental authority and autonomy are undermined by ‘early intervention’ initiatives and the ‘new authoritarianism’ apparent in the creation of the Named Person policy **\[3.4\]**. This work highlighted the disjuncture between policy makers and parents, the problematic and ill\-defined transformation of the welfare state to what was defined here as ‘Third Way Parenting’ – a new type of micro\-management of everyday private life. 

####  **Offensive Behaviour at Football Act** 

 The Offensive Behaviour at Football Act expanded the policing of language in Scotland specifically in relation to football fans. This is another relevant example of the criminalisation of everyday life. Waiton’s research showed that fans were being over\-criminalised as a result of the targeted and prejudicial nature of the new act, which undermined the universality and legitimacy of law. Furthermore, the research developed an understanding of a new form of intra\-fan ‘sectarianism’ that elevated the alleged intolerance of ‘offended’ fans in response to the Act. 

  

 Waiton engaged in participation action research with football fans to address the problem of discriminatory policing and the over\-regulation of language.  He analysed online fan discussions to develop a new understanding of the role played by the criminalisation of language in creating new types of ‘offensiveness’ through which sectarian rivalries were articulated. 

 This work highlighted the move away from the policing of physical violence to the policing of words, now conceived as acts of violence. Emphasis was given to understanding the role of the ‘elites’ in the moralisation of public discourse around the issue of sectarianism and offence **\[3.5\]**. The research demonstrated how the specific targeting of football fans’ language, rather than the language of ‘cultural producers’, as a criminal offence carrying a potential penalty of five years in prison, undermined the universal basis of law **\[3.6\]**.

###  **4. Details of the impact** 

####  **Key impacts** 

 Waiton’s Named Person research contributed significantly to the repeal of the Scottish Government’s initiative which breached human rights laws on privacy and unreasonably expanded state intervention into the family unit. The UK Supreme Court ruled against the Scottish Government in July 2016 **\[5.1\]**. 

 Waiton’s research into the criminalisation of football fans, in collaboration with football fan groups, contributed significantly to the repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in Scotland, helping to demonstrate that the act excessively expanded the criminalisation of language and discriminated against football fans. The act was repealed by the Scottish Parliament in March 2018 **\[5.2\]**. 

####  **Named Person impact** 

 In June 2013, Waiton gave an oral submission to the Education and Culture Committee on policies regarding children at risk, and in August 2013 he produced a written submission regarding the Named Person section of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Bill.  He then coordinated a meeting of stakeholders in the Named Person scheme at the Scottish Parliament with MSP Liz Smith, who later commended him for his “ *excellent*” research into well\-being **\[5.3\]**.  He was also invited to speak to Scottish Conservative MSPs at the Scottish Parliament about the Named Person initiative **\[5.3\]**. 

 In December 2013, Waiton’s research was referenced in the Scottish Parliament regarding discussions about the repeal of the Named Person aspect of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014. MSP and Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, Ken Macintosh noted that Waiton had usefully argued in his submissions that: 

 ‘*the bureaucratisation of adult\-child relationships has undermined our ability to exercise personal judgment*’ **\[5.4\]**. 

 In 2014, helped by MSP Liz Smith, Waiton set up a meeting with interested parties that opposed the Named Person legislation.  This led to the creation of the campaign group ‘Say No to the Named Person Scheme’ \(NO2NP\). NO2NP believed that the legislation would undermine parents’ responsibility over their own children and allow state officials unprecedented powers to interfere with family life. Waiton organised several public discussions as part of the NO2NP group and chaired or spoke at 12 roadshows across Scotland: around 500 people attended the meetings.  A petition against the Named Person was also established and received 37,000 signatures. 

 Throughout the campaign \(2014\-2016\), Waiton was the most publicly cited academic within the media having written several newspaper articles about the Named Person initiative, appeared on numerous television and radio programmes and named in 50 articles about the subject **\[5.5\]**.  He was a board member of the NO2NP campaign established to influence strategy and through this, conferences, roadshows and media work became the most influential academic within the social movements opposing the Named Person. 

 In July 2016, the Supreme Court ruled against the Scottish Government’s Named Person scheme.  They ruled that the establishment of a Named Person scheme would breach data protection laws and that a more coherent concept of wellbeing needed to be defined \(both aspects highlighted in Waiton’s work\) **\[5.1\]**. Education secretary John Swinney initially pushed for a new information sharing bill, but eventually conceded defeat and repealed the Named Person provision of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014, as required by the Supreme Court. 

 In October 2016, the NO2NP campaign won the Glasgow Herald’s ‘Public Campaign of the Year’. 

 The impact of the repeal of the act has been significant. For parent groups and professional organisations this has meant an improvement in professional practices and services through a more positive approach to families and the limiting of unnecessary interventions and breaches of privacy. A survey of health visitors, for example found that more than half opposed the Named Person scheme. 

 In 2018, Dr Waiton’s research into the Named Person’s scheme \(specifically around the definition and understanding of the term ‘wellbeing’, human rights laws on privacy and the problematic nature of data sharing\) was incorporated into the Palgrave Handbook of Education Law for Schools **\[5.6\]**. 

####  **Offensive Behaviour at Football impact** 

 A combination of Waiton’s participatory action research with football fans, written work \(both academic and in the media\), and his submissions to the Scottish Parliament contributed to the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communication \(Scotland\) Bill being overturned in 2018 **\[5.2\]**. 

 In Sept 2011, Dr Waiton was an invited witness in the Scottish Parliament to provide an oral submission on the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communication \(Scotland\) Bill **\[5.7\]**.  As a result of his submission and the response to it by football fans, Waiton undertook new participatory action research with football fans to explore the problem of discriminatory policing and the over\-regulation of language in relation to football **\[3.6\].** 

 In November 2017, Waiton was invited to give a second oral submission to the Parliamentary committee **\[5.8\]** and his written submission was used as evidence in MSP James Kelly’s statement proposing the repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications \(Scotland\) Act **\[5.9\]**. 

 In Jan 2018, the Scottish Parliament held a debate on the repealing of the Act.  Waiton’s arguments regarding tolerance and freedom of speech were used in the Scottish Parliament as part of the challenge to the Offensive Behaviour Act. During the debate, MSP Gordon Lindhurst noted: 

 *‘Inventing a reasonable person and thereby an arbitrary threshold as to what is offensive is itself, in this context, an unacceptable limit on freedom of expression. Indeed, Dr Stuart Waiton said that the 2012 act criminalises “words and thoughts’* **\[5.10\]**. 

 In March 2018, the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act was repealed by the Scottish Parliament.   Maurice Corry MSP stated, during this session that the illiberal position was accurately described by Dr Stuart Waiton: the act criminalises “words and thoughts” **\[5.2\]**.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 **Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Birmingham has contributed to the development of machine perfusion to preserve donor livers and test their suitability ahead of transplant. This has enabled suboptimal\-quality donor livers, previously rejected for transplantation, to be used safely. As a result we have: 

1.  **Improved health and well\-being of patients** with liver disease, through 250 life\-saving transplants carried out to date in the UK alone; 

1.  **Changed UK and US clinical guidelines** on the use of liver machine perfusion in liver transplantation; 

1.  **Changed the practice of liver transplantation worldwide** with up to 70% of suboptimal\-quality livers now being transplanted; 

1.  **Improved liver transplant services in the UK** contributing to an increase in transplants performed each year by 14% since 2014. 

1.  **Raised** **public awareness** of the new methods in liver transplantation.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Liver disease is a major health problem worldwide. Incidence has increased 5\-fold over the last 40 years. It is now the fifth commonest cause of premature death globally accounting for 8,500 deaths annually in the UK. Liver transplantation is a highly effective treatment for patients with end\-stage liver disease and 5\-year survival rates are 60–70%. However, access to life\-saving transplantation is limited by a shortage of donor organs. 12% of patients registered on the transplant list in 2017–2018 died or became too sick for transplant within 12 months of being added to the list and a further 12% waited over 12 months to receive a liver. 

 This shortage is a consequence of both greater demand, i.e. more patients needing transplantation, and the quality of donated organs decreasing over the last decade due to the increasing age, obesity and co\-morbidities of many donors. Today, one third of donated livers are suboptimal quality and considered high\-risk for transplant, and many are not used. In 2019, 15% of the retrieved donor livers were rejected and discarded compared to 10% in 2009. 

 In 2013, Afford and Mergental at the University of Birmingham \(UoB\) established a research programme aimed at reducing the number of donor livers discarded by maximising the functional quality of sub\-optimal organs. To do this they: 

-  Developed methods to improve the preservation and recovery of function of suboptimal donated livers; 

-  Established a set of ‘viability criteria’ that donated livers must meet to be transplanted. 

 Previously, donor livers were kept in cold storage until transplant in order to slow metabolism and reduce the effects of oxygen deprivation. Work by other groups in the UK and internationally had suggested that passing fluid through an organ’s blood vessels \(‘perfusing’\) prior to transplant improves transplant efficiency. Friend \(Oxford\) proposed that to do this at body temperature \(normothermic\) might further enhance the quality of donor organs by preserving metabolic reactions important for liver function. If so, this could reduce the likelihood of organ damage during storage and transplantation, a particular problem when transplanting suboptimal livers. This led Afford’s group to perform preclinical studies to assess whether donor livers could be preserved using machines that perfuse blood at body temperatures, so\-called ‘normothermic machine liver perfusion’ \(NMLP\). At the same time, they developed a panel of tests that allowed assessment of the function of the preserved livers. In 2013/14, they used NMLP in the laboratory to preserve 12 livers that had been turned down by the transplant programme because they were considered too damaged to safely transplant. They found that the rejected livers could be divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they could clear lactate \(a metabolite produced in response to oxygen deprivation\). The ability to clear lactate was thus an indication of reduced tissue breakdown, better metabolic recovery and better liver function — all factors that would be expected to result in better transplant outcome. Lactate clearance and other functional tests were then incorporated into novel viability criteria capable of defining which suboptimal livers treated by NMLP are safe to transplant \[R1\]. 

 In August 2014, the Liver transplant team at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham carried out the first ever human transplant of a suboptimal donor liver reconditioned by NMLP and assessed using the novel viability criteria \[R2\]. By 2015, the team had completed the first pilot series of 5 suboptimal livers transplanted after NMLP. All livers functioned well and patients survived \[R3\]. The team published the protocol for the VITTAL \(VIability Testing and Transplantation of mArginal donor Livers\) clinical trial incorporating their viability criteria to assess the success of NMLP prior to transplantation \[R4\]. The trial commenced in 2017 and, in total, 31 suboptimal livers rejected for transplant by all UK transplant centres were enrolled and subjected to NMLP. 22 livers \(71%\) met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted into recipients with 100% 12\-month patient and organ survival \[R5\]. 

 **Key Findings \(KF\) from this research include:** 

 **KF1:** Rejected, suboptimal donor livers are safe to transplant within 2–3 hours of warm perfusion \(NMLP\) if they fulfil viability criteria \[R1\]. 

 **KF2:** Over 70% of suboptimal donor livers turned down for transplantation on standard criteria can be safely transplanted after NMLP \[R5\]. 

 **KF3:** Suboptimal donor livers treated by NMLP that meet the viability criteria have excellent survival rates at 1\-year when used for transplant \[R2, R3, R5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

  1.  <ins> **Improved the well\-being of patients with liver disease requiring life\-saving transplantation by increasing the number of transplantable donor organs**</ins> 

 **The lives of over 250 UK patients with end\-stage liver disease have been saved** as a result of the introduction of the UoB protocol for NMLP \[R5; S1\]. This includes 56 high\-risk patients who were part of the NAPLES \(Normothermic mAchine Perfusion of the Liver to Enable the high\-risk recipientS\) study. Previously, such patients would not have been considered candidates for suboptimal livers and 40% of them would have died waiting for a high\-quality donor organ. 1\-year patient survival was 93% after these most complex operations and there was no transplant\-related mortality \[S1\]. As a result of these studies, NMLP is being adopted into routine practice allowing more patients to be successfully treated with a life\-saving liver transplant. 

 Patients transplanted with suboptimal donor livers not only survive, the majority **have a near normal health\-related quality of life and good life expectancy**. Patients’ quality of life increases by 23% within 6 months of receiving a NMLP viability tested suboptimal liver \[S2\]. One of the first recipients of a rejected donor liver prepared for transplant using the Birmingham methods said “I couldn’t be more happy. Without that machine I wouldn’t have received this liver. I’m looking forward to a future. I think those two words right there, ‘a future’, says it all” \[R2; S3i and ii\]. 

  1.  <ins> **US and UK clinical guidelines recommend the use of liver machine perfusion in liver transplant surgery**</ins> 

-  In 2018, **The American Society of Transplant surgeons \(ATS\) Standards Committee** recommended liver machine perfusion as the best standard of care. In a white paper on Ex\-Situ Liver Machine Perfusion, the Birmingham work \[R3\] is directly cited as the basis for this recommendation \[S4\]. 

-  In 2019, the **UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\)** drew on the evidence in \[R3\] to conclude that “ex\-situ machine perfusion for extracorporeal preservation of livers for transplantation should be used under special arrangements” as more data is gathered as to its efficacy \[S5i, Recommendation 1.1; S5ii\]. The Birmingham studies were also highlighted in a headline news article by NICE \[S5iii\]. 

  1.  <ins> **Worldwide change in clinical practice of l</ins><ins>iver transplant surgeons**</ins> 

 In response to the Birmingham studies, transplant teams worldwide have **changed their practice and incorporated NMLP as part of their routine practice** \[R3, R4; S6i\]. In the UK, all 7 transplant centres now use NMLP and of these, 5 regularly use reperfusion by NMLP, with 4 of the 5 centres following our criteria to confirm functional viability of the liver. Testimonial statements from liver surgeons at leading liver transplant centres across Europe and the US confirm that adoption of Birmingham’s methods has taken place globally \[S6ii – iv\]: 

 the benchmarks for assessing the functionality of the graft during machine perfusion, defined by the Birmingham group, have been adopted all over the world, as in our Liver Transplantation Unit. \[Senior Lecturer in the Department of Surgical Science, University of Rome Tor Vergata, S6ii\] 

 We use the criteria developed by Dr. Mergental on a daily basis and his work guides us in the field of ex\-situ organ assessment. \[Director, Liver Transplantation Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, S6iii\]. 

 \[…\] it cannot be overstated how important these criteria are \[…\] The Birmingham liver perfusion group has made an immense impact in the field of liver perfusion, and many feel this work will ultimately result in a paradigm shift in liver utilization and recipient outcomes. \[Assistant Professor of Surgery in the Division of Transplant Surgery, University of California San Francisco, S6iv\] 

 Other centres that have adopted the methodology include: 

-  **Europe**: Royal Free Hospital, Kings College Hospital, Leeds Teaching Hospital, Edinburgh, Innsbruck, Rome, Barcelona, Leuven, Hannover; 

-  **Australia**: Melbourne, Sydney, Perth; 

-  **North America and USA**: UPenn Philadelphia, Cleveland Clinic, St Louis, Ochsner New Orleans, Washington University, Duke University, Mayo Clinic Phoenix, University of Florida; 

-  **Canada**: Edmonton, Toronto; 

-  **China**: Guongdong Hospital, which has also evolved UoB’s criteria to develop an ischaemia\-free preservation method. 

  1.  <ins> **Improved Liver transplant services in the UK by minimising the proportion of retrieved livers rejected**</ins> 

 Data from the Organ Donation and Transplantation reports published by NHS Blood and Transplant \(NHSBT\) show that **between 2014 and 2019 the number of transplants performed increased 14% \(118 transplants\), waiting list size decreased 21% \(117\), on\-waiting\-list patient mortality fell by 42% \(34 patients\) and the time patients wait on the list for transplant went down by 32% \(46 days\)** \[S7\]. Acknowledging that Birmingham’s work contributed to these improved outcomes, the Medical Director of Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation, NHSBT stated: “The methods introduced by Birmingham to preserve and confirm the viability of donated livers prior to use in transplant has led to a greater proportion of the donated organs being actually transplanted into patients” \[S8i\]. The same view was echoed by the Chair of the NHSBT Liver Advisory Group, who stated that UoB’s viability criteria have been “used safely to increase utilisation of donor livers and ensure that they are transplanted safely” \[S8ii\]. 

  1.  <ins> **Raised**</ins> <ins> **public awareness of the new methods in liver transplantation**</ins> 

 The extensive coverage of UoB’s research in medical and general media news articles globally has meant that **patients and the public have become aware of the innovations in liver transplantation** and the ability of surgeons to use more of the donor livers retrieved safely and with high efficacy, which gives hope and reassurance to potential recipients and encourages organ donation. For example, the BBC’s ground\-breaking documentary series ‘Surgeons: At the Edge of Life’, described the team’s research and the story of a patient who participated in the first case series \[R3; S3i and S9i\]. The Altmetric attention score of 240 for R5 \(as of 11/09/2020\) placed it within the top 1% of research outputs with regard to the quality and quantity of online attention that it received, indicating the international interest and significance of the work to the public \[S9ii\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 **LitLong** is a digital transformation project to interactively map the ways in which Edinburgh has been used as a literary setting over the course of five centuries. Text mining and analysis of more than a million books has resulted in 47,000 mapped excerpts of scenes from Edinburgh. Since 2014, LitLong has been embedded in Edinburgh’s UNESCO City of Literature digital and on\-site programming, its character\-led tours being a particularly popular innovation, which have also generated a new income stream for a heritage interpretation company. Through foregrounding marginalised voices, the project has inspired new work by over 80 of the city’s contemporary poets and prose writers, and 15 new Wikipedia entries on female writers that have been viewed over 27,000 times. Latterly, its methods have been adopted by Edinburgh International Book Festival and its partner Jalada Africa to map a series of transcontinental journeys and trace trajectories of African writing in English.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Beginning in 2014 as a University of Edinburgh\-led collaboration supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s \(AHRC\) Big Data Digital Transformations programme \(AH/L009935/1; GPB476,501\), **LitLong** – formerly Palimpsest – is a project to digitally map the ways in which Edinburgh has been used as a setting by myriad writers. By the completion of its second phase \(AH/P009549/1; GBP160,942\) in January 2018, it had mapped around 47,000 excerpts from more than a million books made available by the British Library, the National Library of Scotland and the Hathi Trust, collectively spanning five centuries of writing. Led by Loxley, the combination of input from researchers in literature, informatics and the digital humanities at three Scottish universities has enabled the development of an interactive map for a city that has both deep literary roots and a distinctive and complex topography. Researchers developed two visual interfaces for the project, one accessed through the LitLong.org website \(3.1, see map on page 2\), and a free\-to\-download app, which was available through the App Store \(iOS\) and Google Play \(Android\). 

 The UoA’s Loxley, Alex and Anderson worked with collaborators to generate the dataset underpinning LitLong’s digital map, using what Franco Moretti and other scholars refer to as “distant reading” methods: a combination of text mining and human engagement with narratives. The process started with the automated reading of large collections of digitised texts to select those set in Edinburgh, and continued with manual selection, including fine\-grained geo\-referencing. Texts ranked sufficiently highly were processed using the Edinburgh Geoparser, a system that recognises and disambiguates in\-text place names using a specially\-curated gazetteer \(in this case, of Edinburgh locations\). Prior applications of this tool had only geoparsed to the city or village level, but in the LitLong project the process was pursued to a lower level of granularity in the form of place names including names of streets, buildings, parks and monuments within the Edinburgh area. Overall, the methodology constitutes a new way of extracting relevant data from a vast body of literary material and categorising it with pinpoint accuracy, making LitLong a unique exploration of the possibilities of big data for literary research. 



 As well as the map and its two visual interfaces, LitLong’s outputs include several pieces co\-authored by Loxley, Alex and/or Anderson and their collaborators. An article in *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities* details the project’s mixed methods and how they have been used in other contexts \(3.2\). Another article, in *Language Resources and Evaluation*, explores geoparsing’s potential for the analysis of fine\-grained location names in literary texts while also highlighting the challenges researchers can encounter when using data mining techniques \(3.3\). Book chapters on the project offer new insights into Edinburgh’s layered literary history, deepening our understanding of how different writers have engaged with and been shaped by the city \(3.4\), and describing how LitLong enables us to compare narratives from different periods clustered at one location, thereby providing insights into how perceptions and place change over time \(3.5\). The project also informed a white paper on the intersection of the humanities and data science for the Alan Turing Institute \(3.6\). Extracts have uncovered forgotten or overlooked texts by Edinburgh’s female writers, bringing to light the work of previously under\-researched figures such as Isabella Moncrieff \(1775\-1846\) and Catherine Sinclair \(1800\-1864\). 

###  The LitLong research team 

 The project’s Principal Investigator is **James Loxley**, Professor of Early Modern Literature at the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\). Its core team includes colleagues drawn from across the Schools of Literatures, Languages and Cultures and Informatics at UoE: Jon Oberlander \(Professor of Epistemics, 2005\-2017\); Claire Grover \(Senior Research Fellow\); **Beatrice Alex** \(Research Fellow, 2014\-2018; Chancellor’s Fellow since 2018\); **Miranda Anderson** \(Research Fellow, Palimpsest Project 2014; employed by UoE until 2018\); and James Reid \(Geospatial Services Manager\). The core team also includes two further colleagues from other universities: Tara Thomson, Lecturer in Cultural Studies at Edinburgh Napier University; and Aaron Quigley, Chair of Human Computer Interaction at the University of St Andrews. The project was a British Library Labs Awards: Research Award runner\-up in 2015.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Over the centuries, numerous writers have called Edinburgh home, while countless more have chosen it as the setting for their narratives. The city hosts the world’s largest annual book festival and in 2004 was named the first UNESCO City of Literature. Thousands of literature fans flock to Edinburgh each year, previously with little awareness of the literary significance of many of its myriad streets, closes and wynds until LitLong brought together text and location in a digital map. As described by *The Guardian* \(print circulation 174,941\), the project has enabled readers *“to explore the city’s streets through the eyes of the authors they inspired”*, with Edinburgh’s former makar \(poet laureate\) Ron Butlin adding that it has *“really put its finger on making this magical interaction happen and making it possible for everybody to experience this”* \(5.1\). 

  

 Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust, the organisation responsible for maintaining and promoting the city’s literary status, has been using LitLong’s deepened and enriched presentation of the city’s real and imagined literary topography to underpin its engagement activities since 2014. Highlights of these activities include sell\-out walking tours, readings and storytelling sessions at the Edinburgh International Book Festival \(EIBF\) in 2014, 2015 and 2017, and workshops for local younger readers. To mark Edinburgh’s 500 years of publishing in 2016, the Trust and several partners drew on the research to create the Canongate Stars and Stories project, installing 24 custom\-designed lightboxes in the city’s Old Town to form an annotated, illuminated walking trail through its print and publishing history. The scheme was reprised the following winter and awarded a 2017 Scottish Thistle Regional Award for communities working together for tourism. Reflecting back on the project in April 2020, following a successful GBP20,000 funding application for a new collaboration with Loxley, the Trust’s Director wrote that LitLong *“provided \[us\] with an exceptional opportunity to use research\-driven insight and expertise to meet our charity's objective to grow audiences for literature and help connect people of all backgrounds to Edinburgh's literary heritage and contemporary activity. In particular the LitLong events at the Edinburgh International Book Festival have proved hugely successful… \[and, overall, Loxley\] has pushed us to be more creative in our approach whilst constantly rooting our understanding in research and best practice”* \(5.2\). 

 
To make Edinburgh’s literary history even more accessible, LitLong has commissioned new products and services from local businesses. For the EIBF walking tours, for example, it asked the heritage interpretation company Artemis Scotland to create four new literary characters as tour guides – ranging from the renowned Sir Walter Scott to the almost\-forgotten Catherine Sinclair \(pictured right\). Prior to its engagement with LitLong, the company was *“very much focussed on the typical historical characters such as Mary, Queen of Scots and Queen Victoria. We had not considered costumed interpretation for authors of the past. This is a new income stream for the business”* \(5.3\). Directly because of its engagement with LitLong, Artemis Scotland has been commissioned by the Edinburgh City of Literature Trust to deliver further literary characters, has developed walking tours around the city’s New Town, and has seen its Director awarded full professional membership of the Association for Heritage Interpretation for its characterisation of Sir Walter Scott \(5.3\). 

 Through creative writing workshops and competitions, LitLong has inspired new work by Edinburgh’s contemporary literary community. April 2016, for example, saw the publication of the first edition of *Umbrellas of Edinburgh*, an anthology of pieces composed through engagement with the project which quickly sold all 2,500 copies of its initial print run, was the focus of an episode of the Scottish Poetry Library Podcast with over 2,000 listens \(5.4a\) and was republished by Shoreline of Infinity in November 2020 with more maps and contributions \(5.4b\). The diverse mix of 80 writers featured in *Umbrellas of Edinburgh* include AJ \(formerly known as Laura\) Clay, author of *A Beltane Prayer*, who says that LitLong helped them *“see the city in a different light… a more literary kind of way… it really helped get a greater awareness of – and appreciation for – the city and its history”* \(5.5\). Similarly, the poet Helen Boden, who attended workshops and used the LitLong website when developing *Edge of Edinburgh*, felt the project prompted her to think more about Edinburgh as a place, with the workshops in particular providing creative stimuli that she wouldn’t have experienced writing alone at her desk. She reflects: *“I was very pleased with this poem, which definitely wouldn’t have come without that”* \(5.6\). 

 As emphasised on the LitLong website \(3.1\), one of the researchers’ priorities has been to excavate and showcase the diversity of literary Edinburgh, past and present. When compiling *Umbrellas of Edinburgh*, the editors wanted to *“shift the existing \(dead white men\) focus through a more contemporary lens”* \(5.7\) – most of the anthology’s contributors identify as women, and some are writers of colour, identify as LGBTQIA\+, live with disabilities, and/or have lived outside Scotland. To redress the historical gender imbalance, LitLong facilitated a Wikipedia “Editathon” at the Being Human festival in 2017, in which users were trained to create pages on Edinburgh’s women writers, generating 15 new webpages and improving one other. The new pages have now been viewed 27,304 times \(5.8\). Feedback from the workshop participants \(majority identifying as female\) indicates that the benefits of the Editathon ranged from developing skills in using Wikipedia to feeling a “ *genuine link to contributing knowledge of a less well known but excellent literary figure”* \(5.9, p.3\). 

 In 2017, LitLong brought a *“particularly striking”* \(5.2\) digital dimension to the Edinburgh International Book Festival \(EIBF\) by installing touchscreen literary maps in the Festival’s new “greenhouse” venues, an expansion onto one of the city’s main commercial thoroughfares which saw EIBF achieve its highest footfall \(250,000 visitors\) since it began in 1983. On seeing the technology in action, EIBF partner and pan\-African writers’ collective Jalada Africa approached the team to discuss its use in Outriders Africa, a project in which ten acclaimed writers from around the world embarked on journeys across the African continent in early spring 2020, meeting local writers, discussing climate change, colonisation and migration, and ultimately producing new work. Before travel restrictions imposed by the global COVID\-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of EIBF 2020 and cut the planned journeys short, LitLong’s methods were being used in the development of two online maps underpinning various Festival events and activities: one documenting the writers’ journeys; and the other a co\-curated LitLong for African writing in English, titled AfroLitMap. Regardless of the pandemic, Jalada Africa has reported that work on AfroLitMap is ongoing, with the visual design, backend of the website and underpinning database of 250 books complete \(5.10\), and that a follow\-up series of journeys – this time across Europe – is planned for a future iteration of the Book Festival.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Developer contributions within housing planning consents have fallen consistently during the REF period. Such contributions are intended to benefit the local community, and include affordable housing. In contrast, housebuilder profits have increased significantly within a system that allows for economic viability testing of developments. Research at the University of Reading has identified deep flaws in development appraisal methodology in general and its application to viability assessments within the English planning system in particular. It has also identified flaws in Central Government guidance, primarily the Viability Planning Practice Guidance \(PPG\) of 2014. The research identified the mechanisms through which developers gamed the system. These findings have been instrumental in major changes to national and local government housing and planning policy and guidance. The research has also underpinned the development of enhanced global and UK practitioner practice through major industry Guidance Notes. These changes are designed to safeguard community benefit through developer contributions and improve applications of development appraisal technique globally. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

##  Research context 

 A major policy initiative of successive governments in England and Wales has been to maximise community benefit from “planning gain” in the form of developer contributions and affordable housing. Developer contributions are estimated to be worth a total of GBP6,000,000,000 per year, of which GBP4,000,000,000 is credited to affordable housing. Planning gain is essentially the resultant increase in land value from the granting of planning permission. It is the difference between the existing use value \(for example, agricultural land value for greenfield sites or a commercial use on an inner\-city site\) and the site value, assuming development \(that is, the value of the completed new development, less the costs of development\). The vehicle by which the three elements of landowner return, developer return and return to the community, in the form of developer contributions, are determined is a Financial Viability Assessment \(FVA\). This is basically a valuation of the development. These are negotiated between landowner, developer and Local Planning Authority \(LPA\); therefore, the three stakeholders have an incentive to use the FVA as a vehicle to maximise their individual return at the expense of the other stakeholders. The main issue to be negotiated is the value of the development land. 

##  Research at the University of Reading 

 Property valuation is a core research activity at Reading, and research on FVAs sits within a wider research agenda on land\-value capture. One aspect of this wider research agenda is the valuation of development property globally and the application of development valuations to FVA in England and Wales. 

 In 2010, the Reading team were consultants on the original *Guidance Note on Financial Viability in Planning* \(2012\) published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors \(RICS\) and responsible for the insertion of the assumption that the land\-value component should assume compliance with Local Planning Authority’s developer contribution policy. At the same time, the Reading team was undertaking academic research into both development appraisal \[Section 3, ref 1\] and viability testing \[see, for example, refs 2–5\]. Using a mixture of research techniques, including theoretical modelling, case studies of published appraisals, and analysis of court, tribunal and planning appeal decisions, the Reading team identified flaws in the general application of the FVA model. These included both inconsistencies within the basic modelling of developments and manipulation of the model when applied to viability testing in England. General inconsistencies concerned the identification of profit, the use of finance inputs and the application of value and cost growth. Regarding the manipulation of the modelling within FVA, the research identified how it was possible for the landowner and developer, and their expert advisers, to exploit these flaws in the basic model, together with ambiguities in the 2014 Viability PPG. Landowners and developers were therefore able to persuade local authorities, and planning inspectors upon appeal, to increase their allocations \(land value\) at the expense of developer contributions. These flaws introduced an element of circularity into the process, whereby, if a developer paid an additional amount for the land, they could in effect reclaim it in reduced developer contributions. This resulted in a higher return to the landowner, a stable return to the developer and a lower return to the community in reduced developer contributions. 

 In addition, the research programme led to the identification of further flaws in the FVA modelling process. Crosby’s article in *Town Planning Review* \[ref 5\] showed how the combination of static value/cost modelling in a dynamic market environment could explain prices that looked to be overbids, but were not, a situation they originally identified in the RICS \(2012\) guidance \(Appendix D\). These findings have underpinned the development of MHCLG\-supported RICS Guidance on FVAs due to be published early in 2021. 

##  Summary 

 The research was critical to the identification of “circularity”, whereby developers knew that any overbid for land would be returned to them in reduced developer contributions, maintaining their own profits \[ref 4\]. Furthermore, they identified the hypothesis that a continuation of this circularity within the system would lead ultimately to the elimination of developer contributions by higher land prices, a situation accepted by government and the High Court \(Section 5, source 3\) in 2018. It is principally these two research outputs \[refs 4 and 5\] that have informed 2018/19 changes in PPG and \[with ref 1\] new editions of global and national professional guidance on valuation from RICS set out in Section 4.

 The outputs range across the width of the research agenda of development appraisal in general \[ref 1\] and FVA in particular \[refs 2, 3, 4 and 5\]. The industry\-funded research has been developed into high\-quality international academic publications spanning both planning and real estate appraisal disciplines. The research is innovative, in that it was the first to identify why the FVA system was failing and how that could be rectified. It includes the first major modern critique of development appraisal modelling of inputs and of why current practice varies from finance theory. The research uses a rigorous mixture of theoretical modelling, surveys and case study analysis methodology and includes the collation of new databases. In so doing, it adds significantly to the theoretical and applied knowledge base of development appraisal globally. Uptake of the research has resulted in changes in government policy and the development of industry practice.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Falling developer contributions at a time of rising developer profitability including major bonus payments requires investigation and a policy and practice response. Research at Reading has been at the forefront of the investigation and has played a major role in the development of government policy and industry practice responses. It identified the problem, informed central and local government consultations and discussions, and underpinned national and local government policy changes and global industry guidance. As a result, revised policy and industry guidance aim to stop the system being gamed and protect developer contributions for the benefit of the community as well as improving development appraisal practice globally. 

##  Safeguarding developer contributions in FVA \- Impact context 

 Economic viability is at the heart of the current English planning system. Viability assessments are used to identify the level of developer contributions. In its 2018 consultation paper ‘Supporting housing delivery through developer contributions: Reforming developer contributions to affordable housing and infrastructure’, the UK government stated that reforming the viability assessment process was “a vital step towards fixing our broken housing market and ensuring that it delivers for everyone”. 

 The UK housing market was relatively depressed in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. However, in the economic recovery, the profitability of the seven largest housebuilders in the UK rose from an average 9% Return on Capital Employed in 2011 to 33% in 2017. It would be expected that an increasingly profitable industry would have been able to deliver more, not less, affordable housing. But the amount of affordable housing delivered by the same seven largest UK housebuilders reduced from 44% of completions to 20% between 2011 and 2017. As detailed in Section 2, the research had identified the flaws in the viability assessment process that were causing these anomalies and contributing to shortfalls in the levels of developer contributions. 

##  Changes in planning policy and guidance in the London housing market 

 The first major sign that policymakers and practitioners were engaging with the research at Reading came from within London, in the Borough of Islington. It amended its supplementary planning guidance \[source 1\] in January 2016, citing Crosby and Wyatt’s research \[Section 3, ref 4\] in paras 6.67, 6.69 and 6.75 as reasons for their revised approach in addressing the circularity issue. They also used the research outputs in evidence statements at planning appeals. Using the research as a basis, with Crosby providing written expert witness evidence \[source 2\], Islington Borough Council successfully took a landmark case in Parkhurst Road through appeal and ultimately to the High Court \(\[2018\] EWHC 991 \(Admin\)\) \[source 3\]. Crosby and Wyatt’s research \[Section 3, ref 4\] was cited in the Planning Appeal and High Court decision as the source of the identification and explanation of the circularity issue within viability assessments, the central issue in the case. 

 Further to this, a consortium of 13 London boroughs \(led by Islington\) commissioned research in 2016 on land values and development viability, with the viability part undertaken by Crosby. This research \[Section 3, ref 6\] was  [Highly Commended by the Royal Town Planning Institute](https://www.henley.ac.uk/news/2017/rep-wins-all-the-prizes-at-rtpi-research-excellence-awards) in its 2017 academic research awards. Importantly, the research widened the focus across the whole of London. As a result, McAllister, Crosby and Wyatt were invited to give evidence, later deemed “influential” \[source 6\] to the London Assembly and the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) Planning Committee \(2016\). Noting the importance of the Reading\-authored RICS 2015 paper on FVA \[subsequently ref 4\] as “the first significant report to highlight the ‘circularity’ issue”, the GLA highlights that it “was subsequently referred to in guidance produced by London boroughs” \[Sources 5 and 4\]. Indeed, both the Mayor of London’s 2017 supplementary planning guidance \(Para 3.48\) \[source 4\] and the ‘London Borough Viability Protocol’ \(Paras 8.8 to 8.13\) \[source 5\] cite the research as the basis for the decision not to accept market values of land within viability assessments. Since then, Crosby, McAllister and Wyatt’s engagement with the GLA has continued through the GLA’s new viability team, established in 2017 \[source 6\]. 

##  Changes in the UK government housing and planning policy 

 RICS notes that “Reading University’s research drew attention to an underlying contradiction in government’s 2012 national planning policy” \[source 8\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. Therefore, “\[t\]he arguments produced by Reading University and the evidence upon which they were based … contributed significantly to a change in national government policy in what has emerged as the National Planning Policy Framework/ Planning Practice Guidance 2018/19” \[source 8\]. 

##  Changing industry practice in development appraisal and FVA 

 In 2018, Crosby and Wyatt were invited onto the industry working group responding to the new PPG. Administered by RICS, but involving the RTPI, the Law Society and the MHCLG, the aim was to rewrite the RICS guidance to valuers undertaking viability assessments and set out a process for the implementation of the new PPG. Revised RICS guidance had previously been requested by High Court Judge Holgate, in Islington Borough Council’s Parkhurst Road appeal, in order to address the circularity issue \[source 3 para 147\]. 

 Crosby took on the lead authorship for the Guidance Note \(GN\), and guided it through the RICS Valuation Standards and Regulatory Board and the consultation process in 2019/20. In balancing the views of all stakeholders in the process, the new GN aims to facilitate delivery of government policy on the ground. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 These impacts on national housing policy and development viability practice are part of a wider impact on global development valuation. Crosby and Wyatt have used the research into the technical issues of development appraisal \[Section 3, refs1, 4 and 5\] to write the RICS Global Valuation Guidance Note *Valuation of Development Property* published in 2019 \[source 9\]. This Guidance Note forms the basis of the application of development appraisal modelling by all RICS valuation member worldwide \(totalling 35,000\). “This is a fundamental piece of guidance for practitioners undertaking what is regarded as one of the highest risk valuations. This guidance … applies to chartered surveyors working around the world … and is also fundamental in defining methods, data and information relied upon in development viability appraisal” \[RICS Testimonial, source 8\]. 

##  Summary of the impact 

##  With a global membership of valuers, the RICS Guidance Note has a wide\-reaching and important international role in improving global professional practice. Nationally, the change in viability policy and practice guidance is very significant in terms of ensuring communities have access to proper affordable housing and wider community benefits. \[Text removed for publication\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Following a decade of spending cuts, grassroots open youth work \(youth clubs, street\-based and online youth work\) has faced significant challenges. In providing an evidence base for the value of youth work and more youth\-centred evaluation practices, research led by Dr Tania de St Croix at King’s College London has contributed to new investment in the sector and prompted change to accountability and evaluation policies and practices. Further, the research has bolstered youth\-centred developments in the daily practice of open youth work and the training of professional and volunteer youth workers, ultimately benefitting some of society’s most marginalised young people. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A decade of substantial cuts to youth work provision across the UK has resulted in the depletion of a resource that is open to young people by choice, engages with them on their terms, and attracts marginalised young people who are less likely to access mainstream services. At the same time, there has been an increasing policy emphasis on assessing youth services through predetermined, measurable outcomes. Two research studies led by de St Croix have examined the impact of these developments on grassroots open youth work; that is youth work that takes place in youth clubs, street\-based youth work, and youth work with specific groups \(eg young women, young refugees, black young people, LGBTQ young people, or disabled young people\). Specifically, the research has documented practitioners’ and young people’s perspectives and experiences, highlighting, mapping and analysing how a combination of austerity and the increased use of outcome\-based monitoring procedures has transformed practice \[1,2,3,4\] and is threatening the long\-term future of youth work \[5\]. The research has also identified existing good practice in evaluation and articulated the case for more youth\-centred qualitative techniques \[5\] and grassroots narrative methods \[6\] that are more congruent with the values of youth work. 

#  Grassroots youth work practice in a changing policy context 

 Through policy analyses, participant observation and in\-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups with 35 youth workers, the first study, published as a monograph, *Grassroots youth work: Policy, passion and resistance in practice*, showed how part\-time and volunteer youth workers, who work directly with young people facing complex and challenging circumstances, are themselves marginalised in decision\-making relating to policy and practice \[1\]. The research also illuminated the ways in which target cultures have distorted their practice by, for example, requiring formal evaluation methods \(such as form\-filling and database tracking\). This has made it more difficult for them to develop person\-centred, trusting relationships with young people who are inclined to be suspicious of formal measurement and intrusive tracking mechanisms \[2\]. In a co\-authored paper with Ian McGimpsey from the University of Birmingham, researchers at King’s have conceptualised these changes as being informed by neoliberal logic, resulting in services and projects being ranked and compared according to their economic outcomes \[3\]. This contrasts with a tradition of youth work that is based on a commitment to critical dialogue with young people and the creation of informal education opportunities that start from young people’s agendas \[4\]. 

#  The value and evaluation of youth work 

 A follow\-up study, funded by the ESRC, ‘Rethinking Impact, Evaluation and Accountability in Youth Work’ \[7\] examined how evaluation and accountability mechanisms are used in youth work, how young people and practitioners conceptualise the value of youth work and what approaches to evaluation and accountability are most appropriate in relation to practice. Qualitative data collection comprised participant observation in a variety of youth work settings in five regions across England \(including urban and rural areas with varied demographics\) alongside in\-depth interviews, focus groups and youth participatory research with 140 young people, practitioners, managers and policy influencers. The study took place in a policy context in which youth organisations were encouraged by government \(through the Centre for Youth Impact, see section 4\) and funding agencies to prove their effectiveness through outcomes measurement. Conventional outcomes measurement approaches are problematic in youth work settings because they determine efficacy on the basis of predefined, discrete outcomes, whereas in youth work, there is no specific beginning or end and diverse needs may only emerge during the process of engagement. 

 The study generated new understandings and articulations of how youth work makes a vital contribution to young people’s everyday lives in the here and now, by providing an in\-depth analysis of the value and importance of providing trusted relationships, safe yet informal spaces, and critical conversations around personal challenges and wider social issues \[5\]. The research has, in addition, revealed and unpacked the ways in which evaluation and monitoring practices are experienced by young people and youth workers as inappropriate: intrusive, time\-consuming, overly formal, impractical; and as reinforcing adult\-defined deficit narratives about young people \[5\]. The research has shown how, in contrast, young people and youth workers value accountability mechanisms that are rooted in practice, are sensitive to the complexities of young people’s lives and avoid deficit labels \[5\]. 

 The research has also identified and illuminated the problematic ways in which outcomes measurement shapes overall provision towards short\-term targeted projects and away from long\-term open provision \[5\]. This is intensified by what de St Croix, with colleagues from King’s and the University of Birmingham, have named a ‘social investment machine’, in which evaluation techniques developed within and outside government attribute a financial value to outcomes and services, further disadvantaging practices that are less amenable to this kind of evaluation \[3\]. 

 To address the need for a more equitable, nuanced approach to accountability that reflects the complexities of practice and the skilled nature of youth work, the research has made the case for, and recommended, mixed qualitative evaluation processes \(comprising, for example, interviews, focus groups, storytelling and creative methods\) and the greater involvement of young people and practitioners in decisions about evaluation and accountability \[5,6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In the largely practice\-based field of youth work, the research has provided an evidence base for reforms to funding, policy and practice. The research impact is rooted in a collaborative approach, based on de St Croix’s lengthy professional experience in the field, and extensive engagement with young people, youth workers and policy makers/influencers throughout the research process \(planning, data collection and engagement/dissemination\). Research findings are shared in a variety of accessible formats including policy briefings, blog posts, workshops at professional conferences and creative methods such as film. 

#  Strengthening the case for new investment 

 In the context of spending cuts that have disproportionately affected grassroots open youth work, de St Croix’s research \[1,4\] has helped to articulate the case for further youth work investment and amplify the voices of young people and youth workers calling for increased funding and more responsive systems of support at local and national levels of government. For example, the Chair of the Institute for Youth Work \(the professional association for youth workers in England\) has commented that: “We as youth workers have been empowered by Dr de St Croix’s research to push back against commissioners… Dr de St Croix’s work speaks to the frame of reference that youth workers need in order to inform the agency they have in such a system” \[A\]. 

 De St Croix’s research documenting and conceptualising the value of open youth work \[1\] was also used by the 2019 All Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs as evidence of the highly skilled role played by youth workers in providing young people with trusted relationships, safe spaces and stimulating activities \[B1 p.19\]. Three months after its publication in April 2019, the APPG report prompted a general debate in the House of Commons on the current sufficiency of youth services, in which new funding, including GBP500,000 in bursaries for up to 400 youth work students, was announced \[B2\]. 

 **Informing policy: reframing accountability and evaluation in youth work** 

 By providing evidence of the harmful effects of the policy emphasis on target cultures and outcomes measurement and demonstrating and articulating the value of alternative ways of conceptualising and practising accountability in youth work, the research \[5,6\] has directly contributed to moves towards more youth\-centred approaches that are more in keeping with the philosophy of youth work. 

 For example, de St Croix has worked in partnership with the Centre for Youth Impact, which was set up by the Cabinet Office in 2014 to encourage impact measurement in youth organisations and which works collaboratively with practitioners, funders and policymakers to improve services and support for young people across the UK. Influenced by the research \[2,5\] and through a ‘critical friend’ relationship with de St Croix \(including regular meetings, mutual advice and invitations to speak at events and contribute to essay and blog series\), the Centre for Youth Impact has moved away from recommending standardised outcome\-based measurement approaches in youth work towards an approach that is more sensitive to, and better aligned with, the traditional values and practices of youth work \[C1 p.18\]. The Centre for Youth Impact has put this change into practice in their commissioned evaluation of one of the biggest investments in open access youth provision in recent years, the 2017\-20 Youth Investment Fund \[C2 p.2,4\] \(a joint investment between the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and The National Lottery Community Fund of GBP40,000,000 to support voluntary, community and social enterprise youth organisations to deliver, expand and create high quality local youth provision in targeted communities across England\). Rather than imposing a model of evaluation from outside and restricting the evaluation to outcomes measures, they have taken a participatory approach \(working in collaboration with youth organisations\) and have focused on young people’s feedback and indicators of quality practice, both of which were absent from government\-funded youth work monitoring and evaluation in the past. The CEO of the Centre for Youth Impact, commenting on de St Croix’s influence on the Centre’s thinking and practice, has noted that the continuation and responsiveness of its work is due in large part to de St Croix’s research: “If we had kept trying to push out some of the ways of working that Tania critiques, we wouldn't have been around…\[T\]he fact that we have integrated so much of the kind of thinking that Tania represents – and tried to walk a sensitive and thoughtful line – is the reason why we exist” \[D\]. 

 Insights from the research also fed into the development of Labour Party policy ahead of the 2019 general election, through de St Croix working closely with the Political Advisor to the Shadow Youth Minister, giving advice on issues including: the distinctive contribution of grassroots open youth work; training and workforce development; challenges and opportunities in scaling up youth work after a period of under\-investment; and the need for appropriate evaluation and monitoring. By identifying the danger of tying funding to quantitative outcomes, in contrast to previous Labour policy, Labour’s \(2019\) *Only Young Once* policy paper and its subsequent 2019 manifesto committed to reversing the funding cuts and moving towards longer\-term, contextually\-sensitive forms of evaluation \[E1\]. As acknowledged by the Political Advisor to the Shadow Youth Minister “\[de St Croix’s\] research on accountability and evaluation processes in youth work and her informal feedback helped shape Labour’s policy positions on youth work evaluation and contributed to wider youth policy development…\[H\] *er expertise played an important role in shaping Labour’s commitment outlined in the Only Young Once Report to move towards stronger, more effective evidence of youth work that focuses on the long term, moving away from previous attempts to tie quantitative measures around outcomes and impact of universal youth work.* Following the publication of this report, Labour at the 2019 General Election committed to build a statutory youth service that focused on non\-formal learning and ensured all young people have access to high quality youth work provision that matches their needs” \[E2\]. 

 In addition, the research findings have provided youth workers and organisations with an evidence\-based rationale for more qualitative, youth\-centred approaches to evaluation. Practitioners \(youth workers, managers and evaluators in local government, charities and social enterprises\) have widely engaged with King’s research on youth work, including academic articles \[especially 1,2,5\], blogs, essays and talks at practitioner events, and de St Croix has held meetings with over 25 organisations rethinking their approach to evaluation. This influence on practice has been recognised by the National Youth Agency – the national body for youth work in England, with wider influence internationally – which works with youth work providers to champion youth work and raise its profile among policymakers, educators and employers; train youth workers and offer accreditation; and further facilitate youth work by arranging collaboration and funding with commercial and public sector partners. The National Youth Agency’s Research and Learning Manager has acknowledged the importance of de St Croix’s research and its strong impact focus, commenting that: “de St Croix’s work helps organisations think about the implications of their practice and evaluation processes in a way that considers the practical context within which youth work operates, but places individual young persons at the centre of the process … \[I\]t improves the overall outcome for young people by ensuring their needs are understood as the most important element in the youth work process, and \[shows\] that… sometimes the ‘everyday’ contribution that youth work makes in young people’s lives is just as valuable as the ‘extraordinary.’ … \[H\]er mixed methodologies fill a significant gap in evaluation processes… She is regularly referenced in our advocacy reports due to the strong empirical evidence her work provides… We regularly consult with Dr de St Croix’s on various matters that concern the youth sector” \[F\]. 

#  **Pioneering new approaches to practice** 

 To embed research findings \[5,6\] in youth work, de St Croix has collaborated with charities and practitioners’ groups to develop and share alternative evaluation tools. For example, in 2020 she worked with London Youth \(a London\-based network of 650 community youth organisations\) to deliver training in qualitative interviewing for youth workers, to enable practitioners to build their skills and confidence in using qualitative research methods for evaluation. De St Croix also worked as part of In Defence of Youth Work \(a grassroots practitioners’ forum\) to devise and implement a radically different approach to conventional quantitative evaluation – a qualitative and reflexive storytelling methodology. The storytelling workshop method has been used for practice development, critical professional reflection and accountability purposes by local government and third sector organisations. The approach has been shared through workshops involving 1416 participants across nine countries, and resources to run the workshop have been made available on an opensource website aimed at practitioners \[G\]. The workshops were developed as a form of resistance to the dominance of neoliberal outcomes measurement in youth work, as theorised by researchers including de St Croix \[4\], and their adaptation as a form of qualitative evaluation draws on de St Croix’s articulation of the value of alternative evaluation methodologies and her research on the importance of democratic accountability \[2,6\]. 

 The storytelling resource has had an impact on practice internationally. For example, a research team at Hosei University, Tokyo, who have researched the impact of youth work in Europe in order to develop youth work practice in Japan, have taken a particular interest in the storytelling methodology and invited de St Croix and a practitioner to Japan in 2019 to lead seminars with over 200 practitioners and local policy makers. The professor who led this project has acknowledged the use of this storytelling approach in Japanese youth work and described how de St Croix’s work has “helped to develop local practice and highlight ways of communicating what youth work can achieve” \[H\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Co\-organised by David Herd and Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group \(GDWG\), the *Refugee Tales* project calls for an end to the UK’s policy of indefinite immigration detention by sharing stories of people who have been detained. Since its inception in 2015, the project has made space for detainees’ stories across multiple contexts: as part of the annual ‘Walk in Solidarity with Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Detainees’; in three internationally acclaimed volumes of tales; across various media, including film and radio; at lobbying events and meetings with MPs. Through this process of making space for accounts of the lived experience of detention, the project has: influenced policy on immigration detention; established an international model of campaigning practice; changed teaching of migration in schools and universities nationally and internationally; and provided a community for former detainees isolated by the hostile environment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Research problem** 

 Herd’s research into the UK’s policy of indefinite immigration detention began in **2009**. Although the power to detain indefinitely had existed since the 1971 Immigration Act, its use was significantly increased by the UK Borders Act of 2007. Whereas in 1988, 1,800 people were held in immigration detention, by 2009 that figure had risen to 28,000 \(including 15,780 asylum detainees\). At that time, it was widely unknown that the UK is the only country in Europe that detains people indefinitely under immigration rules, and, as a consequence, the stories of those detained were rarely, if ever, heard. There was therefore insufficient understanding of the human costs of large\-scale indefinite detention, or of the function of detention in the UK’s increasingly hostile immigration environment. 

 **Research aims** 

 Working initially with the NGO Kent Refugee Help, from **2009** to **2015** Herd visited people held at the Dover Immigration Removal Centre, attended asylum and immigration tribunals, and observed the lived experience outside detention of people whose asylum cases remain pending. His principal research observation concerned the way people who had experienced immigration detention were deliberately held outside key modes of communication. Such exclusion, as Herd has documented, took multiple intersecting forms **\[R2, R4\]**. The asylum interview, for example, commonly took the form of a sequence of approximately 100 questions immediately repeated, the aim being to generate discrepancy and a basis for doubt. Hearings in the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal system were not courts of record, meaning that the words of the appellant are not preserved. At the level of daily existence, the relief granted the refused asylum seeker who cannot return \(£5.05 per day\) was paid in the form of a voucher that could only be spent at certain outlets on certain products \(not including public transport\) and which stigmatised individuals at the point of transaction. Having directly observed the effects of these processes, Herd set out to: consider the ways such symbolic exclusion compromises the individual’s capacity to act in the world; explore how, in the face of such hostility, forms of community and solidarity can nonetheless be established; contribute to the development of a social and linguistic environment in which the voices of those who had been detained might be heard. 

 **Individual research outcomes** 

 Since **2009**, Herd’s research has taken various forms. Through a series of articles, essays, and works of creative non\-fiction he has detailed modes of linguistic exclusion that shape the experience of people who have been detained **\[R1, R4, R6\]**. Across two collections of poetry, he has used lyric and documentary modes to explore the affective consequences of such exclusion and arrived at expressions of solidarity that both register and seek to overcome the prevailing linguistic hostility **\[R3, R5\]**. This work has been internationally acclaimed, with the *Los Angeles Review of Books* describing *All Just* \(2012\) as ‘one of the few truly necessary works of poetry written on either side of the Atlantic in the past decade’ **\[R4\]**. 

 **Collaborative practice\-as\-research outcomes** 

 Building directly on his individual research into the linguistic exclusion of people who have experienced detention, Herd helped co\-found the *Refugee Tales* project with GDWG in **2015**. The aim of the project was to create a space in which the stories of those detained could be safely shared, thus demonstrating both the human costs of indefinite detention and the power of stories to generate community. Stories are written either as co\-productions with established writers \(where anonymity is required\) or as first\-person testimonies. Taking *The Canterbury Tales* as its model, the project first shares all stories in the context of an ongoing series of large\-scale public walks. They are then published as part of the *Refugee Tales* series, now in its third volume **\[R2\]**. As Co\-Director of the project, Herd has been integral to all aspects of its organisation and execution throughout. In particular, he has led its cultural inquiry through the commissioning of co\-produced tales, the mentoring of people writing first\-person testimony, the co\-editing of the project’s volumes, and the constant articulation of the project’s findings through essays, broadcasts, and at numerous high\-profile political events. In particular, he has framed the space in which published stories are shared, through the verse ‘Prologues’ and discursive ‘Afterwords’ he has contributed to each volume. Herd’s contribution to migration studies through *Refugee Tales* has been extensively discussed in articles and essays \(see Barr, 2019; De Michelis, 2019\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As the Director of GDWG, Anna Pincus, states: ‘without David’s \[Herd\] expertise as a researcher and writer *Refugee Tales* could not have achieved its influence and reach’ **\[a\]**. The impact achieved is as follows: 

1.  **Influence on the framing of detention policy** 

 The accounts of indefinite detention shared by Refugee Tales, and published in the project’s three volumes, have directly influenced the framing of detention policy and legislation. Following the publication of Volume II \( **2017**\), the project used the published stories as a lobbying tool to press for a change of law. Herd and other project members engaged in one\-to\-one meetings with MPs from all parties, using the project’s accounts of detention as evidence of the need for change. During this process, Refugee Tales secured the support of a sufficient number of MPs to establish a working cross\-party majority \(in the 2017\-19 Parliament\) in favour of a change to the law **\[b, c\]**. In **September 2017**, Herd was invited to contribute to Diane Abbott’s Party Conference Speech as Shadow Home Secretary. 

 In **2018**, Refugee Tales invited Shami Chakrabarti \(Shadow Attorney General\) and Afzal Khan \(Shadow Immigration Minister\) to take part in a Labour Party Conference Fringe Event, which Herd hosted and addressed, with the aim of securing the Party’s adoption of a 28\-day limit to asylum detention. Khan posted a policy announcement immediately after his appearance at the event: ‘Tonight I spoke at the @RefugeeTales fringe at \#Lab18 on the need to end indefinite detention. @UKLabour will implement a 28\-day limit on immigration detention. It’s \#Time4aTimeLimit’ **\[b\]**. Writing in the *Guardian*, Chakrabarti has publicly cited *Refugee Tales* as a book to ‘inspire activism’ **\[e\]**. 

 In **October 2018**, Refugee Tales further built the campaign for a limit by launching 28for28.org: a series of filmed readings of the published tales \(by leading writers and actors\), with an introduction scripted by Herd, and released one per day for 28 days across social media **\[d\]**. Subsequently, a submission including extracts from *Refugee Tales I* and *II* was considered as evidence by the Joint Committee on Human Rights’ Report on Immigration Detention \(JCHR Report\), helping inform the report’s case for a time limit on detention **\[c\]**. Following this political groundwork, Refugee Tales was actively involved in the process of preparing for, and drafting, an amendment to the 2019 Immigration Bill, sponsored by the Labour Front Bench and designed to end indefinite detention **\[c\]**. Though the bill was ultimately deferred \(by prorogation and the 2019 election\), the amendment has set the terms for subsequent legislative discussion of detention in the UK. 

1.  **An international model of campaigning practice** 

 Refugee Tales’ influence on national policy\-making on immigration detention has established the project as an international model for campaigners for migrant rights. Herd has been invited to address numerous audiences of international activists and educators seeking to learn from and emulate the project’s practices in working with immigration detainees, speaking in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Holland, Italy, and the USA. He has been asked to advise on projects working with refugees and asylum seekers in Germany and India. 

 In **2019**, Herd was invited to the Kenan Ethics Institute at Duke University to advise volunteers working at refugee camps in Jordan on good practice in relation to refugee testimony. The Director of the Institute wrote that Herd had ‘inspired us to think much more carefully about the impact of our own work’ **\[f\]**. By communicating his research in these settings, Herd has extended the reach of both Refugee Tales and GDWG, whilst continuing to maintain international focus on the UK Government’s policy of detention. The project has been cited as a model of civil society activism in publications in Australia, Germany, Italy, South Korea, the UAE, and the USA. In **2019**, Herd was interviewed by InfoMIgrant, ‘a news and information site for migrants at every point of their journey’, which reaches over 160,000 migrants worldwide and is supported by France Médias Monde and the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, and is co\-financed by the European Union **\[g\]**. 

 In **2020**, Refugee Tales consolidated the international reach of its practice. On **3\-5 July 2020**, a series of online stories and talks, led by Herd’s introductory film, provided the context for people to walk ‘in solidarity with detainees’ in 20 countries worldwide, confirming the project’s international influence **\[a\]**. 

1.  **Changing teaching in schools and universities nationally and internationally** 

 Refugee Tales has changed the way the realities of immigration detention are taught at a time when it is increasingly a defining international issue. The three volumes are taught in over 50 universities around the world \(including Cambridge, Oxford, Glasgow, Cornell, Avanza College, Argentina, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Ottawa, Lodz, and Leiden\) and in secondary schools in Denmark, the UK, and the USA. Teachers describe the transformative effect of the books. As a teacher at Rowland Hall High School in Salt Lake City, Utah wrote: ‘My students have responded so well to the text that I first of all just wanted to thank you \[…\].This book could do so much good if read and taught widely’ **\[h\]**. 

 That widespread teaching is now a reality. In **April 2020**, the Oak National Academy developed a series of online lessons for Key Stage 3 Students dedicated to the *Refugee Tales* books. The Academy is funded by the Department of Education and is the main national provider of home\-school education during lockdown, with a reach of 4.7 million visitors. The purpose of the *Refugee Tales* lessons is to ‘look at how \[the project\] uses poetic tone to get across the message of how refugees should be treated with respect’, with Herd’s ‘Prologue’ being the sole focus for this discussion **\[i\]**. His research has thus directly influenced the way 11\-14\-year\-olds in the UK are taught to think about migration. As a teacher writing in *Public Books* concluded: ‘As much as Chaucer is the father of English literature, Refugee Tales and the culture it creates can be its future’ **\[h\]**. 

1.  **Providing a community for people isolated by the UK’s hostile environment** 

 Refugee Tales is unique in the way it has built a community by sharing stories of people who have experienced immigration detention. Stories are first shared in the context of the project’s annual public walk, which since **2015** has taken place across several days and has included, on any given day, up to 200 walkers, approximately 25% of whom have experienced detention. Herd has shaped all walks by commissioning all the talks and tales that constitute their focal points. The annual walks – along with the project’s interim monthly day\-long walks – provide a space in which former detainees experience a sense of belonging that is of considerable benefit to their wellbeing. This benefit can only be registered through individual testimony. As ‘R’ \(for whom Herd acted as writing mentor\) observed in ‘The Volunteer’s Tale’ in **2019**: ‘So now I feel, like, you know, I am surrounded by a new family. I can feel that now. And I hope everything stays like that’ **\[j\]**. Such accounts of the project’s value have been echoed when people with lived experience of detention have spoken to national media \(for example on *Ramblings* and *Today*\) and in feedback to the project. As a first\-time walker said following the **2019** walk: ‘As a refugee in this country, I have never felt so welcome than I did on this particular walk’ **\[j, k\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research into the role of textiles, their use and manufacture in Victorian literature and culture led in 2013 to the establishment of the Textile Stories project. Public\-engagement events included seven annual study days, and other talks and workshops in collaboration with regional and national museums, libraries, churches, charities, literary festivals, and literary societies. These brought together people interested in textiles: professionals \(costume designers, museum curators, needlecraft teachers, artists, pattern\-cutters, rare\-breed sheep farmers\) and amateurs \(crafts hobbyists, vintage clothes enthusiasts, fans of costume drama\) were introduced to academic research on textiles in literature and screen adaptations. These interactive events inspired more than 250 participants to experience an enriched understanding of the literary and cultural importance of textiles. This stimulated creativity and promoted wellbeing, as well as prompting participants to read books and watch films they might otherwise ignore, engage in further study, and change their professional practices. The project’s reach was extended by a Textile Stories blog, online talks, and an appearance on a primetime BBC television show. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research was conducted by Deborah Wynne \(Professor from 2010\), initially when researching women’s portable property in Victorian novels, funded by an AHRC Research Leave Grant in 2008\-09 \[ref. AH/G002940/1\]. The resulting monograph, *Women and Personal Property in the Victorian Novel* \(2010\) **\[3a\]**, demonstrated how writers depicted women’s property in the form of ‘soft wealth’ or textiles. From this beginning, Wynne’s understanding of textiles as pervasive in Victorian society and culture led her to examine the diversity of cloth representations in the literature of the long nineteenth century. She later gained an AHRC Fellowship \(2013\-14\) \[ref. AH/K00803X/1\]to focus on how textile cultures informed, and were represented in, nineteenth\-century literary culture and contemporary screen adaptations. The outputs from this research **\[3b, 3c, 3d, 3e\]** have contributed to the ‘material turn’ in Victorian studies. 

 The project’s research findings between 2010 and 2020 revealed that nineteenth\-century literature utilised a diversity of languages and plots related to cloth manufacture and a consumer economy based on the retail of textiles and clothing, showing how textile cultures facilitated writers’ engagements with political and social developments, from controversies around slavery and cotton manufacture to the conditions of British textile workers. Wynne’s research has ranged across the Victorian period: her published outputs include an article on Victorian textile recycling and paper manufacture in the writings of Dickens **\[3c\]**; a co\-authored study of Miss Havisham’s wedding dress in screen adaptations of *Great Expectations* **\[3b\]**; an analysis of male drapers’ assistants in late\-Victorian life\-writing and fiction **\[3d\]**; and an article examining Charlotte Brontë’s engagement with Yorkshire wool manufacturing in her novels and juvenilia **\[3e\]**. During her Fellowship year Wynne established the public engagement aspects of the project as a way of disseminating the research more broadly. This firmly set in place a plan for the impact evidenced in section 4.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Wynne’s research approaches the study of nineteenth\-century textiles, needlecrafts, dress, cloth manufacture, and the retailing of fabric from the perspective of literary studies. Submitted as an impact case study to REF2014 in its nascent stages, the project has grown considerably, benefiting from Wynne’s AHRC Fellowship in 2013\-14, which funded the first Textile Stories Study Day \(TSSD\) in 2013. This was followed by annual events on the same model, whereby Wynne presented talks based on her research project \(which included topics such as Elizabeth Gaskell, Manchester and US slave\-grown cotton, the Brontës and Yorkshire wool manufacture, and clothing and costume in Jane Austen’s novels and screen adaptations\). Additionally, invited speakers from the fashion and heritage industries, needlework instructors, sheep farmers specialising in wool production, novelists, poets, and textile artists presented talks and interactive workshops at the events. The study days introduced a general audience interested in textile history, fashion, vintage clothing, and crafts to Wynne’s research on textile cultures in nineteenth\-century literature and its modern manifestations in the form of screen adaptations, known as ‘costume dramas’. Harnessing this interest in textiles, crafts, museum collections and fashion, the TSSD activities engaged participants in discussions relating to costume in literature and film, thus encouraging the reading of literary texts and the co\-creation of resources via the Textile Stories blog, as participants and speakers contributed posts based on their interests and responses to the events **\[5:3\]**. Between 2013 and 2020 approximately 250 participants attended study days from a broad geographical reach within the UK \(one participant wrote: ‘I will be going back home to Scotland full of knowledge from answers to my questions and inspiration from all I have seen and heard’, TSSD 2015\) **\[5:2\]**. 80% of participants attended more than one event. 

 Wynne’s research findings have been delivered to the public through talks linked to her published work **\[3b, 3c, 3d, 3e\]**, and this has encouraged participants, some of whom would not normally have read nineteenth\-century fiction, to make meaningful engagements with literature and film via their interest in textiles. Designed to bring together diverse people from different backgrounds \(including teachers of needlecrafts; amateur crafts people; professional textile artists; fashion designers; fans of vintage clothing and costume dramas; collectors of antique textiles; school and college students\), participants shared their interests in textiles, and discovered how these could lead to rich engagements with literature and film. Some participants mentioned in feedback that they had previously considered academia remote and inaccessible and the TSSD, as their first experience of a university\-led event, had made them see the relevance of academic research; some were inspired to continue their studies in FE and HE **\[5:2\]**. Participants at the events recorded developing a sense of community and belonging, many expressing their appreciation of the unique opportunities afforded by the TSSDs to discuss their interests in textiles in the context of literature and film **\[5:1\]**. In this way, the events \(along with the project’s related blog **\[5:3\]**, which has attracted 64,645 views since 2013 from across the world\) have promoted wellbeing and stimulated creativity, as well as encouraging the reading of literary texts and watching of screen adaptations with new understanding. 

 The TSSDs have been held in different locations in the North West, Midlands and Wales, some on University of Chester campuses, while others, involving collaborations with museum curators, were hosted by museums **\[5:1\].** Some participants have contributed to the project’s blog, which was established in 2013 **\[5:3\]**. In addition to the day\-long annual study days, Wynne took the project to other venues, delivering public lectures based on her literary textiles research in libraries and churches \(the Unitarian Chapel, Shrewsbury \(2019\), for example\), and in 2017 for a charity’s fundraising event \(namely the Shrewsbury Drapers’ Guild’s project to build homes for the disadvantaged elderly\). She was invited to present talks at numerous literary festivals \(including Gladfest at Gladstone’s Library in 2015 and 2019\) and events organised by literary societies \(including the Brontë Society \(2016\); Gaskell Society \(2018\); Jane Austen Society \(2015\); Mary Webb Society \(2019\); and Arnold Bennett Society \(2019\)\). These talks recruited new participants for the TSSDs. 

###  Impact on participants: new discoveries of literature and screen adaptations 

 The feedback from each study day is dominated by the word ‘inspiring’, with participants revealing how the events stimulated them to read books and watch films they did not know about before; one participant reported: ‘I’ll certainly be seeking out Elizabeth Gaskell novels’ \(TSSD 2019\), while another stated: ‘I’ve never seen “The Piano” but I will now’ \(TSSD 2014\) **\[5:2\]**. Many now engage with nineteenth\-century texts via their love of textiles and crafts **\[5:1\]**. Comments from participants reveal an impulse to take what they have learned at the study day to explore cultural forms differently. For example, feedback comments include: ‘Will look at film and TV dramas in a different light\!’ \(TSSD 2014\); ‘My mind has been opened and questions are being asked in it. I have made a note of your suggested books and look forward to reading them’ \(TSSD 2018\) **\[5:2\]**. Participants reported enjoying the novelty of being presented with information from an academic perspective, an indication of the educational benefits of the events **\[5:1\]**. For some, it has been a revelation to discover new aspects of culture: ‘Who knew there was so much to wool\! It is even in art and literature’ \(TSSD 2016\) **\[5:2\]**. As these typical comments demonstrate, the study days have prompted participants to think of new ways of engaging with textiles via literature and film, enriching their hobbies and professional interests, and raising awareness of the role of textiles in literary texts, screen adaptations and historical contexts **\[5:1\]**. 

###  Impact on participants: furthering education 

 Some participants have been stimulated by the study days to continue their education or to view their studies differently. One college student reported, ‘I’ve left with lots of think about and this has been an excellent add on to my textile art studies’ \(TSSD 2019\) **\[5:2\]**. Others took practical steps to return to education, one writing: ‘Attending the study day in 2015 reignited my love of learning, and contributed to my enrolling on the MRes in Gender Studies’; she went on to complete a dissertation at Chester’s Institute of Gender Studies on gender and 1950s home dressmaking, graduating in 2020 **\[5:2\]**. Another participant, a retired Maths teacher with an MA in Textile History, was stimulated by the first TSSD to study for a PhD on the cultural history of tatting lace, gaining her PhD \(supervised by Wynne\) in 2018 when she was 80 years old: ‘It was after attending one of the Textile Story Days that I was inspired to transfer \[…\] to Professor Deborah Wynne who was inspirational’ **\[5:2\]**. Another retired participant stated in 2019, ‘Textile Stories enables me to keep in touch with education \[…\] helping to fill a much\-needed gap where I can continue learning alongside others’ **\[5:2\]**. A number of school and college students have attended the TSSDs: one 15\-year old reported gaining a new understanding of textiles, fashion and costume through the lens of literary and film studies, and wrote about this in a blog post for the *Textile Stories* blog **\[5:3\].** 

###  Impact on textile professionals and teachers 

 The study days have also been popular with a range of professionals, such as teachers of crafts \(including spinning; weaving; pattern cutting; and natural dyeing\); sheep farmers specialising in wool production; textile artists; fashion and costume designers; and museum curators, many setting up stalls at the events to showcase their work or the collections they manage in the museums and heritage sites \(such as the Flax Mill in Shrewsbury\) **\[5:1\]**. The events have also encouraged some professionals to change their practices. For example, a needlework teacher stated in an email that attending the Textile Stories events encouraged her to include references to literature in her talks; in her demonstrations of creating vintage\-style smocks she now refers to representations of smocks in the work of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy **\[5:2\]**. One participant reported: ‘The talk on Miss Haversham’s \[sic\] dress prompted me to make my own version of her wedding dress for World Book Day, when I was employed as a reading interventionist specialist teaching assistant at Middlewich High School. This also inspired a display around the reading room of the novels of Charles Dickens’ **\[5:2\]**. 

###  Impact via the media 

 In 2019 Wynne was interviewed for the BBC One series *The Great British Sewing Bee* about her research into textile recycling in the Victorian period. This was broadcast on 27/05/2020, the series attracting c. 4.9 million viewers per episode. The interview came about when the producer \(from Love Productions\) had read Wynne’s open access journal article on Dickens and rags recycling **\[3c\]**. Wynne showcased Dickens’s interest in rags recycling in his writing, thus highlighting in the interview the relationship between textiles and literature to a mass audience. 

###  Impact on the heritage sector 

 The *Textile Stories* study days have also been organised in collaboration with heritage organisations, as museum curators heard of the success of Wynne’s events. In 2017 the Director of the Silk Museum in Macclesfield invited Wynne to organise the study day in the museum as a way of promoting its collection to a wider audience. Costumes and other silk items which had long been in storage were displayed, revealing the breadth of the collection to participants. The event also involved a crafts session, whereby participants constructed booklets using textual fragments from *Jane Eyre* and fragments of waste silk. One participant found this creative bringing together of text and fabric ‘inspirational’ **\[5:2\]**. 

 In 2020 Wynne collaborated with Wrexham Museum to organise an event designed to display for the first time items from its costume collection. The whole collection had been in storage since its arrival at the Museum in 1980 **\[5:1\]**. For this study day Wynne worked with Ruth Caswell, an award\-winning costume\-maker for the films *Shakespeare in Love* \(1998\) and *Elizabeth* \(1998\), as well as for television and theatre productions, while her fashion designs had featured in *Vogue*. Caswell had approached Wynne after hearing her talk on Victorian textiles at Gladfest, Gladstone Library’s literary festival in North Wales in 2019. They went on to collaborate with Wrexham Museum’s lead curator, Karen Murdoch, to organise a study day for 40 participants as a way of highlighting how collections of historical costume can inspire the making of costumes for theatre and film. The Victorian costumes were taken from their storage boxes, where they had lain since the 1980s, and were then displayed and explained during the event. For example, Wynne discussed the design of one gown from the 1840s in relation to Charlotte Brontë’s *Jane Eyre* and its many screen adaptations. The study day began with Wynne interviewing Ruth Caswell about her work with actors to develop character through costume **.** One participant noted: ‘Really made me think about costume in a new way’ **\[5:2\]**. The study day, as well as benefitting the participants, also helped the Museum to rethink the importance of its collection. Karen Murdoch stated in an email after the event that it had ‘an even greater impact as it has provided the momentum needed to look at larger projects as well as enabling us to start to understand the wealth of the collection’ **\[5:2\]**. 

 Other collaborations with the heritage sector involved speakers at the study days from the National Trust at Attingham Park, Shropshire \(2019\); from the Flax Mill heritage site in Shrewsbury \(2018\); and from the V&A \(in 2014 and 2016\), all of whom talked to participants about the textile and costume collections they manage. Participants mentioned in feedback that they had subsequently visited these heritage sites and museums with a new awareness of their links to literature and film **\[5:1\]**. The costume curator at Attingham Park, Holly Kirby, reported that following her involvement in the 2019 study day there was an increase on previous years in the number of people booked for her 2019 Summer guided tours of the costume collection **\[5:2\]**. Participants mentioned to her that their attendance at the TSSD had prompted them to book a guided tour, offering further evidence that Wynne’s project made an impact on the heritage industry. 

###  Online impact during the Covid\-19 pandemic 

 The cancellation of the 2020 TSSD because of the pandemic led to Wynne establishing alternative channels of communication via the *Textile Stories* blog **\[5:3\]**. Participants at previous events were invited to submit details of their textile crafts projects, along with the books they were reading while under lockdown. Many reported finding this channel of communication useful, enabling them to retain their awareness of the relationships between texts and textiles and feel a sense of connectedness with the people they had met at previous study days **\[5:3\]**. Further opportunities for online engagement came later in 2020 when Wynne was invited to present a short talk on textile recycling and paper\-making \(delivered on 06/08/20\) for the *Crafting Communities: A Series of Victorian Object Lessons & Scholarly Exchanges in COVID Times* project, organised by the Victorian Studies Association of Western Canada and involving scholars from the Universities of Alberta and Victoria. Wynne presented \(and will present in 2021\) online talks on Victorian textile recycling to a global audience of 65 academics and members of the public. In response to her talk, one non\-academic participant from the UK emailed Wynne to say, ‘thoroughly enjoyed your discussion about “rag collectors”. For many years I researched my family tree and recently came across a great grandparent who was a “rag sorter”. Your talk gave me a new perspective and made me think about him in a completely different way’ **\[5:2\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The revenues of regulated water companies in Great Britain are set in advance, with Ofwat having set 2020\-2025 prices for England and Wales in December 2019 and the Water Industry Commission for Scotland \(WICS\) having set 2021\-2027 prices in December 2020. Productivity and cost assessment research at Loughborough University played a major role in informing these complex regulatory decisions. It contributed to Ofwat’s and WICS’s decisions to reduce by around GBP2.7 billion the allowed regulated revenues paid by all water service customers in Great Britain. It improved Anglian Water’s cost assessment modelling and thereby shaped the company’s Regulatory Business Plan submission, its response to Ofwat’s Draft Determination and its appeal against Ofwat’s Final Determination. Moreover, it influenced the Competition and Markets Authority’s September 2020 provisional appeal judgment, adding GBP46 million for the provision of resilient services to Anglian’s six million customers.

 **2.  Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Water companies in Great Britain are subject to regulated revenues that are set in advance for five years by Ofwat in England and Wales and for six years by WICS in Scotland. Revenues are set based on the regulator’s prediction of future cost requirements, which means each firm’s cost improvement potential must be assessed as part of the process. 

 When determining the potential for cost improvement, Ofwat and WICS both consider general productivity trends in the industry to set a continuing efficiency challenge for all regulated firms. In addition, Ofwat compares the relative cost efficiency of firms and allows lower revenues for those it deems less cost\-efficient. 

 In 2015 the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) was highly critical of Ofwat’s previous relative cost\-efficiency methodology, as a result of which Ofwat developed a new approach for its December 2019 determinations. English and Welsh water companies also developed alternative cost assessment models. These were used not only to provide evidence supporting their projected 2020\-2025 costs in their Regulatory Business Plan submissions but to challenge the appropriateness of Ofwat’s methodology via formal responses to its initial and draft regulatory determinations and, ultimately, via appeal against Ofwat’s Final Determinations. Given this context, research at Loughborough by Professor David Saal, Dr Maia Nieswand and Professor Tom Weyman\-Jones has provided essential insights relevant to regulatory cost assessment modelling. 

 The research report co\-authored by Saal for Water UK **\[R1\]** provided English water industry productivity estimates for 1993 to 2017 and found evidence of a substantial slowdown in productivity growth after 2011. This report is often referred to as the Water UK and Frontier Economics report. Research by Saal and Weyman\-Jones **\[R2\]** provided evidence on the impact of privatisation and regulation, along with other drivers, on water industry productivity trends from 1985 to 2000. Collectively, this work also demonstrated the need to include water and sewage outputs to accurately measure productivity growth if firms produce both **.** 

 Further research modelled the water operations of English and Welsh water companies for the period from 1996 to 2010, highlighting the need to control for water delivered, leakage \(water scarcity\), connections and supply area in modelling **\[R3\]**. Research also demonstrated the presence of cost interactions between upstream and downstream activities that should be controlled for **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. Moreover, by proving that cost model parameters differ for integrated electricity companies that both generate and distribute electricity relative to firms that generate or distribute it separately, the research revealed potential assessment bias if the costs of multiple output firms are modelled with a single output **\[R4\]**. 

 Research also provided sophisticated econometric models using logged and translog specifications in which the meanings of parameter values need to be carefully interpreted **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. This demonstrated that further operating characteristic controls are necessary to properly assess a firm’s costs. In addition, it was shown that operating characteristic controls are still necessary even when employing econometric techniques controlling for unmodelled company characteristics **\[R2\]** or company\-specific efficiency differences **\[R3\]**. 

 Regulators may fail to implement efficient cost levels and revenue caps by not properly accounting for operating characteristics **\[R5,** **R6\]**. This was first demonstrated in the case of regulated Norwegian electricity companies **\[R5\]** and then reinforced by a methodological piece that applied simulation analysis and thereby showed how assessment can be extremely sensitive to different approaches to controlling for such characteristics **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Regulators and water companies used the research to support their competing positions on determining regulated revenues. The research has impacted policymakers at Ofwat, WICS, Anglian Water and the CMA, as well as water company shareholders and all users of water services in Great Britain. Ultimately, revenues, profits, quality of service, prices and bills are all directly impacted by the outcomes of these regulatory processes. Specific examples are detailed below. 

 **• Contributed to a GBP2.7 billion reduction in the regulated revenues paid by all water service customers in Great Britain** 

 The research on productivity trends influenced Ofwat’s regulatory expectations on performance. In October 2018, the regulator’s Chief Executive cited the evidence of recent low productivity growth **\[R1\]** as justifying the need to require substantial productivity improvements in the 2020\-2025 period **\[S1\]**. Ofwat’s December 2019 Final Determination documents **\[S2\]** directly reported the research’s estimates to support the final determination of a cost productivity improvement challenge of 1.1% per annum for 2020\-2025, amounting to a total reduction in regulated bills of approximately GBP2.5 billion. 

 Similarly, WICS’s October 2020 Draft Determination document **\[S3\]** cited the research **\[R1\]** to justify the requirement to impose a 1.0% per annum efficiency challenge on Scottish Water. This reduced the company’s GBP8 billion 2021\-2027 revenue allowance by GBP0.2 billion **\[S3\]**. This draft determination was subsequently sustained in WICS’s December 2020 Final Determination. 

 *• **Improved Anglian Water’s relative cost\-efficiency modelling and its use as evidence in Anglian’s regulatory submissions throughout the price determination process** 

 In 2017\-2018, at the company’s request, Saal and colleagues produced an academically informed review of Anglian Water’s Phase 1 regulatory cost assessment work and then worked with Anglian on improved models. These activities drew heavily on the underlying research with regard to cost assessment modelling **\[R1** to **R6\]** and were annexes to Anglian’s September 2018 Regulatory Business Plan submission to Ofwat **\[S4\]** and its April 2020 Statement of Case for its appeal against Ofwat’s Final Determination **\[S7\]**. 

 The academic insights and the models developed from them were repeatedly cited by Anglian in these documents, as well as in further submissions the company made to Ofwat as part of the regulatory process **\[S5, S6\]**. In April 2019 Anglian’s Regulation Director indicated that the contribution of the research was fundamental to the company’s Regulatory Business Plan, stating: “The insights... influenced our approach to regulatory cost assessment and every cost model we employed. They significantly influenced the GBP6.8 billion expenditure requirement we put forward as part of our regulatory business plan.” **\[S10\]** 

 In January 2019 Ofwat published its initial assessment of Anglian’s Regulatory Business Plan, suggesting Anglian’s efficient expenditure requirements amounted to only GBP5.5 billion. In April 2019 Anglian published its response, which included an academic\-based review of Ofwat’s cost assessment model, authored by Saal, which Anglian used as evidence in rejecting the appropriateness of Ofwat’s modelling **\[S5\]**. Anglian stood by the cost assessment models Saal and Nieswand helped it develop. The company’s Regulation Director stated in April 2019: “The insights drawn from your academic research have influenced our strategy in responding to Ofwat’s initial assessment of plans and provided a significant part of the evidence base we have submitted to Ofwat.” **\[S10\]** 

 In July 2019 Ofwat published its draft PR19 determinations for Anglian and other companies, making no significant changes to its cost assessment models. In August 2019 Anglian responded in its Draft Determination Representation **\[S6\]**, largely retaining its original Regulatory Business Plan. The reply to Ofwat included further substantial reference to insights drawn from the research, as well as an annex authored by Saal **\[S6\]**. Anglian also referenced new water cost assessment models derived particularly from **R3**, developed by Saal as alternatives to Ofwat’s models. 

 In December 2019 Ofwat published its final PR2019 determinations and again made no significant changes to its cost assessment models. In February 2020 Anglian was one of an unprecedented four water companies to appeal their PR19 price determinations **.** In April 2020 Anglian’s Statement of Case to the CMA included four reports written by Saal and Nieswand, with a substantial amount of the discussion featured in the statement based on these **\[S7\]**. 

 In June 2020 Anglian responded to Ofwat’s comments on the company’s Statement of Case and again substantially cited Saal and Nieswand’s insights, as drawn from their research. Anglian’s response **\[S8\]** also cited and incorporated a set of alternative wastewater cost assessment models developed by Saal and Nieswand for consideration by the CMA, with this modelling again informed by **R2** to **R6**. In December 2020 Anglian’s Regulation Director confirmed: “Anglian Water’s Statement of Case to the CMA, our response to Ofwat’s response to our Statement of Case and our October 2020 response to the CMA’s provisional findings relied significantly on models and arguments that build directly from your recently published research.” **\[S10\]** 

 *• **Influenced the CMA provisional appeal decision, thus increasing the resources available to provide resilient services to Anglian’s customers** 

 In its September 2020 Provisional Determinations the CMA removed one of the sewage collection cost assessment models used by Ofwat, as its parameters were counterintuitive. This decision was responsible for a GBP46 million increase in allowed costs and hence revenues for Anglian **\[S9\]**. 

 The decision was made in response to evidence provided in Anglian’s Statement of Case, **\[S7\]**, which was based on the scientific understanding of logged functional forms developed by the research team. It replicated arguments made in Saal and Nieswand’s review of Ofwat’s models, based on insights from **R2** to **R4**, which Anglian had included in its response to Ofwat’s initial assessment of its Regulatory Business Plan **\[S5\]**. 

 As noted by Anglian’s Regulation Director in December 2020: “The CMA’s rejection of one of Ofwat’s sewage collection cost models was based on evidence drawn from the insights of your academic research using logged and translog modelling... The significance of this particular impact of your research is demonstrated by the fact that it alone closed 20% of the gap between the expenditure we believe is required to maintain the resilience of our sewage networks for our customers and the resources that Ofwat allowed us in its final determinations.” **\[S10\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Calls to increase teaching about colonialism in schools have intensified in recent years. Black history forms only a small part of the national curriculum and what is taught often centres on histories of enslavement, erasing the agency of black individuals and potentially alienating non\-white school pupils. Based on their research into the West India Regiments, Lambert and Lockley created an Online Learning Resource that enables schoolteachers to explore the broader history of the Empire in an accessible and sensitive way. The learning resource has been accessed 42,393 times, with a spike in uptake in June 2020, coinciding with increased attention on the Black Lives Matter movement \(5.1\). An exhibition at Museum of London Docklands, underpinned by their research, has also increased public understanding of African\-Caribbean men’s contribution to British military history while opening up a conversation about the British Empire.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Africa’s Sons Under Arms \(ASUA\) project, funded by the AHRC, had four strands: 

 **A\) Military Medicine and the Making of Race \(led by Lockley\)** used the West India Regiments \(WIRs\) to analyse changing racial attitudes in the Anglophone Atlantic. Britain’s black soldiers were used as a benchmark by those who believed ‘blackness’ could be defined, measured or quantified as something tangible and in opposition to ‘whiteness’. Britain’s military physicians advanced the idea that white and black bodies were medically different and this came to have a significant international impact, particularly in the support of polygenesis arguments that different ‘races’ did not share the same origin. Without the WIRs those writing about race would have had neither literature nor data to support their theories about black bodies. While polygenic arguments were ultimately discredited, the perception that black bodies were medically inferior to white bodies persisted far longer \(3.2; 3.3\). 

 **B\) Slaves to Soldiers: The Image of the West India Regiments in Britain and the Empire, 1795\-1914 \(led by Lambert\)** examined the contested image of black soldiers during the ‘long’ nineteenth century. The WIRs held an ambiguous place within British imperial discourses around race, masculinity, martial prowess and heroism. Competing representations, particularly by the WIRs’ commanding officers and West Indian colonists, was part of a broader struggle over the representation of the African subject that was a significant element of the ‘war of representation’ during the Age of Abolition \(3.1; 3.2\). 

 **C\) Slavery in Print: Slaveholding ideology and anxiety in Antebellum Southern Newspapers, 1830\-1860 \(led by Lockley and included PhD studentship for Rosalyn Narayan\)** examined the role of the antebellum southern press in propagating the racist stereotypes, including those of black soldiers. Narayan highlighted the importance of newspapers in both creating and perpetuating anxieties amongst the slaveholding elite, whilst also bolstering slaveholders’ moral justification for their exploitation of fellow human beings \(3.2\). 

 **D\) Picturing the West India Regiments: Race, Empire, and Photography, c.1850\-1914 \(led by Lambert and included PhD studentship for Melissa Bennett\)** showed that visual representations of the WIR rank\-and\-file reflected their ambivalent position within the British Empire’s racial hierarchies. Photographs and other visual sources demonstrate that imperial ideas about race were flexible when necessary, and both shaped and were shaped by the ideology, economics, and logistics of imperial expansion \(3.2\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ‘The histories of BME communities in Britain are…often absent from school and university curricula. Even when those histories are present, a seemingly relentless focus on enslavement, abolition and exploitation is viewed by students as intellectually limiting and, at times, alienating. In diversifying the curriculum, it is especially important to go beyond these limited vantage points.’

###  Online Learning Resource for Schools 

 Increasingly, campaigners are pushing to decolonise the curriculum by ensuring that colonial history is taught in schools. Where they appear at all, non\-white people largely feature in the British history curriculum as subjects of exploitation. By using their research on the history of the WIRs to produce a free Online Learning Resource \(OLR\), ASUA has created an alternative narrative for students in which people of African descent can be recognised as the significant and complex historical agents they are. 

 Launched in November 2017, The OLR was developed for pupils aged 11\-14 and is hosted by the British Library \( [https://www.bl.uk/west\-india\-regiment](https://www.bl.uk/west-india-regiment)\). It contains digitised images, captions, a timeline and essays, plus a Teachers’ Pack with lesson plans and activities \( [https://www.bl.uk/teaching\-resources/west\-india\-regiment](https://www.bl.uk/teaching-resources/west-india-regiment)\). Between 16 November 2017 and 30 June 2020, the OLR received 42,393 unique visits; there was particular uptake in June 2020, coinciding with the increased attention on the Black Lives Matter movement \(5.1\). A February 2018 workshop for approximately 50 teachers showcased the OLR as a new way of presenting Black history and the OLR was publicised through Modern History Review \(vol. 21:2\), distributed to approximately 800 schools. 

 The resource enables teachers to engage their pupils with this important topic while meeting the requirements of the national curriculum. Black History \(including slavery\) features in the Year 8 history curriculum and ‘Empire’ is part of the syllabus for many GCSE exam boards. The OLR is an accessible, historically accurate resource to enhance how this part of the curriculum can be taught. It includes an introduction to Caribbean history; explanation of why the British Army created the WIRs and opposition to them; the day\-to\-day experiences and treatment of black soldiers; the 1802 mutiny of the 8<sup>th</sup> WIR in Dominica; and how the WIRs maintained and expanded the British Empire in the Caribbean and Africa. 

 Teachers who trialled the OLR commented that it enabled them to teach this material: ‘working with the site empowered me with the subject knowledge to teach the WIRs in a deep and meaningful way which wasn’t time demanding’. They felt that the material was engaging for pupils, who ‘loved the topic, even created an exhibition to share it with the school’. Another said that the resource was ‘a great way of interacting with well\-founded academic history research’ and that students had found it ‘user friendly when compared to other forms of “academic history”’ \(5.2\). 

 Participants at the workshop showcasing the OLR agreed: ‘I learned a lot that I can use in my teaching and some good approaches to identity which will cut across different elements of empire’ \(5.3\). 

 The OLR was also helpful in enabling the British Library to present Black history in new ways. Curator Beth Cooper, who worked with the Warwick research team, stated that ‘I have been able to take the skills and subject expertise that I gained through the ASUA project and apply them to my current work as a historical consultant on Caribbean focused public history projects at English Heritage and the Garden Museum’ \(5.4\). 

###  Museum Exhibition 

 Wider understanding of these histories was further advanced by a museum exhibition. Lambert and Lockley curated ‘Fighting for Empire’ at the Museum of London Docklands \(MLD\) between November 2017 and September 2018. An exhibition\-related event for community organizations and the public was also held on 14 July 2018 with the Windrush Foundation, which works with academics to increase public knowledge of Caribbean peoples’ contributions to British \(military\) history, something that the Foundation felt ‘has not always been acknowledged or commemorated’ \(5.5\). 

 The exhibition highlighted the long\-term role of people of African descent in the British army by focusing on Samuel Hodge, the first African\-Caribbean soldier to win the Victoria Cross in 1866. The exhibition featured a 19<sup>th</sup>\-century painting of Hodge that was unique in featuring a black military hero. The owners, Penlee House Gallery and Museum \(Cornwall\), had never previously been asked to loan this painting but were keen to do so. They commented that the loan to MLD raised their profile: ‘as a small regional gallery, we are always keen on opportunities to promote our organisation and its collections’. The Gallery is using research on the painting undertaken for the exhibition in its ‘Citizen Curators’ scheme, through which the Gallery is reinterpreting its collections to explore Black history \(5.6\). 

 Both the exhibition and event were successful in raising public awareness of this history. Feedback from the community event showed that it successfully raised awareness about the long\-term role of African\-Caribbean men in British war efforts, with one attendee commenting that they had had no idea that ‘so many Black people were fighting for the empire’ \(5.7\). The MLD exit survey at the exhibition showed that 82% of visitors felt the exhibition had enriched their understanding of the WIRs. Interviews showed that most were unaware that men and boys of African descent had served in the British Army before the First World War. As a result of the display, almost all \(94%\) understood more about the WIRs \(5.8\). Interviews also showed that some visitors had never thought about the imperial role of the British Army and its connection to slavery. This led to reflection on national identity, patriotism, racism, power structures and school curricula: ‘It makes you question the Empire, it makes you think differently. We’re taught more about the UK as “heroes” around the world, about all the civilisation we’ve given people but it’s not always the truth’ \(5.8\). 

 Bennett, one of the PhD students on the AHRC project, contributed to the exhibition and went on to become Higher Education Programme Manager at the Museum of London. Reflecting on her involvement, she stated that it ‘gave me invaluable experience and knowledge that led to me being given the opportunity to curate my own display in the space 2 years later \(this time as a Museum of London employee\). My knowledge of the museum's Caribbean and West African collections, gained from my time on the ASUA project, meant that ... I was even able to include an object directly connected to the WIRs in my own exhibition’ \(5.9\). 

 Through their work with community groups, museums and galleries, schoolteachers and the public, ASUA has improved public knowledge of WIRs, contributed to the teaching of colonialism in schools and influenced the perception of Black history in Britain prior to the First World War.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 University of Bristol \(UoB\) research has produced a diverse cluster of companies exploiting quantum photonic technologies, including the world’s most highly funded start\-up quantum computing company, which has raised USD215M and created over 100 jobs. Companies exploiting UoB research are enabling secure telecommunications; reducing diagnostic time and reliance on broad\-spectrum antibiotics in healthcare; and combating climate change by preventing leakage of natural gas from production facilities. The research has led to the founding of a skills and training centre for quantum entrepreneurs from which 31 new businesses have been developed, attracting a combined investment of GBP44.8M and creating 126 new highly skilled jobs. To grow this vibrant technology ecosystem, we have attracted GBP91M for a business incubator which will further enhance Bristol’s position as a world leading centre for the commercialisation of quantum technologies.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Before the advent of integrated quantum photonics, state\-of\-the\-art photonics involved bulky apparatus and unwieldy table\-top interferometers the stabilisation of which was challenging. In 2008, UoB researchers from the Quantum Engineering Technology Laboratories \(QET Labs\) combined their interdisciplinary strengths in quantum photonics and microfabrication to demonstrate the first integrated photonic quantum logic gate on a chip \[1\]. These first quantum photonic chips were fabricated in silica \(glass\). At only a few square centimetres in size, they had the advantage of being two orders of magnitude smaller than their bulk optics predecessors, but more importantly they were completely interferometrically stable. 

 A further development showed how the platform could be fabricated from silicon \[2\] which allowed the UoB team to exploit mature fabrication tools from the microelectronics industry. This permitted much greater numbers of photonic components to be combined on a single chip, leading to the development of a multidimensional integrated quantum photonic platform able to generate, control, and analyse high\-dimensional quantum entanglement. This platform marked a major step towards the creation of a quantum computer based on silicon photonics. 

 A further large body of work has demonstrated that techniques for generating single photons, controlling their interaction with nanoscale structures, precision time\-of\-flight measurements and sensitive photodetection techniques, together provide a versatile platform for a wide variety of photonic quantum technologies, including secure communications \[3\], metrology \[4\], sensing \[5\] and imaging \[6\]. Seven UoB patents have underpinned a drive towards applications. The combined body of work on integrated quantum photonics from the UoB group comprises over 100 publications, with 20 in Nature, Science, and the Nature journal family.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 UoB’s ground\-breaking research in quantum photonics provides opportunities for a host of innovative applications. Supported by a strong entrepreneurial culture, academics have leveraged their interdisciplinary skillsets to found a series of new companies. They have also established a world\-leading skills and training centre \(QTEC\) for budding entrepreneurs in quantum inspired technologies.  These initiatives have spawned a vibrant local ecosystem in quantum technologies. From our diverse portfolio, we highlight several companies that have developed directly out of UoB’s research. 

#  1\) PsiQuantum – photonic quantum computing 

 Quantum computing is the most ambitious and far\-reaching quantum technology, with applications including new methods for drug discovery and dramatic speed ups in data searching and image recognition. In 2016, QET Labs academics co\-founded the world’s most highly funded quantum computing start\-up company, PsiQuantum in Silicon Valley \[A\] to exploit UoB research in quantum photonics. 

 The basic unit of information in a quantum computer is the qubit and it is widely accepted that the first useful computer will require at least 1 million physical qubits. A highly promising way to achieve this is via photonics and the technological innovations at the heart of PsiQuantum were invented at UoB \[1,2\].  Specifically, PsiQuantum exploits QET Labs’ development of silicon photonic quantum circuit chip technology which allows operations on qubits at room temperature. These chips can be fabricated in standard microchip foundries. Silicon photonics greatly enhances the scalability at which a quantum computer can be designed and ameliorates several of the engineering issues that plague other computing architectures such as ion\-traps and superconductors. In the words of PsiQuantum’s CTO: “ *Rather than take a quantum system and make it scalable, we have taken a scalable process \- silicon manufacturing \- and made it quantum*”. 

 Four UoB patents have been transferred to PsiQuantum \[B\]. Since 2016 the company has raised USD215M including investment from Microsoft’s venture capital arm and Blackrock \[A\]. They operate from their own premises in Palo Alto where they employ over 100 people \[C\]. PsiQuantum have formed a strategic alliance with *Global Foundries*, a top tier semiconductor fabrication company, to produce the hardware for their quantum computer \[A,C\]. 

#  2\) KETS Quantum Security – increased encryption security for UK industry 

 KETS uses quantum key distribution \(QKD\) protocols to realize cost\-effective encryption for secure communications.  Their chip based QKD technology \[3\], protected by a UoB patent, enables applications that call for ultra\-low size, weight and power, without compromising performance. KETS are working with multinational companies across diverse sectors, including Airbus, BT and Thales. The Head of Optical Research at BT stated that *“The KETS solution solves that problem* \[of high cost of equipment\] *through integration and this puts them in a very strong position to capitalise on the current world ambition towards quantum secured communication""* \[D\].  R&D work with Airbus on an Innovate\-UK funded project has developed secure communications for unmanned aerial vehicles \[D\]. Investor Quantonation states “W *e opted to invest in KETS due to their potential to become a global leader in quantum secure communications and as a result of their technological advantage gained from nearly 10 years of world class research in quantum technologies”* \[E\]. KETS employs 12.5 FTE staff and has raised investment of over GBP2M \[C\]. 

#  3\) FluoretiQ – point of care diagnostics for health services and patients 

 Annually 700,000 people die due to drug\-resistant infections. Using UoB discoveries to resolve fluorescence emissions at the single\-photon level \[5,F\], FluoretiQ, has developed a rapid \(15 minutes\) diagnostic platform to identify specific bacterial pathogens. This technology reduces the time to diagnosis and obviates the need to prescribe broad\-spectrum antibiotics that encourage the global threat of bacterial resistance \[C\].  A prototype analyser for identifying *E. coli* \(which accounts for 80% of urinary tract infections\) has been trialled in an NHS lab \[F\]. FluoretiQ employs 7 FTE and has raised over GBP1M investment \[C\]. 

#  4\) QLM Technology – preventing gas losses for the natural gas industry 

 Leakage of natural gas to the atmosphere constitutes more than 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and costs industry more than USD30 billion annually \[G\]. QLM \(Quantum Light Metrology\) produce a tuneable diode laser gas detection and imaging system based on Light Detection and Ranging technology the sensitivity of which is enhanced via UoB discovered techniques for single photon quantum optics and detection techniques \[4\]. This low power detector underwent field trials in 2020 and is at the centre of the GBP2.7M SPLICE project in which QLM is collaborating with the National Physical Laboratory BP, National Grid and Ametek among others \[C\].  QLM has revenue of GBP200K and employs 7 FTE \[C\]. 

#  5\) RayCal – correlated photon pair source 

 RayCal in collaboration with Thorlabs have developed a commercial version of a correlated photon pair source, the SPDC810. This is based on UoB research on the suppression of the quantum fluctuations that cause errors in optical metrology \[6\]. The director of Thorlabs’ Laser Division said *“This is an exciting addition to Thorlabs’ line up of products for the Quantum Photonics community. The project started when a UoB researcher asked if we could expedite the efforts of those working in quantum optics labs by offering a compact, reliable single photon source. Prompted by that need, we engaged in a collaborative effort that led to the development of the SPDC source”* \[H\]. The product went to market in August 2020 and in the first 4 months has  accumulated sales of GBP 80K \[C\]. 

#  6\) Duality Quantum Photonics – photonic chips to simulate molecular dynamics 

 DQP was founded in early 2020 to design and fabricate photonic chips that can simulate the quantum dynamical behaviour of molecules to assist drug design in the pharmaceutical industry. DQP are collaborating with Hitachi Europe and ARM on a novel quantum operating system and have secured GBP900K of investment and sales revenue of GBP325K \(contract with BT\). They employ 3 FTE \[C\]. 

#  7\) Qontrol – instrumentation for the global integrated photonics community 

 Founded in 2016, Qontrol develops and markets state\-of\-the\-art electronic instrumentation for the global integrated photonics community. The company’s products make controlling complex photonic and quantum photonic devices easy and economical. The CEO says \[C\] “ *Qontrol now boasts more than a hundred customers worldwide, including many of the largest companies in the global ICT space…Our success has only been possible because of the research and ecosystem developing around the University and City of Bristol”.* It has an annual turnover of around GBP200K and supports 4 FTE \[C\]. 

#  QTEC – An enterprise ecosystem for commercialising quantum technologies 

 Seeking to capitalise more widely on the potential for ground\-breaking applications arising from their research, in 2015 QET Labs secured GBP4.4M of EPSRC funding to establish the Quantum Technologies Enterprise Centre \(QTEC\). This innovative skills and training centre is producing the next generation of entrepreneurs in quantum technologies. 

 The 12\-month QTEC fellowship programme provides training and mentoring by academics and entrepreneurs with experience of commercialisation. Fellows gain new knowledge in quantum technologies, skills to develop a viable business plan, management expertise, and access to dedicated incubator space. They also forge connections to the investor community, the National Quantum Technology Hubs and relevant industry partners. 

 QTEC has trained 33 Quantum Enterprise Fellows across four cohorts \[I\]. According to the Chair of Innovate UK's Special Interest Group in Quantum Technologies “ *The QTEC fellowship program provides scientists with invaluable entrepreneurial skills which allows their companies to be successful. This in turn gives investors confidence in the companies” ...* “ *The vibrant Bristol quantum technologies ecosystem that has grown up around UoB and QTEC is unique and world leading, making it a very important centre for quantum industries in the UK with global significance.*” \[J\]. 

 The first cohort of four Fellows were all QET Labs alumni and have founded the four thriving companies \(2\)\-\(5\) above. Subsequent cohorts have been attracted from further afield, both nationally and internationally. These have founded a further 27 companies, 20 of which remain active \[I\], including *Nu Quantum* who have raised GBP2.75M to produce quantum photonic components, and *SeeQC* based in New York and employing 16 people, which has raised USD22.4M to develop a quantum computing processing system. SeeQC’s Managing Director said “ *I returned to the UK \[from the US\] and joined the QTEC fellowship program at the University of Bristol.  If QTEC had not provided me with these opportunities and skills, investment may not have been forthcoming, and my business success might never have happened.“* \[C\]. 

 QTEC’s Director of Enterprise notes that, “a *n independent report … found that a third of the UK’s funded Quantum Start\-ups originated through the QTEC fellowship programme*” \[I\].  By the end of 2020, QTEC alumni companies raised over GBP44.8M of funding from grants, revenue, and equity, generating 126 new highly skilled jobs \[I\]. 

 **QTIC\+ Local economic growth and capacity building** 

 Building on these successes, in 2019 UoB established the Quantum Technologies Innovation Centre \(QTIC\+\), as Europe’s first incubator providing specialist facilities and expertise for quantum businesses. Currently operating as a pilot facility, QTIC\+ is already making an impact, KETS’s CEO states “ *QTIC\+ provides us affordable access to the high\-tech equipment we need to develop our product. Without it we would have needed to raise a huge amount of capital to get started, while now we can, on a modest budget, produce our technology demonstrators*” \[C\]. 

 GBP91M has been invested in QTIC\+ as part of the Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus.  Investment comes from West of England Combined Authority \(WECA\) and the Local Enterprise Partnership \(LEP\) GBP35M, UoB GBP35M, and GBP21M from industry.  Commenting on the impact of QTIC\+ on Bristol, WECA’s Director of Business and Skills states that QTIC\+ will *“position the West of England as a global leader in deep tech innovation…This local strength has already attracted four global businesses with an existing presence in the region \(Boeing, Airbus Group, BAE Systems and Raytheon\) to establish their own quantum activities … WECA are excited about the potential of QTIC\+ to help propel fledgling quantum companies to success. Indeed, without it, there would be a high risk of losing these* *companies to other countries which are also investing heavily in quantum technologies”* \[K\] *.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The events surrounding the financial crash of 2007\-8 highlighted the very real human costs incurred when bad ethical practices are allowed to flourish in business. These events made clear that philosophical work on the relationship between businesses and the societies they serve should have a central role to play in influencing the attitudes of private sector organisations, and in raising awareness of the ethical dimensions of their activities. By providing rigorous underpinning research and thought\-leadership for a local social enterprise ‘Ethical Reading’ *,* Emma Borg and Brad Hooker’s work on what private sector organisations owe to society has had a material impact on business thinking and practice, raising ethical standards across the Reading Borough area and informing the national understanding of these issues. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Hooker’s influential research in moral philosophy, in particular his work on fairness, underpins this case study. He has critically evaluated John Broome’s theory that fairness consists in the proportional satisfaction of moral claims \(output 1\). Hooker has also considered whether, while there are many differences that fair rules must ignore, fairness requires that some important rules are sensitive to differences in what people need and deserve, including what people deserve on grounds of reciprocity \(output 2\). One component of Hooker’s overall moral view, which he defends against attack by Peter Singer, is that moral requirements should be suitable for publicity; suitable for teaching as part of moral education, suitable for guiding behaviour and reactions to behaviour, and suitable for justifying ones behaviour to others \(output 3\). 

 During the period of Hooker’s research on fairness, the business world saw a massive upheaval due to events related to the financial crash of 2008. Hooker and Borg recognised the fundamental importance of these events and both felt that Hooker’s work on fairness had important implications for the debate. Initially, their collaborative research focused on the financial services sector, exploring how we should construe the causes of the crash – as primarily epistemic failings or involving genuinely moral problems. As part of this collaborative work Borg and Hooker undertook a series of exploratory meetings with leading stakeholders from a range of sectors and firms, culminating in ‘Trust in Banking’ \(June 2016\) – an invitation\-only workshop hosted by the City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer. The exchange of ideas at this event led to the production of ‘Epistemic virtues versus ethical values in the financial services sector’ \(output 4\), in which Borg and Hooker argued that events around the financial crash involved specifically moral failings. If correct, this limited the ability of regulation to bring about change. Instead what was needed was a change of culture and purpose in organisations. Institutions needed to specify a ‘social purpose’ and to articulate the ethical values the firm intended to promote that goes beyond ‘window\-dressing’. Furthermore, Borg and Hooker suggested that firms needed to make greater investment in ethical training for employees, where this training needed to incorporate philosophical, specifically ethical, understanding in order to avoid being a mere ‘tick box’ exercise. 

 Following discussion of these issues in output 4, Borg recognised the need to further explore the theoretical underpinnings of the notion of ‘social purpose’. This led her to argue for the relevance of the Enlightenment thesis known as ‘doux commerce’ – that business can and should be a force for social good in its own right. She argued for crucial revisions to the original thesis, stating it as operating at the level of systemic relations between business and society rather than at the level of individual moral characteristics. Further, she linked the thesis to social contract theory, holding that in this form it provided a crucial theoretical basis for public calls for business to be done in a more ethical manner. She also argued for a new ‘social licence’ form of regulation to embed the demands of a firm’s social purpose. Presentation of these research ideas took place in a range of venues – including briefing documents for the Liberal Democrat Party, a public lecture at the University of Reading and a talk at the Institute of Business Ethics culminating in output 5.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Borg and Hooker’s work on what private sector organisations owe to society has had a material impact on business thinking and practice. It has helped raise ethical standards across the Reading Borough area and informed the national understanding of these issues. At a macro\-level, changes have been made to expected standards for all firms operating in the Reading area and at a micro\-level changes to practice within specific firms have taken place. 

 **A. Dissemination of theoretical ideas behind ethical business to industry groups** 

 Borg and Hooker consulted with a significant number of potential stakeholders in 2015 and ‘16, including financial services \(Barclays, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and the Bank of England\), legal services \(Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer\), politics \(Jesse Norman MP\) and third sector institutions \(the Banking Standards Board, UK Finance, Institute of Business Ethics, the Financial Services Consumer Panel at the Financial Conduct Authority, and the St. Paul’s Institute\). Representatives of these stakeholders were invited to the ‘Trust in Banking’ workshop in June 2016, hosted by the leading City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Derringer \(E1\). Borg and Hooker ran the event and presented at it, helping both to disseminate their ideas outside of academia and, crucially, providing feedback from non\-academics on their research. Their findings were then delivered to other stakeholders, including at the concluding panel discussion for the ‘Centre for Competition Policy annual conference \(2016\)’ and via invited briefing papers for the Banking Standards Board. 

 **B. Collaboration with Ethical Reading** 

 As a result of these engagement activities and following discussions with the Institute of Business Ethics in London, Borg and Hooker initiated contact and collaboration in March 2018 with a social enterprise organization – ‘Ethical Reading’. Ethical Reading exists to make Reading a better place to live and work through helping organisations do the right thing by each other, the wider community, and the environment. Currently, Ethical Reading has over 1000 individual members plus over 40 business partners, including large organisations such as Santander, Boyes Turner LLP, Shoosmiths LLP, Litchfields, and the Unite Union, together with small–medium sized \(SME\) organisations such as Reading Football Club, London Irish, and Jacobs the Jewellers. Ethical Reading’s reach with SMEs is particularly significant given that about 60% of the UK workforce is employed in this size of organization according to the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Reading Borough Council, Thames Valley Police, and the University of Reading are also recognized supporters \(E2\). 

 The directors of Ethical Reading are leading business experts with many years of experience, but none have specific expertise in ethics. Through a range of collaborative projects, Borg and Hooker provided the foundational research needed by the organisation, influencing the thinking and practice of Ethical Reading. In turn, this has influenced the thinking and practice of their business partners. Hooker is now a Director of Ethical Reading \(providing day\-to\-day thought leadership for the organization\) and leads on the Ethical Cities operational guide \(aiming to roll out the blueprint of Ethical Reading to other cities worldwide\); Borg sits on their Advisory Council \(meeting 4 times a year to decide overall direction and focus\) and has spoken at business breakfast briefings and other events. Borg, Hooker and several academic colleagues from the University’s Philosophy Department delivered a programme of 13 lunchtime webinars for business partners, on topics such as ‘What is right and wrong in business?’, ‘What role do managers play in creating an ethical workplace?’, and ‘What is implicit bias and what does it mean for ethics at work?’ In addition, the ideas articulated in output 4 on ethical training have influenced the form and content of Ethical Reading’s ‘Healthy and Ethical Workplaces’ training course. The Directors state that Borg and Hooker have become ‘a go\-to resource’, contributing to the ‘content, thinking and rationale’ of the organization and adding ‘weight and credibility’. Furthermore, their work is ‘definitely valued by \[business\] partners’, who find them ‘credible and effective’ \(E3\). 

 **C. Ethical Reading/Reading Borough Council’s ethical recruitment charter** 

 One of the most significant collaborations with Ethical Reading concerns Ethical Reading’s Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Implementation, based on Borg and Hooker’s research \(E4\). Consultation took place at an intensive half\-day workshop involving Borg, Hooker, representatives of Ethical Reading and a number of their Partners. This collaborative process resulted in Borg and Hooker writing the Code of Ethics which has now been formally adopted by Ethical Reading. Since then Ethical Reading has provided the Code to its business partners as a primary resource on business ethics. A launch event for the Code in 2019, was attended by key local stakeholders, including members of Reading Borough Council. The CEO of Reading Council noted the Code of Ethics will ‘encourage everybody that’s involved to act and think ethically in how they go about their business, so we can build a town we’re really proud of’ \(E5\). Impressed with the Code, the Council approached Ethical Reading to co\-produce an Ethical Recruitment Charter. This Charter utilizes three of the key values set out in the Code of Ethics \(respect, transparency, and fairness\) and sets a gold standard for recruitment practices across the Borough. As one Reading Councillor noted ‘It’s not that people are trying to treat applicants badly, they just don’t know how to treat them well. So that’s what \[the Charter\] does really simply and clearly – this is what you need to do to treat people well’ \(E6\). 

 The Charter was launched in March 2020, with the Council becoming the first signatory. The COO of The Association of Professional Staffing Companies called the Charter ‘a fantastic initiative’. It has served to codify and embed best practice for organisations in the Reading area, with signatories reviewing recruitment practices to bring them in line with the demands of the Charter. Its influence on recruitment practices is set to continue, with the Associate Director of recruitment agency Eximius Group commenting: ‘We believe as a Charter it can become a trademark for the Reading area’ \(E6\). 

 **D. The WorkInConfidence ethical metrics tool** 

 One of Ethical Reading’s partners, WorkInConfidence \(a firm that has adopted the Code of Ethics, E7\) has collaborated further with Borg and Hooker, following the attendance of the COO at the public lecture given by Borg \(‘Doing Business Better: Should Reading Firms have a Social Purpose?’, 2019\). The COO said ‘things in the talk resonated with what \[our organization is\] trying to do’ and the firm subsequently invited Borg to work on the co\-production of a new business survey tool for assessing organisations along ethical dimensions and improving performance on key indicators. Borg’s work has included applied research, co\-production of draft materials for the tool, and supervision of a Philosophy PhD student on an internship working on the project. The theoretical elements have now been delivered and WorkInConfidence are stress\-testing the product with key members of their client base \(which includes NHS foundations, alongside private sector companies such as Hobbes\). WorkInConfidence’s COO has stated that Borg and the intern have ‘done more to move \[this project\] forward than I could possibly have hoped for…We wouldn’t have been able to get this far this fast’ without their input and expertise. The product will ‘help \[WorkinConfidence\] deliver greater value to the organisations we sell into’ and, once rolled out, will enhance firms’ ability to identify ethical problems and raise performance against these measures \(E8\). 

 **E. Impact on national debate on ethics in business** 

 Borg and Hooker’s work has helped to inform public understanding of ethical issues in business. Public dissemination of their research has occurred through numerous blog posts for ‘Ethical Reading’ and the University of Reading. Borg’s University of Reading public lecture \(2019\) resulted in several members of the public contacting Borg subsequently to discuss the issues raised in that presentation. Their work has also contributed to the national business ethics conversation, in particular through Borg’s invited role on the Steering Committee of AcaBEN \(an academic\-business network run through the Institute of Business Ethics\) and the invited talk she gave to their conference \(December 2019\). Their work is playing a significant role in advancing political and regulatory debate in this area. For instance, they held a series of meetings with, and submitted invited briefing documents to, principal sector\-specific organisations, such as the Banking Standards Board \(2015\-16\). They also briefed representatives of the Liberal Democrat party during 2018, including discussions with their Chief Economic Advisor; E9\), exploring potential changes to regulatory frameworks. 

 Borg and Hooker continue to influence change, currently with a project funded through a British Academy Special Research Grants: Covid\-19 award – ‘Reshaping relations between the state and the private sector post\-COVID\-19?’ \(July 2020\-April 2021\). As part of this project Borg and Hooker have produced a briefing document on the social licence framework, which is aimed at politicians, regulators and think tanks; they have also submitted evidence to the EU Sustainable Corporate Governance Initiative, the UK Tax Inquiry and the UK Greening post\-Covid Recovery Inquiry. As a result of this activity, Borg has been invited to take up a post as an Independent Advisor on the newly formed HMRC Professional Standards Committee. This post will commence in January 2021 and will enable Borg to continue raising the profile of the social licence framework as a model for reshaping state and business relations at a government level \(E10\). 

 Borg and Hooker’s collaborative research partnership has had a significant impact on business thinking and practice, resulting in deep rooted changes in the Reading area but also extending to the national debate. Through the collaborative creation of the Ethical Recruitment Charter, those applying for jobs in the Reading area will be treated in line with core ethical values. Through co\-creation of the WorkinConfidence ethical metric tool, the business practices of that company have been influenced and, once rolled out, the tool will raise ethical standards across WorkinConfidence’s client organisations. Through webinars, public lectures and briefing documents, Borg and Hooker have advanced public and regulatory understanding of the role that philosophical ideas about fairness and social purpose have to play in bringing about better business practices. Starting locally, Borg and Hooker have shown how embedding awareness and understanding of ethical issues, alongside practical support for creating more ethical structures and behaviours, can help to improve the way we do business.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cutting\-edge techniques in interferometry, astronomical survey science and data analysis, developed through collaborative radio astronomy research at the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\), were translated into an intensive programme of human capital development in low and middle\-income countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. UH co\-designed the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy \(DARA\) initiative, leading its delivery in Zambia and Madagascar, as well as technical training in Botswana and Mozambique. UH led the design and delivery of a related programme in Thailand and contributed to the delivery of a DARA ‘spin off’ in Latin America. In engaging hundreds of young people in graduate, master’s and PhD\-level training, the programmes have upskilled key sections of the workforce in these economies. This has led to entrepreneurial activity and job creation; prepared these countries to exploit economic opportunities from new radio telescope networks; and enabled the engagement of thousands of schoolchildren in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics \(STEM\). The programmes influenced the allocation of £5.5m in UK Government overseas aid, strengthening UK soft power. Their efficacy in capacity building is recognised in ministerial statements and independent evaluations.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Radio astronomy encompasses a wide range of techniques and technologies that have direct impact on the economy. A canonical example is digital signal processing for astronomical radio interferometers; this was used to solve multi\-path interference in wireless internet technologies. UH’s Centre for Astrophysics Research \(CAR\) carries out core radio astronomy science, with an emphasis on single\-dish and large\-sky interferometric surveys. The observing, data reduction and analysis techniques, developed through STFC\-funded research \[ **G1**\- **G3**\], underpinned the design of human capital development training by UH researchers and partner institutions in Africa and Southeast Asia. Funded by the Newton Fund \(UK aid budget\), the programmes are: *Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy* \(DARA\), led by the University of Leeds with UH, Universities of Manchester, Oxford, Bristol and Central Lancashire, and *Capacity Building for Thai Radio Astronomy* \(Radio Capaci\-Thai\), led by UH with Leeds and Manchester and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand \(NARIT\). They use the draw of new facilities in their respective geographies – the Square Kilometre Array \(SKA\), the world’s largest radio telescope, and the Thai National Radio Telescope \(TNRT\) – to engage students in radio astronomy and broader STEM training to close skills gaps and facilitate wider capacity building. 

 The SKA is hosted by South Africa with Australia and eight African partners: Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Madagascar, Mozambique and Mauritius. These partners are converting 30m\-class telecommunications antennas to form single\-dish radio telescopes that can be connected to a Very Long Baseline Interferometer \(VLBI\). Known as the African VLBI Network \(AVN\) and set to span sub\-Saharan Africa, this network will be linked to its equivalents in Europe and Australia, enabling mapping of the Milky Way in unprecedented detail. The conversion of telecommunications antennas and their incorporation into VLBI Networks is described in **3.1**; this demonstrated the benefits of incorporating the Goonhilly Earth Station 30m antennas into the UK’s national radio astronomy facility. The simulations and analyses in **3.1** were instrumental in planning the AVN. Subsequently, the first such African antenna to be converted was the 32m dish at the Ghana Radio Astronomy Observatory \(GRAO\), which is now used as a training facility for DARA students from across Africa. 

 The Methanol Multi\-Beam \(MMB\) survey, combining single\-dish and interferometric techniques, was the largest survey of the sky for 6.7 GHz methanol masers \[ **3.2**, **3.3**, **3.4**\]. These masers are key tracers of massive star formation. MMB is the most complete search to date, revealing a population of variable sources and details of the underlying structure of the Milky Way. It linked evolution of star formation to maser luminosity for the first time. Thompson and Chrysostomou were CIs in an international consortium. Thompson led the observational programme and multi\-wavelength exploitation; Chrysostomou was a founding member of the MMB Consortium and co\-designed the initial survey. The survey’s single\-dish element involved a purpose\-built, multi\-beam receiver. The practical observatory training for DARA students is built directly on the MMB survey techniques and results, with **3.3** used to select specific maser targets for observation. 

 In **3.5**, high\-resolution radio interferometry of the Orion Nebula Cluster was used to identify variability of young stellar objects. This paper \(lead author: Forbrich\) demonstrated that broadband digital interferometry \(to be deployed in the SKA and TNRT\) provides a new perspective on high energy processes in timescales as short as minutes. Papers **3.6** and **3.7** detail the design, techniques and results from the Low Frequency Array \(LOFAR\) Two Metre Sky Survey \(LoTSS\), the deepest and widest survey of the sky yet, carried out at 100 MHz frequencies. A novel direction\-dependent pipeline was developed to produce high\-resolution images from LoTSS data; CAR led its implementation. The observation, data analysis and high\-performance computing techniques optimised for **3.5**\- **3.7** were incorporated into DARA and Radio Capaci\-Thai training.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Most African countries joining the SKA have very little or no expertise in radio astronomy. Through the co\-design and delivery of DARA, based on research pushing the boundaries of radio survey and interferometry science, CAR has played a central role in building the human capital required to build self\-sustaining radio astronomy hubs in Africa. Beginning in October 2014, DARA has provided young people with transferable skills for wider job and wealth creation \[ **5.1**\- **5.4**, **5.10**\]. UH’s Thompson led the development and delivery of DARA in Zambia and Madagascar \[based on **3.1**\- **3.4**\] and UH’s Forbrich and Hardcastle led the development and delivery of technical training \[based on **3.5**\- **3.7**\] in Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia. Thompson applied these techniques and principles to the design and delivery \(as lead\) of a similar capacity building programme in Thailand from February 2017. This programme supported the Thai Government to develop the advanced skills the country required to deliver its flagship infrastructure project: a 40m radio telescope that will allow Thailand to further develop its instrumentation design capabilities and access international astronomy and geodesy VLBI research networks \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Upskilling workforces and building STEM capacity in developing economies** 

 A key aim of DARA is to achieve a ‘multiplier effect’; the first generation of radio astronomers in these eight African countries will train future cohorts, helping to dispel the notion that the only career destination for graduate physicists is teaching. Researchers from UH and partner institutions designed and delivered radio astronomy and related\-skills training at graduate, master’s and PhD\-level. The graduate\-level intensive programme lasts eight weeks, spread over a year and including four weeks at a radio telescope site. It includes computer programming and data reduction techniques for radio astronomy using the likes of Python and Linux. Over the impact period, 264 students from eight African countries participated \[ **5.1**\]. An evaluation \[ **5.2**\] by the Newton Fund said that participants had gained the following technical skills: expertise in radio antennas and instrumentation; radio astronomy observation; data reduction and analysis; astrophysics. They gained the following transferable skills: awareness of commercial opportunities in the space sector; science outreach experience; high\-level computing; English language skills in a technical context \[ **5.2**\]. Of 264 students, 31 were accepted onto MSc/PhD programmes, including at UH \[ **5.1**\]. From the first cohort of 10 Zambian students, five went on to international postgraduate study, with one UH PhD student taking a research\-active engineering lecturer post at the University of Zambia in 2020. Trainees used their skills to find employment or set up businesses in fields such as earth observation, satellite services and data analysis \[ **5.2**\]. 

 A follow\-up survey of 156 DARA trainees \[ **5.3**\] demonstrated the following key outcomes: 

-  97.4% described their experience of the study programme as ‘very positive’ \(67.3%\) or ‘positive’ \(30.1%\); it was 100% in the UH\-led countries of Zambia and Madagascar. 

-  32% said the graduate\-level training had already helped them ‘further their career’; this figure was 75% in Zambia and 59% in Madagascar. 

-  Jobs secured by participants that were attributed to participation in DARA included: data analyst; senior technicians for remote sensing and GIS; telescope operator; lecturer; teacher; research scientist; knowledge transfer associate; engineer; metrologist. 

 Longer\-term impact was demonstrated via individual case studies. One Zambian participant said the UH\-led training had secured him employment as an environmental engineer and led to him co\-founding a consulting firm that offers remote sensing satellite services. He said: ‘It is because of the knowledge that I acquired through the DARA training program that barely a few months after I completed the training, I got a job. The DARA programme introduced me to Agri Big Data which can help in decision making in agriculture and increase Zambia's agricultural productivity \[ **5.2**\].’ A Zambian student who studied an MSc in radio astronomy at UH in 2016\-17 secured a Visiting Lecturer post at UH and in July 2019 delivered a DARA radio astronomy workshop to students at the University of Zambia \[ **5.4**\]. After DARA graduate\-level training in 2017, a Botswanan student was accepted onto a funded PhD in astrophysics at UH; she plans to seek employment as a big data analyst in a leading bank \[ **5.4**\]. A DARA alumna from Ghana launched a start\-up that trains children and young adults in Python programming \[ **5.3**\]. Two DARA MSc and PhD students from Ghana founded, in 2019, a start\-up that provides high\-volume data storage and processing \[ **5.1**\]. The University of Zambia said that ‘as a result of the training’, DARA students had secured international scholarships and MSc/PhD study in the UK, noting that these opportunities ‘would be impossible or difficult without the project’ and that these students ‘will form the basis of the human resource that will be required for the meaningful participation of Zambia’ in the SKA \[ **5.5**\]. DARA won a Better Satellite World Award in 2018. The organiser, the Society of Satellite Professionals, said: *‘We couldn’t help but be impressed by DARA’s work … to help grow expertise in these fields in Africa. The … powerful combination of technology and business acumen is already paying dividends for the students who have undertaken courses* \[ **5.6**\].’ 

 Building on DARA, UH secured Newton funding in 2017 to lead Radio Capaci\-Thai \[ **5.7**, **5.9**\]. The main outcomes were: STEM outreach to a wide cohort of Thai undergraduate students; the upskilling of a selected cohort of Thai and Southeast Asian undergraduates; technological skills transfer in radio\-frequency engineering, data processing and low noise amplifier design. More than 150 Thai science and engineering students attended a UH\-led, in\-depth seminar series across nine Thai HE institutions in 2017. This led to intensive summer schools in 2017 and 2019; 52 Thai and other South East Asian undergraduates received training in radio astronomy, antenna and receiver design, software development and data processing \[ **5.7**\]. Twenty\-three NARIT staff attended the schools to develop their skills and access hands\-on training. Six Thai Government engineers and three research assistants from NARIT received advanced radio astronomy training. 

 **Stimulating interest in STEM among young people in low\-income countries** 

 DARA students are also trained as outreach ambassadors. As of 2019, DARA alumni had delivered STEM sessions to 30 schools and 4,000 students to promote science\-based careers \[ **5.2**\]. In 2018 the Office of Astronomy for Development \(OAD\), a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, invited funding proposals from DARA students. Awards included a programme of school visits to the Ghana Radio Astronomy Observatory; a programme to engage underprivileged schools in rural Namibia in the role that radio astronomy plays in society; a programme to engage high school students in Madagascar in the opportunities afforded by the SKA/AVN \[ **5.8**\]. DARA survey responses showed how the outreach training had been put into practice. Representative comments \[ **5.3**\] included: ‘ *I currently organise and sponsor astronomy seminars, workshops and talks in schools and event centres. It* \[DARA\] *has boosted my confidence in stand\-up talks*’; ‘ *After the basic training my confidence level in organizing astronomy outreach, teacher training workshop\[s\], public presentations has gone up immensely*’; ‘ *To promote the knowledge and experience I acquired from DARA, I set up a facility to promote astronomy through seminar, workshops often in schools and educational events. My hope is to…project the idea across the country*’; ‘ *We enrolled an outreach and development program in rural Kenya. The project has been cited by OAD as a success story*’. 

 **Influencing allocation and distribution of the UK’s Government’s overseas aid budget** 

 The Newton Fund is part of the UK’s Official Development Assistance. In co\-designing DARA, CAR research has influenced the allocation and distribution of £5.41m of the UK Government’s overseas aid budget \(an impact indicator as per REF 2021 guidelines\) in eight African countries, Thailand, Colombia and Mexico \[ **5.2**, **5.9**\]. This comprises: £4.13m to Africa \(Thompson as CI\);  £0.50m to Thailand \(Thompson as PI; Forbrich as CI\), £0.37m to Colombia \(Thompson as CI\) and £0.40m to Mexico \(Forbrich as CI\) \[ **5.9**\]. DARA Big Data in Colombia was designed to build capacity in big data science and the Mexico project involved skills training for a new national radio astronomy facility \[ **5.9**\]. The Thailand, Colombia and Mexico projects were built on the DARA Africa model. The value that the Newton Fund attaches to this model is demonstrated by their allocation of £5.41m based on outcomes of the initial £0.83m DARA grant. An initial £59,440 grant for the Thailand programme led to a follow\-on grant of £0.45m \[ **5.9**\]. 

 **Benefitting governments in developing economies and strengthening UK soft power** 

 Representatives of the African governments involved in the SKA and AVN have endorsed the value of DARA. A joint ministerial meeting in 2018 noted that: ‘ *DARA was specifically designed to support the African SKA and AVN projects and it is making valuable contributions to strengthen radio astronomy in partner countries*. *DARA courses are important for capacity building in high performance computing and data science, key technologies to support and develop radio astronomy* \[ **5.10**\].’ An independent evaluation \[ **5.11**\] of the Newton Fund’s impact in South Africa highlighted DARA as one of three case studies. It said DARA had ‘ *helped support the UK to position science and innovation as a central part of the bilateral relationship with South Africa*’ and ‘ *in terms of soft power*’ was ‘ *often referred to as a joint success story by both countries*’. The fact that ‘ *the DARA model is now moving beyond Africa*’ demonstrates that ‘ *the DARA project is catalytic and has proven how politically salient the idea of astronomy for development is among academic institutions, governments and funders*’. The report concluded: ‘ *DARA has been very successful in terms of the human capital development outcomes, institutional linking and upskilling. The action also has managed to scale up and leverage funding*.’ DARA ‘spin\-off’ projects in Colombia and Mexico have raised the prospect of an AVN\-style network in Central and South America. Teams from Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Honduras have announced a plan to lobby their governments to create a network of telescopes in Latin America \[ **5.1**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research conducted at Swansea University \(SU\) has been instrumental in the commercial success of Innoture Ltd, a microneedle \(MN\) company, focussing on their novel anti\-aging regime Radara® which utilise microneedle patches. Research conducted by Swansea researchers allowed the company to optimize their MN print manufacturing processes, increasing the number of products produced per day while reducing costs by 50%. This allowed Radara® products to be brought to market one year earlier than planned. As a direct result of SU research, they have generated sales of GBP50,000 in 2020. Swansea\-developed microstructure prototypes for transdermal delivery have also allowed Innoture to develop a new product pipeline around analgesics, with Swansea facilitating the first human trials for the company. Critically, Swansea University research has underpinned Innoture’s ability to secure private investment of GBP3,000,000 during the REF period, allowing the company to add 12 staff, an increase of 600% from 2014.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Microneedles \(MNs\) that penetrate the top layer of the skin have long promised pain\-free administration of drugs, but, despite a plethora of research publications, very few have ever approached commercial reality. Scalability of production, drug yield and molecular size/type \(solubility\) have severely limited MN application. Swansea’s research has effectively solved these issues by providing the underpinning knowledge needed to deliver small molecules and complex biologicals \(peptides and cells\) at high volume from mass\-manufacturable printed patches \(Fig. 1\). This work represents a step change in MN patch technology that has since seen commercial exploitation via a 7\-year collaboration with Innoture Ltd \- taking the technology from manufacture to successful human trials. 

 Since 2011, Guy has been developing a range of MN fabrication technologies for silicon and polymer MNs in collaboration with industry and Imperial College London. Innovations in microneedle design \(pitch, length, tip sharpness and material hardness\) have enabled facile transdermal injection, leading to a critical process patent for the manufacture of MNs **\[P1\]**. A key element was a novel “bevelled tip” hollow MN, which led to new collaborations with Prof. Birchall’s group at Cardiff University. Guy has led EPSRC **\[G1\-G2\]** and Innovate UK **\[G3\]** MN projects with Cardiff developing the MN technology for transdermal delivery of large fluid doses **\[R1\]**. 






 Fig.1. Radara® patches \(left\) and electron micrograph of microneedles \(right\) 


 Given Swansea’s leading expertise in MN manufacturing, characterisation and skin\-testing research, through Swansea’s Centre for Nanohealth \(CNH\), Guy initiated a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Innoture in 2013 **\[G4\]**. Key research outcomes arising from this KTP were the development of novel MN manufacturing processes for screen\-printed polymeric microneedle patches **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. SU’s critical input **\[R2, R3\]** included the development of screens, ink constitution and viscosity, ink curing and substrate selection which led to MN optimisation.  Reference **\[R2\]** detailed how a newly developed bend test was an excellent predictor of amount of ink deposited and was far better than traditional assumptions based on squeegee hardness. The printing of microneedles relies on a different philosophy from traditional printing, where excess ink deposition is regarded as wasteful.  Microneedle printing is pushing the screen\-printing process to the limits of its capabilities in terms of the amount of material deposited. 

 Reference **\[R3\]** visually showed for the first time the separation of the ink filament as the stencil is pulled away from the substrate.  This study is of great importance to the functional printing industry as it is the first time that frequently cited and historical models of the ink transfer process in screen printing have been tested and validated experimentally.  This allows a direct causal link to be drawn between ink characteristics \(elasticity, rheology\) and printer settings, and print topography, based on the simultaneous contact between the printing form, ink and substrate.  Understanding of printing mechanisms, and the effect of process parameters, is key to ensuring defect free and robust manufacture of printed microneedles as well as maximising ink deposit for faster throughput. 

 Prof Guy has led research into the testing and development of MNs in association with active pharmaceutical ingredients \(APIs\) **\[R4\]**. This involved skin testing research and new methods for assessing transdermal delivery of commercially relevant APIs \(ibuprofen, aspirin and hydrocortisone, galantamine, selegiline hydrochloride \(Sel\-HCl\), insulin and caffeine **\[R4\]**\). Key characterisation and performance data on Innoture’s MNs \(skin penetration and drug permeation efficacy\) were acquired, with the study providing critical data on the effect of a molecule’s physiochemical properties on its ability to be delivered transdermally, with and without microneedle application, leading to a critical process patent for the manufacture of MNs **\[P1\]**. Enhanced delivery of APIs has been demonstrated \(via extended KTP, **\[G5\]**\), with the avoidance of hypodermic needle stick pain during anaesthetic administration into the gums of dental patients. 

 Prof Guy’s group in CNH has conducted research into materials characterisation, microneedle sensing \(including the first mediated MN based biosensor for minimal invasive sensing of lactate in interstitial fluid **\[R5\]**\) and examined the possibility of developing a MN closed loop control system for delivery of precision drugs **\[R6\]**.  Most recently, this technology has been used in the development of a “vaccine smart patch” prototype – for COVID vaccination and diagnosis of COVID antibodies in response to the vaccine.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Improved manufacturing processes/cost efficiencies** 

 Swansea’s MN research underpinned Innoture’s development of the world’s first cosmetic MN patch product, Radara®, in late 2015 **\[C1, C2\]**. Our research on the MN printing process and skin testing of MNs has allowed Innoture to branch into an entirely new business sector \(non\-surgical cosmetic and therapeutics\) through their Radara® products, worth GBP50,000 in 2020. Additionally, advances in ink and polymer development, polymer curing, iterative printing process and tip sharpening allowed the company to develop a super\-fast, large volume, screen\-printed MN production process for Radara® – establishing a new production line in 2016.  Using Swansea’s processes has saved the company over GBP1,000,000 since 2014 compared to using other commercial facilities **\[C1\]**.  Head of Research at Innoture Ltd states, 

 “*Screen\-printing research at Swansea University was key to developing Innoture’s ability to print MNs in large volumes \(5,600 Radara patches per day\) and at low cost, allowing us to reduce manufacturing costs by 50%”* **\[C1\]**. 

 SU skin testing research has helped Innoture optimise their Radara® patches, contributing to the launch of the first and second versions of the micro\-channelling patches a year ahead of schedule “ *which allowed the company to double its turnover from 2018 to 2019”* Head of Research, Innoture Ltd, **\[C1\]**. 

 A new variation of Radara® for the total eye area is the latest high\-performance eye rejuvenation offering from Innoture and has been developed using SU research \(MN development and hyaluronic acid permeation characterisation\). 

 *“In just two years \(2014\-2016\), we've seen Radara®,* our novel anti\-ageing regimen using unique micro\-channelling patches, *go from a technological concept to an award\-winning skin care brand \(e.g. Best Home Use product of device category, My FaceMy body Awards 2016\), only with the input of Swansea University research*” Head of Research, Innoture Ltd, **\[C1\]**, also see **\[C3\]** for award example. 

 **New product development** 

 *“Prof Guy and his colleagues at Swansea University have led the way in developing MSt* \[Microstructure\] *fabrication processes, characterising our MSts, facilitating clinical trials for our products and allowing us to develop a product pipeline incorporating APIs \(Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\).”* Head of Research, Innoture Ltd **\[C1\]**. 

 Innoture’s proprietary platform has the capability to deliver small molecules, peptides and complex biologicals though a MN patch \(less than 1ml\). The ability to deliver large molecules \(above 1ml\) is a step change in transdermal patch technology. SU research has investigated delivery of some larger molecules, including hyaluronic acid and APIs \(ibuprofen, lidocaine\) with MNs, starting in 2016. 

 The foremost pipeline development products are MN pain\-relief patches containing ibuprofen and lidocaine. Transdermal drug delivery research performed by SU under the 2016 KTP was critical in developing MN coatings and drug encapsulation processes for delivery of pain relief APIs \(lidocaine and ibuprofen\) using a MN platform and in validating prototype pain\-relief patches. We were given approval by the MHRA to run a clinical investigation in 2018 to assess the performance of Lidocaine with a MN patch. The results showed a significantly enhanced delivery of APIs over current treatments. 

 SU developed all skin testing protocols and facilities, gaining full ethical approval for research on animal and human skin in 2016. This allowed Innoture’s first successful submission to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(UK\) for a clinical evaluation for a pharmaceutical application. The KTP research project with SU also successfully demonstrated a dental product via a clinical trial \(trials conducted at Bristol University in 2018, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03629041\). 

 Swansea’s research has enabled the design and delivery of a new prototype microstructure patch for drug and vaccine delivery, combining diagnostic sensors with vaccines **\[C5\]** for viral pathogens such as influenza and COVID\-19. This research has attracted GBP290,000 in grant funding **\[C5, C6\]**. This new patch will further enhance Innoture’s product pipeline and diversification into vaccine delivery. 

 **Company Impact** 

 SU’s research has directly impacted Innoture’s ability to attract investment, expand Innoture’s workforce and increase Innoture’s share price from GBP8 to GBP20 \(2016 to 2019\) **\[C1\]**. 

 Innoture secured private investment of GBP1,000,000 between 2014 and 2016 and GBP2,000,000 between 2017 and 2020 **\[C1\]**. SU data \(SEM, ethically approved skin testing, mechanical tests, clinical trials data and regulatory approvals\) and optimization of manufacturing processes undertaken by Prof Guy’s group, were critical in securing this investment and in the subsequent scale\-up and launch of Innoture’s commercial products. 

 The Radara® patches have been advertised to a global audience through publications such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan and Tatler \(see **\[C4\]** for example\) and is now available through selected retailers, skin care institutes and clinics such as national chain SK:N and Church Pharmacy. Revenues from current Radara® products have risen from GBP10,000 in 2016 to GBP50,000 in 2020 **\[C1\]**. 

 **Employment** 

 Since 2014, the number of employees at Innoture has increased from 2 to 14. 

 *“We have been able to grow our workforce by 12 since 2014 – an increase of 600% \- including employing Swansea University chemistry and engineering graduates, as a direct result of the development of our product pipeline which has grown with Swansea university research input”* Head of Research, Innoture Ltd **\[C1\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Howard’s pioneering research into online disinformation has focussed media and political attention on the rise of “computational propaganda”—disinformation and misinformation spread through social media. Howard and his ComProp team have not only demonstrated the need for social media firms and government regulators to address this serious issue but has also helped inform policy responses on an international scale. The UK government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\), the European Commission \(EC\), and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence have all stated that Howard’s work has aided their understanding of online disinformation and computational propaganda, enabling them to identify and counter online disinformation, and engage social media firms in the exploration of regulatory options.

1.  **Underpinning research **\(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 Philip Howard is a professor of sociology, information and international affairs and the Director of the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford. An internationally recognised authority on technology and politics, he leads a programme of research that investigates political communication online and the role of automation in the spread of “junk news”. 

 **\[R1\]** Computational tools now play an important political role in areas such as news consumption and issue awareness. Drawing on quantitative analysis of social media data and interviews with people who design and deploy political “bots” and disinformation campaigns, this global overview presents case studies from Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, Taiwan, Brazil, Germany, the United States, and China. Howard’s team of authors find automated manipulation of public opinion to be on the rise worldwide, with advances in computing technology making this both more sophisticated and harder to track. 

 **\[R2\]** Howard has argued that bots are a new domain of political communication, with pervasive technology increasingly being used to direct public sentiment and manipulate opinion. This article provides a formal description of computational propaganda and defines “political bots” as automated scripts designed to manipulate public opinion. It shows how these automated bots can interfere with political communication by allowing surreptitious campaign coordination, illegally soliciting contributions and votes, and violating election rules. 

 **\[R3\]** To understand what social media users share during important political events, Howard’s team undertook real\-time data collection of political news shared during the 2016 US election and 2018 State of the Union address. Analysing over 20,000,000 tweets through manual and semi\-automated coding, they produce a grounded typology of what information users shared online and develop the concept of “junk news” to describe sources that deliberately publish misleading, deceptive, or incorrect information packaged as real news. They find that users shared substantial amounts of junk news online, reflecting the influence of nonprofessional organizations and decline in influence of traditional gatekeepers of political communication, such as parties, the state, and policy experts. 

 **\[R4\]** Extending this method to recent elections in Europe found low to moderate levels of amplified traffic, suggesting limited effects on social media sharing—albeit with amplification growing substantially around elections. The share of political traffic driven by these “amplifier accounts” in Germany was low \(7.4%\), compared with France \(4.6\-11.4%\) and the UK \(16.5%\). Most of the UK political content shared on Twitter came from professional news sources \(48.8%\) and rarely from junk news sources \(10.3%\). 

 **\[R5\]** This article advances the small body of knowledge on domestic automation and opinion manipulation in China and presents the first piece of research into Chinese automation and opinion manipulation abroad, based on analysis of 1.5 million comments on official political information posts on Weibo and 1.1 million tweets. Little evidence of automation was found on Weibo, but a large amount was found on Twitter—published in simplified Mandarin and driven by a small number of anti\-Chinese\-state voices, presumably aimed at diasporic Chinese and mainland users accessing blocked platforms. 

 **\[R6\]** In this monograph, Howard presents original evidence about how manipulation and amplification of disinformation is produced, managed, and circulated by political operatives and governments, and discusses the evidence of automated manipulation in the Brexit referendum and 2016 US Presidential election. Finally, he describes paths for both democratic intervention and future research in this space.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Professor Howard and the Computational Propaganda \(ComProp\) team’s research findings have informed and shaped policy on online disinformation in the UK, the EU and the US, and they have been recognised by policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic as *‘“pioneers” in the field of online disinformation’,* **\[C1\]**, having ‘ *produced the first wave of real research on how authoritarian regimes interfere in the elections of democracies using social media*’ **\[C2\]**. According to the Head of the European Political Strategy Centre, the European Commission’s in\-house policy think tank, *‘Prof Howard was one of the first researchers to expose the pervasiveness of politically\-motivated bots and fake news on social media with his work on Brexit and the 2016 elections in the United States’* **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Howard has engaged extensively with policymakers to highlight the causes and consequences of online disinformation identified in his research, and helped shape policy responses in the UK, EU and US. 

###  UK Policy Impact: 

 In December 2017, the ComProp team provided evidence to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into ‘Disinformation and “fake news”’. This evidence, which outlined the way in which bots and algorithms are being manipulated by social media companies and political actors to spread misinformation and disinformation, along with references to ComProp research, was included in the inquiry’s interim **\[C3\]** and final report **\[C4\]**. Consequently, the evidence fed directly into recommendations in both reports that the government should impose effective regulation on social media providers and do more to tackle foreign political interference via social media platforms. 

 Acting on the recommendations of the report, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\) outlined the government’s policy for future legislation with the publication of its *Online Harms White Paper* **\[C5\]** in April 2019. The white paper ruminates at length on ComProp research that demonstrates the scale of the problem of online disinformation and proposes a new regulatory framework for internet companies including a statutory duty of care, mandatory reporting and increased transparency for both regulators and independent researchers **\[C5, Box 12\]**. The Online Harms legislation, according to the government’s response to the consultation results on the white paper, *‘is a key legislative priority for this government’*, with the government stating that though the COVID\-19 pandemic had delayed its passage into law, it remained committed to introducing the Online Harms legislation *‘as soon as parliamentary time allows’* in September 2020 **\[C6, p.11\]**. 

 Howard helped the DCMS to engage with technology firms by convening closed workshops in March 2018, February 2019, and February 2020 at Oxford. These brought policy makers from the DCMS together with senior staff from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter. According to the DCMS’s Director of Security and Online Harms, Howard’s research standing enabled him *‘to pull together the right group for difficult conversations about the behaviour of the firms and the regulatory options that are now on the table. Such engagement is particularly welcome in helping senior policy makers … to stay on top of the latest research and analysis on complex issues, and to test ideas and review the policy options’* **\[C2\]**. He further adds that ‘ *Prof Howard has arguably done more than any other independent researcher to hold the attention of policy makers, journalists and the interested public on social media firms and malign influence within the UK’,* and has *‘helped maintain the attention of policy makers and journalists on the nuances of the problem and has directly shaped how policy makers in the UK frame and respond to the problem’* **\[C2\]**. 

###  EU Policy Impact and Code of Practice: 

 According to the head of the European Commission’s \(EC\) European Political Strategy Centre \(EPSC\), Howard and his ComProp research team have provided the EC with *‘an intellectual framework and empirical basis that has \[…\] proven valuable for policymaking’* and has enabled the Commission to understand the full severity of online disinformation in Europe **\[C1\]**. 

 In 2017, Howard’s research team presented the project’s key research findings and recommendations to EU policymakers at two events. The first, in September 2017, was at a meeting of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe \(ALDE\) in Brussels where Marietje Schaake, MEP, and David Kaye, UN Rapporteur for Freedom of Speech, provided commentary on ComProp’s research findings and recommendations **\[C7\]**.The second event, in November 2017, was a multi\-stakeholder conference on Fake News, where the European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, announced the formation of the EC’s ‘High\-Level Expert Group on Fake News and online disinformation’. Following the conference, Howard was one of five international experts asked by the EPSC to contribute testimony to a hearing on ‘Preserving Democracy in the Digital Age’ in February 2018, supporting the work of the High\-Level Group **\[C8\]**. 

 In March 2018 the High\-Level Group’s final report, entitled *A Multi\-dimensional Approach to Disinformation* **\[C9\]**, echoed many of the findings and recommendations that Howard had presented to the EPSC hearing. For example, Howard’s observation in his oral testimony that *‘politicians in the West’* were using communication strategies to spread disinformation to their voters as well as their Russian counterparts **\[C8\]** was reflected in High\-Level Group’s report in the identification of political actors as purveyors of disinformation in both European and non\-European governments and thereby a fundamental cause of online disinformation in the EU **\[C9, pp.11\]**. Two of Howard’s suggested solutions—that algorithmic checks should be introduced and that social media firms should share their data with researchers **\[C8\]**—were also incorporated into the report’s recommendations **\[C9\]**. They also recommended a Code of Practice with two out of ten key principles referencing the need for platforms to enable access to data for researchers **\[C9, pp. 32\-33\]**, which was implemented in September 2018 and has been signed by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others **\[C10\]**. To facilitate the practical application of this mandate, Howard included senior EU officials along with DCMS staff \(as described above\) when he convened policy leadership from social media firms for closed sessions in Oxford, in March 2018, February 2019, and February 2020. At the first meeting there were animated discussions about what, if any, the EU should do to regulate the platforms, and the notion of a voluntary Code of Practice was debated. By the second and third meetings the Code **\[C9\]** was in place and discussion was about platform responses and their action and inaction around protecting the EU and UK elections. The EPSC confirms that *‘Prof Howard's convening power has made possible direct and frank exchanges with executives of the social media firms’* **\[C1\]**. 

###  US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s Russia Investigation: 

 In May 2017, Howard authored an op\-ed piece in the *Washington Post,* arguing that the CEOs of the major US social media companies should be compelled to testify before Congress on Russia's use of their platforms to interfere in the 2016 election. This received significant media and public interest, which the chair and vice\-chair of the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \(SSCI\) say triggered *‘a national conversation on this subject that culminated in the Committee's indeed calling these CEOs to testify in September 2017’* **\[C12\]**. 

 Prior to this, according to the SSCI chairs, *‘Public knowledge about the use of automation, algorithms, and big\-data analytics to manipulate public opinion in targeted ways was exceedingly limited…Insights specific to Russia’s use of these methodologies, or “computational propaganda”, were largely press\-based and anecdotal’* **\[C12\]**. The SSCI asked Howard to act as a formal consultant for them, and he joined the Committee’s Technical Advisory Group in 2018, provided in\-person briefings for senior staff, and aided the preparation of the Committee's inquiries **\[C12\]**. He was also asked by the Committee to testify in an open hearing on 1 August 2018 **\[C13\]**. The SSCI chairs say that Howard’s research has been *‘essential to the Committee's understanding of how Russia endeavoured to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election’* and its understanding of the ‘ *role of social media in the execution of foreign influence operations…his insights have entrenched our resolve to find the appropriate policy response to this vexing concern*’ **\[C11\]**. 

 Using data provided by social media firms to the SSCI, in December 2018 Howard and social media analytics firm Graphika published the first major analysis of the activities of the Internet Research Agency \(IRA\), a group with links to the Kremlin and Russian intelligence agencies. The Committee’s subsequent report on Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election directly references Howard’s research multiple times, including the evidence that Russia’s online campaign was amplified by the IRA’s production of content on social media platforms, citing Howard’s finding that *‘the activity on Twitter constitutes the IRA's first use of a social media platform to conduct information warfare against the United States’* **\[C12 p. 51\]**. The report to Congress recommended that *‘Information sharing between the social media companies and law enforcement must improve, and in both directions’,* and that the scope of existing federal election laws should be extended to online media to ensure that *‘Americans know the sources of online political advertisements.’* **\[C12, p. 80\]** 

 Senator Mark Warner, the vice\-chair of the Committee, is also a co\-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, a bill currently pending in the US Senate, which would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act in this way. The text of the bill cites ComProp research into the scope of Russian social media manipulation in the 2016 election. **\[C14\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The results of my research on orangutan conservation have fed into the Indonesian Government orangutan population and viability analyses as well as the 2019\-2029 Indonesian Orangutan Action Plan. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\) and several NGOs are using this research to guide their conservation strategies. The study on the description and threats to a new orangutan species has been used by an Indonesian environmental NGO in a court case against the local government for the development of a large hydroelectric project that would severely impact the newly discovered species. I have been an expert witness in the court case as well. Even though the environmental NGO lost this case, pressure from NGOs, the IUCN, and others have led the company to increase mitigation plans and finance institutions to decline funding for the project. This project seems stalled now and thus for now gives hope for conservation for the rarest great ape on the planet \(the Tapanuli orangutan that I helped describe in 2017\).

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Effective orangutan conservation needs data on the distribution and density of all three species as well as their population trends. In addition, it needs assessments of which factors are leading to their decline and which conservation strategies and actions can reduce the negative impacts of those factors. Such research then needs to be integrated into the governments’ action plans for orangutan conservation. Therefore, research has aimed to be relevant for all these aspects. Two studies have used spatially\-explicit models providing detailed results on the distribution and density of orangutans throughout both the islands of Sumatra and Borneo \(UR1 & UR2\). Because this is the first time such methods have been applied there is now a solid baseline for all three orangutan species to evaluate conservation actions against. At the time of the research on UR1 the orangutans on Sumatra were still considered as one species but because of research for UR3 it is now known that the orangutan population in the Batang Toru area constitutes a new species \(the Tapanuli orangutan\). Several studies indicate that habitat loss and killing of orangutans are the two main threats to orangutans \(UR1, UR2, UR4\), but that orangutans are quite flexible in terms of habitat disturbance and can to a certain extent survive in a matrix of varying land uses \(forest, oil palm, pulp and paper, and agroforestry\). In addition, for the Tapanuli orangutan research shows that a hydro\-electric project is the main threat \(UR5\). As an extension of the work on orangutans and palm oil a study was conducted on the potential implications of the spread of oil palm plantation on primates in Africa \(UR6\). That study found that there is little area available that has a high suitability for oil plam and low primate diversity. The implication is therefore that the expansion of oil palm in Africa will lead to major negative impacts on primate diversity. 

 There are several recommendations coming out of UR1\-6. First, to halt or reduce the decline of all three orangutan species there needs to be a halt in the conversion of the forests they occur in \(primary and logged\). Second, reduce killing and capturing of orangutans in human\-dominated landscapes so that orangutans can use those areas to move between forest areas. Such connectivity is essential with decreasing population sizes. Third, halt the development of the hydro\-electric plant that will fragment the range of the Tapanuli orangutan and will reduce two populations to numbers too small to be viable. Four, collaborate with all stakeholders in the palm oil sector to work towards sustainable palm oil so that impact on orangutans is minimized.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This research has had impact in several ways that have improved orangutan conservation. First of all it \(UR1\-5\) has impacted the Indonesian Governments Population Habitat and Viability Assessment \(PHVA, \[S1\]\) in which this research was used for the population numbers as well as distribution and threats. The PHVA formed the basis for the Indonesian Government's Indonesian Orangutan Conservation Action Plan and Strategy \(2019\-2029, \[S2\]\), which is the highest level Indonesian conservation plan and is expected become law \(S3\). As a result of this research this Action Plan and Strategy now takes hunting into consideration as a major threat to orangutans which was argued in UR1 and UR4 as well has more focus on managing orangutans outside of forest areas as was recommended by \(UR4\). Second, UR3 and UR5 have been important for both the PHVA and the Action Plan and Strategy as they provide the research on the description of the new orangutan species as well as its population numbers and threats and thus impacted the conservation strategy of the government. <ins>Dr.</ins> <ins>Priadjati</ins>, Chairman of Forum Orangutan Indonesia: “Both of these documents have benefited immensely from the conservation science of Prof Wich” \[S3\]. 

 Third, between 2017 and 2020, UR3 and UR5 have impacted the International Union for Conservation's \(IUCN\) Section on Great Apes of which I am a co vice\-chair. They sent letters of concern about a major hydro\-electric plan in the range of the new orangutan species \(Tapanuli orangutan\) to the Indonesian President, other members of the Government, potential funders such as the Bank of China. In addition, they published a statement that suggests a moratorium on all development in the range of the Tapanuli orangutan until a detailed environmental impact assessment has been developed \[S4\]. The company developing the hydro\-electric project has now been increasing its mitigation efforts and the Indonesian Government has put an orangutan monitoring project in place in the area where the project occurs \[S4\]. News reports as well as IUCN sources have stated that major banks declined funding the project because of environmental concerns and that the project is stalled for now giving hope for the Tapanuli orangutan \[S4\]. In addition, UNEP’s Great Apes Survival Partnership has also focused on the Tapanuli orangutan’s conservation as a result of my research \[S5\]. 

 <ins>Mr. Byler</ins>, Vice\-Chair of the IUCN Section on Great Apes: “The research by Wich on the Tapanuli orangutan has spurred the SGA to focus on the threats facing this species and particularly the hydro\-electric project that is being developed in the habitat of the Tapanuli orangutan and threatens to destroy part of its habitat and fragment its distribution. As a response the SGA has been sending letters to the Indonesian President and other members of the Government as well as to the Bank of China expressing the SGA’s concern about the development of a hydro\-electric project in the area where the Tapanuli orangutan occurs. The IUCN SGA has also published a statement asking for a moratorium on the development of the hydro\-electric project and other projects within the Tapanuli orangutan distribution so that in\-depth environmental impact assessments can be conducted. IUCN SGA members have also used the research by Wich in discussions with the Bank of China. Wich’s research has also been used in a two\-year document that the IUCN produced on the world’s 25 most endangered primates. This document is a main influencing document for policy change and to increase funding for the most endangered primates. The 2018\-2020 report includes the Tapanuli orangutan.” \[S4\]. 

 <ins>Dr.</ins> <ins>Refisch</ins>, UNEP’s GRASP Programme Manager and Coordinator: “Lastly his research on the Tapanuli orangutan has led to a change in policy focus whereby we are focusing on improving protection of this species. Directly this has led to our previous Executive Director debating the precarious status of the Tapanuli orangutan with the Indonesian Government at the ministerial level. Based on Wich’s research GRASP has also sent out letters of concern to the Indonesian President and other members of the Government about the development of a hydro\-electric project in the area where the Tapanuli orangutan occurs. The same research has also supported GRASP Ambassador Nadya Hutagalung to express her concern about the status of the Tapanuli orangutan to the Indonesian Government.” \[S5\]. 

 Fourth, UR3 and UR5 have been important for a court case by WAHLI \(the largest Indonesian Environmental NGO\) against the Provincial Government of North Sumatra for giving out a permit for the development of a large hydroelectric dam in the area of the newly discovered Tapanuli orangutan. I was called as an expert witness for this court case and appeared in court in 2019. The Bank of China has decided not to fund the hydro project and their concerns about the environmental impact was one of the reasons not to fund the project. 

 Fifth, the research on orangutan numbers in Sumatra \(UR2\) has helped orangutan conservation NGOs to conduct their work more efficiently \[S6 and S7\]. For the Orangutan Information Centre \(OIC\) this led to reforestation efforts that have led to more orangutan habitat. 

 <ins>Mr.</ins> <ins>Hadisiswoyo</ins>, Founder of the Orangutan Information Centre “One important consequence of the work of Prof Wich has been to increase forest restoration in crucial areas of the Leuser Ecosystem. The reforestation efforts have led to an increase the habitat for orangutans.” \[S6\]. 

 For OIC and the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Program \(SOCP\) this has led to a focus their conservation efforts to those areas in terms of patrols, orangutan rescue efforts, policy efforts, and working with local communities. For instance, the work on orangutan distribution has allowed SOCP to be involved in the Indonesian spatial plans and in 2015 have a logging concession turned into a protected area. The research has also allowed them to be specific towards the government and companies about how many orangutans would be at risk when certain changes in spatial land\-use planning would be made. Overall it has influenced much of their conservation efforts. 

 <ins>Dr.</ins> <ins>Singleton \(OBE\)</ins>, Director of the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme: “the research conducted by Prof. Wich has been extremely helpful to us in shaping much of our conservation work.” \[S7\]. 

 Sixth, the studies on the orangutans and other primates \(UR1\-6\) have also been used in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) report on oil palm and biodiversity that was published in 2018 \[S8\] as well as two Great Apes Survival Partnership \(GRASP\) \(part of the United Nation Environmental Program\) policy reports that were published in 2015 \(Future of the Bornean orangutan that focused on climate change, \[S9\]\) and 2016 \(Oil palm paradox, \[S10\]\)\). Both IUCN and GRASP have been using this research as part of their conservation strategies, which include the IUCN Redlist assessments. The oil palm report has according to Mr. Byler vice\-chair of the IUCN’s Section on Great Apes “been of major influence on the debate on whether palm oil should be banned or whether it should be sustainably produced.” \[S4\]. 

 The IUCN and GRASP have also used this research \(UR1\-5\) in a report to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \(CITES\). UNEP is using the research as part of the strategies of their Great Apes Survival Partnership \(GRASP\), which they use in their multilateral discussions on great ape conservation \[S5\]. To broaden the debate about oil palm and primate diversity the study that was conducted \(UR6\) on the potential impact of oil palm on primate diversity was used in the IUCN oil palm report \[S8\] which is being used by the IUCN to stimulate the debate about oil palm and biodiversity and vegetable oils and biodiversity in general. It has been suggested this has helped to steer the debate from a ban to oil palm to one of sustainable oil palm \[S4\]. 

 <ins>Mr. Byler</ins>, Vice\-Chair of the IUCN Section on Great Apes: “It is our understanding that the report has led to a more nuanced debate and has facilitated efforts to grow support for a move towards sustainable palm oil.” 

 <ins>Dr.</ins> <ins>Refisch</ins>, UNEP’s GRASP Programme Manager and Coordinator “In addition, the GRASP Palm Oil Paradox report \(S9\) as well as the Future of the Bornean Orangutan \(S8\) reports have relied heavily on Wich’s research. The consequence of this has been that GRASP is now having a strong focus on sustainable palm oil and climate change in its projects.” \[S10\]. 

 Overall in my role as a scientist at LJMU, but also in my role as vice\-chair of the IUCN Section on Great Apes and chair of the scientific commission of UNEP’s Great Apes Survival Partnership, I have been able to use scientific research to provide input on several policy documents from UNEP, IUCN, the Indonesian Government, helped the conservation of world’s rarest great ape \(the Tapanuli orangutan\) and have impacted the conservation work of several NGOs in Indonesia.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Bath Spa University has supported the formation of a more nuanced public discourse and greater understanding of Islam and Muslim minority communities in a range of international, national and local contexts. Hackett’s and Malik’s work has broken down stereotypes and expectations relating to Islam and Muslims and the West, and has created a fuller awareness of the complex history of Muslim migration. The research has given British Muslims the opportunity to reveal and reflect on their personal migratory experiences, providing a voice and a sense of agency and belonging for smaller and more peripheral Muslim communities. It has also shaped wider public discourse and enhanced public knowledge with regards to national and local Muslim migration histories, and issues of integration, race and social cohesion. Research has influenced the national\-level debate in Britain regarding the development and creation of archival collections relating to Muslim communities in the UK, and it has contributed to the training of public sector staff, civil servants, diplomats, and military and security personnel. 

 Hackett and Malik have a shared desire to use history to ensure greater social and cultural understanding and cohesion in the UK. Their research is especially important in an era of polarised views, creating new narratives through the promotion of informed, balanced discussions. The sharing of their ideas beyond academia has led to “a deepened understanding of the complex histories and narratives of Muslim communities, changing actions and behaviour” \(E1\), contributing “actively and positively to a present and future in which social integration and coexistence is possible and in which conflict can be healed through knowledge” \(E5\). 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research by Hackett and Malik explores neglected histories of Muslim migrant communities in urban and rural areas, and works to expose the complexity of the entangled histories between the Muslim world and the West. They have carried out research individually and collaboratively \(for example as the Bath Spa University leads on the NURSLING project researching higher education in Uzbekistan\), as well as collaborating within the activities of the Bath Spa University *Global Citizenship & Identities Research Group.* 

###  Neglected Stories 

 Hackett and Malik’s research has produced new, historically contextualised knowledge on migration, integration policies, and Muslim communities in Europe and beyond. Hackett has published the first historical comparative study of post\-war Muslim migrant integration in British and German cities, exploring the impact that Britain’s and Germany’s different national\-level immigration policies and frameworks have had on migration, integration and diversity policies \(R1\). This research also examines the long\-term integration of Muslim migrant communities in previously unexplored city contexts. It draws upon neglected archival material as well as creating new oral histories, and challenges the notion that Islam has been detrimental to ethnic minorities’ experiences of migration and integration. 

 Hackett has explored the history of South Asian and Turkish Muslims in post\-1945 Newcastle upon Tyne and Bremen, gaining new insights on integration through historical, cross\-country and cross–city nature research \(R2; R3\). Her research also explores the neglected subject area of integration of Muslim migrant communities in more rural settings, examining the relationship between Muslim migrant integration and rural Britain \(R4\). Using the county of Wiltshire as a case study, Hackett delivers an unprecedented insight into some of Britain’s more rural migration policies and Muslim migrant communities, both of which have remained largely invisible despite their robustness, diversity, and vibrancy. This research draws upon a vast amount of primary material, including extensive research across numerous local government archives and 38 oral history interviews. Overall, the research carried out for this project champions the benefits of shifting attention away from the major conurbations of Muslim settlement and challenges way in which the British rural landscape is perceived and portrayed. 

###  Entangled Histories 

 Research by Hackett and Malik has been key in exploring the complex relationships between the Muslim regions across Asia and Africa and the West. One strand of Malik’s research involves the creation of a theoretical and historical framework for understanding Pakistan’s complex political and cultural history, for example in works on the impact of 9/11 and Pashtun identity and geopolitics in Southwest Asia \(R6\). Another strand of research explores the process of cultural transfer that underpinned processes of modernisation, and addresses the effect of changing geopolitics on diasporic communities in Europe and the United States \(R5\). 

 Malik’s most recent work examines Muslim experiences relating to the legacies and memorialisation of the slave trade and offers a more autoethnographic account \(R7\) of research and public engagement across borders, focusing on urban centres such as Bukhara, Samarkand, Lahore, Isfahan, Fez, Konya, Pisa, Palermo, Helsinki and London, and mapping cultural and intellectual mainsprings that have been fashioned by historical crosscurrents. This publication demonstrates the breadth of Malik’s knowledge and research expertise through its exploration of Muslim heritage across four continents, where cultures share commonalities beyond the narrowly defined premise of conflicts. 

###  Dissemination 

 Hackett and Malik employ historical research in order to dispel misconceptions about Islam and Muslim communities, as well as highlighting connections between communities in different parts of the world. They work individually and collaboratively on public\-facing activities and events, engaging with a range of stakeholders, including policymakers, teachers, diplomates, police officers and refugee groups. For instance, in March 2016, both researchers participated in a Roundtable, “Suspected Communities” at the Red Brick Building in Glastonbury, speaking on the subject of Muslims in Britain; the purpose of the event was the creation of greater awareness on issues faced in an increasingly plural Britain.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Research by Hackett and Malik has had impact in three key areas: shaping wider public discourse and enhancing public knowledge of the Muslim world and Muslim migration; changing archival and museographic practice in order to give a voice to Muslim migrant communities; and training public sector staff, civil servants, diplomats and military and security personnel. The Director of the Muslim Institute notes the significance of Bath Spa University research and public engagement in this area, since it “has challenged stereotypes and erroneous assumptions about the history of the Muslim world” \(E1\). 

###  Shaping wider public discourse and enhancing public knowledge of the Muslim world and Muslim migration 

 Hackett and Malik have shared their research with the wider public through print and broadcast media, in the UK and abroad, as well as organising and taking part in a series of public\-facing events \(E2\). 

 Both researchers have been consulted widely by the media \(E2\). Malik has made over 100 media contributions since 2014, including 40 appearances on BBC Urdu \(part of BBC World Service, BBC Urdu is watched by millions on TV and has highest radio reach among international broadcasters in Pakistan\). He has contributed to *Beyond Belief* on BBC Radio 4, as well as being featured on international \(France 24\), national \(Skai Television, Greece; Dunya TV, Pakistan\) and local media \(Awaaz Community Radio; High Wycombe\). Hackett has acted as an academic expert for BBC Radio 4, and has been interviewed by numerous publications, including the Brazilian newspaper *Folha de S. Paulo* and *The Economist* \(E2\). Both researchers frequently write pieces for public\-facing blogs and websites including *The Conversation*, the Centre of Islamic Studies at SOAS’s *MuslimWise* blog, and the North American Conference on British Studies \(NACBS\) blog \(E2\). 

 A Senior Journalist at BBC Urdu TV highlights the importance of Malik’s contributions on the network, noting that the BBC World Service has a global audience of hundreds of millions \(over 300 million people a week in 2020\) which includes “students, policy makers, opinion formers, women and influencers in those societies” \(E3\). The Senior BBC Journalist stated that Malik “with his measured opinion and analysis especially on extremely sensitive topics” had “played a vital role in enhancing cross\-cultural understandings of such issues and also helped BBC audience to make better informed choices/decisions” \(E3\). 

 Hackett’s research “provided the backbone” of one episode of *Neither There Nor Here* on BBC Radio 4; the Series Producer was drawn to her research due to the ways in which it “stressed the positives, for example the flowering of an entrepreneurial spirit among Turks in \[Bremen\] which enabled many to achieve social mobility and a sense of belonging in Germany” and noted that following the broadcast a “number of people later commented to me that they now had a firm grasp on a subject of which they had hitherto been completely ignorant” \(E4\). 

 Malik is founding member of the Muslim Institute, a Fellowship society of thinkers, academics, artists, creatives and professionals with approximately 150 Fellows, which sits at the intersection of academia and wider society, providing a forum for critical thought and creativity. Malik is a frequent contributor \(E2\) to the Muslim Institute’s public talks, online debates, and its publication *Critical Muslim* \(of which Malik is an associate editor\). *Critical Muslim* is a quarterly print and online publication with an international readership in the thousands which encourages engagement from non\-academic audiences. The Director of the Muslim Institute stated that Malik’s “accessible and approachable style” captured the imagination of those seeking to understand Islamic history, “as he provides a platform for marginalised voices in his work and interrogates dominant narratives by uncovering erstwhile unknown stories, bringing them to life” \(E1\). Malik’s involvement in the Muslim Institute and with *Critical Muslim* have also had an important impact on young Muslims in the UK: 

 Young people I have spoken to have said that after listening to Professor Malik’s talks and reading his essays in Critical Muslim, they are learning for the first time the immense contribution of Islamic societies to knowledge production and our understanding of the world. \(E1\) 

 Professor Malik’s display of a rich and multifaceted history offers \[young Muslims\] a chance to understand this identity as embracing and open and not limited and limiting. But even more than that, it additionally also offers young non\-Muslims in the UK a chance to understand Islam and Muslim neighbours, co\-students and fellow citizens as belonging to traditions and histories that are not inherently alien but that belongs to a common world. \(E5\) 

 In addition to media appearances and national and international events, both researchers have been involved in events aimed at local audiences and ethnic minority community members, addressing topics such as integration and social cohesion. Examples include large public\-facing events ‘Representations of Difference’ in \(November 2013\) that promoted reflection, dialogue and discussion on the social implications of representations of difference, and ‘Migration: Facts, Experiences, and Conversations with Refugees’ \(September 2017\), which offered an opportunity to find out about the reality of the refugee experience \(E2\). Between 2013 and 2020, Hackett and Malik gave 38 public talks to over 3000 people in the UK alone, addressing audiences that included archivists, community leaders, police officers, policymakers, refugees and teachers, as well as interested members of the public \(E2\). 

###  Changing archival and museographic practice in order to give a voice to Muslim migrant communities 

 Hackett’s research revealed that the lack of archives relating to Muslim communities in the UK hindered academic exploration of their histories \(E6a, p59\). Through oral history interviews, Hackett was able to create archival documents relating to the history of Muslim migrant communities and, in doing so, had a positive impact on those populations, by giving them the chance to reflect on and reveal their personal migratory experiences, and providing them with a voice and a sense of agency: “amongst the interviewees there was often a sense of pride, delight, and sometimes intrigue, that there existed an interest in capturing the voices of such small rural Muslim communities” \(R4\). 

 To make minority histories available in a sustainable way, Hackett took part in The National Archives \(TNA\) ‘Collections at Risk’ project in 2016\-2017, playing a key role in examining how \(if at all\) immigration and minority communities are represented in archival material in Britain. Hackett worked with a member of the Muslim community and TNA in order to identify areas of risk and opportunities for development \(E6a, p59\). Working on TNA’s project allowed Hackett to help shape recommendations for the creation of new and the development of existing archives. Impacts of this project included establishing that Muslim communities would welcome advice and support on how to develop and maintain their collections and acknowledging the importance of sustained recognition of the Muslim community by archives and in higher education. 

 Hackett’s involvement in this project helped to break down misconceptions between groups and to establish a collaborative way forward in documenting the histories of Muslim communities in the UK \(TNA\). An Archival Consultant involved in the ‘Collections at Risk’ project said that Hackett’s “ **i**nsights were eyeopeners in terms of helping the archival sector understand the context of Muslim life in relation to recordkeeping. They would inform any further work the sector undertakes in collaborating with the Muslim community” \(E6b\). 

 Bath Spa University research has also shifted museographic practice. Hackett was an advisor for a new permanent gallery, “Destination Tyneside”, which opened at Newcastle upon Tyne’s Discovery Museum in July 2013. The gallery celebrates migration to, and the diversity of, Tyneside and was created after research by the museum revealed that minority ethnic communities in Tyneside felt that their stories, histories and voices weren’t represented within the museum \(E7a, p5\). Gallery content relating to Muslim migration was informed by Hackett’s research and publications, as well as Hackett’s involvement through meetings and discussions with the curators. The project curator stated that Hackett’s research “helped to give shape to the stories of migrants who have, over time, become an important part of the north east community and economy through long\-established businesses” \(E7b\). The response to the new gallery was positive, and it expanded the museum’s reach to include visitors from a wider range of ethnicities and backgrounds, as well as causing a significant number of visitors to rethink their views and opinions about migrants and migration on Tyneside \(E7a, p14\). One visitor said that exploring the gallery had helped them to feel they “belong to the International culture of Tyneside”, while a visitor of Yemini origin had learnt for the first time about the Yemeni community which has been based in South Shields, a town at the mouth of the River Tyne, since the late 1800s \(E7a, p13\). The project curator concluded that: 

 **the addition of Sarah’s work on the Asian migration and migrant experiences in Newcastle upon Tyne has been significant in stimulating conversation, supporting a better understanding and recognition of the positive contribution migrants make to the north east in cultural and economic terms. \(E7b\)** 

###  Training public sector staff, civil servants, diplomats and military and security personnel 

 Hackett and Malik have played an important role in training events that help to broaden attendees’ understanding of specific topics and issues, or familiarise them with a specific country or situation. These training events range from tailored sessions for individuals to briefings for groups of up to 100 people. Between them, Hackett and Malik ran 15 training events between 2014 and 2019, training a minimum of 140 people from a variety of backgrounds, including public sector staff, civil servants, diplomats, and military and security personnel \(E2\). Hackett has participated in regional training days on topics concerning faith and cultural awareness and has also taken part in small training events on the topic of integration. These events have been attended by Wiltshire County Council Community Engagement Managers and members/representatives of local ethnic minority communities. The training centred on the importance of integration and community cohesion in Wiltshire \(E2\). 

 Malik’s research expertise has led to ongoing work in training British Civil Servants, Diplomats, and EU officials. This training includes sessions for the Royal College of Defence Studies, the highly selective senior college of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom which trains senior members of national and international military and diplomatic organisations. Malik’s long\-term association with Farnham Castle Intercultural Training has led to a focus on delivering bespoke Specialised Briefings to the Defence Sector, their Support Staff \(and families\) working in Pakistan; delivering 12 training sessions between 2014 and 2019 \(E2\). These briefings provided informed insights into the current political and economic situation, guidance about social ethics and etiquette, and support in enhancing cross\-cultural communication skills. The Director of the training centre said “The feedback we receive from our delegates on Prof Malik’s work is, without exception, outstanding. They often take the time to specifically comment that they feel much better prepared for their roles as a result of their training” \(E8\). Examples of this feedback demonstrate the impact of these sessions: “I shall have a better understanding of the country and its challenges which will help me every day”; “I was very impressed by Professor Malik and his immense knowledge on Pakistan”; “Everything discussed was relevant and very interesting. It’s been a great basis to build on once I get there” \(E8\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Chichester \(UoC\) research led to improvements in leadership capability and organisational development \(OD\) in 2 Sussex\-based NHS Trusts and the UK Civil Service’s Organisational Development and Design \(OD&D\) Service. This was achieved through an iterative process of research and leadership development carried out between 2013 and 2018, which drew on the UoC’s research into action learning and the profound impact leaders within organisations can have, both on each other’s practice, and the organisation as a whole. As a result of this work, the UoC researchers were credited with generating wide\-ranging cultural improvements in the OD&D Service, and contributing towards the most significant improvement in one NHS Trust’s CQC rating ever achieved. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 While we know that leadership matters, the relationship between what leaders do and the effects of those actions can be difficult to establish – particularly over the long term and in complex contexts. Addressing this difficulty in 1978, Donald Kirkpatrick developed a  [4\-tier model](https://www.kirkpatrickpartners.com/Our-Philosophy/The-Kirkpatrick-Model) that tracked the progress of training and development initiatives \(tier 1\) through to their systemic impacts on organisations as a whole \(tier 4\). Although powerful conceptually, finding empirical evidence of leadership development \(at tiers 3 and 4\), and thus developing leadership in an informed way, has remained elusive. 

 The leadership programme at the core of this case study was a postgraduate certificate accredited by the UoC, which has run a total of 4 times \(typically over the course of 10 months\). The approach taken has been iterative, whereby research outcomes influence reflexive leadership and research practice. In short, building on the work of  [Ann Cunliffe \(2009\)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350507608099315), we have taken a critical perspective as researchers and leadership developers. 

 Our practice\-led research has provided compelling evidence of the impact that leadership development has on tier 4. The particular area of investigation relates to the processes of facilitator\-led group coaching in the form of ‘action learning’ \(Revans 1998; Revans 1979\), with an emphasis on political and power relations \(Rigg & Trehan 2004; Vince 2001; Vince 2004\). This approach can facilitate meaningful engagements with the central issues governing decision making. 

 The research, conducted between 2015 and 2020, focuses on the development of individuals’ leadership capabilities in relation to the outcomes of the organisations involved in the leadership programmes we ran. Over the 5\-year period we tracked the impact of leadership development initiatives \( **R1**\). The research involved working closely with a group of NHS leaders and reconsidering our own practice as facilitators and researchers \( **R4**\). A particular focus was the importance of challenging the way participants saw the world – exploring in practice, for instance, the interaction between ‘field’ and ‘ *habitus*’ from a Bourdieusian perspective \( [Bourdieu, 1977](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/outline-of-a-theory-of-practice/193A11572779B478F5BAA3E3028827D8)\). In other words, how habits and rituals that are taken for granted can be safely unsettled and made available for discussion and development \( **R3**\). 

 In the papers we cite here, we explore how the conversations in the action learning sets come to have ‘ripples’ within the wider organisation, demonstrating how ‘spatially’ action learning has a wider organisational impact \( **R4**\). We then take a longitudinal ‘temporal’ view of the same participants to explore how their practice has developed and the impact they attribute to action learning, having formed a tacit part of their leadership practice. These research insights were used to contribute to a book on developing leadership, organisational development and being a reflexive practitioner \( **R2**\). Further research on the impact these programmes have had on us as facilitators and researchers is forthcoming in the *Journal of Autoethnography*. 

 The outcomes of our research have come to further shape the leadership development programmes we undertake and the organisations that undertake them. Indeed, it formed the basis of the development of the University’s own highly reflexive \(Cunliffe 2016; Cunliffe 2009\) MBA programme and the impact it has had on participants \( **C3**\). Henceforth, the research will focus on practice\-based learning, with a special issue call for papers in the *Action Research Journal* on *Artfulness in the organisational playground* and practice\-based learning research.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our OD programme has led to substantial benefits for 3 major public sector organisations, including broad cultural improvements and opportunities for individual participants’ personal development. In each case, our programme has enabled people to develop confidence in tackling difficult organisational problems and complexities, build trusting relationships and address the concerns of regulators. It has also influenced the field of organisation and leadership development more widely. 

 The programme worked with approximately 100 individual leaders in 2 Sussex\-based NHS Trusts and the UK Civil Service’s OD&D Service. Our first partner was Western Sussex NHS Trust, which, when we began this work, was undergoing the first of 2 mergers. The initial focus here was on developing a shared sense of leadership and vision \(evidenced in **C1**\), and latterly on moving out of ‘special measures’, having merged with a larger Trust that was in a state of stress. This larger Trust had received highly critical reviews from the CQC. In both cases, the Chief Workforce and Organisational Development Director attributed the work we carried out with them as having had a significant impact on the clinical care, efficiency, and regulatory improvement of the Trust as a whole \( **C2**\). She has also corroborated to how we built confidence in tackling widespread and long\-lasting interpersonal and trust\-related problems within the Trust: 

 \[T\]here were a few embattled characters. The facilitation gave a confidence and a feeling of safety \[…\] The conversations in that setting, which felt developmental and sharing, built a level of trust that we have come to rely upon very heavily that has changed the nature of the relationships. We have been braver in tackling some of the things here. I’d say that there is a direct link for the leadership development we put in for the clinical leads and Care Quality Commission \[CQC\] outcomes. For Brighton, one of our key aims was to come out of \[…\] Special Measures with the CQC. The CQC report rated us as good for resources and outstanding for care – the most significant shift \[…\] that has been recorded. \( **C2**\). 

 This CQC report stated that ‘the leadership team had the right skills and abilities to run a service providing high\-quality sustainable care. We observed leaders working seamlessly together across departments. They were knowledgeable about clinical issues and about priorities for the quality and sustainability of the service.’ \( **C3**\). 

 Our work with the OD&D Service, which began in 2016, was aimed at developing a centre of excellence for organisational development and design within the UK Civil Service – a capability they saw as critical in dealing with the increased complexities of government \( **C4**\). As a result of this work, the OD&D developed an increased ability to work collaboratively with clients to solve problems together. The Deputy Director for Organisation Development and Design offers the following summary of this change: 

 The first impact this is having is in terms of a shift in mindset from a more classic civil servant to someone who solves problems. It is a shift in mindset from being an expert to holding an ‘enquiry’ and collaborating with the client to help them work things out. It is not just a mindset; it is also confidence. The way that we run \[the programmes\] enables \[participants\] to reflect back on their practice. Intellectually, people get it, but it is the ability to practice it and reflect \[that matters\]. \( **C4**\). 

 More broadly, our research \(particularly **R2**\) is now widely used in organisation development programmes such as Ashridge’s Executive Doctorate in Organisational Change, and the Roffey Park Institute’s  [Masters in People and Organisational Development](https://www.roffeypark.com/executive-education/accredited-qualifications/msc/) – both internationally renowned in their field. **R2** also led to our nomination in 2019 for *HR Magazine*’s ‘HR’s Most Influential Thinker’ award, as one of the top 30 ‘thinkers’ in Human Resources, worldwide. The panel commented that it was ‘one of the most helpful, applicable and widely read works on OD at the moment’ \( **C5**\). 

 Beyond this, our research has influenced the development of the UoC’s MBA programme – particularly its focus on how participants can be enabled to take their own experience seriously as a reflexive prompt for further development. One participant is quoted in *The Times*/ *Sunday Times* ‘UK MBA Programme List’ list as stating that ‘The most interesting thing has been contemporary leadership \[…\] empower\[ing\] your employees and make sure they have what they need to do the job. It is changing me: I look at work from a different perspective.’ \( **C6**\).

for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Risk assessment and management are core to counter\-terrorism practices worldwide, influencing the outcome of almost every referral into counter\-terrorism practice, from those deemed unsuitable for intervention, to those in prison for terrorist offences. By providing a scientific evidence base for risk factors and protective factors, the co\-creation of innovative research with security\-focused agencies and evaluation of practice, Gill and Bouhana’s research has been the central focus for extremist risk assessment and management worldwide. By influencing counter terrorism policing policy and practice, the team’s work has underpinned risk assessment tools and strategies for the UK Counter Terrorism Unit’s PREVENT and ACTEarly campaigns, and the worldwide Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol \(TRAP\-18\), while incorporating the use of multi\-agency approaches and evidence for organisations including Fixated Threat Assessment Centres in both the UK and Australia, and the US Department of Homeland Security.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Gill and Bouhana’s research in the field of violent extremism studies is unique in terms of its genuine multi\-disciplinarity \(e.g. crime science, life\-course criminology, psychology, political science and geography\), innovative research questions, robust analytical approaches, significant collaborations with crime/security agencies and real\-world impact. Their work is the international reference on violent extremist risk assessment and management, in terms of who engages in violent extremism \(in particular lone\-actor terrorism\) and concerns the application of criminological paradigms to understanding radicalisation and terrorist behaviour. Both are fundamental to the real\-world practice of violent extremist risk assessment and management. Prior to Gill and Bouhana’s extensive contributions, work on lone\-actor terrorism was empirically, conceptually and theoretically weak. Their research stems from the basic idea that terrorist behaviour should be examined in the same way crime science has examined criminal behaviour through robust, problem\-oriented and interdisciplinary science. In terms of empirical research, the lone\-actor terrorist datasets maintained by Gill and Bouhana are the richest repositories of information on individual offenders within the field. 

 The descriptive analysis \(via coding\) of 119 lone actor terrorists, using all publicly available information, categorised over 180 behaviours of interest **\[R1\]**, demonstrating the lack of a uniform socio\-demographic profile of lone actors and encouraging a focus on behaviour to inform risk assessment. As the first paper also to demonstrate the high degree to which other people generally knew about the offender’s grievance, extremist ideology, views and/or intent to engage in violence, or ‘leakage’ of information, the paper noted a range of other intervention opportunities including via mental health professionals. A potential concern, however, with operationalising the findings from **\[R1\]** in practice, was that the data was solely based on open\-source information. In 2019, **\[R2\]** acted to replicate this study, but with closed source data from police and intelligence files, in collaboration with front\-line practitioners at Greater Manchester Police. This was the first published analysis of violent extremism utilising UK police and intelligence data. The results served as a validation of **\[R1\]**’s key findings and offered additional novel insights into a range of factors including forms of criminal histories prior to terrorism, a finer\-grained understanding of online behaviours associated with radicalisation, and hostile reconnaissance of attack sites. As part of the Commission for Countering Extremism, Bouhana built a framework for researchers and practitioners to understand the basis on which risk of violent extremism should be assessed **\[R3\],** integrating evidence relating to the characteristics of people who adopt extremist beliefs and engage in extremist behaviours, and the situations where this occurs. The findings recommended that an effective counter\-extremism strategy must adopt a systemic perspective to address the emergence of the moral ecologies that foster extremism. 

 The situational qualities of terrorist behaviour \(e.g. what terrorists do and how they do it\) were examined in **\[R4\]**. This was the first paper to attempt to understand first\-hand accounts of terrorist decision\-making in the context of the risks they faced. Analysing over 90 primary accounts of life in a terrorist group, **\[R4\]** outlined what the cost\-benefit decision\-making processes look like in a terrorist attack, the types of security features of a scene that are considered \(CCTV, police patrols\) and the routes through which terrorists are detected, denied key pieces of information, deterred and disconcerted in the build up to attacks. Whilst **\[R1\]** unexpectedly demonstrated the high degree to which lone\-actor terrorists had histories of mental disorder \(which ran contrary to thinking at the time\), **\[R5\]** went further and showed that lone\-actors were 13.4 times more likely to have a mental disorder diagnosis prior to their offending, whilst demonstrating a range of co\-morbidities and identified behaviours and traits that security agencies could utilise to monitor and prevent lone\-actor terrorism events. In addition, as control group studies were extremely rare in terrorism studies, the resulting lack of base rate information from the general population is a consistent problem for the development of putative risk and protective factors for violent extremism engagement. **\[R6\]** was the first study of its type to collect this data, through an online survey of over 2000 respondents, who were asked to self\-report upon the same 180\+ variables collected and analysed in other studies **\[R1, R2 and R5\]**. The results were compared with lone\-actor terrorist data. Lone\-actor terrorists were significantly more likely to display cognitive vulnerabilities, low self\-control, and indicators of violence\-supportive moralities. The general population was much more likely to experience greater levels of distal stressors but was also more likely to experience factors considered protective against offending \(e.g. university experience\). The results provide empirical evidence for the consideration of protective factors in violent extremist risk assessment, which to date have largely been overlooked.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Consistent with the applied nature of crime science, Gill and Bouhana’s research involves collaborating with practitioners conducting violent extremist risk assessment and management. Impacts emanated from research that Gill and Bouhana were directly commissioned to undertake \(Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, the U.S. National Institute of Justice\), from the co\-creation of research with frontline practitioners \(Greater Manchester Police, the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre, and the FBI\), and through practitioners becoming aware of Gill and Bouhana’s work and embedding these results in policy and practice. These impacts range from guiding early prevention efforts, through to active risk management in ongoing cases **\(S1\-7\)**. 

 **Influencing International Counter Terrorism Organisations** 

 Gill and Bouhana’s research demonstrates the similar genesis of violent extremism and other forms of targeted violence \(e.g. mass shootings\) **\[R1/R2/R3/R5\]**. Between 2019\-2020, after a series of personal briefings from Gill to the Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention in the US Department of Homeland Security \(DHS\), the DHS stated “ *The findings served as some of the first evidence that violence prevention programs should not limit their focus to targeted violence or terrorism, but rather should address both…The findings and subsequent updates…undergird the practice of…the Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention*” **\(S1\)**. The Office was tasked with developing a new definition of targeted violence for the DHS where Gill’s personal briefings on this issue “ *likely saved…at least a month of research and greatly accelerated the work*” **\(S1\)**. Gill’s other briefings on behavioural indicators for grievance\-based violence simplified these difficult topics for a cohort of new employees, leaving them with greater clarity in how to approach the prevention of targeted violence and terrorism. This has been evident in their practice since, “ *which in turn has greatly improved the practice of prevention*” **\(S1\)**. 

 Gill and Bouhana’s work identified, and in turn verified, risk and protective factors for involvement in violent extremism **\[R1\-R6\]**. The developers of risk assessment tools incorporated these risk factors into their tools, and cited Gill and Bouhana’s work in their guidance documents. For example, Fixated Threat Assessment Centres in Australia assess and manage lone, fixated persons, who have obsessive preoccupations. In order to do so, they developed a tool called ‘The Risk Aide\-Mémoire’, to prioritise the urgency and intensity of intervention and monitoring requirements. The tool’s protocol draws heavily on the UCL team’s research in this area particularly in demonstrating \(i\) “ *the relevance of mental health to violent extremism risk assessment and management*” **\[R5\]** and \(ii\) that “ *often other parties such as family members and friends had observed changes in…mental state and behaviour, highlighting potential opportunities…to intervene before the violence*” **\[S2, R1/R2\]**. The Risk Aide\-Mémoire has been used in more than 2,000 cases to assess behaviour, motivations, mental states and the risk of radicalisation **\(S2\)**. 

 TRAP\-18 is the worldwide Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol 18, of which much of the guidance is based on Gill and Bouhana’s work on risk factors. The tool helps assess persons of concern for engagement in ideologically\-motivated violence, and is used by counter\-terrorism and law enforcement officials in Canada, Europe, and the United States. In total, Gill’s research **\[R1/R2/R5\]** on lone\-actor terrorists is cited in 10 of 18 risk factors contained within the TRAP\-18’s guidance manual, whose purpose is to “ *help the assessor develop a narrative for understanding the case given the presence or absence of indicators*” **\(S3\)**. Two of these risk factors are ‘dependence on the virtual community’ and ‘leakage’. For the former, **\[R2\]** “ *provided the most complete analysis of the risk factor*” **\(S3\)**. For the latter, **\[R1\]** was the first to demonstrate a majority of lone\-actor terrorists leak their intent prior to the violence and this is their ‘“ *Achilles’ heel” in terms of early detection’* **\(S3\).** After TRAP\-18’s development, its developer and Gill co\-published the most cited paper in *The Journal of Threat Assessment and Management* **\(R7\)**. “ *This paper was the first to demonstrate TRAP\-18’s applicability to multiple ideologies…advanced the construct validation of the TRAP\-18…\[and\]..contributed toward TRAP\-18’s validation by the Risk Management Authority*” whose remit is to promote consistent, evidence\-based practice for key partners working across criminal justice **\(S3\).** TRAP\-18 remains the only violent extremist risk assessment tool to hold such validation from the authority, and is therefore deemed the measure against which the practice of violent extremist risk assessment guidance should be judged going forward. 

 Such close and impactful collaboration has happened elsewhere also. For example, the FBI replicated publication **\[R1\]** with their internal data for an ecologically valid understanding of the problem in the U.S. Gill provided scientific input, advice and peer review on this replication **\(S4\)**. 

 **Underpinning Campaigns and Practices in National Terrorism Units** 

 Gill and Bouhana’s work on the leakage of intent to bystanders has been publicly noted by Britain’s most Senior Counter\-Terrorism Officer, demonstrating *“the need for policing to work with communities to provide those closest to people at risk of being drawn into terrorism to have confidence that early intervention can divert people away from terrorism.”* Gill and Bouhana’s body of research *“provides the rationale for why a public health approach is needed”* **\(S5\)** in this space, and this is therefore typified in Counter Terrorism Policing’s ‘ACT Early’ safeguarding prevention campaign launched in November 2020, providing advice, guidance and support for adults \(parents, carers, teachers\) who are concerned a child or young adult they know may be vulnerable to radicalisation. ‘ACT Early’ is one part of the UK Counter Terrorism Strategy to stop people becoming or supporting a terrorist. In examining the relationship between mental health problems and violent extremism **\[R1/R2/R7\]**, Gill et al.’s work has been instrumental in setting up Counter Terrorism Vulnerability Hubs \(also known as Mental Health Pilot Hubs\). Their remit is to identify referrals to Prevent who may have mental health difficulties at the earliest possible opportunity and, where appropriate, assist them in accessing mainstream services for help with hundreds of referrals each year of individuals demonstrating radicalisation concerns alongside mental ill health. The work on mental health problems also led to close research collaborations with the UK Fixated Threat Assessment Centre \(FTAC\) to assess and manage the threat to public figures from lone individuals with intense, pathological fixations, the majority of whom are mentally ill. The research demonstrated *“the boundaries between \[FTAC\] casework and \[violent extremism\] were not so stark.”* UCL researchers were embedded at FTAC, and their analyses of FTAC’s case *files “demonstrated particular markers of concern to prioritise in assessment”* and now inform FTAC’s “day\-to\-day risk assessment practice” in approximately 1,000 referrals per year **\(S6\)**. 

 Between 2014 and 2017, Gill undertook close collaborative work with the UK’s North\-West Counter Terrorism Unit \(Project Regulus\), which led to a co\-publication on the antecedent behaviours of 49 lone\-actor terrorists based on police files, intelligence and interviews **\[R2\]**. Gill was the lead academic and scientific partner on the project. The research helped influence the Counter\-Terrorism Network to *“view the threat to national security through the lens of vulnerability and safeguarding”*, leading to the creation of an intelligence enhancement framework based on observable and detectable behavioural indicators, feeding directly into *“strategic direction, defensible decision making, case management for the National Counter\-Terrorism network”.* As noted by the Detective Chief Inspector of Greater Manchester Police, Project Regulus *“became a live national function providing support across the whole U.K. counter\-terrorism network…and introduced a commonality of process, consistency of language and template documentation to manage threat and risk”.* The collaborative work therefore also *“provided an economic benefit by ensuring cases are managed in an efficient, structured and defensible manner, whilst also providing assurance to the national network”* **\(S7\)**. 

 In summary, the impact on violent extremist risk assessment and management spans \(a\) the scientific development and validation of risk and protective factors incorporated into risk assessment tools and procedures applied worldwide \(b\) the co\-creation and direct dissemination of research with practitioner agencies that fed into their internal practice and \(c\) the evaluation of real\-world practice.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 An innovative collaboration with theatre\-makers drawing on research on theatre censorship in Spain, with a specific focus on the most frequently staged and studied modern Spanish play, Lorca’s *La casa de Bernarda Alba* \( *The House of Bernarda Alba*, a set text for Spanish A\-level\). The focus on censorship influenced the way in which the Spanish Theatre Company’s London production of the play was conceived and marketed, and expanded its impact on audiences by informing the educational materials made available to approximately 180 schools and shaping the post\-show discussions for school groups. Lorca’s masterpiece was also the subject of workshops involving 81 A\-level Spanish students, created in collaboration with Théâtre Sans Frontières. Research findings were turned into drama\-based activities integrating language learning, textual interpretation and contextual knowledge, transforming students’ and teachers’ approaches to the work. The project has changed partner organisations’ working methods and modified the way teachers work on *The House of Bernarda Alba* with A\-level students, helping them to develop a wider range of interpretations of the text and understand its relevance to the historical topics on the syllabus. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 This case study grew out of a collaborative research project funded by the AHRC between 2008 and 2011: Theatre Censorship in Spain, 1931\-1985 \(TCS\). Thompson was Principal Investigator, working with Catherine O’Leary of NUI Maynooth as Project Partner and Diego Santos Sánchez as Research Associate. Project website: <ins>www.dur.ac.uk/mlac/tcs</ins>. 

 The team’s outputs are making a significant and original contribution to understanding theatre censorship in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, reframing the field by comparing the Franco period to the Republic and civil war periods, by covering an unusually wide range of theatrical genres, and by paying close attention to Catalan theatre \(especially in output R1\). Since 2008, Thompson has given seven public lectures at schools, universities and theatres focusing on the censorship of Lorca and *La casa de Bernarda Alba*. Written in 1936 shortly before the start of the Spanish civil war and the murder of its author, the play was banned in Spain until 1963, because of the Franco regime’s hostility to the author and because of the intensity of the passions evoked in the work. 

 The *Hispanic Research Journal* article \(R4 below\) offers a survey of the field covered by the project, sets out the research questions, and anticipates some preliminary findings. Two of the key points it makes refer to Federico García Lorca, showing that he was an exception in being completely blacklisted by the Franco dictatorship, and that the case of *The House of Bernarda Alba* exemplifies a significant shift of power within the regime in the early 1960s. The story of the play’s prohibition from 1939 to 1963, including new evidence of the regime’s enduring unease about Lorca’s influence and censors’ arguments over the threat posed by the play, yields illuminating insights into the cultural history of the period, as well as opening up new ways of reading the text and understanding the political and cultural significance of Lorca’s work as a whole. 

 The project’s largest output to date is the edited volume *Global Insights on Theatre Censorship* \(R2\) based on contributions to the conference TCS ran as part of the Dublin Theatre Festival in 2010. The conference and the book expanded the scope and academic impact of TCS’s investigations, creating an opportunity to compare Spanish censorship with systems of cultural control in other countries. The keynote contributors were prominent theatre practitioners, whose accounts of combatting censorship in various forms were complemented by academic papers on historical and current examples from various countries. Output R3 broadens the scope of the research in a different way, using examples of censorship to reframe semiotic concepts of dramatic character. 

 The culminating output of the project will be a co\-authored monograph to be published in 2021, the first on this topic in English. The book will provide a comprehensive account of how the censorship apparatus functioned and how it changed in response to social, political and cultural change between the Republic in the 1930s and the transition to democracy in the late 1970s. It will gauge the effects of censorship on authors, groups and genres, comparing different responses to the constraints, and offer an overall assessment of the wider effects on theatrical activity. The book will make an important contribution not only to understanding of Spanish culture and politics in the 20th century but also to theorisation of the nature of censorship and the politics of aesthetics \(building on ideas from Foucault, Bourdieu, Rancière and Butler\). *La casa de Bernarda Alba* is one of the primary case studies in the monograph.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 There were two strands of activity, both focusing on Federico García Lorca’s *La casa de Bernarda Alba* \( *The House of Bernarda Alba*\), a set text in all English exam boards’ syllabuses for A\-level Spanish, and the Spanish play most frequently performed in the UK. The first strand comprised collaboration with the Spanish Theatre Company \(STC\) in London around their successful production of the play, while the second involved development of workshops for A\-level students with the Hexham\-based multilingual theatre company Théâtre Sans Frontières \(TSF\). Encouraging theatre\-makers, audiences, schoolteachers and their students to look at the play through the lens of censors’ reports between the 1940s and the 1960s has expanded their understanding of this iconic tragedy in relation to multiple contexts, and has influenced perceptions of how it can be performed in a way that brings out its social significance. In addition to the educational benefits for A\-level students and teachers, both strands have provided benefits to the partner organisations \(STC and TSF\) by changing the ways they target audiences and integrate their performance work with educational activities. 

####  \(a\) Support for performances \(November 2017 to March 2018, February 2019 and February 2020\) 

 STC’s production at the Cervantes Theatre in London was developed in consultation with Thompson and financially supported by a grant he obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Culture \(GBP12,790\). Performances were complemented by workshops developed with input from Thompson and post\-show Q & A sessions involving Thompson and members of the company. Schools bringing groups of students to the play were sent in advance an education pack produced by the company’s education officer in consultation with Thompson, informed by his research on censorship, for work in class before seeing the performance. The play was performed in both Spanish \(Monday\-Wednesday\) and English \(Thursday\-Saturday\), attracting general audiences in large numbers as well as school groups, and the link with censorship was highlighted in the promotional material for the production. An additional week of 9 performances in Spanish for schools, including a post\-show discussion led by Thompson, was run in February 2019 at Channing School in London. In February 2020, there were 31 performances in Spanish at the Cervantes Theatre, the Crescent Theatre in Birmingham and the Phoenix Theatre in Castleford \(bringing the total number of performances between 2017 and 2020 to 112\). The material in the education packs has been expanded and made available on the Cervantes Theatre website: <ins>schools.cervantestheatre.com/la\-casa\-de\-bernarda\-alba</ins> \[E4\]. In addition to enriching the experience of those who attended performances, the collaboration benefited the company by providing a distinctive focus for its first full season in its new venue and helping it to develop its educational role, making a significant and timely contribution to its mission of establishing itself as ‘a reference point in London for Spanish\-speaking culture’. 

 Thompson’s research on censorship influenced the way in which the production was conceived and marketed, emphasising the play’s political significance and its reception in Spain \[E1 and E2\]. The total number of spectators who saw the English or Spanish version of the production between November 2017 and February 2019 was 5,823, of whom 2,642 were secondary school students or teachers; approximately 70 of them attended the Q&A sessions led by Thompson, and education packs were sent out to 182 schools \[E2\]. Questionnaires completed by those who attended Q&A sessions showed that 92% of respondents found the information about censorship ‘very useful’ or ‘fairly useful’ for ‘understanding the importance of the play and/or Lorca’s work in general’ \[E3\]. One student confirmed that it ‘improves my understanding of the play, provides more depth’, while a teacher commented: ‘Excellent way to further understanding of the play. Makes the experience more valuable for A\-level students.’ The Spanish Theatre Company’s production reached a significant proportion \(approximately 16%\) of the cohorts of students taking A\-level Spanish in the school years between 2017 and 2018 \(7,591 entries in total\) and between 2018 and 2019 \(7,932 entries\), resulting in widespread influence on those students’ understanding of the play and on teachers’ approaches to teaching it. A further 168 school groups saw the production in early 2020. The company confirms that the collaboration with Thompson made a valuable contribution to the company’s progress towards fulfilling its unique mission of promoting Spanish\-language theatre in the UK: ‘Thompson’s initiative furthered the educational aspect of our mission \[…\], adding immense value to our artistic programme’ \[E2\]. 

####  \(b\) Workshops for A\-level students \(January 2018\) 

 Drama\-based workshops for schools developed in collaboration with Théâtre Sans Frontières \(TSF\) brought together Thompson’s archival research on censorship with TSF’s extensive experience of using drama for language learning. Four workshops were held \(one in Hexham, one in Durham and two in London\), involving a total of 81 students of A\-level Spanish and 12 teachers from 10 schools \[E6\]. The 3.5 hours of activities in each workshop allowed participants to benefit from Thompson’s research through role\-play facilitated by actors from TSF \[E5\]. 

 The workshops addressed the risk of over\-simplification in students’ understanding of the political impact of *La casa de Bernarda Alba*, offering them a more nuanced approach taking account of historical change and staging conditions. Evaluations from teachers and students were enthusiastic, confirming the originality of the approach and the value of integrating textual analysis, contextual knowledge, a focus on performance, and role\-play in Spanish. Of the 78 student respondents, 77 \(98.7%\) found the workshop interesting; 66 \(84.6%\) found it enjoyable; 59 \(75.6%\) found it useful; 54 \(69.2%\) agreed that ‘looking at *La casa de Bernarda Alba* in relation to censorship has changed the way I think about the play’; and 73 \(93.6%\) agreed that ‘the focus on performing *La casa de Bernarda Alba* was a good way of learning about censorship and Francoism’. One student commented that ‘I liked how engaging the learning was’, and another appreciated ‘the way you were always involved – not just telling you the context but making you part of it so you could understand/enjoy it better’ \[E6\]. 

 As well as contributing to the learning of the student participants, the workshops prompted productive reflection by the teachers on creative ways of combining cultural study and language learning \[E6\]. One teacher stated that ‘when I teach the play next year, I will definitely spend more time teaching the historical context’, while another commented: ‘Coupled with the performance at the Cervantes Theatre, your workshop has really made the study of Lorca's play very exciting for \[my students\] and they are very privileged to have had such a rich introduction to the text.’ Another confirmed that ‘the workshop was very rewarding for students and teachers alike, and I went away inspired, planning to bring more drama into the classroom and to use role\-play involving myself as well as the students. I have taught the play for a number of years \[...\] and will definitely stand back more and consider new ways into this important play’. One of the participating teachers disseminated a positive report on the experience to the 120 members of the Independent Schools Modern Languages Association \(ISMLA\) \[E7\]. TSF benefited by being enabled to adapt methods created for younger learners to 6th\-form\-level work with a richer, research\-informed content base. The Artistic Director confirms that the collaboration ‘deepened our knowledge and understanding of how to marry together fact and fiction to develop something that could go beyond the everyday and become a memorable and valuable learning experience for all involved’ and that ‘TSF now has a broader offer for future audiences’ \[E8\]. Materials from the workshops are archived on TSF’s website and can be downloaded, offering the possibility of further workshops in the future and encouraging re\-use of the materials by teachers \[E9 and E10\]. Detailed plans for a second series of four workshops in April 2020 had to be abandoned as a result of the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 In order to further the continuing impact on teachers’ practice, Thompson and the Artistic Director of TSF spoke about the project at the UK\-Lingua conference on language learning in April 2019, which provided an opportunity to spread awareness amongst teachers of this new research\-led approach blending drama and learning about language and culture. There were 93 delegates \(66 from HE, 10 secondary and 1 primary teachers, 16 others\). Further dissemination of information about both parts of the Impact Case Study will come from an interview given by Thompson in October 2020 for an article on Spanish theatre in the UK to be published in the Spanish journal *Artescénicas* \(aimed at theatre professionals as well as an academic readership\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Wilson’s research has been instrumental in maintaining trust in the use of confidential patient information in the NHS. It has led to changes in the way that core concepts such as confidentiality, implied consent, and public interest are interpreted by healthcare professionals, national\-level committees, and the National Data Guardian. Wilson’s research\-based ethical advice contributed materially to: the prevention of the implementation of the care.data project, thereby helping to protect the privacy of all English GP patients \(2014\); an Information Commissioner’s Office \(ICO\) finding that Google DeepMind and Royal Free had breached the Data Protection Act \(2017\); the withdrawal of an MoU between the Home Office and NHS Digital, preventing the mis\-use of patient data for immigration control purposes \(2018\); and the adoption across the NHS of a new principle for the use of data \(2020\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a series of papers, Wilson rigorously analysed how health data can be used more effectively for the purposes of delivering care to patients, and to improve population health, while respecting duties of privacy and confidentiality \[ **R1, R2, R3, R4**\]. He argued that the state’s duties to protect and promote health should be articulated through the right to public health, and that this is the best way to reconcile the value of health with other values such as liberty and autonomy. \[ **R1**\] On this view, states which fail to take easy steps to reduce socially controllable threats to health violate their citizens' rights. Ways that states can violate this right include failing to collect the data necessary to facilitate public health planning. Wilson also argued that citizens’ reasonable expectations play a significantly larger role in justifying the shape and limits of state activity than has often been appreciated. In line with this account, Wilson developed a Public Value account for the NHS, which provides a reconciliation of the public interest in maintaining confidentiality and public trust, with the benefits that can come through commercial partnerships and sale of data. \[ **R5**\] 

 Underpinning research was supported by grants from EPSRC \[ **ii**\], NHS Digital \[ **iii**\], and a secondment to the Royal Society’s Science Policy Centre \[ **i**\]. Wilson was PI for \[ **ii**\], which provided an ethics framework for the GBP11,000,000 i\-sense Agile Early Warning Sensing Systems for Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance collaboration. Wilson’s project examined how to build and maintain public trust in the context of novel mechanisms of disease surveillance such as the ethics of the use of Twitter data for disease detection. The project showed that much of the philosophical discussion so far has presupposed some implausible assumptions about what it is to waive a right, and that the concept of reasonable expectations is crucial for clarifying what counts as a violation of the right to privacy in a range of crucial cases involving inferring private information from public information. \[ **R3**\] 

 This account of privacy and reasonable expectations was crucial for advice Wilson provided to the National Data Guardian for Health and Social Care \(NDG\), Dame Fiona Caldicott, in a high\-profile case about the nature and limits of implied consent. Resolving the case made clear that a theoretical clarification of the nature of implied consent was necessary. With the NDG’s encouragement, Wilson fundamentally rethought the normative underpinnings of medical confidentiality \[ **R4**\], arguing that much of the role that had previously been assigned within guidance to implied consent should be assigned to reasonable expectations.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Patient data is essential for the effective functioning of the NHS. All users of NHS services, and all health professionals benefit from a system of governance that ensures patient data is used only in ways that appropriately balance the need for confidentiality against the benefits to be obtained from wider usage of data for research and service planning. Wilson’s research based ethical advice has been instrumental in maintaining trust in the use of confidential patient information in the NHS, contributing materially to: the prevention of the implementation of the NHS care.data project, thereby helping to protect the privacy of all English GP patients \(2014\); an Information Commissioner’s Office \(ICO\) finding that Google DeepMind and Royal Free had breached the Data Protection Act \(2017\); the withdrawal of an MoU between the Home Office and NHS Digital, thus preventing the mis\-use of patient data for immigration control purposes \(2018\); and the adoption across the NHS of a reasonable expectations principle for the use of data \(2020\). 

 **Maintaining Public Trust in NHS Digital’s Data Disseminations.** Wilson’s research was a key resource in preventing the implementation of the care.data project. Care.data was proposed to harvest data on every individual patient from English GP practices into a central database, without either anonymisation or allowing patients to opt out. Wilson was the ethicist for NHSD’s General Practice Extraction Service Independent Advisory Group \(GPES IAG\), which was tasked with providing independent advice on whether the project was in the public interest. Drawing on his work on the ethics of risk imposition \[ **R2**\], Wilson “led the development of the GPES IAG Public Interest Model”. \[ **A**\] As the then Chair of GPES IAG explains, this model “underpinned GPES IAG processes and recommendations” and “was instrumental in the group articulating its concerns about why care.data did not appear to be in the public interest.” \[ **A**\] GPES IAG’s role in opposing the policy was recognised by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s POSTNote 474, the subsequent Health Select Committee inquiry, and by the medical privacy NGO medConfidential, which described GPES IAG as “The one single body that stood up to care.data”. \[ **B**\] Care.data was “paused” in February 2014, and then finally abandoned in 2016. Wilson’s expertise was further recognised when in 2015 he was invited to become an independent member of NHSD’s Data Access Advisory Group \(DAAG\), which advised NHSD on how to maintain public trust in their data disseminations. The then Chair of GPES IAG, who also served as Chair of DAAG, states that Wilson’s contribution was “consistently valuable” \[ **A**\], bringing “increased rigour”, and “greater attention to the achievement of public benefits”. The committee’s advice contributed to a “wholesale move away from the use of confidential patient information for the routine planning, monitoring, and reimbursement of health and care services”, which “improved the protection of the confidentiality and privacy of millions of NHS patients’ records, without detriment to services.” \[ **A**\] In 2016, he was chosen as “a leading academic in the ethics of data sharing” \[ **C**\] to help NHSD to transition DAAG into a fully independent oversight group, the Independent Group Advising on the Release of Data \(IGARD\), and was IGARD’s ethicist \(2017–18\). NHSD’s Chief Medical Officer estimates that the work Wilson did with IGARD to maintain public trust and improve the ability of NHS data to improve patient outcomes benefited “hundreds of thousands of patients.” \[ **C**\] 

 **Advice to NDG on ethics, confidentiality, consent, and maintaining public trust in the NHS.** Wilson was appointed to the NDG’s Panel in 2016, “principally in virtue of his experience and contributions as an academic philosopher and ethicist” \[NDG for Health and Care, in **D**\]. Wilson was the first philosopher to be appointed to the NDG Panel, and as NDG relates, she “soon came to recognise that we had made an excellent decision in deciding, in general, to have an academic ethicist and philosopher on the panel and specifically, to recruit Wilson, due to the contributions that he has made individually.” \[ **D**\]. In 2018 Wilson joined the NDG’s Steering Group, which is a smaller group of closer advisers. Wilson has regularly represented NDG in national level meetings, and occasionally at Ministerial level meetings such as a roundtable on Artificial Intelligence on 28 February 2018, and the Global Digital Health Partnership \(with Directors General and ministers from twenty different countries\) on AI and Health in September 2018. \[ **D**\] 

 **Specifying the limits of implied consent through the concept of reasonable expectations.** 

 Wilson was key to the formation of the NDG position on implied consent and the common law duty of confidence from 2016 onwards. In one crucial case, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust shared the records of 1.6 million NHS patients with Google DeepMind for the development and testing of an App for detecting acute kidney injury. Royal Free claimed to have done so on the basis of patients’ implied consent, despite the fact that at the time that the data was shared, no steps were taken to make patients aware of this fact. The case was complex, and raised an important point of principle about the circumstances in which it is legitimate to infer that a patient has consented to disclosure of information. Wilson, as a member of the NDG Panel, met senior representatives from Royal Free and DeepMind on three occasions, in order to come to a considered judgement. NDG was subsequently asked by the Information Commissioner to give advice as part of a formal investigation into whether the Data Protection Act had been breached. \[ **D**\] Wilson, together with fellow NDG panel member Mark Taylor, argued that reasonable expectations are crucial in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate uses of implied consent. \[ **R3, R4**\] As NDG explains, “Wilson significantly influenced the emphasis that I laid on the relevance of the legal concept of 'reasonable expectations’ in this case and in later work”. \[ **D**\] Wilson’s advice was crucial for shaping the NDG’s response to the Information Commissioner—namely that as the data usage by Royal Free was not in line with patients’ reasonable expectations, it therefore could not plausibly be claimed that patients had consented to it. \[ **D**\] This advice led directly to the finding by the Information Commissioner’s Office that the Royal Free had breached the Data Protection Act. \[ **E**\] As the Chair of the Health Research Authority explains, Wilson’s analysis was also deeply influential with the Health Research Authority \(HRA\): “The HRA accepted the conclusions of his work and built its regulatory response upon it. I chaired a multi\-agency meeting in which the implications were worked through, all predicated on the analysis that Professor Wilson had developed. Professor Wilson’s work on this specific issue has had a very wide impact on data governance in the NHS.” \[ **F**\] 

 **New reasonable expectations principle for information use in the NHS.** Wilson published \[ **R4**\], which provided NDG with the “intellectual underpinning” \[ **D**\] for the introduction of a new reasonable expectations principle for data use within the NHS. In a 2019 press release, the NDG praised \[ **R4**\] as “a very convincing article which outlines the importance of reasonable expectations and explores how this principle might be used to support appropriate information sharing.” \[ **G**\] NDG undertook a national consultation in 2020 on whether a new reasonable expectations principle should be adopted across the NHS. The consultation document explicitly mentions how \[ **R4**\] influenced the NDG position. \[ **H**\] Consultation respondents were overwhelmingly in favour, and the new principle published in December 2020. \[ **H**\] 

 **Change to Government Policy on the use of NHS Data for Immigration Enforcement.** Wilson’s contribution was important for shaping the line taken by the NDG for the Health Select Committee inquiry on the Memorandum of Understanding \(MoU\) between NHSD and the Home Office \(2017–18\), and through that changing government policy. The MoU allowed demographic information held by NHSD to be used for the purposes of tracing immigration offenders. While it was not illegal for NHSD to share patient information in this way, doing so was thought to be incompatible with the General Medical Council’s \(GMC\) confidentiality guidance. GMC is the regulatory body for doctors, and so any doctor who was involved with decision\-making about individual cases under the MoU would potentially be subject to censure and even to being struck off. It was nonetheless a policy that the Home Office, and NHSD claimed to be in the public interest. Wilson argued that NHSD’s public interest test was deeply flawed. Both NHSD’s most senior advisers on ethics and confidentiality—its Caldicott Guardian and Deputy Caldicott Guardian—were doctors. Thus, neither could be involved in the decision\-making about individual cases required under the MoU, because of the risk of their breaching the GMC Confidentiality Code. NHSD’s solution was to remove the Caldicott Guardian and his Deputy from its processes for determining the public interest in individual cases. Wilson argued this amounted to excluding the very persons who through institutional role and expertise would be best placed to determine the balance of public interest from making their contribution. As NDG explains, Wilson’s argument “became a central plank of the view I provided to the committee” \[ **D**\] and proved influential. Wilson’s argument was quoted prominently in the letter sent by the chair of the Health Select Committee to the CEO of NHSD on 29 January 2018, requesting that NHSD immediately withdraw from the MoU. \[ **I**\] It is quoted again on p. 23 of the subsequent Health and Social Care committee report. \[ **I**\] On 9 May 2018, the Government announced that the memorandum would be withdrawn and revised, reducing the number of cases that would fall under it by over 90%. \[ **I**\] Wilson was then asked to address a private meeting of NHSD’s Board on 5 June 2018, which focused on how the organisation might respond to the ethical criticisms made against it. As NHSD’s then Chief Medical Officer and Caldicott Guardian explains, NHSD’s Board “wanted a renowned expert in the field to advise them” and that Wilson’s name “came up from multiple sources as someone whose body of work had the potential to educate and advise the Board of a national body on the way forward… The impact was a change in organisational structure and adherence to \[Wilson’s\] advice.” \[ **C**\] 

 **NHS Covid\-19 App Ethics Advisory Board.** Wilson was a member of the Ethics Advisory Board \(EAB\) for the NHS Covid\-19 App in 2020. The project was extremely high\-profile, as it was initially envisaged in the government’s strategy that the App would play the leading role in controlling the spread of coronavirus. The Board’s advice and challenge was widely discussed, including in parliament, on the Radio 4 *Today Programme*, and was covered extensively in *The Telegraph* and *The Guardian* and other newspapers *.* EAB’s main formal output was a letter to the Secretary of State for Health on 24 April 2020, which laid out six principles and a framework for meeting the objectives of effective control of the epidemic and protecting privacy. The EAB Chair confirms that “Wilson was the most influential member in crafting the ethical principles that we established”, and explicitly recognises how Wilson’s work on public value and on public health ethics shaped the principles. \[ **F**\] EAB’s principles were warmly welcomed by the government, which committed to follow them \[ **J**\], and that these principles would be “the basis by which any future change requests for the app will be assessed.” \[ **J**\] Wilson continued to advise on behalf of NDG in the lead up to the launch of the second iteration of the App. A number of changes were made to the privacy information provided for App users on the basis of his advice, including making clear that “despite the anonymity of the alerts delivered through the app, users might sometimes be able to infer who among their contacts had tested positive for Covid”. \[ **G**\] As NDG makes clear, his advice “significantly influenced” her decision to endorse the App \[ **G**\] which had been downloaded over 20 million times by the end of 2020. \[ **F**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Art in book form and artists’ books, a long\-standing medium for artistic expression, have tended to remain marginal to the artistic mainstream. Dr Sarah Bodman’s work at UWE has contributed significantly to the recent, measurable resurgence in understanding and recognition of artists’ books by the wider artistic community. Building on her own practice\-based research, her deep engagement in the field has expanded and strengthened the field of practice internationally, through creating a hub connecting a network of artists across the UK, Australia, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and beyond. Her work has increased and enriched the understanding of artists’ books on the part of curators, librarians, the public and the artistic community at large, through her writing and through participatory projects, publishing, exhibitions and events. By widening knowledge and appreciation, she has also expanded commercial opportunities and the market for artists’ books. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Creators of artists' books seek to situate and understand their practice. UWE research works with the artistic community to connect artists’ books practices and understanding across the international field. Dr Bodman uses her artistic practice to interrogate the creation and reception of artists’ books, for example *Read to Me*, an experiment in collaboration with a psychometric reader to transmit the narratives through physical objects. The touring exhibition project invited artists and the public to contribute to the evolving artwork \( **R1**\). 

 
Figure 1: *Read To Me* artist’s book in production at London Centre for Book Arts \(2018\) and public drawing event at Arnolfini bookshop, Bristol \(2019\). 

 As a practitioner\-researcher, Bodman surveys and documents activity through publishing the *Book Arts Newsletter \(BAN\)*, *Artist’s Book Yearbook \(ABYB\)* and *The Blue Notebook journal for artists' books* as a ‘vital research infrastructure’ \( **S5**\). This shares ideas, exhibitions, workshops, opportunities and artefacts with the community. It has identified significant gaps in the field for critical discussion of distinct artists’ books practices neglected by the traditional focus on the US. 

 Bodman’s practice\-led research sought to bring together artists, historians, curators and critics to investigate disparate geographic areas within the wider context and history of international practice \( **R2**\). Peer\-to\-peer knowledge sharing at physical events such as Bristol Artists’ Book Event \(BABE\) and public symposia \( *Artists’ Books in Australia and Brazil – looking to the past to read into the future*\), and in virtual spaces \( *BAN*, *Blue Notebook*\) established new, more balanced, and richer understanding of artists' books. 

 This repositions and strengthens knowledge of Eastern European, Australian and Latin American practices in particular \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\). The research has found and conveyed how artists’ books have developed historically in these regions due to political, colonial and geographical factors. Australian artists’ high craft skills come from using presses and equipment dating back to colonising governmental offices from the 1850s, whereas Brazilian artists’ production and dissemination of printed works brought risks similar to censorship problems faced by Eastern European artists until the mid\-1980s. The research considers the context of these in relation to production and materials. It does so from an artist’s perspective, in a way that reaches out beyond academia \( **R3**, **R5**\), stimulating discussion and interweaving artists’ books into wider publishing practices \( **R3**, **R4**, **R6**\).

 Establishing an international community of practice is vital in creating greater understanding of specific, geo\-located artists' books creation. It allows the previously neglected role and value of artists' books to be repositioned within wider art history and presented confidently to the public as cultural, covetable artefacts. Bodman has used her stance as a practitioner\-researcher, making artists’ books herself \( **R5**\), to introduce empathetic and inclusive models which embed artists, librarians, educators and curators into the research investigations. 

 From these, the project findings become the shared product of collaboration with their audiences. This enables knowledge exchange at local and international levels \( **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\), proposing inclusive language and terminology \( **R4**\), identifying connections between disparate practices \( **R3**, **R6**\) and examines how physical books can endure given the challenges of digital technologies \( **R1**, **R2**\).

 Dr Bodman uses her own creative practice to widen audience engagement and understanding internationally, from collaborative making for World Book Night, to her own solo exhibitions: *I Made This for You* \(Italy\) or *Read With Me* \(USA\) and works included in many group exhibitions internationally. She has been a juror for the Minnesota Center for Book Arts’ MCBA Prize \(the largest book arts centre in the world\), *Turn the Page* **Artist’s Book Fair** \(UK\), the Designer Bookbinders UK competition, and has given public talks at Hauser & Wirth Somerset, State Library of Victoria, Melbourne \(Australia\) and FADA Gallery, Johannesburg \(South Africa\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Over the last decade, Dr Bodman's research has been influential in a number of areas: bringing practitioners and collectors who were not aware of each other together; helping to develop a market and appreciation for artists' books; and encouraging more artists to make books. 

 **Expanding the artists’ books community** UWE's research since 2013 has widened artists' engagement and understanding internationally \( **S1**\- **S4**\). 

 This ‘ *has introduced artists from Brazil and Europe to Australia, and from Australia to Europe through exhibitions, articles and public events…with new ways of thinking about the types of artworks made here and abroad’* \( **S5**, **S6**\). 

 Independent curators and publishers in Kirov, Krasnogorsk and St Petersburg feel more connected through using Bodman's research infrastructure as a resource. A *Rukssian* \[sic\] *Artists’ Books* exhibition tour \(2014\-2015\), stimulated understanding and knowledge exchange between 60 artists from Russia and the UK \( **S1**\). They note: 

 **‘** *we have new artists sharing artists' books and knowledge from Norway, Great Britain, Italy, Denmark \(and now India\) who have become regular participants in our exhibitions”* \( **S2**\). One commented that **“** *being included in Dr Bodman’s publications has given me an extensive network of contacts and artists to connect with and I can also promote my work to a wider audience’* \( **S3**\). 

 UWE’s research brought speakers from Australia and Brazil \(where the importance of mail art to Brazilian artists was explored\) to join UK counterparts for public discussions on contemporary artists’ books practice in the two countries. This included over 100 examples of physical artefacts for handling and analysis with the public \( **S5, S6**\). 

 **Contributing to the artist economy** Bodman is co\-founder of the biennial Bristol Artist's Book Event \(BABE\) at Arnolfini Bristol \(established 2007\). The event has evolved into an international showcase for artists' books, with 100 plus exhibitors and a growing public audience \(7,150 visitors in 2015; 9,630 in 2017; 13,000 in 2019\). BABE seeks to create a direct connection between the public and the book arts \( **S7**\). Visitors handle books and meet makers in a friendly environment, with free talks and performances. Artists sell to collectors and the public and meet their peers. An independent exhibitor remarked: 

 ‘*BABE 2019 was the busiest artist’s book fair I have participated in, in the UK, since 2005. It was financially successful and led to me publishing several very successful series of books’* \( **S8**\). 

 UWE’s research has led to greater legitimisation of artists' books, such that it has secured a place for these artforms in a national collection of printed works. The Head of Contemporary British Collections at the British Library stated that it now not only actively collects artists' books but also holds regular events \( *Artists’ Books Now* series\), and exhibits artists’ books. 

 *‘Almost the entire back catalogue of significant artists such as Ken Campbell and Ian Tyson have been acquired in the confidence that there is external benchmarking of their significance…Dr Bodman and the various kinds of active research infrastructure she has established, has had a profound impact on the collecting and dissemination work of the British Library’  \( **S7**\). 

 UWE surgeries give expert advice on making and marketing. One independent artist observed that: 

 *‘The surgery has proved to be a pivotal, and defining moment in my practice as a Book Artist… Dr Bodman's research has resulted in my books being exhibited in national and international group shows, and sales to collections and collectors’* \( **S9**\). 

 **Enriching public understanding of artists’ books** Artists’ books are a recognisable, non\-intimidating means of presenting ideas on a one\-to\-one basis with the viewer/reader. Creating participatory projects such as World Book Night \(WBN\) events extends public understanding of what artists’ books are and how they are made. Margaret Atwood mentioned UWE’s 2016 WBN project *Serena Joy* on social media after receiving the artist’s book made in tribute to her *Handmaid’s Tale* novel. The artefact is now in the collection of Tate Britain. 

 
Figure 3: *Serena Joy* \(collaborative artist’s book for World Book Night 2016, in tribute to the novel *The Handmaid’s Tale* by Margaret Atwood\), and Margaret Atwood’s Tweets about the project. 

 Bodman's WBN event in 2019 saw 47 contributors respond to Under Milk Wood for the Gwalia Gazette which is in 20 national and international collections, including the Yale Center for British Art, USA. In 2020, despite disruption caused by Covid\-19 forcing the WBN to move online, 98 contributors participated; double the number of the previous year \( **S10**\). Over twelve years, Bodman’s curatorial research model has loaned hundreds of artefacts to 85 plus exhibitions, workshops, community classes, schools, libraries, galleries, prisons, clubs and bookshops around the world. This brings audiences into direct contact with these artefacts. For example, a selection of artists’ books loaned for ‘ *Book Lab, Artists’ Books*’, a handling exhibition at Hauser & Wirth Somerset, September 2018 – January 2019. 

 It is not often that visitors to galleries can handle the artworks. Bodman's model has inspired staff at The British Library to establish regular events where artists bring their books and talk about them to the public audience. 

 *‘Only two decades ago the artist’s book was an anomalous artform, not especially welcome within an art collection or a library. Dr Bodman's work has helped change that, making it a worthy 'genre' which we now know explores the nature of the book and the nature of art at the same time’* \( **S7**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 International concern about the cyber threat to nuclear weapons systems has risen sharply in recent years in both political and public spheres. Debate, policy and thinking about this threat have been directed by research conducted by leading nuclear strategy and arms control expert Professor Andrew Futter of the University of Leicester. Futter’s research has: \(i\) influenced legislative thinking; and \(ii\) shaped the public policy debate by challenging established norms, and changing public attitudes toward cyber\-nuclear threats, the Trident debate and the changing nature of the global nuclear threat. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research carried out by Professor Futter at the University of Leicester since 2013 examines the cyber threat posed to nuclear weapons systems. This research, initially funded by a three\-year ESRC Future Research Leaders grant, was the first major academic work to analyse the new challenges and risks posed to the security and safety of nuclear weapons systems in a new cyber era, and to provide the foundation of an operational framework for how these new challenges could be understood and addressed by experts, governments, Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\) and the public. 

 Futter’s research **\[R1, R2\]** exposed the dangerously low levels of understanding about the nature and seriousness of the potential cyber threat to nuclear weapons systems via academics to policy makers, nuclear\-armed governments and international NGOs and the lack of public awareness. 

  

 Thus, a major objective of his work was to produce the first conceptualisation of the cyber challenge, explain what was vulnerable, how, to whom and why, and make sure this was communicated to relevant stakeholders with an interest in the safe and secure management of nuclear weapons. This was achieved through a publication strategy that targeted specific outlets that would reach practitioners and policy makers as well as raising public awareness via mainstream media outlets to inform public opinion. This strategy ensured that awareness and understanding was substantially raised society\-wide, thus driving real\-world change. 

 Three significant findings from the research form the basis of the claimed impact: 

 \(1\) **Nuclear weapons systems are more vulnerable than governments have realised or acknowledged in the past**. Part of the research was motivated by concern that officials across the globe steadfastly said that nuclear weapons systems could not be hacked, because, for example, they were not connected to the Internet. Futter’s research, notably his monograph **\[R1\]** and occasional paper **\[R4\]** showed that some key nuclear weapons systems are not in fact separated from unsecured networks and that, even if they were, systems could still be hacked, particularly while they were being built/maintained or through attacks on operators or the supply chain. The research stimulated a global debate on the implications of this for nuclear strategy, deterrence and arms control. 

 \(2\) Futter argued that the **UK Trident nuclear weapons system is not as invulnerable as conventional wisdom or UK government claim,** and that a recognition of this needed to be part of the public debate over whether the UK should retain or renew this system in the future. Futter was invited by the European Leadership Network \(an independent, non\-partisan, pan\-European network of nearly 300 past, present and future European leaders working to provide practical real\-world solutions to political and security challenges\), to write a policy brief during the Trident renewal debate in 2016 to ensure the issue reached public and policy consciousness and that decisions would be informed by accurate assessment **\[R3\]**. 

 \(3\) Futter’s research found that there are several dangerous new pathways to nuclear use and escalation driven by cyber risks, the new digitised nuclear context, and increased risk of nuclear explosion resulting from a new cyber\-nuclear nexus. Futter’s research identified and highlighted the **implications of the little\-known US defence programme designed to hack into the missile and nuclear systems of its opponents** \[ **R5, R6\]**. **\[R5\]** in particular, emphasises the risk of directing resources to a cyber\-defence programme which not only has to anticipate and disrupt potential nuclear attack from other states whilst ensuring US technology remains sophisticated enough to hack enemy systems, but may pull resource away from developing and maintaining physical defence capability to effectively neutralise missile attacks once launched. In addition to the physical risk of pursuing such a policy, Futter outlines the political dangers, including normalising this as a political tactic and not providing sufficient protection against non\-state aggressors.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research undertaken by Professor Futter at the University of Leicester has had international impact in two main areas: \(i\) influencing legislative thinking; and \(ii\) shaping the public policy debate by directly influencing lobbying groups and media coverage. 

 **Influencing legislative thinking** 

 Futter is a leading authority on nuclear cyber\-threats and has provided evidence to the UK government several times between 2014 and 2018. In 2014, Futter provided written evidence outlining how cyber risks would alter deterrence thinking and escalation pathways, to the House of Commons Defence Committee, “Deterrence in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century” inquiry **\[E1c\]**. Written evidence from Futter in 2015, warning that UK nuclear weapons might be “less credible, useable or efficacious in the years to come” as a result of new cyber risks, was published by the House of Commons Defence Committee’s inquiry “Flexible response? An SDSR checklist of potential threats and vulnerabilities” **\[E1b\].** 

 Futter was commissioned in 2016 to provide his expertise to underpin a section on “Cyber interference with a nuclear weapon”, for the House of Commons Library POSTnote on Nuclear Security **\[E1d\]**, and his work was cited as recommended further reading in a House of Commons Library Briefing Paper on Trident **\[E1e\]**. 

 In 2018, he was invited to give oral evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on International Relations inquiry into “U.K. Foreign Policy in a Shifting World Order”, providing testimony on the cyber risks posed to the UK Trident nuclear weapons system **\[E1a\]**. 

 Briefings delivered by Futter to the UK Cabinet Office and the Top\-Level Group of Parliamentarians for Nuclear Disarmament in 2018, at their request, has significantly shaped the thinking of key decision makers. He has worked closely with former UK Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Desmond Browne to direct parliamentary debate on the cyber threat to UK nuclear weapons. Lord Browne writes that: “ *I have found Andrew Futter’s work significantly influential in my evolving thinking about the dangers which the cyber threat to the command and control of nuclear weapons poses to strategic stability. I know from my conversations with other Parliamentarians that the same can be said for many of them*” **\[E2\]**. 

 Based on his expertise, Futter was invited twice in 2018 to brief the UK Cabinet Office on cyber\-nuclear risks; both briefings have been described by a policy Advisor to the Cabinet Office as “ *a really important contribution to our thinking*” **\[E3\].** Internationally, Futter was invited to brief the U.S. Strategic Command in 2018. As the agency responsible for integrating and coordinating the necessary command and control capability to provide support with the most accurate and timely information for the President, the Secretary of Defense, other national leadership and combatant commanders, including the oversight of the security of US nuclear weapons, this group represents influential stakeholders and details of Futter’s briefing and presentation were shared via the US Strategic Command Academic Alliance newsletter in January 2019 **\[E4\]**. 

 **Shaping the public policy debate** 

 Futter’s work has guided the formulation of positions of lobbying organisations and other stakeholders, as well as starting to shape approaches to the reporting of cyber\-security in the media and engaging with information security professionals. 

 His research has been vital for the Washington D.C. based Nuclear Threat Initiative in their lobbying of the US government on cyber\-nuclear risks \[ **E5a\]**. Futter is a member of the Nuclear Threat Initiative’s Cyber\-Nuclear Weapons Study Group convened in 2017, in order to gather former senior military officials and top nuclear policy and cyber security experts to assess the risks posed to nuclear weapons by cyber threats and to develop policy to reduce those risks. As a ‘leading voice’ on the cyber threat to nuclear weapons systems based on his track record of high\-quality research, Futter is a ‘key member’ member of this Group **\[E5b\]**. The Group published their influential first report ‘Nuclear Weapons in the New Cyber Age’ \[ **E7**\] in 2018 and this has been cited by lobby groups and opinion\-makers such as the Russian International Affairs Council, The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research and Modern Diplomacy **\[E10a\]**. 

 The British American Security Information Council 2017 report ‘Hacking UK Trident: A Growing Threat’ **\[E8\]** gained national press coverage **\[E10b\]** upon its publication and features Futter’s research, particularly **\[R4\]** which is described as “excellent” **\[E8\]**. The 2017 Nobel Peace Prize recipients, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, invited Futter to help them shape their future research agenda and contribute to the development of their 2020 Briefing Paper ‘Emerging technologies and nuclear weapons risks’ **\[E11\]**. 

 Collaborating with professionals working in and reporting on cybersecurity, Futter is now embedding his research within a range of professional approaches. In 2019, Futter underpinned the design and delivery of training to a workshop for leading international journalists on reporting cyber\-nuclear risks. The Executive Director and Founder of Atomic Report, the workshop organisers, stated that Futter’s “ *input was essential in helping this group of journalists understand how best to report and write about contemporary nuclear risks”* **\[E6\]**. Later in 2019, Futter was the invited keynote speaker at the CODE BLUE information security conference in Tokyo engaging with IT security specialists about the real\-world impact of their work **\[E9\]**. 

 Futter is recognised as one of the leading experts on cyber\-nuclear risks globally. His research is impacting and informing practitioners and policy makers and is repeatedly referenced in the national and international press **\[E10c\]**. In 2018 for example, Futter’s research was mentioned throughout the *New Statesman’s* Spotlight \(a series of highly focused policy reports\) Special Issue on Cyber Security **\[E10c\]**. Thus, Futter is directly informing public opinion on cyber\-nuclear threats as well as informing legislative development and professional approaches across military and civilian sectors.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Effective decision\-making by emergency services personnel is vital for their safety and the safety of others. Research co\-produced by Cardiff University and the National Fire Chiefs Council \(NFCC\) developed a ‘decision control’ process for firefighters after identifying that they relied on instinct and experience, contrary to assumptions made within NFCC guidance for Fire and Rescue Services. The research transformed the National Operational Guidance for Incident Command and the doctrine of the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Programme, which directs UK emergency services response, and is now used across the UK Fire and Rescue Services. These changes to the National Operational Guidance also influenced formal evaluation of incident command skills and informed training of the Strategic Co\-ordinating Groups convened for major incidents across the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Ineffective decision\-making in emergency settings has both societal and economic impacts. For example, human error is cited as the cause of most firefighter injuries \(Department for Communities and Local Government, 2013, *Fire and rescue authorities health, safety and welfare framework for the operational environment*\); and recent history is beset by high\-profile cases where the capacity of different agencies \(e.g., emergency services, civil resource organizations, health boards, and local government\) to work together has been suboptimal, resulting in injury and loss of life. To address these issues, Cardiff University and the National Fire Chiefs Council \(NFCC\) co\-produced research on decision\-making in individual firefighters \(specifically incident commanders, who co\-ordinate ‘on scene’ activity at emergency incidents\) at real and simulated incidents involving the UK Fire and Rescue Service \(FRS\). This UK\-wide research is unique in assessing the efficacy of decision controls on decision\-making processes in the emergency services. The research provided unique insights into both individual and group decision\-making in emergency settings: 

 **2.1 Individual decision\-making** 

 The research used live video footage from helmet\-mounted cameras worn by Incident Commanders at real incidents. It was assumed that decisions to act were arrived at through a linear process: assess the situation, evaluate the merit of different courses of action, and then act. However, analysis of the footage revealed marked departures from this linear process, showing that assessment of the situation was most often followed by ‘directives’ to fire crew members to act as opposed to a process of plan formulation. The Cardiff research demonstrated that Incident Commanders relied on intuitive, procedural knowledge based on past experiences with similar incidents, rather than an analytical process of plan formulation for the current incident **\[3.1\]**. This research was awarded the FIRE/Gore Research Excellence Award 2014. 

 The research proceeded by developing processes that would enable Incident Commanders to balance the use of prior knowledge with an evaluation of the current incident through the use of ‘decision controls’: a rapid mental checklist highlighting goals, anticipated consequences, and risks versus benefits **\[3.2\]**. Extensive experimental work was conducted involving: reproducible simulated incidents \(e.g., a house fire\) created using immersive VR; fire ground re\-creations \(at the Fire Service College, Moreton\-in\-Marsh\); and ‘live burns’ of property due for demolition. 

 The research confirmed that Incident Commanders given traditional training showed a bias toward intuitive decision\-making processes. Importantly, use of such intuitive decision\-making was reduced, and analytical processes increased, when commanders implemented the Cardiff decision\-control training. Commanders given decision\-control training had higher levels of situational awareness, undertook more explicit planning and shared goals with colleagues more. Crucially, this training did not slow down decision\-making **\[3.2\]**. This research received awards from the American Psychological Association, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and the Business and Education Partnership Awards \(see Section 3\). 

 Further research enabled the development and implementation of the first nationally endorsed system \(called THINCS: THe INCident Command Skills system\) to evaluate command skills, including intuitive and analytical decision\-making **\[3.3\]**. 

 **2.2 Group decision\-making** 

 Cardiff research also investigated decision\-making in Strategic Coordinating Groups, which consist of senior representatives of the local emergency services, civil resource organizations, health boards, and government. These groups are brought together to develop a unified strategic response when there is a major incident emergency in the UK \(e.g., a terrorist attack or a natural disaster\). The research was based on analysis of footage of the responses of these groups to simulated major incidents at training exercises across Wales in 2015 and 2016, as well as a large\-scale exercise in London funded by the EU \(€1.8M\) and led by the London Fire Brigade. This research demonstrated that contrary to the recommendations of the UK public\-sector standard Joint Decision Model, groups engaged in limited consideration of different options and contingencies: a key component of effective decision\-making. There were also marked between\-group biases in the decision\-making processes across groups who faced the same simulated incidents, with limited identification of alternative courses of action or horizon\-scanning **\[3.4\]**. To date, this is the only detailed in situ analysis of decision\-making in Strategic Coordinating Groups.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research co\-produced by Cardiff University and the National Fire Chiefs Council \(NFCC\) transformed decision\-making guidance, doctrine and training for individuals and multi\-agency groups in emergency settings. 

 **4.1 Individual decision\-making in the UK Fire and Rescue Service** 

 The research was conducted in close collaboration with the NFCC, and it affected Fire and Rescue Services through integration into **a.** policy, **b.** training, **c.** evaluation, and **d.** operational recommendations. 

1.  **Policy** 

 The Cardiff research findings were extensively reported in the 2015 NFCC publication *The Future of Incident Command* **\[5.1**, pp. 12\-22 **\]** and the outcomes of the research had a transformative influence on the *National Operational Guidance for Incident Command* **\[5.2a**, p.19\-26 **\]**. The guidance cites **\[3.1\]** to illustrate the differences between practices assumed by previous UK guidelines and actual UK practices, and the importance of recognising the influence of intuitive and analytical processes in high\-pressure decision\-making situations. It contains a detailed description of **\[3.2\]** designed to support the adoption of the Cardiff decision control process during emergency incidents. This guidance underpins the response and training of frontline personnel within the UK Fire and Rescue Services \(FRS\), and went live across all UK FRSs in January 2016 **\[5.3\]**. 

1.  **Training** 

 After the guidance went live, a survey of incident command training was fully completed by 56% of UK FRSs. This survey confirmed that **100% of FRSs who fully completed the survey provided theoretical command decision\-making training using the new Operational Guidance**; this contrasts with only 52% providing comparable training in resilience, stress, and fatigue management **\[3.3\]**. 

 London Fire Brigade, the busiest FRS with the largest number of full\-time firefighters, did not initially adopt the decision control process from the new Operational Guidance. In its routine inspection of the London Fire Brigade in 2019, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services noted: “The brigade is the only service not to use the national incident command decision control process…This situation needs immediate attention” **\[5.4**, p.19 **\]**. The London FRS subsequently adopted the use of decision controls in 2020, and as such, **all FRSs in the UK now use the decision control process developed by Cardiff**. 

 The decision control process is also included in the NFCC Training Specifications, which underpin UK FRS training for Incident Command to drive consistency **\[5.3\]**. 

1.  **Evaluation** 

 The Incident Command Skills system \(THINCS\) developed by Cardiff **\[3.3\]** is used to evaluate command skills, including intuitive and analytical decision\-making. It was rolled out across the UK FRS in 2019 together with accompanying guidance, training packages, and a tablet\-based app, which enable its use in both training and operational contexts. The 2019 edition of the *National Operational Guidance for Incident Command* expanded the adoption of decision controls by explicitly recommending the THINCS system to evaluate and reinforce their use **\[5.2b\]**. THINCS licenses have been issued to the Fire Service College **\[5.5\]**, which is a commercial training organization for emergency services personnel from the UK and internationally. 

1.  **Operational Recommendations** 

 In addition to these direct impacts of the research on operational guidance, *The Future of Incident Command* also recommends the use of helmet\-mounted video cameras as a tool for supporting training and development **\[5.1**, p.40 **\]**, based on the value of this resource from the research. This recommendation has now been implemented in Hampshire and was also incorporated as part of the approach recommended for the Scottish FRS in 2015 **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.2 Group decision\-making in the extended emergency services** 

 The Cardiff research on decision\-making in Strategic Coordinating Groups also changed guidance on how emergency services work together in high\-pressure situations. The Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Programme \(JESIP\) is a programme of recommendations made to emergency services to improve decision\-making across the services. JESIP is overseen and supported by the Home Office, Department of Health, Department of Communities and Local Government, and the Cabinet Office. It has the full support of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, Association of Chief Police Officers and Chief Fire Officers Association. Decision controls, developed through the Cardiff research **\[3.1\]**, were incorporated into Edition 2 of the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Programme \(JESIP\)’s *Joint Doctrine: The Interoperability Framework*, July 2016 **\[5.7**, pp. 21\-22 **\]**; and in the revised Aide Memoire for Commanders **\[5.8\]**. This doctrine underpins how emergency services work together, particularly in the context of large\-scale or complex emergencies. 

 Through JESIP, the decision control process developed by the Cardiff team has now been adopted more widely across UK emergency services. For example, the NHS England Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response Framework **\[5.9\]** recommends that decision\-makers use the JESIP joint decision model to support high\-pressure decision\-making processes. The Cardiff team also produced summaries and a video overview of the Cardiff research **\[3.4\]** to inform the Wales Gold III training course for all emergency responder agencies in Strategic Coordinating Groups **\[5.10\]**. 

 **4.3 Summary** 

 Cardiff University research with the NFCC changed the guidance doctrines, training and qualifications framework that underpin decision\-making by firefighter Incident Commanders. Every FRS in the UK has now adopted the Cardiff team’s new decision control process designed to support more effective decisions in emergency situations. The decision control process has also been adopted by broader emergency decision\-making groups through the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Programme, changing how NHS, Ambulance Service and multi\-service groups react to emergency incidents across the UK. The Cardiff research and impact is a Case Study in the first UKRI strategy document \( *Strategic Prospectus: Building the UKRI Strategy;* p. 40; 2018\). **\[5.11\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UCL Laws contributed directly to shaping the legal framework for Brexit, triggering action leading to litigation, supporting legal advocacy, and informing landmark UK and EU judicial decision\-making on fundamental constitutional norms at the heart of the Brexit process: 

-  Research by Hickman and King \(with Hickman part of Gina Miller’s legal team\) developed arguments that prevailed in the landmark *Miller I* decision \(Supreme Court, 2017\), which established a critical UK constitutional requirement for Brexit: that the executive could not initiate withdrawal from the EU without an Act of Parliament. 

-  Research by Eeckhout \(later joining the Wightman litigation team\) developed a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of Article 50 TEU on which the Advocate\-General and CJEU relied in the *Wightman* case \(CJEU, 2018\), establishing that a notification of EU withdrawal, once made, could later be unilaterally revoked by the UK. 

 These decisions strengthened the role of the UK Parliament, developed key EU constitutional norms, and clarified the legal and political possibilities that remained open as the UK approached Brexit. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The first stage in implementing the outcome of the UK’s 2016 referendum on membership of the European Union involved triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union \(TEU\), which allows an EU member state to notify the European Council of its intent to leave the union. However, prior to the referendum, there had been little legal analysis of Article 50, and almost none on its relationship to UK constitutional requirements. This, together with the unwritten nature of the UK’s constitution, meant that the referendum outcome presented immediate questions about the understanding of the UK’s parliamentary democracy, including in relation to norms of EU constitutional law. 

 Since joining UCL, Professor Eeckhout \(Professor of EU Law at UCL, 2012–present\), Professor King \(Professor of Law at UCL, 2011–present\) and Dr Hickman QC \(Reader, now Professor at UCL, 2012–present\) have undertaken research into EU and UK constitutional law, and the relationship between the two. With the prospect of Brexit, this research was developed further to address the urgent and novel legal questions raised by the referendum outcome and, in particular, to clarify the process by which the UK could notify the EU of its intention to withdraw from the EU \(King and Hickman\), and the revocability of that notification \(Eeckhout\). 

 Hickman is an established authority on the historical development of prerogative power **\(R1\)**, and the relation of prerogative to statute, a matter which was directly at issue in the *Miller I* case. King had worked extensively on the role of judicial review and its intersection with democratic legitimacy. His award\-winning monograph, *Judging Social Rights*, had considered when democratic legitimacy does and does not justify judicial deference to Government **\(R2\)**. This analysis directly supported the legally significant proposition in the *Miller I* case that, when interpreting the object and purpose of the European Communities Act 1972, the courts should treat the outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum as legally irrelevant to the meaning of the 1972 statute. 

 In an article for the UK Constitutional Law Blog **\(R3\)** published on 27 June 2016, three days after the referendum result, Hickman and King, along with Nick Barber \(Oxford\), argued that notification under Article 50 required authorisation by an Act of Parliament, because withdrawing from the EU would frustrate the operation of the European Communities Act 1972. Whilst the 1972 Act did not overtly commit the UK to EU membership, its general purpose was to make provision for the UK to join the EU, and it did so by conferring enforceable EU law rights on citizens in the UK. By giving notice to the EU, those rights would be extinguished by an act of the Prime Minister rather than of Parliament. King and Hickman developed an argument based on previous authority in a different context \(principally the *Fire Brigades Union Case* \[1995\] UKHL 3\) that prerogative power could not be used in a way that would render the Act redundant. The argument also appealed to more general principles of our constitutional democracy, since notification would activate a two\-year timetable and affect fundamentally the dynamics of withdrawal negotiations. The argument was entirely novel and exceptionally controversial, attracting intense academic and press discussion. 

 In parallel, Eeckhout was exploring whether an Article 50 declaration, once made, could be revoked by the UK unilaterally, without the agreement of other Member States of the EU. Eeckhout’s research on EU constitutional law and its relationship with Member States’ public law underpinned a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of Article 50 **\(R4\)** \(co\-authored with UCL PhD student Frantziou, now University of Durham\). This article rejected a reading of Article 50 in purely ‘internationalist’ terms, as involving a process between two governments alone, and instead developed a ‘constitutionalist’ reading which understood the withdrawal process in light of EU constitutional law, comprising respect for national constitutional requirements as well as EU values, such as democracy and the rule of law. This gave substantive import to Article 50’s reference to a Member State’s ‘ *decision to withdraw* *in accordance with its own constitutional requirements*’ and entailed that, should the UK make a new decision *against* withdrawal within the two\-year window, in good faith and in accordance with its constitutional requirements, the prior notification of intention to withdraw must be unilaterally revocable by the UK.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2016, questions about how the UK Government would implement the referendum result were of enormous democratic and strategic importance, given the narrowness of the Leave majority \(52%\), and the fact that formal notification under Article 50 of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw would initiate a two\-year window for negotiation of arrangements fundamental to the UK’s future political and economic life. The significance of these questions about the Article 50 mechanism was reflected in the opening minutes of the Lords’ post\-result debate, as Baroness Smith of Basildon, spokesperson for the Opposition, asked, ‘ *How is the trigger for Article 50 authorised? … Why would such a fundamental decision not be a matter for Parliament?*’. Baroness Smith noted that there were divisions of opinion over revocability of the notification and concluded, ‘ *surely the Government must clarify exactly how this works before embarking on the journey*’ **\(S1\)**. 

 Eeckhout, Hickman and King did precisely this. By developing novel arguments which informed legal debate, advocacy and judicial decisions, UCL Laws researchers shaped the two landmark cases that mapped the political journey ahead: what UK constitutional law required in order to trigger Article 50 \(in particular, whether parliamentary approval was required\), and whether notification could be revoked if there was a change of heart \(a hope which endured through much of the 2\-year plus negotiation period amongst the 48% of people who had voted to remain\). 

 **Shaping landmark judgments on the legal framework for Brexit decision\-making** 

 **Miller v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU** \[2017\] UKSC 5 \(‘ **Miller I**’\)** 

 The 2016 Barber/Hickman/King blog post set the legal stage for the ground\-breaking *Miller I* judgment. The novelty and ramifications of the arguments in the blog post **\(R3\)** attracted significant attention, being viewed some 220,000 times \(to January 2017\), and causing visits to the blog to multiply roughly five\-fold that month relative to previous monthly averages **\(S2\)**. It attracted some 550 comments, many from leading academics and practitioners, as well as over 100 further submissions to the blog on these themes in the months following publication. The blog post featured prominently in Parliamentary committee proceedings: the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution cited the post as the first reference in its survey of arguments that the Government was unable to invoke Article 50 without an Act of Parliament, and submissions to an inquiry of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament similarly cited the post as the leading argument for the view that Parliament had a role in triggering Article 50 **\(S3\)**. An edited version of the post was reproduced in *Counsel* \(journal of the Bar of England and Wales\), and the post and its authors were quoted widely in the press \( *Financial Times*; *Guardian*; *Independent*; *New York Times*\) **\(S4\)**. 

 A legal challenge to the ability of the Government to notify its intention to withdraw from the EU using its prerogative power had been initiated prior to the blog’s publication, but was advancing arguments different from those in the blog post. On 30 June 2016, a few days after the blog post, Lord David Pannick QC was persuaded by the argument in the post and endorsed it in his *Times* column: ‘ *as Barber, Hickman and King point out, the courts have stated a legal principle that the prerogative may only be used where the subject matter is not already addressed by an act of parliament so that exercise of the prerogative would frustrate what parliament has itself decided. Here, our membership of the EU, and its impact on domestic law, has been approved by parliament in the 1972 act. A notification under Article 50 would start the process by which that legislation would become a dead letter. … Therefore parliamentary approval is required for the Article 50 notification.*’ **\(S5\)**. Hickman was then retained \(together with Lord Pannick QC\) as counsel to supplement Gina Miller’s existing legal team. The arguments developed in the Barber/Hickman/King blog post became central to submissions made in the UK Supreme Court by Miller’s team \(which also cited subsequent blog posts by King maintaining engagement with the fundamental arguments\) **\(S6\)**. 

 On 24 January 2017, the Supreme Court held that the UK Government could not initiate withdrawal from the EU without an Act of Parliament, on the basis of arguments initially suggested in the blog post. Lord Carnwath \(albeit in dissent on the substance\), recognised the contribution of Hickman and King’s research and ensuing discussion, noting that ‘ *the very full debate in the courts has been supplemented by a vigorous and illuminating academic debate conducted on the web \(particularly through the UK Constitutional Law Blog site\)*’ **\(S7\)**. The seminal role of the post by Hickman and King \(with Barber\) in developing the argument that succeeded in *Miller I* has been publicly recognised by both Pannick, lead counsel for Miller \(noting that ‘ *the core of their argument … was upheld by the Supreme Court seven months later*’\), and other leading scholars, including Professor Mark Elliott \(Cambridge\), Professor Kenneth Armstrong \(Cambridge\) and Professor Gavin Williamson \(Bristol\) **\(S8\)**. 

 **Wightman v Secretary of State for Exiting the EU** \(C\-621/18\)** 

 *Miller I* did not address the question of whether an Article 50 notification could be revoked by the UK without the agreement of the remaining 27 EU Member States. Indeed, the parties had assumed the notification was *not* unilaterally revocable in this way. The point was of real importance: if a notice *was* unilaterally revocable by the UK, there remained a prospect of the UK revisiting, with more information, the decision to leave the EU. The revocability issue was taken up in litigation in December 2017, by a cross\-party group of MSPs. The question was referred rapidly to the Court of Justice for the European Union. Upon being instructed as counsel for Wightman, Maya Lester QC requested Eeckhout’s article **\(R4\)**, and Eeckhout was invited to serve as academic consultant to the Wightman counsel. 

 The European Council and Commission believed that revocation of the UK notification required the unanimous consent of the European Council: once notification of intention to withdraw had been given, the ensuing negotiation period was a multilateral one, no longer susceptible to unilateral changes of heart. Advocate General Campos Sánchez\-Bordona \(providing an advisory opinion to the bench on points of law\) argued the opposite, citing Eeckhout’s work **\(R4\)** with reference to the importance of ‘ *national constitutional mechanisms*’, as referred to in Article 50: where an application of national constitutional mechanisms undermines the decision to withdraw, then ‘ *the second phase of the procedure* \[the two\-year negotiation period\] *must also be affected, since the premiss upon which it is based has fallen away. As there is no longer a constitutional basis for the withdrawal, the State must communicate to the European Council that it thereby revokes its previous notification*’ **\(S9\)**. 

 On 10 December 2018, the CJEU agreed, deciding that a member state could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notification during the two\-year negotiation period, adopting arguments in **R4**: 

 ‘*the sovereign nature of the right of withdrawal enshrined in Article 50\(1\) TEU supports the conclusion that the Member State concerned has a right to revoke the notification of its intention to withdraw* \[until a withdrawal agreement has entered into force or until the two\-year negotiation period, as extended, has not expired\] *. … It is also appropriate to underline the importance of the values of liberty and democracy* \[which\] *form part of the very foundations of the European Union legal order … since citizenship of the Union is intended to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States … any withdrawal … is liable to have a considerable impact on the rights of all Union citizens … In those circumstances, given that a State cannot be forced to accede to the European Union against its will, neither can it be forced to withdraw from the European Union against its will* \[as would be the case if a notification of withdrawal could not be withdrawn without the agreement of the other 27 EU Member States\]’ **\(S10\)**. 

 Co\-counsel for the applicants in *Wightman* has testified that **R4** was ‘ *vastly influential in the litigation*’ and ‘ *formed the central plank of the Court’s reasoning*’. This influence is also acknowledged by academics; Professor Dagmar Schiek, for example, writes that ‘ *\[t\]he Court … followed the ‘Constitutionalisation’ idea submitted by Eeckhout and Frantziou, coupled with a strong emphasis on the autonomy of the Union legal order*’ **\(S11\)** *.* This jurisprudence decided a critical point of EU law, of real importance in the sequence of Brexit decision\-making, but also of wider applicability in the European legal order. 

 **Empowering the UK parliament** 

 Together, these cases preserved important possibilities for UK parliamentary and public engagement on the terms of Brexit. *Miller I* meant that Parliament’s consent was required to trigger Article 50. The fact that a Bill had to be presented to Parliament in turn gave MPs an opportunity to pressure the Government and to shape the Brexit process. The European Union \(Notification of Withdrawal\) Act 2017 was passed, enabling notice to be given on 29 March 2017, but the Government undertook to give Parliament a meaningful vote on draft texts of the ultimate withdrawal agreement and agreement on future UK–EU relations. Parliament’s role in the withdrawal process was thus asserted, creating new avenues for legislative engagement on the timing and terms of Brexit. As Ken Clarke MP observed, ‘ *The process started with the extraordinary suggestion that the royal prerogative would be invoked, that treaty making was not going to involve Parliament at all, and that leaving did not require parliamentary consent. Rather astonishingly, that matter had to be taken to court, and it came to a fairly predictable conclusion*’. While Clarke was wrong to think the conclusion was predictable—it was hotly disputed among constitutional lawyers and one from which three Supreme Court judges dissented—his estimation of the political significance of the case is entirely accurate. As Chris Leslie MP had observed earlier, ‘ *\[i\]t took the Supreme Court to remind us that we live in a parliamentary democracy*’ **\(S12\)**. 

 The CJEU’s decision in *Wightman* was announced on 10 December 2018, days before MPs were to vote on then\-Prime Minister May’s withdrawal agreement. It gave MPs legal confirmation that the option to remain subsisted, ensuring that a deeply divisive debate about the political future of the UK was not foreclosed by May’s agreement: the choices were not simply May’s proposed agreement, or no agreement. Parliament retained a role in shaping the detailed and complex political steps to follow. The holding in *Miller I* that Article 50 could not be triggered by prerogative power alone led the Speaker to rule that bills requiring the Government to extend the Article 50 process did not restrict the prerogative, and thus did not require Government consent. Consequently, the Government was unable to block the Cooper\-Letwin Bill \(EU \(Withdrawal\) Act No. 1 2019\), providing for extension to the negotiation period from April 2019 to October 2019; nor the Benn\-Burke Bill \(EU \(Withdrawal No. 2\) Act 2019\), requiring the prime minister to seek an extension to Brexit beyond 31 October 2019 in the event that no deal was agreed by then. 

 In sum, the *Miller I* and *Wightman* decisions ensured Parliament’s role in what has proved a fundamentally important, and deeply controversial, phase in Britain’s political history.

 Pinsky has revolutionised how information about air pollution and toxicity can be disseminated, in a non\-toxic and accessible manner. His *Pollution Pods* art installation has toured internationally and helped visitors, including policy makers and UN delegates, grasp the global implications of declining air quality for health and wellbeing. The effect of his installation differs from other educational methods by stimulating multiple senses directly and invoking emotional rather than purely intellectual responses.

Throughout his research, Pinsky uses his art pieces to bring awareness of climate change to the general public, promoting positive behaviour change and supporting education. Pieces such as *Plunge* **\(R1a, b\)** or *In Transit* **\(R2\)  visualise encroaching climate issues; rising sea levels and non\-fiscal costs of transport modes respectively. *Pollution Pods* **\(R3\)** builds on his experience with climate activism art and collaborative studies to create an art piece optimised for climate psychology and advocating for behaviour change in his audience. 

 The *Pollution Pods* were commissioned by and developed with The Norwegian University of Science and Technology \(NTNU\) as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of environmental psychology, visual art and communication around climate concerns. Based on findings from Phase 1 of the project, which collected data on the mechanisms prior artwork employed to illicit changes in emotion and opinion **\(R4\)**, Pinsky was challenged with designing an art piece which aligned with the principles set forth by the study: 



-  *Exposure to immersive activism art increased intentions to engage in actions to address pollution and climate change;* 

-  *Sadness, helplessness and anger were strongest emotions impacting intentions to act;* 

-  Figure 3. Model of relationship between climate psychology and art 

*Ascription of responsibility was strongest cognition impacting intentions to act.* **\(R5\)** 

 Pinsky decided to recreate the pollution in five chosen locations representing the least toxic to the most toxic in air quality: Tautra, Norway; London, United Kingdom; San Paolo, Brazil; Beijing, China and New Dehli, India. These locations were chosen to represent how air pollution presents significant risk to the health of local and adjacent populations and to demonstrate the unique circumstances facing the Global South as they wrestle with the causes and consequences of toxic air. The domes are interconnected to illustrate that air pollution is a global problem. 

 When initial recreations proved too toxic for visitors even for short exposure durations, Pinsky reached out to International Flavours and Fragrances \(IFF\) to mix unique cocktails of perfumes, produced by perfumers from the chosen locales. The final concoctions emulated the locations relative presence of ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide within the interconnected pods solely through smell. By combining the perfumes with heaters, humidifiers and misters Pinsky was able to simulate the atmospheres of the locations. The pods evoke a physical and psychological reaction, but the atmospheres are non\-toxic. 

 The materials and design were chosen to avoid contributing to air pollution. Light\-weight reclaimed Norwegian pine forms the frame of the domes and the construction of the tessellated shapes is simple for local staff to construct while the exhibition is touring, ensuring that the pods can reach as many places/people as possible and reducing the installations as well as visitors’ carbon footprint. **\(R6\)**

In April 2019, as Pinsky was installing *Pollution Pods* in Vancouver, Canada commissioned as part of the annual TED conference, the Mayor of London announced that 2 million Londoners – including 400,000 children – were living in areas exceeding legal air pollutant metrics **\(S1\).** The global health implications of air pollution continue to require urgent and drastic action from individuals and governments. 

 In surveys of audiences after they experienced *Pollution Pods,* many participants reported an “ *awareness of the environmental consequences of their action, their willingness to take responsibility for their consequences,* and *belief in the relevance of environmental problems for daily life.*” **\(S2\)**

Pinsky’s *Pollution Pods* succeed in provoking the emotions and cognitions which are most likely to incite positive behavioural change in audiences and, in turn, the global atmosphere. The effectiveness of Pinsky’s approach was recognised in the 2019 textbook *Public/community health and nursing practice: caring for populations* as an aid to help nursing students comprehend the dangers of public health hazards like toxic air and convey them to patients **\(S3\).** 

 Figure 5. Pollution Pods exhibit at TED 

*Pollution Pods* pairs well with educational events such as the King’s College seminar series which was funded by the Medical Research Council **\(S4\)** and the events surrounding the UN Youth Climate Summit New York City, 2019. Pinsky continues to be involved with TED Talks, exhibiting at the annual 2019 conference and delivering a talk at TEDx Freiburg. **\(S5\)** 

 **2. Global Collaboration for Global Problems** 

 As illustrated by the inter\-connected pods, Pinsky emphasises the need for global participation in solutions to climate change. From the inception of the project, Pinsky worked closely with international institutions and corporations: NTNU, IFF, AirLabs, Hubs and the Norwegian Institute for Clean Air. In particular, his commission for IFF and their perfumers brought new opportunity for expert perfumers from those areas to showcase their craft and to participate in political art. 

 Pinsky’s commitment to promoting international responsibility for air pollution has translated into a relevance which extends beyond language barriers, demonstrated by international coverage in English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Italian, Luxembourgish, Portuguese, Japanese, Swiss, Czech, Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Indonesian. The sustained, global interest in *Pollution Pods* results in sustained interest in air pollution and access to commentary about the project is crucial to reaching people who will not have the opportunity to view the pods in person. 

 Since the initial exhibition in Norway, *Pollution Pods* has toured to eight different countries and over 30,000 visitors have experienced the sensations of the pods **\(S6\).** In each new location, the installation attracts media coverage and engagement. **\(S7a, b, c, d, e\)**

*Pollution Pods* has also reached prominent health and climate activist spokespeople, such as Greta Thunberg and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus **,** Director\-General of WHO. Between those two figures alone, 6.3 million Twitter followers were engaged specifically with the challenges and consequences of air pollution in the context of wider climate and health concerns. *Pollution Pods* even featured on an episode of Daily Planet, a scientific news show aired on and produced by Discovery Channel Canada. 

 **3. Engagement with policy makers** 

 Figure 9. The pods in Madrid 

*Pollution Pods* was exhibited December 2019 in Madrid, Spain concurrent to the COP25 UN Climate Change Conference.  It was officially endorsed and opened by Minister for the Ecological Transition Spain Teresa Ribera, WHO Director Dr Maria Neira, and the Deputy\-Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Ovais Sarmad. **\(S8\)** 

 During this time, the pods hosted members of the public and delegates from the conference. *Pollution Pods* was especially topical to the delegates, as the conference discussed the parameters of the 2015 Paris Agreement and emission targets. 

 The pods were exhibited as part of Manchester’s 2019 Clean Air Week, a collaborative project between local councils, charities and communities to help reduce air pollution in Greater Manchester and alert the public to health hazards. **\(S9\)** 

 **4. Moving forward** 

 As a result of the positive reception and success of *Pollution Pods,* Pinsky is now working with Professor Stephen Holgate, Medical Research Council Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology, to create a response to the dangers of indoor pollution through olfactory art. **\(S10\)**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Computational Mechanics and Reliability Group \(CMRG\) at University of Greenwich develops state\-of\-the\-art numerical models to estimate when and how innovative, high\-reliability, and high\-value electronics systems will fail. The work's impacts relate to economic impacts \(£30,000,000\) for electronics companies in the aerospace sector, such as Leonardo and Micross, through better\-printed circuit board assembly designs that meet these high value\-added electronic systems' reliability requirements. Our work has also led Microsemi to adopt 3D printing in their electronics manufacturing processes, reducing costs and time to market by 10%, and reducing material wastage by 2\-3%. Additionally, we have extended our knowledge through the IEEE \(the world’s largest technology professional society\), impacting the development of new standards and influencing a technology roadmap for practitioners in the worldwide electronics sector.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research activity at the University of Greenwich in Electronics Packaging, led by **Professor Chris Bailey**, began in 1998. Electronics packaging involves selecting components \(semiconductors, bare printed circuit boards, etc.\), materials, and assembly processes to manufacture assembled printed circuit boards and then to test these boards and then assemble these boards into electronics systems that range from mobile phones to avionics radar systems. A key challenge for the electronics industry is to ensure that the design of these assembled printed circuit boards meet end\-user requirements in terms of their reliability for different market applications. 

 Since 2000, CMRG has focused its research activities on developing modelling and simulation techniques to support Design for Reliability \(DfR\) by predicting the mechanical behaviour in these electronic assemblies when subjected to changes in temperature during pre\-board assembly, board assembly, reliability testing, and when in\-service as an electronic system \(in a mobile phone, aircraft, etc.\). The research methodologies are based on finite element methods using high\-performance computing \(HPC\) to predict the physics taking place across the four stages of product development as detailed in the figure below. The developed modelling techniques provide the ability to support DfR and predict the magnitudes of changes in temperature, stress, damage \(cracks, etc\) in all the materials, making up an assembled printed circuit board from the pre\-board assembly to the final electronic system. 



 Our early research \(2000\-2004\) was supported by three EPSRC projects in collaboration with BAE Systems, Rolls Royce, Celestica Ltd, Multicore solders, MBDA, Alpha Metals, and DEK. This research undertaken by CMRG developed the first multi\-physics models to predict the changes in temperature, stress, and damage during the reflow process and subsequent reliability testing of Flip\-Chip electronic components \[ **3.1**\]. From 2004\-2019, CMRG has extended its modelling expertise to other electronic components, including Ball Grid Arrays \(BGA\) and Quad Flat No\-Leads \(QFN\); refinishing processes \(e.g. hot\-solder dip, and laser deballing/re\-balling\); novel board assembly processes such as 3D Printing; reliability test environments \(aerospace\); and health monitoring \(prognostics\) of electronic systems. 

 In 2004, CMRG started its long\-term collaboration with Leonardo \(ex BAe Systems Avionics\). Using component, materials, and thermal profiles \(test and in\-service\) data from Leonardo, CMRG extended its flip\-chip models to predict the thermo\-mechanical behaviour of BGA components. These newly developed models predict the thermally induced fatigue \(and associated cracks\) in the solder joints when the assembled BGA component is subjected to these thermal profiles. The models confirmed that the location of failure predicted in a reliability test would be the same as that seen when the electronic assembly is used in an aircraft environment. As with the flip\-chip components, our models also identified printed circuit board \(PCB\) and underfill material properties to ensure the assembled PCB meets the aerospace reliability requirements for 25 years of life within an aircraft environment \[ **3.2**\]. 

 From 2004\-2019, funded by EPSRC, DTI, EU, US Govt, and consultancy projects with Industry, CMRG extended its modelling capabilities to predict the reliability of many other electronic component constructions and assembled PCB’s. For the aerospace sector, the research challenge is to use low\-cost commercial electronic components. From 2011\-2019, CMRG collaborated with industry partners including Leonardo, Rolls Royce, Micross Semiconductors, Cassidian \(Germany\), and General Dynamics \(USA\). Using manufacturing process data provided by Micross Semiconductors and Leonardo's component data, our first project developed the first thermo\-mechanical finite element model of the pre\-board assembly hot\-solder dip refinishing process. The developed models' results demonstrated that the electronic components' exposure to the temperatures induced by the refinishing process would not result in damage to the component \[ **3.3**\]. 

 From 2014\-19, we extended our modelling capability to complex electronic component constructions such as QFN’s and Micro\-BGA’s. Using materials data and component construction data from Leonardo, these models predicted the physics that govern the fatigue damage of the assembled PCB’s that these components are mounted to during reliability testing. Key findings include the thermo\-mechanical effect that materials such as conformal coatings have on these PCB assemblies' reliability and identified specific material properties that would ensure that the aerospace reliability specifications are met \[ **3.4**\]. 

 The benefits of 3D printing for the electronics industry is its ability to design, manufacture, and assemble complex and unique printed circuit board designs with complex shapes and non\-planar geometry at low cost and much less material wastage compared to traditional reflow assembly. Funded by the EU \(from 2013\-2017\), and in collaboration with industry partners such as Microsemi, who provided materials and component data, we extended our board assembly modelling techniques to predict the thermo\-mechanical behaviour of conductive and non\-conductive materials printed using a 3D printing process. Key findings included the developed models' ability to predict the residual stresses during the printing process and identify suitable material properties and printing process parameters that ensured the fabricated printed circuit boards meet the reliability requirements for the relevant electronic system \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 CMRG has been developing DfR modelling techniques since early 2000’s. Our research has been widely disseminated, with over 400 academic publications on the topic. However, our primary means to transition the knowledge developed through to direct industrial impact is through our partnerships with many international major electronics companies. Industrial partners adopting our DfR technologies can develop electronics systems with improved reliability and reduced in\-service failures. Product failures have costs, both fiscal and reputational. For example, the costs of each reliability test \(which can run over a period of 6 months\) is in\-excess of £100,000 and the cost of a product failure in the field can run into £M’s. 

 **Implementation of UoG research at Leonardo has led to financial impacts.** Leonardo Spa, based in Edinburgh, employs 2,000 people and specialises in the provision of multi surveillance radars and countermeasures systems. It produces world\-leading technology, including Captor Radar for the Typhoon aircraft. The ability to develop and manufacture this equipment on\-shore is of strategic importance to the UK, allowing the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\) to operate without other nation\-states' intervention and maintain an operational advantage over potential adversaries. 

 The transfer of knowledge between the CMRG and Leonardo occurred through direct consultancy in 2004\-2005 and 2018\-2019, and through collaboration on US Government funded projects throughout 2011\-2018. As per the contracts, CMRG provided quarterly reports to the funder and Leonardo, and meetings took place at the company premises to discuss the results from the models. CMRG model predictions for different components \[ **3.2 & 3.4**\] were successfully implemented into radar signal processors, where each processor has a value of the order of £600,000 and the Radar itself has a value of the order of £3,000,000. From 2014 – 31<sup>st</sup> July, 2020, the results from the models developed by CMRG has informed Leonardo’s design protocols and manufacturing standards, and this has removed greater than £30,000,000 of design and qualification risks by ensuring the right materials and assembly processes are used, hence significantly reducing the number of reliability tests **.** The distinct and material contributions made by CMRG to the impacts listed above are confirmed by the University & Emerging Technologies Manager at Leonardo, who states “ *the results and knowledge generated from your research has been extremely successful in informing Leonardo’s design protocols and manufacturing standards, providing significant benefits to us, our suppliers, and customers globally including our major contracts with Governments in the UK, Italy, Spain, and Germany,*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **Research by UoG academics helped Micross and Leonardo gain greater insight into refinishing process and secure significant annual growth in this service**. Micross Semiconductors is a US company whose refinishing process is used by the high\-reliability electronics sector \(including Leonardo\). From 2011\-2014, CMRG worked closely with Micross and Leonardo on a US Government funded project to develop models of the hot\-solder dip refinishing process \[ **3.3**\]. Knowledge transfer between CMRG and these companies took place through quarterly reports and meetings at the Crew, UK, Micross facility. The results from the models of 23 electronic component types supported Micross and its customer Leonardo in gaining a greater insight into the thermo\-mechanical behaviour of the components when subjected to this refinishing process, providing more guidance than found in the current GEIA\-STD\-005\-2 standard. The results helped Micross secure significant growth in this service throughout the period 2014 \- July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020. For example, the University & Emerging Technologies Manager at Leonardo states “ *computational models developed by your team for the Hot Solder Dipping process – a service provided by Micross Semiconductors – helped Leonardo successfully assess the behaviour of our electronic components when subjected to this refinishing process”* \[ **5.1**\] and the Product Line Manager at Micross states “ *the modelling work undertaken at Greenwich* *has helped us gain a clear insight into to the refinishing process supporting us to deliver product of the highest standard to our worldwide customer base,“* \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **UoG research fed into Microsemi’s assessment of 3D\-Printing for electronics packaging resulting in reductions in material wastage and cost saving benefits.** Microsemi \(now Microchip\) is a US company with facilities worldwide, including its Advanced Electronic Packaging facility in Caldicot, Wales, UK, which offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and electronic systems solutions for communications, defence and security, aerospace, and industrial markets. During the period 2013\-2017, CMRG collaborated with MicroSemi on the EU\-Funded project NextFactory. The models developed by CMRG for the 3D\-Printing process during this project provided significant insights into the feasibility of MicroSemi adopting this process and addressing the key technical barrier of residual stresses in the fabricated parts. Based on the results from the NextFactory project \(including the modelling undertaken by CMRG \[ **3.5**\]\), in 2019, Microsemi purchased a 3D printer to support its strategy in driving the next generation of 3D electronics systems miniaturization. During the period to 31<sup>st</sup> July, 2020, this led to a 2\-3% reduction in material wastage compared to traditional reflow\-based board assembly processes and a decrease in time to market and cost savings of 10%. The ability to design genuinely 3D print printed electronic products has also opened\-up new product lines for the company \[ **5.3**\]. Technical staff engineer at Microchip states, “ *the results from your models have supported our assessment of this manufacturing process and in Summer 2019 the company purchased a 3D printer to supplement our existing stencil printers. This printer is now used with our design and manufacturing departments for prototype evaluation and tooling for several high\-value export products to North America and Europe”.* 

 **UoG’s work into modelling and simulation made significant contributions to IEEE Standards and Roadmapping.** The IEEE is the world’s largest professional body with over 420,000 members globally. Most of the world’s major electronics companies are members of IEEE. As part of its relationship with IEEE and the high\-quality work in modelling and simulation produced over the years, CMRG was invited to participate in the development of the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap \(HIR\) in 2016 \[ **5.4**\]. The HIR roadmap provides state\-of\-the\-art / best practice in Electronics Packaging and its drive to produce the next generation of 3D heterogeneous electronic systems. It contains the chapter Modelling & Simulation, which is led by CMRG. This involved **Professor Bailey** chairing the Technical Working Group for this chapter bringing together experts in modelling and simulation worldwide to contribute to the chapter’s contents, which contains material from CMRG – particularly our research into multi\-physics modelling and design for reliability. From 2019\-July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2020, the HIR roadmap has been downloaded 24,197 times by engineers at electronics companies and research organisations globally. This is confirmed by the IEEE \[ **5.5**\] and the roadmap’s manager and the Chief Scientific Advisor of ASE group, the world’s largest semiconductor assembly & test company states: “ *The modelling & simulation research undertaken by the Greenwich team provided significant contributions to the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap. This roadmap is now guiding the worldwide electronics industry to progress beyond 56\-years of ‘Moore’s Law’ \(transistor and economics scaling\) through innovations in advanced electronics packaging and heterogeneous integration”.* \[ **5.4**\]. 

 From 2012\-2017, **Professor Bailey** also contributed to the IEEE Standard P1856 \(Standard Framework for Prognostics and Health Management of Electronic Systems\) as part of its development working group. This standard provides the electronics industry with best practice guidance on the use of techniques \(including modelling and simulation\) for prognostics in electronic systems. The standard and the roadmap are both conduits to transition the group’s DfR expertise into improvements in the reliability of products of a great many companies globally. The manager of the standard confirms: “ *The research undertaken by the Greenwich team contributed to this important standard for the electronics industry to address the latest techniques in Prognostics and Health Management for electronics systems across the electronics ecosystem from consumer electronics to renewable energy to medical devices to aerospace”* \[ **5.6**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research outlined in this study has had a major impact on the resourcing and policing of farms, farm businesses, rural communities and individuals within the Dyfed\-Powys Police \(DPP\) area. Lack of police visibility, resources and limited Welsh medium provision had led to feelings of isolation and vulnerability in these communities. The research was commissioned by Dyfed\-Powys Police, recommendations made on resources and strategies were implemented through the Rural Crime Strategy 2017\-2021 which changed processes and services as a result. Key outcomes are seen as improved trust, communication and relationships between communities and the police.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Morris and Norris since 2013 has examined the use of internet\-based technologies in rural communities, and assessed the impact of these technologies on reducing criminal activity in rural environments \[3.1; 3.2; 3.3\]. This research found that rural crime is linked to in\-group/out\-group tendencies and shows an elevated concern over offenders travelling into rural areas to commit crime. Furthermore, that technologies such as social media can impact on the way in which local communities and police forces can work together to prevent and reduce criminal activity. 

 Establishing accurate estimates of the amount and cost of crime perpetrated in rural areas is complex. This is primarily due to the diverse nature and geographies of rural businesses and is further confounded by limitations in police reporting systems. Nevertheless, wider classifications of rural crime estimate the cost to rural communities in the UK at GBP40,000,000 p.a. These figures, however, are skewed towards insurable losses and do not include the full and wider impact of rural and environmental crime where the impact and effect on the community is considered to be significantly more. 

 In 2017, the Dyfed\-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner \(DPP\-PCC\) made a key policy commitment towards developing evidence\-based policing and working with rural communities to reduce crime \[5.1\].  Research was subsequently commissioned by Dyfed\-Powys Police \(DPP\) and awarded to Morris and Norris. DPP funded a community survey across the force’s area which aimed to analyse the perceptions of rural communities to the way in which the Police deal with crime prevention and criminal investigations \[3.7\]. The survey examined issues surrounding trust between the Police and rural communities \[3.4\], and how the Police resource and respond to rural crime. 

 The findings were disseminated to over 60 delegates at a DPP research symposium on 6 October 2017, with the final report submitted to DPP in December 2017 \[3.5\]. The report recommended significant changes to both the resourcing and policing strategies of DPP and included the establishment and use of specialist rural crime teams, increasing both human and technical resources in the prevention and investigation of crimes, and specifying the type and use of various technologies to deal with and prevent crime. All the recommendations from the report were incorporated into the DPP Rural Crime Strategy 2017\-2021. 

 Following the initial survey, a second Rural Crime Survey was commissioned and funded by DPP \[3.8\] and completed in mid\-2019. This assessed the changes in police resourcing that had taken place following the implementation of the Rural Crime Strategy in 2017. The findings of this second study were presented to the DPP and the DPP\-PCC; and were subsequently presented at a DPP Rural Crime Conference on 6 March 2020 where they were also disseminated to over 100 delegates including PCCs from other Welsh Forces, farming unions and local councillors. The 2019 Rural Crime Survey and Report \[3.6\] is being used by DPP to inform the development of its next Rural Crime Strategy and, DPP has requested Morris and Norris to undertake a third Rural Crime Survey in 2021.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Morris and Norris’ research informed the Dyfed\-Powys Police \(DPP\) Rural Crime Strategy 2017\-2021, which implemented changes to the resourcing and policing strategies of DPP. The research demonstrates impact in three key ways: 

 **Informing the policing of rural crime** 

 The research proposed the development and implementation of specialist Rural Crime Teams \(RCTs\) and the need for increasing human and technical resources \(including specific technologies, such as using Facebook and Twitter\). Proposals which were subsequently incorporated into DPP’s Rural Crime Strategy \(2017\-2021\) \[5.1\]. The Police Crime Commissioner \(PCC\) reports: *\`The results informed the development of a Rural Crime Strategy specifically tailored to our rural communities, and greatly assisted in the development of strategies to meet the unique demands of these communities’* \[5.2\]. 

 Our research evidenced many of the new and revised initiatives detailed in the 2017 Strategy. Following which, the police and farming / rural communities received more supportive and targeted police activity regarding the way in which farm and rural crimes are resourced. The community response to the new policing strategy identified that 79% of those asked reported that it is now easier to contact DPP on rural crime issues \[3.6\]. 

 **Changing DPP processes and services** 

 Morris and Norris recommended that rural ‘flags’ were attached to reports of agricultural crime for more efficient responding and reporting of rural crime. These were developed into a search algorithm by DPP force analysts to facilitate the detection of rural crime patterns, intelligence and responding. The RCT Officer reported that *‘systems have been adapted for better recording of calls and that they are categorised as Rural Crime’* \[5.3\]. This facilitated the identification of specific farm and rural crimes which was not possible using the previous categorisations of crime. 

 The establishment of a RCT was identified as a key recommendation in the report and as one RCT Officer explains: *\`The creation of Rural Crime Teams and the appointment of dedicated Rural Crime Officers has enabled us to begin to break down the barriers which previously existed between the police and rural/farming communities.’* Furthermore, the RCT Officer confirms that the RCT’s *\`also opened channels of communication with the community in the language they use in their day\-to\-day life’* \[5.3\]. 

 Evidence that the recommendations from the research conducted for DPP are being used by other forces is evidenced by best practice and training being shared with North\-Wales police through fortnightly meetings between DPP and North\-Wales rural teams \[5.3\]. 

 **Public benefited from service improvements** 

 Research recommended more effective resourcing by allocating Officers who understand the specific communities they support. The allocation of specific officers to communities resulted in 70% of the community respondents agreeing that dedicated rural crime officers had increased their trust in the police \[3.6\]. The Senedd Cymru \- Welsh Parliament Member for the area explains the importance of the RCT and Welsh language: *\`Welsh is their day\-to\-day language and when reporting a crime … they often find it easier to express themselves in Welsh and can often do so more accurately.’*  They also report that following the establishment of the RCT *\`the provision of localised support by Welsh speaking officers with agricultural and rural backgrounds has increased visibility and access to officers for the agricultural community in Ceredigion’* \[5.4\]. 

 Dedicated rural officers have been appointed and work with farmers’ welfare organisations, identifying people who may be isolated and vulnerable and helping Agricultural Welfare Organisations, such as the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution \(RABI\), Tir Dewi, and the DPJ Foundation, to support people in rural communities with poor mental health, including farmers in crisis. Tir Dewi and RABI representatives confirm that the rural officers’ familiarity in communities is a positive factor in dealing with vulnerable people \[5.5\]. Increasing police visibility in rural areas was a key recommendation of the research and this was implemented by DPP. As such, operationally\-dedicated RCT Officers now regularly attend rural and community events, including livestock markets, Young Farmers Clubs \(YFC\) and Women’s Institute events \[5.3; 5.6\]. The YFC County Organiser for Ceredigion highlights the RCT’s interaction with the YFC, the importance of working with young people in the community, and reports that the Ceredigion RCT Officers are a *\`great asset’* \[5.7\]. 

 The research recommended that communication between DPP and rural communities in DP should be increased. Following the implementation of the Rural Crime Strategy, DPP increased communication with residents and expanded its use of social media using Facebook, Twitter and attending public engagement events.  For example, DPP’s Rural\-Watch Facebook group, created in January 2018, now has 9,151 members as of 3 January 2021 with over 2,000 posts and 6,000 reactions. The Rural Crime Team Twitter account has 1,690 followers, and, as 4 January 2021, there have been 3,362 tweets posted \[5.8\]. The second Rural Crime report states that overall satisfaction with the police across the force area increased from 47% to 52% following the implementation of the DPP 2017 Rural Crime Strategy.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Short's research at the University of Cambridge focuses on the adaptation of post\-war buildings to increase resilience to a changing climate, reduce carbon emissions and improve comfort. The UK Department of Health appointed Short to develop the NHS Energy Efficiency Fund \(EEF\) specifically to mitigate climate change effects by improving energy efficiency across the retained NHS Estate and subsequently commissioned him to redraft the primary NHS guidance on energy efficiency, promoting EEF findings and advocating refurbishment as often the superior option to newbuild. The concept has been taken up internationally by healthcare organisations and by stakeholders in China's Hot Summer\-Cold Winter region responding to government carbon reduction policy.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As a result of climate change, many parts of the world are experiencing greater extremes of temperature. This poses a particular problem in non\-domestic buildings, notably hospitals, which treat vulnerable patients, and often constitute older building stock. The 2014 submission focussed on the NHS Estate. The problem is acute for the existing stock in geographic regions with increasing susceptibility to periods of extreme temperatures. The diagnosis and adaptation of a wider variety of building types in Continental climates is the focus of this submission. This highly interdisciplinary research, lead by Architecture at the University of Cambridge in close collaboration with Engineering, Geography and Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in Cambridge and with Earth Sciences at Imperial College London and Chongqing and Zhejiang Universities in China, addresses these challenges in building the existing stock’s resilience. Short’s expertise in adapting relatively recent buildings to enable natural ventilation and passive cooling whilst reducing solar and other gains derives from leading thirty years of research including design and delivery of a number of live adaptation projects:  Future House in Beijing **\[R1, Ch.8\]**, Poole's 'Lighthouse' and the 'Garrick' theatre in Lichfield **\[R1, Ch.5\]**. 

 The research programme DeDeRHECC measured excessively hot summer conditions in UK buildings \(hospitals\) and in China \(various\) 2007\-19. Theoretical adaptation proposals were developed to boost resilience in hot summers, following DeDeRHECC methodology: identifying recurrent building types; monitoring over two years; simulation; diagnosis of performance to inform re\-engineering designs to increase resilience, reduce carbon emissions and improve comfort from a palette of interventions to reduce solar gains, expose latent thermal mass, encourage cross ventilation and/or stack ventilation through interventions in plan and envelope.  **\[R2\]** proposes an adaptation of a typical Nightingale hospital ward. **\[R3\]** presents adaptation options for a medium\-rise maternity hospital. DeDeRHECC type solutions were then applied across 248 NHS England Acute Hospitals, 12.4 million m<sup>2</sup> **\[R1, Ch.9\]**. Chongqing and Zhejiang co\-researchers with policy advisors from the China Academy of Building Research, the Green Building Council of China and industrial partners Grace Corporation, Nantong Construction Group and others followed this work, evolving Short's adaptation schemes for a harsher Continental climate. The China\-focussed project Low carbon climate\-responsive Heating and Cooling of Cities \(LoHCool\) was developed out of DeDeRHECC and HTM 07\-02 and adds wind\-driven ventilation to UK type passive schemes to further reduce summer internal temperatures. **\[R5, R6**\]. In subsequent research, the Low carbon climate\-responsive Heating and Cooling of cities \(LoHCool\) project, the methodology was extended to the 9 billion m<sup>2</sup> of building stock in China’s Hot Summer\-Cold Winter \(HSCW\) zone, population 550 million people where internal environments oscillate well beyond regionally derived comfort zones. Colleagues in Chongqing and Hangzhou sampled significant portions of their respective cities to identify recurrent building types. Representative buildings were selected by the international team, internal and external data were collected at the type buildings over two subsequent hot seasons to assist the team in diagnosing their malperformance and designing sets of coupled adaptation measures. Building internal environments were modelled in China whilst their external city environments were modelled at Imperial. Internal environments were coupled within the same FLUIDITY model predicting the external prevailing city\-wide airflows, calibrated against measured data and remodelled with the proposed adaptation measures to enable the design of a standardised approach for each highly recurrent building type **\[R5, R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>Changes to UK health policy and guidance:</ins> The UK Department of Health commissioned Short to develop the 2013\-14 NHS Energy Efficiency Fund 'to mitigate the effects of climate change by improving energy efficiency across the existing NHS Estate'. GBP49.3m was expended on 117 energy efficiency projects in 48 NHS organisations predicted to save 100.6Mkg CO<sub>2</sub> pa, 2.4% of the entire NHS building energy related carbon footprint. Reporting of the fund outcomes contributed to the REF2014 impact case study **\[E1\].** Short/Guthrie's 2015 Executive Summary captures the key outcomes **\[E1\]**. The unpublished full report includes 31 case studies, revealing wide variations in the relative benefits of different approaches and the challenges and limitations of the schemes such as: too tight timescale disqualifying failing Trusts, lack of building level energy data, skills gaps in NHS organisations, lack of staff trust and engagement. Unanticipated requirements for planning approvals eliminated most renewable energy schemes, important learning for the DH: ‘ *The NHS EEF was regarded as having been particularly successful and your report highlights a series of exemplar projects setting a clear policy direction for future physical adaptation of the retained estate which clearly aligns with the Government's move towards retention and refurbishment of the NHS’* **\[E4\]**. Opportunities were identified in upgrading planned maintenance with easy wins such as lighting upgrades **\[R4, p.11\]**. Lord Carter \(NHSi\) took findings from Short's 20 lighting improvement case studies and launched an NHS fund exclusively for lighting upgrades in 2017 **\[E11\].** 

 The Department of Health commissioned Short and colleagues to draft new guidance on energy efficiency, the updated Health Technical Memorandum \(HTM 07\-02\) *Encode 2015*, *Making energy work in healthcare  \[E2\]** reinforcing the trajectory of government policy established by the EEF emphasizing, *'From a financial and resource efficiency perspective, the refurbishment of an existing building is often a superior option to constructing a new one*'. \(p. 29\) The HTM is now the required point of reference for approvals for all NHS Estates and Facilities projects. In his foreword, the then Head of Profession for NHS Estates & Facilities Policy, wrote *'The \(Energy Efficiency\) Fund enabled the NHS to go further, faster in mitigating the effects of climate change, by improving energy efficiency, whilst retaining the resulting benefits within the NHS organisations for re\-investment directly into frontline patient services. The lessons learnt from these energy efficiency projects are embedded in Encode 2015 as best practice guidance'* \[ **E4**\]. The Department of Health Chief Architect wrote to Short on the published HTM, *'I just would like to pass on my gratitude and thanks this is a real source of best practice and knowledge sharing'* **\[E3\].** 

 International healthcare charity 'Health Care Without Harm' alerted Fraser Health, which manages 99 health care facilities in British Columbia, to Short's adaptation research in September 2016, citing Short's film 'Robust Hospitals in a Changing Climate'. Fraser Health’s Director of Energy and Environmental Sustainability has commented that *‘the Climate Risk and Resilience Lead at Fraser Health and her Energy and Environmental sustainability \(EES\) colleagues subsequently translated Short’s principles and methodologies to a British Columbia context, developed projects with national\-level partners, and shared results and insights with communities of practice. Drawing on research from 2016, firstly a National Research Council study which provides a Climate Resilience Feasibility Study of Facilities at Fraser Canyon Hospital…. Inspired by Short’s video on retrofitting hospitals for extreme heat, and included the evaluation of six options, the same measures as highlighted in Short’s own research and shows a clear incorporation and implementation of his concepts and methodological approach in the Canadian Healthcare context’.* **\[E5\]** 

 A Director in multi\-disciplinary, international design practice BDP and project partner wrote in March 2020 that: 'Such \[Short et al\] research has enabled us to both advise our clients in effectively assessing the suitability of retaining existing buildings, and provide evidence to support the reduced use of ‘energy\-hungry’ air conditioning and increase the use of low\-carbon mixed\-mode natural ventilation in healthcare buildings and across other sectors ... ' **\[E6\]**. 

 <ins>Extending Adaptation and Retrofitting to the Chinese Construction Sector, Hot Summer\-Cold Winter Region \(HSCW\)</ins> estimated total annual energy consumption for residential floorspace 90\-135 Billion kWh. LoHCool proposals mitigate a potential future 320.11\- 415.8 Billion kWh of energy consumption per annum **\[R6\]**. Short and Yao of Chongqing and Reading held two\-day workshops in 2018 for Nantong Sanjian Holdings Co. Limited, parent of the China Nantong Third Construction Company **\[E7\],** and the Grace Corporation, Yibin Sichuan **\[E8\],** introducing low energy adaptation of existing stock as a novel concept rather than wholesale demolition and replacement. Grace Corp. emphasizes their interest in exploiting LoHCool's low energy concepts at the city planning scale, 'At the planning stage in April 2018, Prof. Alan Short intensively worked with us and had a two\-day workshop and a site visit. He provided a low carbon sustainable planning concept that we have adapted in the our \(sic\) final plan...Prof. Short’s low carbon design and model are very helpful in our building design practice. The research provided evidence of important implications to developing policy in this area within which we are able to play an active part' **\[E8\]**. In Hangzhou, Zhejiang Shimao Real Estate Group costed the LoHCool Hangzhou case study projects **\[R5, R6\]**, the real estate developer Hangzhou Sanxiang Impression Co. Ltd. states it will reconsider approaches to existing buildings given the clear national and regional sustainability agenda **\[E9\]** and the leading design agency Zhejiang Huazhi Building Technology Promotion Centre cites a broader approach to the existing building stock **\[E10\]**. 

 The Deputy General Manager and Main Board Director at Nantong Sanjian Holdings Co., Ltd. writes, 'Prof. Short introduced the LoHCool project ...Prof.Short's research provides a new concept in housing design and retrofitting that explained in the film, which is very interesting. We are keen to explore future the retention and adaptation of existing buildings and new builds'. Nantong is no. 26 in ENR table of world's 250 largest contractors, no. 9 out of top 200 construction companies in China **\[E7\]**. Hangzhou Sanxiang Impression Co. Ltd. a leading real estate developer writes, '’this research project has important implications to developing lower energy residential buildings in this area within which we are able to play an active part. Our company has reviewed its benefit to the existing building stock and the research has greatly broadened the range of approaches which we can consider when we plan for new construction, we can see greater value to be recovered in our existing building stock as a consequence in the region of Hot Summer and Cold Winter'. **\[E9\]**. From the Zhejiang Huazhi Technology Promotion Centre letter, 'The research and our interactions with Professor C. Alan Short have had important impact on designing lower energy buildings in this region. The research has broadened the range of methods which we can consider when we plan for refurbishment or new construction'. **\[E10\]**. Regarding the influence on BDP’s operations in China: 'More directly, the case study buildings, such as Liubo ... look very familiar both in China and other countries where we work ...The wind\-catcher design developed within the project provides evidence for the effectiveness of a retro\-fit solution and indeed evidence for similar approaches to be integrated into new\-build construction' **\[E6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by staff in the Personal Social Services Research Unit \(PSSRU\) at the University of Kent has both changed practice and been instrumental in influencing policy in the allocation of adult social care funding. It has changed local authority practice across England by creating a model to facilitate new ‘Deferred Payment Arrangements’ that have directly impacted on the lives of thousands of people needing to pay for care costs. The UK Government\-commissioned development of a new Adult Social Care Relative Needs Formula \(ASC RNF\) has influenced policy formation at all levels. It has informed House of Commons discussions, been employed by Government departments’ technical working groups, been cited in policy formation consultation documents, and been used by local government associations to inform their analysis and to feed back to Government regarding their preferred policy option. The new formula is now the leading Government policy option for the distribution of some £5.7 billion of public Adult Social Care \(ASC\) funding. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Adult Social Care Relative Needs Formulae \(ASC RNF\) are used to distribute Government funding for ASC to local authorities \(LAs\). The research of Professor Julien Forder and his colleagues, Dr Karen Jones and Dr Florin Vadean, developed the following: 

1.  Allocation formulae for funding the new Deferred Payment Agreements \(DPA\), which are a way for local authorities to initially pay care costs on behalf of home\-owners moving into care homes, with repayment made when their home is sold after death \(or before\). 

1.  A new ASC RNF to form part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, used to distribute around £5.7 billion to local authorities. 

 The study was funded by the Department of Health and Social Care \(056/0018\), and conducted between September 2012 and July 2015 **\[G1\]**. It was conducted jointly with local government specialists LG Futures and colleagues at the London School of Economics. The University of Kent team led on: \(i\) the conceptual development; \(ii\) the specification of the data collection; and \(iii\) the analysis and outputs as reported below. 

 Allocation formulae are developed on the principle that people in each local authority should have equal access \(to adult social care\) for equal need \(including impairment, risk, frailty, etc.\) **\[R1\]**. The University of Kent team’s approach was to assess the \(statistical\) relationship between people’s \(current\) use of ASC and indicators of their level of need, with parameters for a need formula being estimated while accounting for the influence of non\-need factors, including the existing supply of care services, on people’s utilisation **\[R2\]**. Their previous research helped to guide the empirical methodology **\[R3\]**. DPA policy is targeted to support home\-owners who are not financially eligible for public ASC support. Accordingly, the research also involved developing a person\-level model of whether people in different circumstances would qualify for a DPA, again drawing on the team’s previous research **\[R4\]**. 

 Dr Karen Jones led on the ethics and research governance applications, and then worked closely with LG Futures to help ensure that data on ASC utilisation from local authorities was collected to specification. The data collection generated unique datasets on ASC users in 53 LAs and more than 13,000 small areas – ONS Lower Layer Super Output Areas. Small area data from various national datasets were added by the University of Kent team on need and wealth factors \(e.g. longstanding illness, rates of benefits uptake, home ownership, number of properties by Council Tax band, etc.\). 

 Statistical \(mainly regression\) analyses conducted by Professor Julien Forder and Dr Florin Vadean produced the parameters for an allocation formula for DPAs **\[R5\]** and for general funding allocations to LAs for ASC provision **\[R6\]**. They found that utilisation of ASC does vary significantly with differences in need across 152 local authorities in England. Supply was also an important factor. The new formula produced funding allocations that are different from those made per head of population only, and also from the currently used ASC RNF allocation.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The University of Kent team’s research set out in section two above has had significant impact in two areas: 

 **Impact on Practice** 

 First, there has been direct impact on practice through the implementation of a University of Kent\-designed allocation formula for funding the new Deferred Payment Agreements \(DPA\). The decision to implement the formula followed a 2014 consultation run by the Department of Health and Social Care with local authorities and stakeholder organisations **\[a\]**. Responses were received from 74 Local Authorities \(LAs\) and nine organisations, with the vast majority \(82%\) agreeing with the formula as published in the 2014 interim report **\[b\]**. Since the formula was adopted in April 2015 **\[b\]**, it has directly impacted the lives of thousands of people by allowing them to receive timely care whilst being able to defer the costs. The implementation of the formula has also directly impacted local authorities by providing a fair and transparent method whereby they can provide funds upfront to those in need, but formally recoup their costs at a later date in order to plan effectively and respond to a large portfolio of needs. 

 The reach of DPAs employing the Kent\-designed formula is demonstrated by the number of people who have benefited as a result of its implementation. Between April 2015 and March 2019, over 12,000 DPA recipients were directly impacted by the use of the formula. In 2015\-16, the planned spend was some £83.5 million to LAs, to be allocated by the formula **\[b, c\]**. The total number of active DPAs in England as of March 2019 was 6,380, with a total value of £213 million **\[d\]**. With regard to significance, the Government’s impact assessment for this policy suggested substantial benefit to people from DPAs, especially the reduced stress and anxiety from time to sell their homes and meet care costs, during a period of significant upheaval in people’s lives **\[c\]**. 

 **Impact on Informing Policy** 

 Secondly, the University of Kent research achieved a multifaceted impact on policy, building capacity and awareness within national and local government, as well as in an influential think tank. In England, national and local government have been examining policy solutions in order to distribute an estimated £5.7 billion of national ASC funding fairly. The importance of this policy development cannot be overstated. It will not only affect some 870,000 people aged 18 and over who receive publicly funded long\-term care, but also the social care sector as a whole, which employs about 1.45 million people \(full\- or part\-time\), whose pay, workload, and conditions are dependent on public funding and care policies. 

 The University of Kent research has directly informed policy, improved awareness, and created capacity in this crucial area by offering options through the development of a new ASC RNF. The formula, and its development work, has had a direct and tangible impact on Government thinking. It is being formally ‘considered as part of the government’s review of local authorities’ relative needs and resources’, this review being led by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government **\[e\]**. It formed part of key House of Commons discussions on the distribution of ASC funding by Sajid Javid, then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government **\[f\]**. It is also cited as informing discussions regarding the development of a key forthcoming Government Green Paper on adult social care **\[f\]**. At a local level, it forms a central part of the information being used by the local government association to gauge potential impacts of changes regarding the relative distribution of adult social care funding on local authorities in order to feedback to Government **\[g\]**. Beyond influencing central and local government, the advantages of employing the new ASC RNF in the distribution of adult social care funding has been recognised by the Institute of Fiscal Studies **\[h\]**. 

 The significance of the ASC RNF development on Government policy is further demonstrated by the fact that it is now cited as the preferred policy option both by the Government’s ‘Fair Funding Review’ consultation **\[i\]** and by the Department of Health and Social Care Technical Working Group **\[j\]**. The reach of the ASC RNF has what we refer to here as 360\-degree evidence of influence on policy formation at all levels. It has influenced ministerial discussions, thinking in Government departments, and local government, as well as a key think tank inputting into consultation processes. Our research is recognised as providing Government policy\-makers with the ability to ensure resources are fairly distributed to meet eligible care needs, regardless of the local authority in which recipients live **\[h\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 NTU research has influenced and shaped business support policy in the East Midlands *inter alia*. by identifying previously overlooked high\-growth potential in creative and digital industries. Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Local Economic Partnership \(D2N2\) revised its strategic priorities, unlocked £9.7 million funding targeted at SME development and engaged with 1,970 SMEs. 

 NTU’s research had a direct impact on the growth, job creation and competitiveness of small businesses in D2N2, by developing its SME managerial capacity. The research subsequently influenced the design of SME interventions in the UK and Europe, through the Small Business Leadership and Interreg Scale\-Up Programs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 NTU research has identified three important components of learning for management education and business support: 

1.  Learning is *situated* \- it is produced together within a temporally, geographically, or relationally situated practice \( **R2**\) 

1.  Learning is *social* \- it is not individualised but is co\-created between people \( **R3**, **R4**\). 

1.  Learning is *emergent* \- it is always in a state of becoming and as such is provisional \( **R1**, **R3**\) \( **R5**\). 

 These components combine to inform the development of NTU’s ecosystem methodology of SME business support, using a reflexive, iterative cycle of engaged theory and practice \( **R4**\). NTU’s flagship business support intervention ‘Future Factory’ \(2009\-2015\) provided an early testbed for this emerging methodology \( **R5**\) connecting theory to practice. 

 The first principle is the understanding that knowledge is situated \( **R2**\) and contextual \( **R1**\). The approach requires respectful listening and careful noticing to reveal taken\-for\-granted aspects of practice. It responds to the situated nature of learning, which demands a detailed and nuanced understanding of local contexts. For example, the research has identified particular issues related to notions of embodied confidence for local actors \( **R2**, **R5**, **R6**\), and contextually co\-designed bespoke support to meet the specific needs of priority client groups, such as creative and digital and high\-growth SMEs \( **R6**\). 

 The second principle is an understanding that learning is social. It foregrounds a collaborative inquiry approach \( **R1**, **R2**\) which brings together academic and practitioner perspectives. Each party is equally valued to promote learning from, with, and for each other. In particular, this approach recognises the identity struggles that are at the heart of management learning \( **R1**, **R3**\) and works by foregrounding this approach through reflexive learning \( **R1**\) and critical reflection \( **R4**\). 

 The third principle is an understanding that learning is emergent \( **R1**\). This informs a purposeful cyclical approach \( **R4**\) through which we learn from the experiences of SME managers to inform the continuous development of our SME ecosystem. The underpinning research emphasises the importance of reflexivity and a responsive approach to delivery and co\-design in the SME ecosystem.  For example, the team show how they mobilised findings from a forum where participants reflected on their experiences in a way that shaped future interventions \( **R5**\). 

 In the context of SME support, the reflexive, iterative cycle of theory and practice \( **R4**\), as developed through the ‘Future Factory’ \( **R6**\) and subsequent projects, has led to three specific components of practice: 

1.  understanding how to create an environment in which SME managers can reflect upon their perceived needs in order to arrive at their underlying requirements. For example, to become more sustainable, Future Factory clients needed to develop cumulative capabilities in marketing and commercial leadership, addressing their anticipated and additional objectives \( **R5**\). 

1.  being responsive to the underlying requirements of SME participants and using these to develop the SME ecosystem. The need to support high\-growth Creative and Digital Industries \(CDI\) businesses as well as the micro\-businesses in the creative and cultural ecosystem is an example \( **R6**\). 

1.  creating a dynamic environment through which the ecosystem can be piloted and constantly developed, such as by facilitating networking between SMEs and education providers to update awareness of sector skills needs \( **R6**\). 
","
###  3. References to the research 

 The quality of the underpinning research has been evidenced by rigorous externally peer reviewed outputs and by multiple commissions and re\-commissions by national and local key stakeholders across the sector.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Impacting policy 

 NTU research has directly impacted on D2N2’s strategic policies, by making the Creative and Digital Industries a strategic priority sector \( **S1**\) and unlocking funding of £8.855 million through the European Structural Investment Fund Strategy, 2015\-16 \( **S2**\). The NTU report, “Creative and Digital D2N2: Strategic Action Plan for the Creative and Digital Industries in D2N2” \(SDAP\) \( **R6**\), led directly to the D2N2 Strategic Economic Plan \(SEP\) extending its reach into previously overlooked Creative and Digital Industries as an additional Priority Sector. 

 *“NTU has been exemplary in their support for the Creative and Digital Sector. Since the inception of the Big House project, NTU have played an active and leading role in the project, and in supporting the CDI sector.* *They have provided the fundamental research that has helped develop and guide the project … \(NTU\) have contributed to the development of a team approach on the project and have been central to the delivery of the project* \( **S1**\) *.* 

 NTU directly impacted on D2N2’s policy implementation for the support of high growth businesses, \( **S2**\) facilitating the release of £850,000 targeted funding channelling the three key components of learning \(R1,2,3\). **S3** describes: 

 “*Co\-designing* … *how a scale\-up Ecosystem could be created and implemented in the specific D2N2 context … As a result, in 2017, D2N2 adopted a strategy of supporting more SMEs to become scale\-ups”* and continues *“these programmes …incorporated the recommendations from the NBS team to include a detailed business diagnostic, specifically targeted workshops and peer\-to\-peer support \( **S3**\)”.* 

###  Impact on SME Performance 

 Reflecting on this policy influence, The Small Business Charter feedback states: 

 “*The research from NBS informs policy which in turn leads to funding opportunities which the institution is able to capitalise on through their collaboration with the relevant stakeholders in the growth agenda”*  while *“reports in the base room and conversations with businesses during the \(assessment visit\) left no doubt of impact”* \( **S4**\). 

 SME interventions reached 1,970 SMEs \(17% of CDI SME’s\) and supported 40% of D2N2’s High Growth SMEs. Its significance evidenced by: 

1.  Directly *improved* SMEs competitiveness. Over 50% of Big House \( **S9**\) and Future Factory \( **S5**\) beneficiaries have or already plan to introduce new products or processes because of interventions.  Support led 35% of Big House participants to report increased competitiveness \( **S9\)** and 33% Future Factory beneficiaries to identify commercial benefits such as new orders or cost savings \( **S5**\). Of 14 SMEs supported by the intense Big House Accelerator, 8 and 11, respectively, created new\-to\-market and new\-to\-firm products, 3 created new jobs and 3 accessed finance for growth \( **S9**\). One co\-founder explained how the SME won a 3\-year contract to double their revenue \( **S6\).** 

1.  SMEs consistently reported increased management confidence and competence, team performance, “i *mproved decision\-making”,* ability to *“manage change effectively”* \( **S8**\), and resilience in the face of Covid\-19 \( **S7**\). One UpScaler participant Managing Director explained that as a result of their participation: “ *Having taken the right decisions for the right reasons we found ourselves prepared when the current crisis arrived, and we have worked on and through pretty much unaffected*”. Another said: “ *Being part of UpScaler has encouraged us to raise the bar and adopt new techniques… we’re far more strategic in what we do.” A third added: “\[UpScaler\] is very much run for the benefit of the participants, not to big up the organisation* \( **S7**\) 

1.  Further evidence of direct impact on SME turnover and jobs, in spite of economic challenges comes from UpScaler participants reporting turnover growth of 38\-60% p.a. and jobs growth of 2\-25% during the project, while a Big House Accelerator participant reported: “ *we’ve been really busy so have recruited two more team members, taking our team to 8 from 4 when we started the programme”* \( **S7**\). 

###  Reach of the Impact: 

 Our unique approach to bespoke management development; and the evolving Ecosystem for SME support \( **S5, S8, S9**\), was called ‘ *outstanding*’ by The Small Business Charter \( **S4**\), leading to a contribution to the design of a national Small Business Leadership Programme \( **S11**\). The Interreg Europe Scale Up Project \( **S10**\) identified the UpScaler programme and Big House Accelerator as Good Practices, with partners from 6 countries learning from the programmes. **S4** states: 

 “*\[UpScaler\] has raised the profile of D2N2 with the national ScaleUp Institute and has been acknowledged as a best practice by the Interreg Scale Up programme. This has influenced the East Midlands Chamber to embed support for Scaling SMEs … across its full geographical area of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire*.”

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 All media systems must navigate global competition and technological innovation on the one hand, and national regulation and public needs on the other.  Small nations are challenged by limited resources, the greater muscle of powerful neighbours, and complex multi\-tier governmental systems as in devolved Wales. McElroy’s research, conducted at the Centre for Media and Culture in Small Nations \(CMCSN\), has provided evidence of failures in UK and Welsh media adequately to build a devolved democratic public sphere at the very point when devolved nations have seen their legislative powers grow. The research has had impact by enhancing public scrutiny of broadcasting, developing a statutory remit for digital Welsh\-language broadcasting, and securing new investment for innovation in Wales’ screen sector. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 There are three strands of underpinning research: 

1.  Television production and cultural representation in bilingual Wales 

1.  Devolved media policymaking and increased public scrutiny 

1.  Comparative analyses of small nations globally to stimulate innovation in screen industries 

 **Strand 1** examines the relationship between broadcasting strategy, TV production, and cultural representation in the Welsh screen ecology. It marries methodologies and frameworks derived from media production studies with cultural research examining textual forms and representation. It challenges the dichotomy of business vs culture present in much creative industries thinking, arguing instead for a holistic appreciation of how public media may enrich cultural life in a bilingual nation. Qualitative and quantitative research examines the impact of Public Service Broadcasting \(PSB\) investment on what appears on screen and the difference this makes to how audiences feel represented \(or not\) by PSBs. In 2014\-16, McElroy led research **\(3.1\)** investigating the impact of BBC Roath Lock Drama Studios on both the Welsh production sector \(i.e. production companies based in Wales\) and the range of cultural representations produced. This research entailed semi\-structured interviews with stakeholders \(e.g. broadcasters, Welsh Government, producers, and trade unions\). It found that while BBC investment delivered reputational gain for production in Wales and enhanced demand for a skilled TV workforce through major popular series such as *Doctor Who* and *Casualty,* the exclusive focus on UK network production meant the Studios delivered almost nothing in improving diverse representations of Wales on\-screen. The expansion of Roath Lock at speed led to workforce shortages that drew crews from outside of Wales thereby failing against stated strategic aims of developing the Welsh screen workforce. Rather than Wales being unique, research **\(3.2\)** demonstrated the common challenge faced by small nations when their screen industry strategy focuses disproportionately on servicing production from larger neighbours \(whose focus is economic efficiency, not cultural gain\), as opposed to investing in their own production sector. 

 **Strand 2** entails research examining devolved media policy within the context of an emerging Welsh public sphere **\(3.3\)**. McElroy’s research, reveals the challenges presented by multi\-level government structures to policymakers, citizens, and media organisations as they come to terms with what devolution means for civil society. Research undertaken in 2015 by McElroy with the Institute for Welsh Affair’s Media Policy Group **\(3.5\)** gathered quantitative and qualitative data on media in Wales. It provided evidence of inadequate public scrutiny of media policy and an enduring democratic deficit in the range and quality of information available to Welsh citizens. It evidenced substantial under\-investment in TV production for Wales, showing a fall of 22.4% in spend by BBC on programmes in English for Wales between 2007\-2015 and cuts of 36% to S4C since 2010 leading to job losses, increasing TV repeats, and a diminishing service for Welsh\-speakers. 

 **Strand 3** comprises comparative research\-led innovation undertaken by McElroy bringing together academics, industry and policymakers in international knowledge exchange. McElroy’s research **\(3.2\)** has explored the cultural and industrial value of innovative ‘back to back’ TV drama production \(where a scene is shot first in Welsh then in English to create distinct Welsh\-language and English\-language series\) as a model for enhancing quality drama production in bilingual Wales. In 2015\-6, she led ‘TV Production in Small Nations: building a network for cultural and commercial success’ \(AHRC AH/M011348/1\) that gathered 63 academic experts, policymakers, broadcasters and independent producers from 12 European countries to identify the cultural and economic value of indigenous TV production and specific opportunities for non\-Anglophone content globally. Findings demonstrated that: 

1.  PSB contributes disproportionately to the culture and economy of small nations and helps normalize minority\-language use in everyday life. 

1.  Digital innovation demands more ambitious thinking by broadcasters and policymakers to enable growth in new media forms in minority\-languages **\(3.4 and 3.6\)**. 

1.  While co\-production partnerships leverage resource into small nations, they do little to deliver diverse cultural representations. Investment in small nations’ own domestic production is vital to sustain indigenous production. 

1.  To retain public legitimacy, PSBs must be more inclusive and better communicate their value to audiences in this era of abundant, English\-language content.

 **4.Details of the impact** 

 This research has helped bring about change to the media landscape in Wales resulting in: 

1.  Improved democratic scrutiny of devolved media policy. 

1.  Increased investment in Welsh television production through advocacy for change in BBC regions and nations strategy. 

1.  Greater understanding of the place of innovation in screen production and its value both to speakers of minority\-languages and to the industry as content creators. 

1.  An improved, updated statutory remit for S4C reflective of the digital era. 

1.  Better informed public debate regarding the consequences of the democratic deficit and what this means for an informed civil society. 

 **1a\)CMCSN research has informed the Senedd Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee on Welsh broadcasting and helped improve democratic scrutiny \(see 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4\)** 

 *‘Professor McElroy’s contributions to the Committee’s work have improved my understanding of media policy, and that of politicians’. **\(5**.* **4** *\)* 

 Before the Wales Media Audit 2015 **\(3.5\)** was published, the National Assembly for Wales had no designated forum through which to scrutinise media policy. In the Audit we recommended improved monitoring of media in Wales drawing on academic expertise to highlight emerging media developments. The Audit galvanised the legislature to create the  [Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee](about:blank) \(CWLCC\). Since its creation in 2016, this committee has delivered improved scrutiny via numerous public inquiries. 

 *“It is worrying that specific media provision for Welsh audiences is in decline. One result of this is insufficient scrutiny of decisions affecting Wales \[…\] This paucity of information may also contribute to an ill\-informed population. Moreover, given the high value that Welsh audiences place on seeing themselves and Welsh life on screen, the current service and any prospect of further decline, particularly in non\-news programming, is concerning”* **\(5.1a, p.24\)** 

 In 2016, McElroy gave oral and written evidence to the Parliamentary ‘ [Welsh Affairs Committee Inquiry into Welsh Broadcasting](https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/35119192-b824-4bda-ae5d-d3f19aedbef5)’ **\(5.1a\)**. Several of their findings cited our research 

 in their  [final report](https://old.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/welsh-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/broadcasting-in-wales/publications/) **\(5.1a\)** including the need to improve scrutiny of broadcasting and the representation of Wales on screen, thus: “ *Research conducted by the University of South Wales and the BBC Audience Council for Wales concluded that audiences in Wales value the programming produced in, and representing images of, the country. The research stated that “such representations strengthen a collective sense of cultural and social identity*”’ and ‘ *the University of South Wales concluded that important elements of Welsh national life are failing to be captured on screen.”*  [Broadcasting in Wales, Section 4, ‘Portrayal of Wales on Screen’](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmwelaf/14/1407.htm) 

 McElroy and other researchers in CMCSN have regularly been invited to supply research insights to inform CWLCC inquiries **\(5.2**\). This includes  [McElroy’s evidence](http://www.senedd.tv/Meeting/Archive/2dc561d2-e552-42dd-92fd-6cfa5edb8440?autostart=True) on ‘The Future of S4C’ \(8 March 2017\) **\(5.2c\)**; McElroy’s and  [Hannah’s](https://business.senedd.wales/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=445&MId=4732) \(CMSN PGR\) evidence to ‘Film and High\-End TV Production’ \(10 May 2018\) \( **5.2d\)**, whose  [final report](https://senedd.wales/laid%20documents/cr-ld12524/cr-ld12524-e.pdf) launched at USW in May 2019; and   [McElroy’s evidence](http://www.senedd.tv/Meeting/Archive/5d80d03f-5ca5-44c2-ba13-2c83f2295b0b?autostart=True) to ‘The Future of PSB: Small Screen, Big Debate’ \(20 November 2019\). **\(5.2e\)** 

 **1b\)McElroy’s research helped deliver informed scrutiny through her advice to the regulator, Ofcom \(see 5.6\)** 

 *‘Professor McElroy’s research is an invaluable asset to Ofcom as it develops its policy in relation to the media in Wales…She is uniquely placed to provide advice to Ofcom on these matters and to help shape the regulator’s response to a rapidly changing media environment.’* 

 In 2017, McElroy was appointed by DCMS to Ofcom’s Advisory Committee Wales \(ACW\) \(2017\-2021\) to advise on the impact of communications and broadcasting policy in Wales. For example, in 2019/20, she advised Ofcom to scrutinise Channel 4’s promised nations strategy to deliver ‘For all the UK’. This led to the Channel 4 team appearing before ACW in March 2020 to give evidence of improvements in investment in Wales. During the COVID\-19 pandemic, McElroy advised Ofcom of the public impact of differential media coverage of Devolved vs. UK governments’ guidance to citizens’ understanding of lockdown rules. 

 **2\)McElroy’s research with IWA lead to recommendations that resulted in increased investment in TV production in Wales \(see 5.2 and 5.3\)** 

 *‘Professor McElroy played a pivotal role in contributing to the research which formed the basis of the 2015 IWA Wales Media Audit and, together with other members of the IWA’s Media Policy Group, worked collaboratively with us on shaping its recommendations’* **\(5.3**\). 

 The 2015 Media Audit contributed to substantially increased pressure on the BBC to increase its investment in TV production Wales. We evidenced a significant reduction since 2008 in spend on English\- language TV in Wales representing a real\-terms decline of 30% and demonstrated there had been a 48% reduction in the total hours per week of output made for Wales. In response, a key recommendation made in the Wales Media Audit \(2015\) was that ‘investment in the BBC’s services in Wales should be increased’ **\(3.5\)** substantially as a priority for BBC. 

 This had impact firstly through being taken up by National Assembly for Wales’ 2015 report on ‘BBC Charter’ \(2015\) **\(5.2a\)** and the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee’s ‘The Big Picture’ on broadcasting in Wales \(2017\) **\(5.2b\)**, which argued for substantial investment increases in English\-language drama and broadcasting about Wales. Secondly, our research had impact when the call for greater investment found realisation in February 2017 with the BBC announcing an extra £8.5million investment in Wales. In 2017/18, this resulted in new popular drama series such as *Keeping Faith/Un Bore Mercher*, which had  [17 million iPlayer download requests](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47116363) and was one of the most popular ever to appear on BBC iPlayer. This co\-production with S4C was also the realisation of the Audit’s recommendation that S4C and BBC Wales ‘maximise their collaboration across radio and television, without losing the distinctiveness of each others’ services’ **\(3.5\)**. 

 **3\)CMCSN’s screen research secured investment in innovation for screen sector growth** 

 McElroy’s research **\(3.2, 3.3, 3.6\)** on bilingual screen production, exemplified by the 2015\-16 AHRC TV Production in Small Nations Network **\(5.5**\), was instrumental in 2017\-18 in helping secure  [Clwstwr](https://clwstwr.org.uk/). It is one of just 9 UK Creative Clusters funded by AHRC’s Creative Economy programme and Welsh government. CMCSN’s research and industry collaborations underpin Clwstwr’s focus on R&D for screen innovation. Clwstwr leverages more than £1million annually of new investment for R&D in Cardiff’s screen industries which McElroy has  a key role in delivering as lead Co\-Investigator and programme Co\-Director. More than 60 industry/HE R&D projects have been funded to date including USW’s 2019 collaboration with the company Painting Practice to develop a new product, Plan V. Plan V is a virtual studio that allows a TV producer to visualise virtually\-created sets combining VR and AR to plunge the user into deeper levels of immersion. As part of this Clwstwr R&D project, Plan V had its first full industrial application on *His Dark Materials,* produced at Wolf Studios, Cardiff for BBC/HBO. It became BBC’s most watched new show in 5 years \( [7.2million](https://www.fm104.ie/news/buzz/bbcs-his-dark-materials-is-its-most-watched-show-in-five-years/)\) and gained millions more worldwide. David McCulloch \(exec producer\) said ‘ [Plan V was key to bringing the books of *His Dark Materials* to the screen…we would have been lost without it](https://paintingpractice.com/plan-v/)’. 

 **4\) CMCSN research substantially advanced the case for an updated S4C statutory remit** 

 McElroy’s research **\(3.6**\) has helped drive forward the agenda on digital innovation in Welsh\-language broadcasting, which is vital to normalising the Welsh language in contemporary life. A major plank in this agenda has been securing a statutory digital remit for S4C allowing it to modernise \(see **3.3**\). CMCSN’s research situated *S4C in Context* **\(3.4**\) for DCMS’ 2017\-18 Independent Review of S4C \(conducted by Euryn Ogwen Williams\), providing a comparative analysis of S4C in relation to other small nations’ broadcasters and demonstrating the need for greater digital innovation and responsiveness to Welsh\-speaking audiences within and beyond Wales. It delivered a convincing case for a new statutory digital remit for S4C by framing it within wider international evidence of the role of PSB in sustaining minority\-languages. Direct citation of CMCSN research is made by Euryn Ogwen Williams in his DCMS   [‘Building an S4C for the Future’](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/695964/Building_an_S4C_for_the_Future_English_Accessible.pdf) 2017. The case for a new statutory digital remit was accepted by the  [UK Government Response to the S4C Independent Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-s4c-independent-review-building-an-s4c-for-the-future) on 29 March 2018 where Matt Hancock, then Secretary of State DCMS, stated ‘Updating the remit will allow S4C to make its content available on a wider range of platforms \- in Wales, across the UK and abroad’. 

 **5\) McElroy’s research better informed public debate in Wales through a diverse media dissemination process** 

 *‘Wales is facing a media market failure that will leave the nation with a deficit of reliable information.’* \( [Maggie Brown *The Guardian* \(11/11/15](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/11/welsh-media-iwa-report-bbc-itv)\). 

 Media policy in multi\-level governmental nations is complex and can seem irrelevant to citizens and licence\-fee payers. McElroy’s research is the basis of her  [public communication](https://www.iwa.wales/agenda/2017/05/future-media-wales-policy-challenges/) to impact and improve the public’s understanding of how policy shapes what we see on screen. She provides  [expert interviews](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-38831823) to both mainstream UK and  [Welsh](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34777804)  [media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34789536) and specialist media \(e.g.  [Welsh Football Magazine](https://welsh-football.net/other-welsh-football-news/170-the-media-we-deserve) 2017\).  The Wales Media Audit **\(3.5\)** gained UK\-wide media coverage. On 11/11/15, McElroy was interviewed on the Audit’s findings of market failure and underinvestment in programmes for Wales on the [Radio 4 *Media Show*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06nq26w), the premier weekly programme examining UK media, alongside Ian Hargreaves, former editor of *The Independent* described the Audit as ‘ [*a brilliant pull\-together of things you never knew \[…\]get reading and rejoice in this thorough and classy piece of work*](http://angelagraham.org/2015/11/iwa-wales-media-audit-and-cardiff-media-summit/) *’.* McElroy communicated Audit findings to Welsh citizens on Radio Wales’ *Good Morning Wales* which advanced public debate on media in Wales and increased pressure on broadcasters such as the BBC to improve investment in Welsh productions.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Doug Gay's research into ecclesiastical history directly led to the May 2019 adoption by the governing court of the Church of Scotland of a ‘three\-year Radical Action Plan’. The plan’s measures, based on Gay's research recommendations, amount to a comprehensive reform aimed at halting the declining membership and influence of the Church. Change encompassed structures, training, strategy, finances and mission, in what constitutes the most substantial re\-organisation of Scotland's largest Church since 1929, fundamentally reshaping an institution with GBP120 million turnover and 330,000 members across 1,341 congregations, in Scotland and abroad. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Dr Doug Gay has been a lecturer in Practical Theology in Theology and Religious Studies, and Principal of Trinity College \(the Church of Scotland ministerial training college\) at University of Glasgow since 2005. Throughout his career Gay has been researching, presenting and writing about radical change in church, mission and social theology in the Presbyterian tradition. This broader body of work is represented by his publications \[3.1 and 3.2\], and led to a focused but substantial piece of research reviewing the problems facing the modern Church and their historical origins, disseminated in a  [Chalmers Lecture Series](https://ctbi.org.uk/lecture-series-explores-state-of-church-of-scotland/) and a monograph \[3.3\]. 

 Gay’s analysis showed that since the 1970s, as the pace of secularisation increased in Scotland, the Church of Scotland \(known as ‘the Kirk’\) has experienced steady and rapid decline, with its influence and domination of Scottish public life and institutions peaking in 1956. At various times the Kirk has responded, for example by removing a layer of synodical governance, or advancing a programme of union and readjustment of parishes in response to a shortage of ministers \(Church of Scotland clergy\). His research showed that the Kirk has also periodically considered more radical reforms to its institutional structures, but either deferred these or only partially enacted them. Gay showed that the Kirk of the 2010s was in crisis, its membership having reduced from 1.32 million members in 1956 to 0.33 million. Gay’s research revealed the federal nature of the Church’s historic governance system and presented alternative forms of Presbyterianism from a broader global context, allowing him to suggest radical reform to address this crisis, simultaneously appealing to tradition and offering examples of alternatives. 

 Gay adopted a holistic approach to researching the history of Church structures, management and theology since the 1560 Reformation, reviewing the inherited compromises and structures resulting from its schism in 1733−1843 followed by the Presbyterian reunion in 1900 and 1929. When the old Kirk, which had evolved slowly over time, merged with a church that had been newly created in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, this created a highly centralised and bureaucratic organisation, and Gay identified that these qualities increasingly affected the reunited church from 1929. Between 1960−2017 this structure came to constrain managerial agility, innovation and change, and the Kirk’s financial systems tended towards centralisation, hindering effective use of funds. 

 Gay’s analysis included a strategic overview of how central Kirk structures in Edinburgh related to district\-level management in the presbyteries, including previous unsuccessful attempts at reform. Part of his original contribution was to emphasise, based on this historical analysis, that the reform of a federal structure must happen both centrally and peripherally, and that if the centre is reduced, the edges must simultaneously be strengthened. As an illustration of this logic, Gay argued that centralising training provision would maximise quality by allowing subject specialism, whilst devolving decision\-making about mission activities could empower individual faith communities. 

 Gay argued that the decade from 2020−2030 would be crucial for the Kirk, and that continuous and rapid decline since 1958 had already brought it near to the point where its work became unsustainable. Based on his analysis, showing that the then\-present degree of bureaucratic and economic centralisation as well as the number of presbyteries resulted from a nineteenth\-century contextual response, Gay advocated for a partial and flexible redesign of what he termed the systems architecture of the Kirk. A key reform needed, Gay argued, was presbytery reform: by reshaping and meaningfully devolving power to the presbyteries, the other necessary reforms would then be made possible. He went on to propose a package of reforms that quickly proved highly influential with the Kirk.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 By 2017 the Church of Scotland \(‘the Kirk’\) was facing serious and long\-standing challenges, including weighty bureaucracy, over\-centralisation, declining income, and lack of agility to respond to social and cultural change. These challenges were accompanied by  [declining membership](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17639525.church-of-scotland-loses-millions-in-a-year/) and influence: membership has declined by 80% since the 1950s, and attendance by c.4% per year \[5.1\]. Despite awareness of this, radical systemic change was not considered until Gay’s lecture series and the publication of *Reforming the Kirk* in 2017 \[3.3\]. 

 As a result, the 2018 Church of Scotland  [General Assembly](https://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about-us/general-assembly/guide-to-the-assembly) \(an annual event which brings together the councils and committees that govern the Kirk\) rejected the Kirk’s own official 10\-year strategic plan by 439 to 130 votes, with one member explaining the action \[5.2\]: *‘What we need is urgent, radical action. We have had 60 years of decline and it will be worse in 10 years.’* The General Assembly agreed instead to instruct the Council of Assembly \(the body with administrative authority over resources, finances and staffing between General Assemblies\): ‘ *to work collaboratively with other Councils, Committees and Presbyteries to bring proposals to the General Assembly of 2019 for structural change, consulting with the Rev Dr Doug Gay about the ideas contained in the recent Chalmers lectures’* \[ [5.2](https://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/news-and-events/news/2018/general-assembly-calls-for-more-radical-strategic-plan)\]. 

 Gay was then formally consulted by senior managers and by a Special Commission on Structural Reform. The latter was established following the 2018 General Assembly to propose changes to the implementation of Assembly decisions and the distribution of Church funds \[5.3\]. 

 The Commission’s report and plan were drafted in 2018−2019. The Convenor of this Special Commission stated: ‘ *the most significant single resource for our work was Dr Doug Gay’s* Reforming the Kirk *… At the outset of our work, each member of the commission was provided with a copy of his book, and during … our deliberations we met privately with Dr Gay’* \[5.3\]. 

 The Special Commission report and its  [Radical Action Plan](https://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about-us/radical-action-plan) were presented to and overwhelmingly approved by the 2019 General Assembly \[5.4\]. Its proposals aligned closely with Gay’s recommendations. The Radical Action Plan was subsequently incorporated into the Kirk’s Faith Action Plan, principles of which included: 

-  consolidation of presbyteries and other organisational reforms 

-  creation of a new trustee body 

-  centralisation and modernisation in the training of clergy \[5.5, 5.2\]. 

 The Convenor of the Special Commission stated that: 

 *‘In several respects, our final proposals reflected the recommendations of his \[Gay’s\] book – the shift in power and resource from the central to the regional and local church, a strong trustee body able to curb expenditure and eliminate annual deficits, the reduction in the number of presbyteries, the overhaul of the General Assembly and Kirk Sessions with a view to producing smaller bodies more able to enact change, and the need for the whole Presbyterian system collectively and simultaneously to embrace reform’* \[5.3\]. 

 Gay’s recommended reduction of the number of presbyteries from 46 to 12 is well underway \[5.3, 5.2\], with four new merged presbyteries formed in 2020 \[5.4, 5.5\] in Fife, Inverclyde, Aberdeen and Shetland \[5.2\]. *Reforming the Kirk* also recommended the merging of its four Councils, part of its hierarchical governance structure – Church and Society, World Mission, Ministries, and Mission and Discipleship – into one. In response, the Commission merged them into two: the Faith Impact Forum and the Faith Nurture Forum \[5.3\]. With this, the ‘ *cost of central administration’* was expected ‘ *to be cut by up to 30*%’ \[5.6\]. The Convenor of the Special Commission commented in November 2020 that ‘ *there is now active discussion of reducing to one agency’*, even closer to the original research recommendation \[5.3\]. 

 Decision\-making has also been devolved, from central administration to regional and local levels \[5.7\]. The former Council of Assembly was replaced by a newly created and  [more powerful](https://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about-us/our-structure/assembly-trustees) 12\-person body, the  [Assembly Trustees](https://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about-us/our-structure/assembly-trustees),  [created May 2019](https://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/68288/Assembly-Trustees-Update-May-2020.pdf) \[5.3, 5.2\]. This body is responsible for articulating the strategic priorities of the Kirk, has oversight of budgets and staff and manages the work of the General Assembly’s standing committees. It has an annual turnover of GBP120 million, and according to the Convenor of the Special Commission in November 2020: *‘is now in the second year of its work. Tighter budgets and staff cuts have been implemented, while a more strategic approach to core functions, buildings and improved governance has been adopted. … Success has already been achieved with mergers taking place in Fife, Inverclyde, Aberdeen and Shetland, while talks are progressing in other parts of the country with a view to further rationalisation in 2021. If anything, the current pandemic has generated increased recognition of the need quickly to implement a raft of changes.’* 

 The Kirk also adopted the research recommendations to establish a new growth fund of up to GBP25 million to encourage church planting, the generation and development of new faith communities and regeneration of existing congregations \[5.4\]. However, this aspect of the programme has had to be suspended due to the impacts of Covid\-19 during 2020 \[5.8\]. The General Assembly also agreed to centralise their five training centres, implementing another recommendation from *Reforming the Kirk*. Five centres, with relatively small cohorts, made it challenging to build training capacity and make effective use of specialists, and centralising resources is therefore intended to improve training quality. Tendering began in 2020, but was interrupted because of Covid\-19, which led to a shift to remote learning and the next steps in this process will be clarified in 2021 \[5.9\]. 

 These fundamental changes will affect all Kirk members, totalling, at the end of 2018,  [325,000 members in 1,341 congregations](https://ga.churchofscotland.org.uk/storage/uploads/council-of-assembly.pdf) across Scotland, and 18 additional international congregations. Census data indicate that around 1 million adults, c.18% of Scotland’s population, identify with the Kirk as their religious tradition, making it one of Scotland’s largest membership organisations and the largest single identifiable social grouping. As the Convenor of the Special Commission put it \[5.2\], Gay’s ‘ *findings and recommendations have made a significant impact in the long overdue changes that are now sweeping the Church of Scotland, the largest charitable body in the country’*. Though its size and influence are declining, a programme of reform with so major an impact on the Kirk still has significant reach into Scotland’s civic society and social fabric.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The International Criminal Court \(ICC\) is the only permanent international criminal tribunal to date. It has jurisdiction over the most serious international crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. Akande’s research on the various ramifications of state consent within the ICC’s legal framework has brought significant change to the Court’s judicial and prosecutorial activities and decisions regarding 1\) the immunity of senior state officials; 2\) bringing into force the crime of aggression and 3\) the classification of armed conflict and the scope of war crimes. It has also directly shaped the work of ICC prosecutors and judges, courts in ICC party states, and a major international NGO \(International Committee of the Red Cross\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Akande’s research has sought to explain the basis on which the International Criminal Court exercises its jurisdiction and the legal limits to the exercise of such jurisdiction over the nationals of states that are not party to the Court’s Statute. Akande’s body of research at the University of Oxford has looked at how the principle of state consent informs several contentious aspects of the ICC Statute. 

 **Immunities of state officials:** Akande’s work has focussed on the longstanding tension between securing accountability for international crimes and the immunities accorded to senior state officials which safeguard the independent exercise of state functions. He argued that the key to reconciling those two fundamental interests lies in the principle of state consent. In a series of articles **\[R1, R2\]**, Akande asserted that while personal immunities conferred upon heads of state, heads of government and ministers of foreign affairs applies under customary international law even in respect of the most serious international crimes, those immunities could be lifted by the United Nations \(UN\) Security Council explicitly or by necessary implication when referring a ‘situation’ to the ICC for prosecution. Since virtually all states in the world have consented to the exercise by the Security Council of the power to create international criminal tribunals, and, significantly, to displace immunities, the ICC Statute’s provisions on the non\-applicability of immunities would apply, even to States that were not party to the Statute, on the basis of the state’s consent to the UN Charter. This interpretation, disseminated in a 2009 article **\[R1\]**, became commonly known as the ‘Akande approach’ or the ‘Security Council route’ to immunities and was adopted in a series of ICC decisions relating to the prosecution of the Sudanese President. 

 **Crime of aggression:** After the drafting of amendments to the ICC Statute concerning the crime of aggression, controversy remained as to who could be subject to prosecution for this crime. In a seminal working paper **\[R3\]** and a subsequent journal article co\-authored with Professor Antonios Tzanakopoulos \(Faculty of Law, University of Oxford\) **\[R4\],** Akande argued that, even when activated, the crime could *not* be applied to acts committed on the territory of or by nationals of non\-ratifying states parties, to the extent that these had *not* consented to the amendments. Nevertheless, a referral of the situation to the Court by the UN Security Council would supply the necessary consensual basis to prosecute crimes of aggression committed by nationals of non\-ratifying states. 

 **War crimes and the classification of armed conflict:** Under the law of armed conflict, conflicts may either be international or non\-international and this determines which body of law applies to that conflict, including which war crimes are applicable in that conflict. In **R5**, Akande argued that central to classifying armed conflicts marked by foreign military intervention is the consent of the state on whose territory the hostilities occur. He concluded that if the territorial state does *not* consent to the foreign intervention, the conflict must be classified as international because there is an attack *against* the territorial state.

###  Reinforced the validity of ICC judgments relating to non\-immunity of Omar al\-Bashir 

 Akande’s approach to the interpretation of the ICC Statute’s provisions on immunities of state officials **\[R1, R2\]** has provided a key supporting rationale for the ICC decision that Sudan’s \(now\-former\) President, Omar al\-Bashir was not entitled to immunity from arrest and prosecution. Al\-Bashir is accused of committing genocide and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region, predominantly against three ethnic groups: Fur \(approximately 894,000 people in Sudan\), Masalit \(approximately 440,000 people\) and Zaghawa \(approximately 2,370,000 people\): the initial arrest warrant for al\-Bashir was issued by the ICC in 2009, whilst he was still a sitting head of state. Sudan is not a state party to the ICC Statute so the legality and validity of his arrest was under significant scrutiny, and in some cases, disagreement from both party and non\-party states. In April 2014, the ICC’s Pre\-Trial Chamber held, along the same lines as the arguments expounded in **R1**, that by referring the situation of Darfur \(Sudan\) to the ICC, the UN Security Council had necessarily applied the ICC Statute to Sudan **\[C1\],** meaning the Statute would operate to remove any immunities for al\-Bashir. The foundational role of Akande’s work on this issue was accepted by the Supreme Court of South Africa in a case following an official visit to South Africa by al\-Bashir in June 2015. Finding that this visit was unlawful, the Court cited **R1** when ordering the executive authorities of that country to cooperate with the ICC in arresting Bashir. The court’s decision in March 2016 **\[C2\]** stated: ‘ *The Government* \[of SA\] *called these principles* \[of state immunity\] *in aid in support of its position that President Al Bashir was immune from arrest and surrender in terms of the Implementation Act. It cited the authoritative statements by the International Court of Justice \(ICJ\)… the ICJ said \(para 58\) that it had examined State practice, including national legislation and decisions of higher national courts, but was unable to deduce that there existed under customary international law any exception to this rule where the individual concerned was suspected of having committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. This appears to be accepted by leading commentators such as Professor Akande* \[with footnote to **R1**\]’. 

 This legal reasoning was further elaborated by the ICC Pre\-Trial Chamber in July 2017, when it held that, by reason of the application of the ICC Statute to Sudan and the displacement of Bashir’s immunities, South Africa was also in breach of its obligation to arrest him during an official visit in June 2015 **\[C3\]**. Akande’s work was not cited in the decisions but the ICC’s reasoning mirrored the substance of Akande’s argument in **R1** which was publicly noted by two commentators from the blog of the European Journal of International Law i.e. “ *The South Africa decision* \[by the ICC\] *is more sophisticated than the DRC decision by taking up the suggestion of Dapo Akande to treat Sudan like a state party*”. **\[C4a–c\]**. ICC Pre\-Trial Chamber II made yet another finding of non\-cooperation in 2017 against ICC party state Jordan **\[C5\]** using the same approach proposed in **\[R1\]** and also citing the South African decision throughout as precedent. Following Jordan’s appeal of that decision, several ICC hearings in The Hague, and heated academic debate, the ICC Appeals Chamber upheld the finding of Jordan’s non\-compliance. In doing so, it explicitly acknowledged Akande’s research using his approach as one of the key grounds of its Appeal Judgment: with a footnote citing **R1** as the basis, it found: ‘ *Jordan could not rely on article 98\(1*\) \[referring to national prerogatives\] *as a basis to not cooperate with the Court*’ **\[C6\]**. Akande’s work **\[R1, R2\]** was also heavily cited in the Prosecutor’s response to Jordan’s appeal **\[C7\]**, with 29 references throughout, and the majority reflecting the court’s agreement with Akande’s argument that the application of the ICC Statute was legally valid: ‘ *As Dapo Akande points out, since “\[t\]he Court does not apply national law,”* this qualification *“would be redundant unless it was directed at authorities who would otherwise be bound by national law—national authorities*’. On 11 February 2020, Sudan's ruling military council agreed to hand over the ousted al\-Bashir to the ICC in  [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague) to face charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur. Al\-Bashir will in due course be forced to account for his actions – a historic moment in securing justice for the people of Sudan. 

###  Supported the activation of a new crime of aggression 

 Akande’s research on the crime of aggression helped culminate in the activation of this crime at the ICC. Akande was invited to verbally brief the Assembly of State Parties’ \(ASP\) – the ICC’s management oversight and legislative body – on the issues raised in **R4** \(as evidenced in a subsequent report, **C8**\). The report noted that these presentations were ‘useful to expand their knowledge and to illustrate legal and policy arguments for various positions’ and that ‘texts of the expert presentations were circulated to all States Parties after the meetings’ \[ **C8**\]. This informed their ultimate decision to activate the crime of aggression on 17 December 2017, which noted ‘ *with appreciation*’ the earlier report **\[C9\]**. This decision, effective from 17<sup>th</sup> July 2018, endorsed Akande’s interpretation of the aggression amendments \(that the ICC was precluded from prosecuting aggression committed by nationals of states that have not accepted the relevant provisions, even when committed on the territory of states that have accepted ICC jurisdiction **\[C9\]**\). Although not binding on ICC judges, this decision, as Akande argued in **\[R5\]**, must be taken into account by ICC judges when interpreting the aggression amendments. 

###  War crimes and the classification of armed conflict 

 Akande’s research **\[R5\]** was also used by Trial Chambers of the ICC when classifying the hostilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\)’s Ituri region. This armed conflict formed the factual matrix of the cases against Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda, both leaders of different rebel armed groups operating in that province. The conflict took place between several non\-state armed groups which initially made it a non\-international armed conflict \(as it was *not* a conflict between two or more states\). However, with Uganda’s occupation of parts of that region, along with its intervention in the conflict to fight against certain rebel groups, the classification of the conflict was rendered more complex. Relying on the criterion of consent, proposed by Akande in **R5**, the Chambers found that the presence of Uganda in the DRC’s territory without its consent, internationalised the conflict, as every Ugandan military attack on the territory was necessarily against the DRC. Akande’s work was directly cited in the *Katanga* Judgment **\[C10\],** rendered in March 2017, and indirectly in the *Ntganda* Judgment \(by cross\-references to the relevant findings in *Katanga*\), issued in July 2019 **\[C11\]**. This classification is crucial, as different rules apply to international and non\-international armed conflicts. By adopting Akande’s proposed criterion for classifying the hostilities, the ICC was able to identify the applicable war crimes and to hold perpetrators to account accordingly. Akande’s approach to classifying armed conflicts on the basis of state consent **\[R5\]** was cited several times by the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2016 **\[C12\]**, whose guidance on the rules of armed conflict is instrumental in securing compliance with international law and in reducing war casualties.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Computer vision, visualization and machine learning are state of the art techniques that require enormous computing power. Researchers at the University of Huddersfield have accelerated their practical application by developing techniques that enhanced data processing capability, thus enabling more data sources to be used, the data to be processed more rapidly and more knowledge to be derived. 

 Key impacts resulting from the underpinning research were as follows: 

-  The ShenZhen Public Security Department in China installed software that removed the need for human operators for 9,712 CCTV cameras, thus saving £8m. 

-  The global brand, Phoenix Bicycle was able to update its factories in China to be greener and more efficient, which also opened up new markets, using new computer vision techniques. 

-  A Chinese supplier of augmented reality\-based wearable devices for the visually impaired exploited UoH patents and grew their customer base to 80,000 whilst greatly improving the quality of life for users.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Advances in the overlapping spheres of engineering and computing have been increasingly driven by developments in highly specialised fields such as computer vision \(where computers replace the human eye\), visualization \(computer graphics, animation, and virtual reality\), machine learning \(where systems improve automatically\) and the software and systems strategies associated with them. Practical applications have multiple input streams containing data that must be analysed, combined, and interpreted. A key challenge is ensuring that the data processing burden is not so high that the system cannot be utilized in real\-time. Research at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) developed techniques that improved the speed of data processing, which were applied practically in field of visual and immersive computing. 

 The research described in this case study was carried out at the Centre for Visual and Immersive Computing \(CVIC\) at UoH. It was led by Professor Zhijie Xu \(Director of the CVIC, at UOH since 1999\). Other members of the team who aided the impact building included, in surveillance and security \(Dr Jing Wang\), automation and machine vision \(Professor Paul Scott, an associate member of CVIC\), and health technology \(Dr Duke Gledhill\). The work focused on three interlinked strands of expertise. New algorithms and techniques for real\-time CCTV analysis; smart factory automation based on machine vision; and improvements in data handling techniques in Augmented Reality \(AR\) product design used in health products for the visually impaired. 

 **Devising New Algorithms and Techniques for Real\-Time CCTV Analysis** 

 Globally, huge amounts of CCTV data are acquired daily by sources such as security cameras \(in the public realm\), private enterprises such as Tube and Dashcams for insurance firms, and private homes. The efficient processing of this data is now critical in numerous aspects of daily life, not least due to the heightened threat of terrorism and the consequent need for effective surveillance and crowd control. 

 The research focused on how to use machine learning to enable data from a video camera, to replicate the decisions of a human operator. A foundational study developed a system that used high dimensional information \(additional data streams\) to identify individual behaviors by constructing compact spatial and temporal signal representations. The techniques learned were further developed and applied to enable real\-time intelligent monitoring and early warning of emergencies in large\-scale networks monitoring crowds. 

 The research team devised a representational model of the environment and a corresponding scheme to code the scenario, based on category theory \(which enabled disparate data sources to be compared and interpreted\) \[3.1\]. In the model, ‘higher’ dimensional information such as individual pedestrian ‘actions’, crowd movement and the nature of the surrounding environment, were used to construct a ‘global’ model in which a subject’s movements in three\-dimensional space were inferred by combining multiple 2\-D images from CCTV cameras, and then geometrically represented as a whole. This enabled the individuals to be monitored as they moved, including from camera to camera. 

 When implemented, the model automatically updated and recognized changes in a subject’s behavior, motion, and context \(environment\) by applying a feature map fast vector coding scheme \(which ensures features in images can rapidly be identified\). The new model used advancements in Artificial Neural Networks \(created via so\-called deep learning\) combined with UoH\-developed heterogeneous scalable neural networks \(again designed to accelerate data analysis\) called the Treble Stream Semantic Network \[3.2\]. These were used to resolve the long\-standing challenge of accurate delicate \(subtle\) feature \(individual item of interest\) selection. It was used to process and classify complex crowd scenarios and enabled the recognition of changes in the behavior of an individual relative to their surroundings. 

 **Developing Smart Factory Automation Based on Information Visualization and Machine Vision** 

 Virtual Reality is an important platform for simulating and designing manufacturing systems. Its real\-world adoption was slow because complex manufacturing scenarios had to be treated as unique, meaning that each one was individually modelled in the VR environment. This made it particularly expensive to model large scale and complex manufacturing environments, such as assembly lines. The research solved the problem with a novel approach, a top\-down virtual environment construction model \[3.3\], which enabled, for the first time, a modular approach to building complex VR simulations. A software system which separated the “look” \(models\) and “feel” \(GUI and programme functions\) of the system, was designed and implemented. A general case was created, which was then applied to multiple manufacturing scenarios, resulting in reduced build time. The model incorporated practical processes that were leading\-edge in automated manufacturing at the time e.g., flexible manufacturing concepts such as cells, in a practical manner that led to optimised scheduling, reduced lead time and logistical cost saving. 

 The research \[3.4\] explored the whole manufacturing process from design to implementation on the shop floor. It used visualization techniques such as single view and stereo vision to improve the performance of robotics equipment, such as visual alignment for robot guidance \(which improved accuracy in part placement\), 3D detection \(which enabled a robot arm to pick up parts\) and parts measurement \(used for quality control\). Parallel computing hardware acceleration strategies \(based on adapting commercially available ‘gaming’ graphics cards\) were devised. These transformed algorithm\-acceleration approaches, originally developed for the software arena, to the computer hardware. Consequently, the algorithms ran faster. The faster online processing delivered, meant it was possible to incorporate deep learning capability \(i.e., an artificial neural network trained model that runs in real\-time\). 

 **Deploying Intellectual Property in Augmented Reality \(AR\) Product Design for Global Visually Impaired Population** 

 Scene recognition establishes the context of the objects in a ‘view’ \(a practical example of which is an ever\-changing streetscape\). It plays a crucial role in robotic navigation and localization, which is used in assistive technology, especially for the visually impaired. Current scene recognition techniques were prone to error, due to issues with their inability to distinguish individual features and a weakness in template matching \(which is used to identify specific elements of ill\-defined objects\). The research team developed algorithms described in international patents \[3.5\], which improved i\). the integrity of data supplied from multiple sensors \(e.g. IR, UV, ultra sound etc.\) and provided better signal quality for signal fusion \(2016\), and ii\). an open\-source scene recognition programming API \[3.6, 5.10\], that was made available for programmers to exploit on the IOS and Android platforms. It has transformed practice in the challenging domain of real\-time scene recognition by synthesizing data from multiple\-input sources in real\-time. 

 New developments included improved differentiation between passable areas and new obstacles \(for instance between a wall and a staircase\), and recognition of traffic lights and zebra crossings. The approach improved performance versus state\-of\-the\-art benchmarks in the acquisition of close\-range depth data. This used laser pulses in a similar fashion to sonar, to create a depth ‘map’ which was fused with other data sources, such as polarized infra\-red \(which allowed differentiation between a wall and a glass door\). The closest detectable range for the sensors was reduced from 650mm to 165mm with an accuracy of 95%.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings led to commercial impacts in three organisations in China. The impacts can be summarized under three headings: 1. New forensic imaging technologies for law enforcement; 2. Enabling automation in a bicycle factory; 3. Commercialization of wearable devices for visually impaired individuals. 

 **New Forensic Imaging Technologies for Law Enforcement** 

 CCTV is a pervasive tool for monitoring crowd behaviour and has had proven success in enabling the detection of suspicious individuals, such as terrorists and alerting the authorities to risks to individuals in large crowds. Each camera, however, needs to be monitored by a human operator, which introduces a non\-scalable cost factor. 

 Forensic imaging scientists at the Shaanxi Electronic Information Scene Investigation \(EISI\) in China collaborated with the UoH CVIC since 2010. One project \[5.1\] resulted in the creation of a real\-time crowd behaviour analysis capability \[3.1\] \(2016\). It was trialled as a live system in the southern Chinese city of ShenZhen and significantly reduced the number of people required for continuous \(24\-hour\) real\-time monitoring. It also improved the emergency response speed for public emergencies and reduced loss of life and damage to property \[5.3\]. 

 The technology \[3.2\] and IPs \[5.2\] were adopted by policing and public security bureaus in eight provinces in China \[5.4\]. In one example, the system has been installed in more than 640 sites \(such as streets, railway stations and parks\) in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, with 9,712 video cameras in the network. Since 2016 more than 22,000 abnormal emergencies have been identified. Multiple police, traffic control and crime prevention agencies provided positive feedback on the pilot system, which delivered an estimated cost\-saving to the public purse of 70 million RMB dollar \(£8m\) since 2016. Significantly, it is estimated that in the Sichuan Province alone, the technology saved over 3,000 security monitoring personnel. Based on the average cost of a police officer per year, the technology has reduced costs by up to 240 million RMB dollar \(£27.5m\) annually for the provincial public security and police departments in Sichuan. The Police Superintendent stated “… the crowd monitoring technology significantly reduced the cost of police resources including time, workload, and public grant” \[5.3\]. 

 **Enabling Automation in a Bicycle Factory** 

 The China\-based Shanghai Phoenix Company Ltd. produced 4.89 million bicycles in 2019 and exported to more than 50 countries. In 2000 the manufacturing practices of the company were similar to those seen in Europe in the 1920s. Since then, the company has collaborated with various global research institutions to accelerate the modernisation of its production lines. The CVIC at UoH provided research and consultancy\-based support since 2010, focused on the design and development of an efficient shop floor by utilizing virtual manufacturing\-based planning and simulation \[3.3\]. This enabled Phoenix to modernize its production operations to match current global best practice in just a decade, becoming more energy efficient and cost effective \[5.5\]. 

 The CEO of Phoenix stated “Prof. Xu’s expertise in industrial design and automation has greatly reduced the lead time to modernise and operate complex manufacturing and production environments. Substantial cost saving from labour and energy of up to 15 percent have been recorded in the past 3 years. The increased production capacity has also enabled the strategic redirection of the product type towards more green lines. For example, the partnership with the Shared Bicycle scheme \(OfO Ltd.\) exported Phoenix products to countries including France, United States and United Kingdom” \[5.6\]. 

 Visual guidance systems were jointly developed with the sector leading Second2None Machine Vision Systems Co. Ltd \[3.4\]. These included the ‘Long\-Rui’ series of smart vision sensors, which were applied to a series of vision appliances used for robot guidance, 3\-D detection, visual alignment, and welding control in two of Phoenix’s plants. The company has been able to sell the new product to Epsom and Yamaha. It has grown for five years in a row and was named a Star Company in Shenzhen City \[5.7\]. 

 **Commercialization of Wearable Devices for Visually Impaired Individuals** 

 The research facilitated ShiKe \(KrVision\) Ltd to commercialize wearables and headsets for the visually impaired in 2016. It exploited patented technologies \[3.5\] \[5.8\] and the open source API \[3.6\]. The product featured cutting\-edge functionality in scene localization, video augmentation and sign and text recognition, plus the capability to render the information synthesised from the data in audio form. It could remember a regular route followed by the wearer, which was used as a template that enabled greatly improved identification of new obstacles. In addition, the device expanded the ‘visual’ range of a totally blind person from the ‘point in space’ defined by a ‘white stick’, to a three\-dimensional hemisphere that radiated from the front face of the wearable device. The founder of the company stated, “… the collaboration with the CVIC at UK has greatly accelerated the release of our new AR kit” for the visually impaired community \[5.9\]. He added “The improved functions and new features on audio coding and feedback, semantic segmentation, street water pool and sinkhole identification have greatly benefitted the users and could not have been implemented so successfully without the collaboration with our international partners”. As a result of the joint effort, the company has grown from an SME in 2014 into a medium sized enterprise with a customer base of over 80,000 users across world \[5.9\]. 

 A visually impaired user of the wearable device said “My life has been utterly transformed by my new headset. I can now move about more easily outside my home, confident that I will have a better warning of any obstacles I need to avoid” \[5.8, 5.10\].

#  1. Summary of impact 

 The University of Manchester’s isolation of graphene has led to an array of products incorporating graphene, which deliver a range of performance improvements, including composite strength and wear resistance, heat management, noise dampening, low material weight, high electrical conductivity and microbial resistance. Graphene is a key component in some of the world’s bestselling cars, running shoes and smartphones. Graphene has been fundamental in the development and performance of numerous products that have dominated their individual markets. Within this impact period: 

-  Inov8 has sold \[text removed for publication\] running shoes worldwide \[text removed for publication\], with their graphene enhanced G\-grip soles. 

-  The automotive giant Ford has incorporated up to ten graphene components in the engine compartments of their Mustang and F\-150, including fuel rail and engine covers, to improve thermal management, mechanical endurance and reduce engine noise and vehicle weight.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2004, research conducted at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) demonstrated the existence of free\-standing two\-dimensional crystals, including graphene, boron nitride and an array of dichalcogenides and complex oxides **\[1\]**. This went against the Mermin\-Wagner theorem, which stated that non\-zero temperature thermal vibrations would destroy any 2D crystal at large distances \[Mermin N. D., Phys Rev 176, 250 \(1968\)\]. Isolation techniques, initially achieved by rubbing layered nano\-crystals against a solid surface **\[1\]**, and later by mechanical exfoliation **\[2\]**, offered a simple, cheap and reliable approach for isolation of these 2D materials. This, combined with the promise that the new class of 2D materials would offer a wealth of new physical phenomena for application across a range of industries, led to significant interest in the field. 

 Interest in graphene was further accelerated when Geim and Novoselov demonstrated that graphene’s electrical properties offered ballistic transport \(negligible resistivity to the passage\) of charge, a linear current\-voltage \(I\-V\) relationship, and could sustain huge currents **\[2\]**. These properties made graphene a target for research in semi\-conductor related industries where performance improvements of silicon\-dominated technologies were plateauing. 

 In 2016, Iliut *et al.* demonstrated that graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide flakes could be incorporated into elastomer latexes for composite production by dip or film casting **\[3\]**. The resulting thin\-film graphene composites demonstrated significant enhanced strength and elongation relative to pure latex elastomer. It was also shown that uniform dispersion of graphene within the matrix, control of graphene particle size, amount of graphene, and appropriate tailoring of the graphene\-polymer interface were essential for positive reinforcement.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 UoM has had direct and indirect influence on global advancement of graphene\-related products. This includes the initial isolation of graphene **\[1, 2\]** \(without which no impact at all from products could have occurred\), and direct development of graphene products to the benefit of specific companies **\[3\]**. 

 Products available on the market that explicitly use graphene to increase strength and wear whilst reducing overall weight of their composite components include: motorcycle and bicycle helmets \(e.g. MOMO FGTR Graphene 1.0 jet Helmet, Catlike Mixino\); bicycle tyres \(e.g. Vittoria Corsa G\+ Clincher graphene road tyre\); cycle shoes \(Catlike Whisper line\); bicycle wheels and frames \(e.g. Vittoria Qurano, Dassi Interceptor frameset\); fishing rods \(e.g. Century Graphex Lure \); golf balls \(e.g. Callaway Chrome Soft Truvis Red Golf Balls\); tennis racquets \(e.g. Head Graphene Touch Speed Lite\); wristwatches \(e.g.RM 50\-03 chronograph\); earphones \(e.g. MediaDevil BC\-01, Zolo Liberty and FiiO F3\); thermal rubbers \(AvanGRM rubbers\) and cars \(e.g. Briggs Mono R sports car, Ford F\-150 and Mustang \(discussed below\)\) **\[A\]**. 

 This case study uses examples from three companies to describe the extent of the impact from using graphene in their products, detailing the improved performance achieved in each case These examples are: 

##  4.1 Innov8 running shoes 

 Publication **\[3\]** drew the attention of Inov8 Ltd who, in 2017, engaged in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with UoM to explore the benefits of graphene composites for the outsoles of sports footwear **\[B\]**. The graphene\-enhanced composite developed from this KTP \[text removed for publication\] was commercialised as the G\-grip outsole, as part of the G\-series and other footwear products launched by Inov\-8 for challenging pursuits such as fell running, ultra\-marathons and high\-intensity training. 

 The first running shoes to feature G\-grip were launched in June 2018, followed by hiking shoes in Dec 2018. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

##  4.2 Ford insulating foams 

 Automotive giant Ford, in collaboration with Eagle Industries and specialist graphene supplier XG Sciences in the USA, has formulated a range of graphene\-doped polyurethane products for under the bonnet parts **\[Ci\]**. Graphene serves as a nucleating agent, producing a more reliable urethane structure made up of more consistent and smaller bubbles. The reduced density of the doped foams lowers the mass of polyurethane required for the product, offsetting the cost of the graphene and making adoption of the improved product cost neutral **\[Cii\]**. Dopant levels of less than 0.5 weight% graphene lead to foams with a 30% improvement in heat endurance, 17% reduction in noise transmission, 20% improvement in mechanical properties and an increase in compression strength between 20–30% **\[Ci\]** when compared to traditional non\-graphene equivalents. The company’s senior lead for emerging materials confirms the importance of graphene; “ *It is a win–win for everybody: the customer gets a quieter car with a more heat\-durable under\-hood foam*” **\[Ci\]**. 

 By the end of 2018, the Ford Mustang and F\-150 both incorporated up to ten graphene components around their engines, including fuel rail and engine covers, to improve thermal management, mechanical endurance and reduce engine noise and vehicle weight **\[Ci, Ciii\]**. Improvement of these features, crucial to reliability, fuel efficiency, performance, assurance of safety, and marketability were all achieved without additional material cost **\[Ci, Cii\]**, and have been used in the \(approximately\) 1,500,000 mustangs and F\-150s sold since the end of 2018 **\[Ciii, Civ\]**. 

##  4.3 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 Further products utilising graphene for its heat dissipation properties include: ski jackets \(e.g. Colmar G\+ Raptor\), solid\-state drives \(T\-Force Cardea Zero M.2 PCI\-E\), graphics cards \(MSI RTX 3000\), concrete additives \(e.g. GS Graphene concrete modifier\), air conditioners \(The Elesia Air Cooling Unit EL\-ACU\-1000\) and heated mattresses \(Xiaomi blankets\) **\[A, G\]**. 

 Alongside these examples other products have reached the market exploiting additional properties of graphene. These include microbial resistance, exploited in antimicrobial coatings \(GrapheneCA antimicrobial coating **\[G\]**\) and electrical conductivity. This has been developed in a range of products including: inks \(GRAPHINK, Cambridge Graphene inks **\[G\]** and Vorbeck materials inks **\[Aii\]**\), antistatic bags for protection of electronics \(GXT\-EST bags **\[G\]**\) and diagnostic sensors \(Nanomedical Diagnostics NHS Agile biosensor chip **\[Ai\]**, VIS\-SWIR linear array detectors **\[G\],** CN2 Nanobioelectronics Q\-Sense GO **\[Aii\]**\). 

##  Summary 

 The three companies provide examples of the reach of impact from using graphene in their products; all three have resulted in the improved performance capabilities of products.  Using estimates for total cumulative graphene production revenue \(just for the material itself\) within the window 2013 to 2020 **\[H\]**, and using a conservative estimate for product mark\-up of a factor of 100, the total revenue generated, in this REF period, from products containing graphene would be in the range of between GBP5,000,000,000 and GBP50,000,000,000.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by Professor Stephen Halloran into the Faecal Immunochemical Test \(FIT\), including a pilot of FIT within the national bowel cancer screening programme \(NHS BCSP\), was instrumental in the UK National Screening Committee’s recommendation for the UK\-wide adoption of FIT as the primary test for bowel cancer screening replacing the previously used guaiac\-based Faecal Occult Blood Test \(gFOBT\). The introduction of FIT has influenced healthcare policy in Scotland, Wales and England, with updates to NICE Guidelines made in 2017 and is expected to contribute savings compared with gFOBT of £26m per year. Since its introduction, FIT has increased Bowel Cancer Screening uptake by up to 10%, particularly for previous non\-responders and first\-timers, as well as hard to reach groups.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Colorectal cancer \(CRC\) is the second highest cause of cancer deaths in developed countries \(1.8 million cases, 896,000 deaths worldwide, 2017\). The aim of population\-based screening for bowel cancer is to reduce incidence and mortality through prevention by the removal of adenomas and earlier diagnosis. The National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening Programme \(NHS BCSP\) utilising the guaiac\-based Faecal Occult Blood Test \(gFOBT\) was rolled out in the UK in 2006. 

 In 2012, a study by Professor Halloran \(in collaboration with the University of Sheffield\) was undertaken on behalf of the NHS Cancer Screening Programme to inform future bowel cancer screening policy in England. This work concluded that comprehensive screening data would improve understanding of the disease and allow identification of optimal screening modalities **\[R1\]**. At that time, uptake for gFOBT was lower than for other cancer screening programmes due to the multiple faecal samples required. Professor Halloran \(in collaboration with University College London\) also identified that socio\-economic deprivation was consistently associated with lower gFOBT uptake **\[R2\]** therefore a test involving a simpler single sample approach was needed to help improve uptake overall and within these harder to reach groups. 

 The Faecal Immunochemical Test \(FIT\) specifically recognises human haemoglobin \(Hb\) in faeces and thus the presence of bleeding bowel cancers and pre\-cancerous polyps. Unlike gFOBT, FIT results are not influenced by the presence of other blood in stools \(e.g., animal blood ingested through diet\) or drugs that have oxidising or reducing properties. FIT therefore reduces the chance of false positives. In addition, FIT detects human blood at much lower concentrations, analysis is automated and only requires a single faecal sample \(compared to the 6 samples required for gFOBT\). FIT also provides a quantitative result facilitating the setting of appropriate thresholds to support optimal use of ‘post\-test’ investigation resources. 

 In 2012, to further develop the evidence\-base for the potential introduction of FIT in the UK, Professor Halloran led a study undertaken by the Guildford Medical Device Evaluation Centre \(GMEC\) based at the University of Surrey. This work evaluated four quantitative FIT products **\[R3\]** generating essential data on the pros and cons of the potential testing products that would be needed for rollout of FIT screening services. The evaluation also investigated standardisation issues including sample stability, sample mass, traceability and cross reactivity. 

 In 2014, Professors Halloran and Moss \(Queen Mary University, London\) led a large comparative study of FIT and gFOBT within the existing NHS BCSP at two Screening Hubs \(Southern; Midlands & North West\). Over a 6\-month period, 40,930 \(1 in 28\) participants were sent a FIT instead of a gFOBT. Overall uptake was 66.4% for FIT compared with 59.3% for gFOBT, a <ins>greater increase than had been achieved previously in any established screening programme</ins>.  Importantly, <ins>uptake by previous non\-responders almost doubled</ins> \(FIT 23.9% vs gFOBt 12.5%\) and <ins>an increase was observed across all deprivation quintiles</ins> with a 7.8 percentage point increase in the most deprived quintile \(FIT 54.3% vs 46.5% gFOBT\). Furthermore, and most critically, <ins>with FIT cancer detection increased two</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>fold and advanced adenoma detection nearly five</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>fold</ins> **\[R4\]**. 

 Professor Halloran collaborated with Health Economists from University of Oxford to explore the cost\-effectiveness of FIT at a range of positivity thresholds. It produced the first published economic analysis of FIT screening in England using data directly comparing FIT with gFOBT. Results for a cohort starting screening aged 60 years demonstrated that FIT is highly cost\-effective at all thresholds, results in quality\-adjusted life years \(QALYs\) gains compared to gFOBT and that a population screened with FIT would result in a total estimated cost saving of £26 million per year compared with gFOBT **\[R5\]**. In a further study involving Professor Halloran \(funded by the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care\), it was demonstrated that including routinely available risk predictors in the screening algorithm alongside FIT improves both the risk prediction model performance and test accuracy **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 On the 19th November 2015, as a direct result of the outcomes of the 2014 study conducted by Professor Halloran, University of Surrey **\[R4\]**, the UK National Screening Committee \(UK NSC\) recommended the adoption of FIT within the NHS Bowel Screening Programme as the primary test for bowel cancer **\[S1\]**. Following this recommendation, on the 7th June 2016 the Department of Health issued their media statement “ **New bowel screening test to save hundreds of lives**” announcing that FIT would replace the current gFOBT used in the NHS Bowel Screening Programmes in England, Scotland and Wales **\[S2\]**. Public Health Minister, Jane Ellison, stated “ **This new test is an exciting game changer for helping us beat bowel cancer. It is easier to use, will increase the number of tests and help us tackle cancer earlier**”. 

 In July 2017, NICE issued their guidance on the use of FIT testing for patients with low\-risk symptoms **\[S3\]**. Subsequent work commissioned by the UK National Screening Committee \(NSC\) to consider the cost\-effectiveness of a variety of different screening options and thresholds and directly citing Professor Halloran’s research outcomes **\[R1, R2, R4, R5\]** concluded in September 2017 that a FIT strategy is indeed more effective and less expensive than gFOBT **\[S4\]**. The roll out of FIT commenced in Scotland on 20th November 2017, Wales on 28th January 2019 and England in June 2019. 

 In Scotland, latest figures show, that following the introduction of FIT, the uptake of bowel cancer screening had already increased from 55.9% \(2016/17\) to 63.9% \(2017/18\). Moreover, the largest improvement in participation has been amongst those living in the most deprived areas \(42.0% to 51.8%\) where survival outcomes are often poorer. The number of men participating increased by more than 9 percentage points \(52.6% to 61.8%\) and there was an even greater increase in uptake \(8.2% to 18.4%\) amongst those who had never participated before, but previously had the opportunity to **\[S5\]**. 

 Wales began their phased introduction of FIT on 28th January 2019 with 1 in 28 random screening participants issued with FIT, mirroring the approach used in Professor Halloran’s research **\[R4\]**. Although it is too early for a full statistical analysis to be reported regarding the effect, the most recent data available from Public Health Wales Screening Division \(for the year 2018/19\) has already shown performance improvements compared to gFOBT. For example, the percentage of spoilt or rejected tests appears lower with FIT \(0.0%/0.2% FIT vs 1.1%/2.3% gFOBT\) **\[S6\]**. 

 Prior to the Welsh roll\-out, and in support of it, in December 2018 Cancer Research UK \(CRUK\) issued their “Engaging Primary Care in bowel screening GP good practice guide for Wales” **\[S7\]**; this cites Professor Halloran’s research **\[R4\]** as the primary underpinning evidence for the replacement of gFOBT with a FIT screening pathway. They reinforced the replacement of gFOBt by FIT in their Insights Brochure for GPs \(Insights Brochures are CRUK’s expert guides on prevention and early diagnosis of cancer for health professionals\) **\[S8\]** again citing the University of Surrey’s crucial work **\[R4\]** showing superior uptake associated with FIT. Further, it states that “ **The switch to FIT provides a great opportunity to raise screening with your patients**” and through achieving diagnosis “ **at the earliest stage \[ensure\] more than 9 in 10 people will survive bowel cancer for more than 5 years**” \[S8\]. 

 In summary, as a direct result of research conducted by Professor Halloran at the University of Surrey, national bowel cancer screening policy has changed to include the adoption of FIT as the primary screening test used in the NHS BCSP. Moreover, since its recent introduction, utilisation of FIT is radically increasing bowel cancer screening uptake across England, Scotland and Wales and is clearly already reducing inequalities in screening rates across Scotland. Given that early diagnosis is the most effective route to reducing deaths from colorectal cancer, this change in screening technology will directly contribute to lives saved.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Getting outdoors is essential for maintaining health and wellbeing throughout life. OPENspace research has kept this issue on the public agenda, influencing local, national, and international strategies to improve access to public green space. Deploying surveys, mapping, biomarker, EEG and co\-design methodologies, the research has provided new evidence about the health benefits of green environments, informing planning priorities, policy and guidance for bodies including the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), Scottish Government and Parliament, and UK local councils. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Research conducted through OPENspace, the research centre on inclusive access to outdoor environments based at the universities of Edinburgh and Heriot\-Watt, has generated new evidence that links access to green open space with health and wellbeing. Four projects funded by UKRI, NIHR and commissions from UK and Scottish Government bodies, examined the relationship between socioeconomic deprivation, Black and minority ethnic \(BME\) demographics, older people, and quality of urban green space. 

 a. The research involved a study of how residents value their local outdoor green space in a project commissioned by Forestry Commission Scotland: Woods in and Around Towns \(WIAT\) \(2006\-11\), followed by a quasi\-experimental study funded by NIHR \(GBP1.1M, 2012\-2017\). These studies evidenced how well\-designed woodland interventions in deprived urban locations can enhance residents’ perceptions and active use of open spaces in their neighbourhood, contributing to overall wellbeing and quality of life \[3.1\]. 

 b. The research team collected and analysed quantitative data on access to green spaces and health outcomes among deprived urban communities with significant BME populations. This led to the Community Green study for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, funded by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport and Department for Communities and Local Government \(2008\-9\). The project findings identified significant associations between poverty, ethnicity, and potential wellbeing benefits from access to green space in the UK \[3.2\]. 

 c. Supported by the GreenHealth project for the Scottish Government’s Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate \(2008\-2012\), the researchers used GIS \(geographic information system\) green space data alongside measures of the diurnal patterns in participants’ salivary cortisol \(which act as biological indicators of chronic stress\).  The findings showed how the amount of accessible green space in deprived urban environments makes a difference to residents’ mental health and social wellbeing \[3.3, 3.4\]. 

 d. The GBP1.5M grant, Mobility, Mood and Place \(MMP\) \(2013\-2017\) drew on participation from over 900 people aged over 65. One strand of this project deployed innovative mobile EEG \(electroencephalography, the detection of electrical activity in the brain\) to assess older people’s neural responses to contrasting environments. It identified neural patterns generated by engagement with green space, as opposed to built environments, that indicate potential restorative health effects for older people, including relief from fatigue, stress and low mood \[3.5\]. MMP also used co\-design research strategies to help older people in the community to articulate their criteria for age\-friendly local environments. This research highlighted the need for suitable pavements, benches, and street lighting, as well as four characteristics of places that influence quality of life: access for all; access to nature; access to others; and access to light \[3.6\].

 4. Details of the impact 

 The research has been developed and conducted in partnership with national and international stakeholders, who have regularly invited OPENspace researchers to provide evidence and to join or chair working groups that set the premises for policy, guidance and debate on the benefits of access to green public space. 

 Helping create urban green space strategies for the WHO 

 Initially invited to contribute because of the innovative approach to using biological markers of mental health in the GreenHealth project, Ward Thompson co\-authored section 2 of the WHO report ‘Urban Green Spaces and Health: a review of evidence’ \(2016\). This document summarises empirical evidence \(including OPENspace publications\), which led to recommendations for indicators measuring access to green space similar to the GIS data used in the GreenHealth study, and a toolkit for developing them \[5.1\]. 

 Another WHO report, ‘Urban Green Space Interventions and Health: a review of impacts and effectiveness’ \(2017\) provides a platform for guiding the design, implementation and evaluation of future Greenspace research. The review cites examples of OPENspace research, including the Woods In And around Towns project \[3.1\] which, it notes, contributed to proposals for local action on delivering effective urban green space interventions \[5.1\]. These two reviews, in turn, contributed to WHO/Europe’s ‘Urban Green Spaces: A Brief for Action’ written to support urban policymakers and practitioners in translating research findings into implications for urban planning practice. One of the key messages of this brief for action draws upon OPENspace work on inequalities \[3.2\], noting how urban green spaces deliver positive health, social and environmental outcomes; and upgrade the social and environmental quality of disadvantaged and deprived areas \[5.1\]. 

 Influencing UK policy and NICE guidance relating to access to green space 

 OPENspace research connecting health and being outdoors \(including \[3.1\]\) was included in an evidence review published by the University of Exeter and DEFRA in 2018 \[5.2a, b\] which, along with the WHO reports mentioned above \[5.1\] underpinned one section of the UK government’s 25\-year plan to improve the environment published in 2018 \[5.2c, pp. 71–82\]. ‘Connecting people with the environment to improve health and wellbeing’ has, as one of its targets, high quality, accessible, natural spaces close to where people live and work, particularly in urban areas, and encouraging more people to spend time in them to benefit their health and wellbeing \[5.2c, p. 28\]. 

 In March 2018, OPENspace was invited to provide expert testimony to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), which provides evidence\-based recommendations for health and care in England. The researchers contributed insights and evidence \[5.3a\] about the benefits from access to outdoor space, the barriers that elderly people face in engaging with the outdoors, and the ways in which these might be overcome. These were incorporated into published ‘Guidance on Physical Activity and the Environment’ \[5.3b\], which targets local authorities and other stakeholders, including public transport planners, workplaces, housing and local enterprise partnerships. 

 Five specific recommendations were based on OPENspace research \[5.3b\]: 

1.  Ensuring that people with limited mobility can safely move along and across streets and in public open spaces 

1.  Ensure that footways, footpaths and cycle routes are convenient, safe and appealing to users, and are built and maintained to a high standard 

1.  Making it as easy as possible for people with limited mobility to move around their local area 

1.  Considering ways to enhance the accessibility, quality and appeal to users of local open spaces, focussing particularly on communities who may not currently use them, for example those with low mobility, low income and some black and minority ethnic communities 

1.  Involving community groups and volunteers in decisions on how to design and manage public open spaces, including trails, footpaths and towpaths. 

 Influencing Scottish policy about access to, and the benefits of, green space 

 The GreenHealth report \[3.3, 3.4\] was commissioned to inform government understanding and policy on access to green space. Along with those of the WHO review \[5.1\], its conclusions, especially the emphasis on equitable access to green space that can be enjoyed and used recreationally for all Scotland's people, was highlighted in the Scottish Government’s consultation paper \[5.4a\] and discussed in the Scottish Parliament committee hearing \[5.4b\] as part of its 2018 review of environment policy. This review committed the Scottish Government to the continuation of the use of ‘Access to Green and Blue Space’ \[5.5\] as an indicator in the Scottish National Performance Framework. 

 This research also informed the development of the Place Standard by NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government and Architecture and Design Scotland \[5.6\], launched in 2016, which incorporates ‘natural space’ as an indicator of community wellbeing and demonstrates policy recognition of the link, reinforced by our research, between place and health. The Place standard quotes directly from section 2 of the WHO report \[5.1\], as well as the ‘GreenHealth’ project outlined above \[3.3, 3.4\]. 

 NatureScot, Scotland’s Nature Agency, used the research \[3.3, 3.4\] in a key paper to the then Cabinet Secretaries for Health and Environment in 2015, which led to the setting up of Our Natural Health Service \(ONHS\) in 2016. This is an action programme developed as a partnership between NatureScot, the National Health Service \(NHS\) Scotland and a range of cross\-sectoral national and local partners. The programme addresses the barriers within health and social care professions to recommending outdoor physical activity and contact with nature. A pilot evaluation in 2019 found that the four regional Green Health Partnerships \(GHPs\) established in 2018 as the cornerstone of the ONHS programme, had engaged with 230 partners, promoting 350 green health opportunities, delivered 225 capacity building activities, and connected with an estimated 11,200 people in the health and environment sectors. GHPs are referred to in 35 policies and plans across a range of sectors \[5.7\]. 

 **These national engagements have catalysed change in local environments, for example by informing planning guidance** for Moray Council \(pop. over 90,000\). Their Local Development Plan 2020 \[5.8\], which sets out priorities for the region over the next decade, now assesses compliance against key findings from MMP. The principal planning officer for Moray Council has endorsed our recommendation to institute “simple measures such as providing additional footpath links into landscaped areas, over and above the minimum, ensuring seating is provided for people to rest and reflect…and ensuring that landscaping stimulates the senses through colour, seasonal variation, promotes biodiversity and is accessible and multi benefit” \[5.8\]. Moray Council uses the MMP project materials to instruct planners of the link between “demographic and health pressures with spatial planning” \[5.8\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum of 100 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s neuroscience research team have developed, de\-risked and discovered the mode of action of cladribine, a new highly\-effective oral disease\-modifying therapy to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis \(MS\). MS is the commonest non\-traumatic disabling disease of the nervous system to affect young adults, with socio\-economic impacts such as unemployment and reduced quality of life. Cladribine tablets \(Mavenclad<sup>®</sup>\) were approved as a New Drug Agent by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) in August 2017, by NICE for use in the UK in November 2017 and by the FDA in 2019. Cladribine tablets have now been licenced in over 80 countries. Since the drug is given orally, in short courses, and has a very low monitoring and adverse event profile, it was one of only two therapeutic innovations to be selected by the NHS accelerated access collaborative in 2018.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum of 500 words\) 

 Multiple sclerosis \(MS\) affects about 3,000,000 people worldwide, including 1 in 300\-800 people in the United Kingdom. The immune system drives the production of damaging neurological attacks that lead to permanent disability. This leads to socioeconomic issues relating to unemployment and reduced quality of life. Relapsing MS \(RMS\) is the commonest type, with 85% of individuals with MS diagnosed with RMS. RMS is two to three times more common in women than men. Research in Queen Mary’s Centre for Neuroscience has focused on developing a protocol for the off\-label preparation of cladribine for use in patients with RMS who do not fulfil NHS England criteria for treatment with licensed disease modifying drugs \[3.1\]. Cladribine is a small molecule purine analogue that was originally licensed to treat hairy cell leukaemia. The research has addressed the following questions: 

 **Efficacy**: \(1\) Prof. Giovannoni is the international principal investigator \(PI\) of the oral cladribine phase 3 development programme. Giovannoni helped Serono, a pharmaceutical company, acquired by Merck in 2006, do due diligence on the in\-licensing of a patented oral formulation of cladribine for clinical development. As PI and member of the trial steering committee, Giovannoni first helped model pharmaco\-kinetic and pharmaco\-dynamic data from the intravenous formulation of cladribine to select an oral dose range for clinical development \(data on file at Merck\). Giovannoni then helped design and write the trial protocol for a large phase 3 trial of cladribine tablets in RMS.  The trial showed that cladribine is a highly effective disease\-modifying therapy \(DMT\) to treat RMS, with relative risk reductions in the annualised relapse rates of 57.6% and 54.5% for the two doses of cladribine studied compared to placebo [](https://paperpile.com/c/DLOJ00/o7fa) \[3.2\]. 

 \(2\) A post\-hoc analysis of the phase 3 trial was done that showed that a subgroup of patients with highly\-active relapsing\-remitting MS had a greater response to cladribine tablets \[3.3\]. In addition, the 3\- and 4\-year results of the blinded extension study showed that just 2 short courses of treatment over 2 years resulted in the majority of patients staying in remission in years 3 and 4, ie without the need for additional treatment \[3.4\]. 

 **Safety**: Prof. Schmierer performed a meta\-analysis of malignancies in all phase 3 trials of DMTs in RMS and showed that cladribine was not associated with an increased risk of malignancies \[3.5\]. The meta\-analysis showed that due to zero cases in the placebo arm of the phase 3 trial of cladribine tablets, the perceived malignancy risk represented a false positive signal \[3.5\]. This study was instrumental in convincing Merck\-Serono to reconsider oral cladribine as a licensed treatment for RMS. 

 **Mode of action**: Prof. Baker led on detailed immunological studies performed at Queen Mary that have delineated that the mode of action of cladribine in people with RMS is via the prolonged suppression of peripheral memory B cells \[3.6\]. This has led the team to define a new class of MS DMTs called immune reconstitution therapies, and facilitated the adoption of cladribine tablets as a highly effective, safe and easy to use and monitor DMT for highly active RMS. 

 Thus, Queen Mary’s research has led to the use of cladribine tablets to treat attacks \(“relapses”\) and prevent disability in people with RMS, some of whom may even be considered cured given their long\-term freedom of disease\-activity without further treatment intervention. This has allowed wider international access to an affordable generic formulation of cladribine, enabling people with MS in lower and middle\-income countries access to effective disease modifying treatment.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum of 750 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s neuroscience research has resulted in the successful repurposing of cladribine, a small molecule purine analogue originally licensed to treat hairy cell leukaemia, into an oral formulation to treat patients with highly active relapsing MS \(RMS\). 

#  Access to effective, affordable treatment for patients with active RMS 

##  In the NHS 

 Following Merck’s withdrawal of cladribine from the market in 2011 due to concerns about cancer as a side effect, Queen Mary’s neuroscience team has focused on generating an evidence base to alleviate these concerns. They presented the licencing package to the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) and the oral variant was approved as a New Drug Agent in August 2017 \[5.1, 5.2\]. This was approved for use in the UK and US following a NICE appraisal in November 2017 \[5.3\] and by the FDA in 2019 \[5.4\] respectively, based on the team’s evidence \[3.1\]. This is a novel global medicine sold under the trade name Mavenclad® by Merck \[5.5\]. 

 Cladribine tablets are given as short courses \(up to 20 days of treatment over 4 years\), are well tolerated, have very few adverse effects, and therefore have a low monitoring burden. Both the brevity of the active intervention and the fact the medicine can be taken at home aid treatment adherence. Thus, there is potential to significantly increase access to treatment for patients with RMS and at the same time reduce healthcare utilisation. Cladribine tablets are also the only capsule in the range of disease modifying drugs that does not contain beef gel, making it suitable for vegetarians and Hindus, thereby providing greater scope for personalisation of treatments \[5.6\]. As a result of these favourable attributes, in October 2018, the NHS named cladribine tablets a ‘rapid uptake’ product to be made accessible to more patients through the Accelerated Access Collaborative \(AAC\) \[5.7\]. The AAC identifies, and then actively supports the adoption of innovations that have the potential to transform the care of NHS patients. This adoption made the drug available to over 50,000 patients and provided cost savings to the NHS of GBP30,000,000 \[5.8\]. It is one of only two therapeutic innovations to be prioritised as part of the AAC in 2018. Queen Mary, in partnership with the UCL Partners Academic Health Science Network, has designed a national programme to promote the rapid adoption of cladribine tablets. So far, over 24,000 patients globally have been treated with cladribine tablets \[5.5\]. 

##  In resource\-poor settings 

 The Queen Mary developed off\-label protocol \[5.9\] for using generic subcutaneous cladribine for patients with active RMS who do not fulfil NHS England criteria for treatment with licensed treatments. This protocol has been published, widely disseminated, and is now being used by clinicians in resource\-poor countries to treat people with RMS. This has enabled affordable access to cladribine as a treatment for RMS in low\- and middle\-income countries. In total, cladribine tablets have now been licenced in over 80 countries worldwide \[5.5\]. 

#  Cost savings for the NHS 

 The use of generic cladribine for treating RMS has led to substantial savings for the NHS. The cost of treatment is GBP1,300 \(20 x GBP65/10mg cladribine maximum dose\) compared to GBP56,360 for alemtuzumab \(8 x GBP7,045\), excluding the costs of monthly monitoring for 4 years after the last dose, and management of the secondary autoimmunities which occur in 30\-50% of people treated, as a side\-effect of this treatment. 

#  Commercial success of cladribine tablets \(Mavenclad<sup>®</sup>\) 

 In 2018, Merck reported a 42% decline in net income to EUR247,000,000 for Q2, but the new drug Mavenclad helped the company maintain organic sales growth, bringing in a revenue of USD23,000,000 \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Essex research provided the benchmarking data and protocols to assess health\-related fitness in youth. These benchmarks were essential in establishing Fitmedia Ltd. \(a fitness assessment business which evaluates health and wellbeing in youth\). Fitmedia’s award winning assessment programmes work with over 50 schools and community organisations, assessing over 8,000 children and directly influencing charities. Within this impact case are two examples of how this work enhances the activities of two youth charities, London Playing Fields Foundation and Rackets Cubed \(R<sup>3</sup>\). Fitmedia informs public debate by providing evidence \(underpinned by this research\) supporting the importance of child fitness assessment to five working parties of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for a Fit and Healthy Childhood. 

 The research has influenced local practice directly at Active Essex and Essex County Council, supporting the development of new assessment methods in the area of physical activity, changing evaluation practices \(thus facilitating more effective use of public money\) and enabling the Council to access GBP10,000,000 funding to transform the delivery of physical activity locally. 

 Internationally, the research has influenced policies in education and public health in Bogota, Columbia, directly enabling accurate fitness assessment of over 95,000 children and informing new health and fitness recommendations to improve the physical capacity and muscular fitness of the schoolchildren. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Essex’s Health, Exercise and Active Lifestyle \(HEAL\) research group produces theoretical and applied research relating to health, exercise and activity. This research is then used to inform progress in health behaviours, especially in children’s health and wellbeing. 

 Despite being the most powerful indicator of children’s health, aerobic fitness is not routinely monitored in the UK. A series of reviews \(2006\-7\) showed downward trends in fitness based on data gathered in children from 53 countries. No data were available for England due to total absence of any published research. This led Sandercock to undertake two large childhood fitness surveys in England. In 2008, Sandercock assessed fitness of a representative sample of volunteer schools providing a sample of over 300 children aged 9 to 11 years old. Comparing test scores from the Chelmsford Children Fitness and Activity Survey \(CCFAS, 1998\) with data collected in 2008, it was established that both physical capacity \[R1\] and muscular fitness \[R2\] had declined. Furthermore, the 9% decline reported in physical capacity was double the global rate of decline reported previously \[R1\]. 

 Sandercock \(aided by Gladwell and Taylor\) followed up the CCFAS with a seminal study on older children: the East of England Healthy Hearts Study \(EoEHHS\). This was the first large\-scale evaluation of fitness providing much\-needed reference data for multiple elements of physical fitness in English children aged 10\-16 years \[R3, R4\]. EoEHHS produced the first data on English children’s fitness and the first open access data of this kind when deposited on the UK Data Service \[R5\]. This enabled detailed international comparisons and investigation of potential correlates. 

 The CCFAS demonstrated the sensitivity of multiple indices of fitness \[R1, R2\] when used as an objective outcome measure of children’s physical health. The EoEHHS demonstrated how large\-scale assessments of children’s fitness were feasible and could be cost\-effective \[R3, R4, R5\]. These messages were clearly set out in \[R6\]; a battery of simple fitness tests in children could be both cost effective *and* informative for governments and educational providers to understand the benefits of PA programmes on health and wellbeing. Furthermore, understanding the context of different settings, including barriers and facilitators \(for example the importance of play environment in schools in PA levels \[R7\]\), is crucial to enabling stakeholders to embed evaluation and thus gain learning and insight from PA programmes in youth.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **A. Fitmedia: fitness assessment in children \[S1, S2, S3a,b, S4, S5, S6a,b\]** 

 **Four** areas where the University of Essex’s research \[R1\-5\] achieved impact through Fitmedia: 

 **\(i\) Impacts on the economy: a new business has established its viability \[S1, S2, S3a,b\]** 

 The company Fitmedia was established in 2013 for the commercial exploitation of the fitness assessment protocols in children developed by Sandercock and his collaborator \(Cohen\) in \[R1\-R5\]. Although the company was initially set up in February 2013, nearly all of its activity was in the period 2014\-2020. Sandercock is one of the four founding Directors and is Fitmedia’s Director of Testing. According to the Director of Strategy and Operations at Fitmedia, Essex Research *“provided the foundations of the company. Without the research work, there would be no reference data*. W *ithout the reference data, there would be no ability to provide benchmarking protocols, to accurately assess children’s fitness and physical aptitude. Without the benchmarking protocols, Fitmedia as a company would not be able to provide its products and services*. *Without Fitmedia, schools and children across England would not have information about their fitness and physical abilities*” \[S1\]. 

 The Company is a microbusiness set up without loans or investment funding to ensure that the business model and growth could remain under the Directors’ control and the aims of the company would not be compromised by external or conflicting interests. It has proved its viability during the period 2014\-2020 as evidenced by \[S1\]: turnover for the period 2018\-2019 double that achieved for the period 2013\-2014, employment for six part time trainers; running 59 separate assessment events totalling over 8,000 children across the South and South East \(Boroughs or Local Authorities including  Devon, London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Essex\) to a diverse clientele including; primary, secondary and SEN schools, community organisations, and charities. In 2015, Fitmedia was a finalist for the Sports Technology Awards as the “Best Technology to Promote Participation in Sport”. In 2019, it was awarded Global Health and Pharma magazine’s “Leading Providers of Children's Fitness Analysis & Assessment – UK” \[S2\], and in 2020 they awarded Fitmedia “Best Children’s Fitness Analysis and Testing Specialists – UK”. In 2020 it was named “Global 100” magazine’s “Leading Provider of Children’s Fitness Analysis & Testing” \[S1\]. 

 **\(ii\) Impacts on public policy: informing policy debate with research evidence \[S3a,b\]** 

 The All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for a Fit and Healthy Childhood was formed to promote evidence\-based discussion and produce wide\-ranging reports on all aspects of childhood health and wellbeing to assist policymakers to reach decisions based on best evidence. Fitmedia, utilising Essex research, were part of the working group that contributed to five APPG reports: Healthy Patterns for Healthy Families \(Oct 2014\); Early Years \(Nov 2014\); National Obesity Framework \(Jan 2016\); Physical Education \(Oct 2016\); and PE and Sport Premium \(Feb 2019\). Particularly relevant excerpts from the reports include: a recommendation “ *to encourage Local Authorities to undertake fitness assessments on the children in schools in their area*” \[S3a\] and “ *Fitmedia Ltd undertook an intensive evaluation of an intervention financed by the PESS Premium at a school in North London in 2013\-14; the assessment methods used indicated that the money had been well spent and in a subsequent Ofsted testing, the school rating of ‘Outstanding’ was augmented by the fact that the inspectors specifically praised the assessment of attainment in the PE programme*” \[S3b\]. 

 **\(iii\) Impacts on improving wellbeing and influencing a charity \(LPFF\) \[S4, S5\]** 

 The London Playing Fields Foundation \(LPFF\) was one of the UK’s first sporting charities \(established 1890\). According to LPFF’s Chief Executive their vision is to create a “ *happier, healthier, more cohesive London through protection, provision and promotion of playing fields*” \[S4\]. Coppermile is a project based on The Daily Mile, delivered by LPFF and Coppermill primary school, Waltham Forest. The Chief Executive states “ *to measure the impact of the project we decided to evaluate changes to the children’s physical fitness and psychological wellbeing. Fitmedia Fitness was recommended to us because of their research into child fitness testing and expertise in evaluating other areas of a child’s development such as wellbeing and self\-efficacy”* \[S4\]. 

 The evaluation showed improved fitness levels in the children \[S5\] and it also increased academic outcomes: “ *The school believes that the Coppermile also contributed to excellent academic outcomes; overall the majority of pupils in both year groups made better than expected progress. In addition, during SATs week all Year 6 pupils completed the Coppermile every day before sitting each test. The results they achieved, in meeting the end of key stage 2 expectations in all areas of English and maths, was significantly above the estimated Waltham Forest and national standards*” \[S5, p10\]. 

 LPFF concluded that “ *Fitmedia Fitness’s work on this project strengthened LPFF’s commitment towards evaluating the impact of physical activity interventions. It reinforced our belief in the importance of providing independent and objective evidence to prove the value of such interventions*” \[S4\].  As a result of working with Sandercock and Fitmedia, LPFF are wishing to “ *share the experience of the Coppermile project with other schools and playing field providers so that they can implement something similar in their own setting*” \[S5, p12\]. 

 **\(iv\) Impacts on improving wellbeing and influencing a charity \(Rackets Cubed\) \[S6a, b\]** 

 Rackets Cubed \(R<sup>3</sup>\) is a charity that runs integrated Squash, Tennis, Education Maths and Nutrition Programmes for children at local schools in areas of High Deprivation. In 2018, R<sup>3</sup> began a year\-long educational and physical activity intervention at one Primary School in Roehampton.  The intervention was targeted at pupils from Years 4 and 5 to help improve their health, fitness and basic maths skills. R<sup>3’</sup>’s founder \[S6a\] explains that Fitmedia were engaged to carry out an evaluation of the impact of the project on the children’s physical literacy and fitness. Fitmedia’s evaluation showed that the programme was successful in improving the physical fitness of the participants \(fitness improved more in Year 4 than in Year 5, and slightly more in boys than girls\). As a result of that evaluation study, R<sup>3</sup> were allocated increased funding and expanded their charitable work, to run intervention projects in seven areas across England \[S6a\]. The project was expanded to look at the children’s self\-efficacy and confidence and due to run over the academic year from September 2019 to July 2020 \[S6a\]. Fitmedia was again engaged to assess the impact across each project. Initial baseline assessments were taken in Sept/Oct 2019, but due to the COVID\-19 health crisis, and the closure of schools, the project was terminated and final assessments in July 2020 were not available. However, the charity responded to COVID\-19, aided by Fitmedia’s evaluation: “ *The experience of Rackets Cubed from their previous work and the evaluation of Fitmedia enabled Rackets Cubed to run a 5 week pilot project, for children aged 9\-11.The project provided physical activity programmes for children from three selected primary schools in Roehampton. Fitmedia evaluated the impact on the children’s physical fitness and personal self\-efficacy across three areas \(doing sport, activity outside school, and learning and concentrating\)*.” \[S6a\]. Using the findings from Fitmedia the founder of R<sup>3</sup> stated that “ *Fitmedia’s evaluation showed that the project had a significant impact on agility. Agility improved significantly for both genders and across all three age groups. The project also had a positive effect on the children’s personal self\-efficacy. Across the entire cohort, the increased confidence was much more prevalent among the boys than the girls\[…\]. The findings have led Rackets Cubed to run an adapted COVID Recovery Programme and run a larger COVID Recovery Impact study beginning in September 2020 \(see https://twitter.com/RacketsCubed/status/1297872462273810434\). In summary, had it not been for the research, which you undertook at the University of Essex, the benefits outlined here could not have been achieved”* \[S6a, S6b\]. 

 **B. Active Essex and Essex County Council \(ECC\) \[S7, S8\]** 

 **Impacts on public policy and health: research used to change current processes or services and identify new services to be provided.** 

 Active Essex is the Sport and Physical Activity Partnership for Essex County Council \(ECC\). Active Essex’s Strategic Lead for Education and Skills stated that their “ *collaboration with you \[Sandercock\] and your fellow researchers \[Gladwell\] at the University of Essex began in 2013*” \[S7\] and continued through 2014\-2020. “ *We were aware of your research into child fitness assessment \[R3, R4\] focussing on fitness levels and obesity in young people. We also knew of your expertise in evaluating other areas of a child’s development such as wellbeing, self\-efficacy and so chose to collaborate with you on numerous projects*” \[S7\]. 

 In 2016 Sandercock worked \[G1\] with Active Essex and ECC to evaluate the school\-based interventions aimed at promoting physical activity \(including the Primary PE and School Sport Premium\). Sandercock worked with ECC first, to: *“develop and deploy a measure of children’s physical self\- efficacy, self\-esteem and wellbeing*” then *“evaluate the impact of the … Premium on teaching efficacy in primary school teachers across Essex*” \[S7\]. This work promoted stakeholder collaboration within ECC because it “ *dovetailed with the work that the County Sports Partnership is doing to support schools in their delivery of the Primary PE & Sport Premium.”* The scale and objectivity of these evaluations all stakeholders to *“make the most effective use of the funding”* \[S7\]. 

 Sandercock’s assessment and evaluation programme “ *has provided schools with insight that has informed future planning. This is particularly the case with two schools which required a School Improvement Plan in line with OFSTED determination*” \[S7\]. Sandercock impacted policy of a local authority as he “ *significantly influenced Active Essex’s decision to recommend that schools evaluate the impacts of the Golden Mile and Daily Mile on pupils’ physical and mental wellbeing*” \[S6\]. Furthermore “ *Active Essex’s attitude towards evaluating the impact of physical activity interventions for children has been influenced by your \[Sandercock\] research and we now recognise its importance and benefits. We feel that our collaboration exemplifies how a university can work with a county organisation for the betterment of the county”* \[S7\]. 

 Gladwell built on these ongoing collaborations, and the Head of Commissioning for Public Health and Wellbeing writes because of her “ *expertise in evaluating areas of development such as wellbeing \[and\] self\-efficacy*”\[R7\] \[S8\] she was seconded to ECC in 2017 \[G2\]. Gladwell was based at County Hall in Chelmsford one day a week to “ *build on the innovative work undertaken by the University of Essex to inform how we use the considerable resources, in pursuit of improving the physical emotional and spiritual wellbeing of the Essex population*."" \[S8\]. Working with ECC and Active Essex, Gladwell and her team explored “ *evaluating more of \[their\] physical activity services/programmes and to embed more behavioural change training within \[their\] offer*” \[S8\]. This culminated in ECC being one of the twelve consortia awarded GBP10,000,000 to implement Sport England’s local delivery pilot schemes to transform “ *the delivery of physical activity locally*”. Gladwell was “ *a key partner in assisting ECC to win this award*” \[S8\]. “ *Further, due to the evaluation work carried out, these projects originally funded by ECC or Local Delivery Pilot have now gained funding from other sources to support continuation or new projects that they are running helping to provide additional benefits to residents of Essex”* \[S8\]. 

 **C. Fitness assessment in Columbian school children \[S9, S10\]** 

 **Impacts on public policy and health: research used to identify a new service to be provided, which led to proposals for new health and fitness guidelines in children.** 

 In 2014, based on the research of Sandercock \[R2, R4, R6\], the Secretary of State for Education in Bogota incorporated fitness assessment into a regional health study, the Prueba Bar Survey: “ *Evaluando Nuevas Formas de Aprender:* *Bienestar físico, ciudadanía y convivencia""*  \(Evaluating New Ways to learn: physical wellbeing, citizenship and living together”\). The Secretary of Education for Bogota acknowledged \[S9\] the “ *important role \[our\] research played in influencing our policy on assessing the physical health of schoolchildren in Bogota*.” In particular \[S9\], “ *The publication of your data from the East of England Healthy Hearts Study regarding the importance of assessing children's cardiovascular \[R4\] and muscular \[R2\] fitness and your appraisal of the importance and cost\-effectiveness of fitness assessment in health monitoring \[R6\] helped us to choose which tests to perform in our surveys. In Bogota, our survey team collected data … using methodologies similar to those used by yourself and Dr. Cohen in the East of England Healthy Hearts Study \[R6\] and the Chelmsford Children's Fitness and Activity Study*” \[R2\]. 

 Data was collected on 41,173 children in 2014 and 55,856 in 2015 \[S9, S10\]. The detailed fitness results were published in a report by the Superior Mayor of Bogotá \[S9\]. Based on the data collected and consequent concerns about the future health and wellbeing of the children tested, recommendations were made to education institutions to improve the physical capacity and muscular fitness of the children. Most notably these included specific recommendations for:  the integration of physical activity into normal lessons and the implementation of active breaks between class of 5 to 10 minutes to include stretching, vertical jumps and walking around the room \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into Orcadian Neolithic archaeology by the University of Highlands and islands \(UHI\) has created the conditions for substantial regional economic growth. This includes fieldwork undertaken by staff at UHI’s Archaeology Institute, both within and beyond the World Heritage zone known as the ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’. The research has enabled the development of heritage tourism, as well as associated infrastructure and goods. It has also delivered cultural impact through a range of media changing the perceptions of a global audience. In turn, coverage has driven engagement with archaeological research among local citizens, helping local communities to understand and appreciate their heritage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The long\-term research into the Neolithic period of Orkney \- particularly in the World Heritage Sites \(WHS\) and buffer zone by current UHI Archaeology Institute staff \- began with the discovery and excavation of Barnhouse and fieldwork at satellite sites including Maeshowe \[3.1\]. This research helped make the case for the ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ to be established as a WHS which was granted in 1999 \( *https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165/*\). The subsequent establishment of a WHS research strategy \[3.2\] resulted in further field\-based research leading to a range of discoveries such as the Ness of Brodgar \[3.3\] and further fieldwork at Maeshowe passage grave, Ring of Brodgar, and the Stones of Stenness \[3.4\]. 

 Beyond the World Heritage Sites, a substantial number of Neolithic sites and ‘settlement landscapes’ have been discovered and continue to be investigated by UHI Archaeology Institute staff. These include: Vestra Fiold \(Richards\), Ha’Breck \(Thomas\), Knowes of Trotty \(Downes\), Wideford Hill, Stonehall, Smerquoy \(all Richards\), Crossiecrown \(Card & Richards\) \[3.5\] and Cata Sand \(Downes & Richards\). Taken together, this substantial body of research has enabled sophisticated charting of Orcadian Neolithic settlement history, unparalleled elsewhere in northern Europe \[3.5; 3.6\]. 

 Continued research by Institute staff at the Ness of Brodgar \[3.3\], the Ring of Brodgar \[3.4\] and the wider WHS landscape \[3.6\] adding to previous results from Barnhouse \- has radically transformed understanding of Neolithic dwelling practices and monument construction. This covers the WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ and buffer zone, including the extraordinary density of settlement adjacent to these great monuments. UHI excavations continue at the Ness of Brodgar \(2008\-2020\) uncovering a vast settlement complex with stone\-built monumental structures. Currently, more than 30 structures have been discovered, many standing over a metre tall covering an area of c.3 hectares. Described as the most spectacular Neolithic architecture in northwest Europe, the sheer scale and visual spectacle of the numerous monuments and ongoing Ness of Brodgar excavations have ensured continual national and international academic interest together with widespread coverage in the mainstream media. This long\-term research programme has helped to elevate the status of Neolithic Orkney to be perceived as a claimed ‘cultural capital of the ancient world’.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 ‘Unquestionably among the most important Neolithic sites in Western Europe’ are those in Orkney’ states UNESCO, further describing them as ‘monumental masterpieces’, with the group constituting ‘a major relict cultural landscape graphically depicting life in this remote archipelago north of the coast of Scotland five thousand years ago’ \( *https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165/\).* UHI Archaeology Institute research informs the interpretation and presentation of these sites to a world\-wide audience enabling enhanced and far\-reaching appreciation of this extraordinary expression of Neolithic culture. Between summer 2014 and 2020 more than 700,000 people visited the WHS *Heart of Neolithic Orkney* in what is a remote archipelago of \~ 22,000 inhabitants. The robust data for increased visitor numbers during the REF period relates to WHS Skara Brae and the Ness of Brodgar only. Many other archaeological sites such as Ring of Brodgar, Stones of Stenness and Barnhouse are unattended, and freely accessible to visitors. WHS Skara Brae saw an increase of \~ 26,000 during the period with a notable increase in 2017 \(Fig. 4.1\). Open day numbers at the Ness of Brodgar follow this trajectory, both benefiting from and reflecting enhanced media attention based on ongoing UHI research. For example, of visitors surveyed 64% knew of the UHI Ness of Brodgar excavations in advance and 63% said it was very important/important in their decision to visit Orkney \[5.1, p12\]. 

 **4.1 Economic impact** 

 Member of the Scottish Parliament \(MSP\), Liam McArthur says that ongoing UHI research projects in the WHS “are a major tourism draw for Orkney and the excavation \[Ness of Brodgar\] has been demonstrated to be a key driver in the visitor economy” \[5.2\], a sentiment mirrored by Orkney islands Council in recognising ‘the short term local economic value of this project is exceptionally high and the long\-term awareness raising potential is enormous’ \[5.9, annex A\]. 

 UHI archaeological research has indeed made a substantial economic contribution to the local economy through the large increase in independent tourists visiting Orkney during the REF ‘impact’ period. Many visited archaeological sites, particularly the accessible ongoing excavations at the spectacular Ness of Brodgar. The rise in independent tourist numbers \- from 142, 816 in 2014 through to 174,273 in 2017, with an additional 113,000 cruise liner passengers – increase tourist revenue from £31m to £50m \[5.3\]. Overall, this increase has helped to transform the local economy and in 2017 more than half \(62%\) of all visitors were ‘heritage tourists’, with 40% identifying that archaeology as the main reason for their visit. \[5.6, p29\]. Approximately 80% of tourists visit an archaeological site in Orkney, and as a proportion this far exceeds Shetland \(57%\) and the Outer Hebrides \(44%\) although both island groups have outstanding archaeological remains. However, the research and presentation of Orkney archaeology has become a model for their own economic development \[5.4, p 15\-7\]. 

 Neolithic archaeology, particularly excavations at the Ness of Brodgar, offers substantial economic impacts to the local community \(5.5, p12\). Economic beneficiaries include tour guides, accommodation, service providers, and transport companies. There are now 28 Orkney\-based tour companies noted in a guide list provided by the Visit Orkney Tourist Information Centre in Kirkwall.  Fully three\-quarters of these businesses highlight Neolithic archaeology on their websites and/or other promotional material \[5.5, p6\].  Specialist/guided tours frequently visit the Ness of Brodgar during the excavation period, 59 such guided parties – a total of 770 people \- visited the site in 2018\-19. This is summarised in table 4.1 \[5.5, p13\-14\]. 

 **Table 4.1 Economic impact of ‘heritage visitors’ to Orkney** 

| *Period* | *No. of*  *Site Visitors* | *No. of Visitors \(excluding Orkney Residents\)* | *No. of visitors for whom Ness of Brodgar was Very Important* | *Average Tourist Visitor Length of stay \(Nights\)* | *Average Daily Expenditure*  *GBP* | *Total Expenditure during trip to Orkney*  *GBP* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2012\-19 | 101,250 | 87,075 | 25,252 | 5.3 | 68 | 9,100,821 |
| 2018 | 18,200 | 15,652 | 4,539 | 5.3 | 68 | 1,635,856 |
| 2019 | 18,500 | 15,910 | 4,614 | 5.3 | 68 | 1,662,886 |

 As an example, multiplying an average stay of 5.3 nights and £68 daily expenditure \[5.6, p53; 5.5, p14\], by the number of visitors for whom the Ness of Brodgar was *very important* in their decision\-making \[5.1\] generates a total expenditure figure for 2019 of £1,662,886 \[5.5, p14\]. The number of local jobs supported by this spending can be estimated by applying the ratio of £50,000 expenditure:1 FTE job \(including multiplier\) giving a total of 31 local jobs created in 2019 \[5.5, p16\]. 

 Locally, exhibitions such as 2015’s *Art and Artefacts – Ness of Brodgar* helped to push the annual number of visitors to Stromness museum over 11,000 for the first time \(11,976 in 2015, an increase of 3,606 on the 2014 figure of 8,370, a normal annual figure between 2000 and 2014\).  The 30% increase in visitor numbers in 2015 \- substantially attributed to the exhibition \- helped to improve the 2015 financial performance of the independent Stromness Museum \[5.7\]. Neolithic archaeology is generating wider economic impact, such as the July 2019 launch by Highland Park of 5000 bottles of its highly successful limited\-edition *Ness of Brodgar* malt whiskey \(sold out\). 

 **4.2 Changing perceptions of Orkney and its Neolithic heritage through media exposure** 

 Wider appreciation of the spectacular nature of Orcadian Neolithic archaeology is enhanced by UHI research in the WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ zone \[3.1 \- 3.4\] and beyond \[3.5 – 3.6\]. The research continues to compile evidence of a complex and rich Neolithic society living more than 5000 years ago. Awareness and appreciation of this society has reached a worldwide audience via social media, TV and radio, newspapers, magazines, and public lectures. Between 2016 and 2020 the Ness of Brodgar excavations/Neolithic Orkney appeared more than 600 times in the national and international media, and the Ness of Brodgar over half a million website and Facebook visits \(5.5, p11\). 

 In August 2014, a front\-page feature in National Geographic Magazine showcased UHI research within the WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ \[5.8a\] The UHI excavations established a claim to Orkney as a ‘cultural capital of the ancient world’. This precept formed the basis of a 2017, three\-part, BBC documentary which not only altered overseas perceptions of the archaeology of Orkney but also engendered internal pride and shift in appreciation by local communities of the world\-class significance of their archaeological heritage. The series – *Britain’s Ancient Capital: Secrets of Orkney* – was based on the UHI excavations in the WHS area and generated an audience of 2.1m viewers, almost 9% of the total available UK audience \[5.8b\]. The series was ‘infectiously enthusiastic’, according to a review in *The Daily Telegraph* \[5.8c\]. It also caught the popular imagination by proposing that a number of ancient customs and artefacts – including stone circles and pottery – originated in the rich cultural milieu of Neolithic Orkney, including the structure of Stonehenge. Other, earlier programmes – such as BBC2’s *Orkney’s Stone Age Temple – A History of Ancient Britain Special*, presented by Neil Oliver \[5.8d\] – have now been viewed more than three million times, and are regularly repeated on terrestrial television. 

 In addition, in 2017 a BBC News Channel Travel Show featuring Neolithic archaeology reached an estimated 350 million worldwide \[5.8e\]. As an indication of the effect of the substantial media coverage in 2017, the number of tourists visiting WHS ‘Heart of Neolithic Orkney’ increased considerably that year, as shown in Figure 4.1. Social media amplifies the reach and awareness of Neolithic archaeology. The Ness of Brodgar’s Facebook page attracted more than 290,000 views and its website more than 137,000 page views over a six\-week period in 2019 \[5.5, p11\]. 



 **Figure 4.1. Increasing visitor numbers for WHS Heart of Neolithic Orkney Skara Brae: note the 2016\-17 jump from 93,375 – 110,028 visitors \(source: Historic Environment Scotland\).** 

 **4.3 Further engagement in heritage as a consequence of UHI Neolithic research** 

 Visitor numbers to the Ness of Brodgar reached over 18,500 during the 2019 excavation period, and two Open Days had over 1000 visitors each day; Some 83% of visitors to the Ness of Brodgar excavations \(sample size 750\) state that the experience had increased their interest in archaeology/heritage, while 82% said they were more likely to visit further archaeological sites in Orkney \[5.1\]. Research\-based narratives of the Neolithic Age through a broad array of media coverage have had substantial impact locally, leading to greater engagement with heritage and fostering community\-based research. As an example, Orkney Islands Council sponsored a successful 2019\-21 National Lottery Grant of £60K for a Neolithic ‘Tombs o’ the North’ project, under which local communities are researching and conducting fieldwork in six of the Northern Isles to produce Neolithic chambered tomb trails. This enhances island heritage and local tourism in outlying areas. Equally, community involvement in the Cata Sand excavations of a coastal eroding Neolithic settlement in Sanday enhanced local understanding of the effect on island communities of rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and climate change. In conclusion, it is challenging to capture the numerous ways in which Neolithic archaeology, specifically, has become embedded in the local community through societies, museum groups, volunteers and in particular, school projects and classes; as MSP Liam McArthur says ‘I would wish to note for the record the considerable investment in time in engaging local schools and young people in what is happening at the Ness of Brodgar’ \[5.10\]. In short, Neolithic archaeology is efficacious in the social and economic fabric of Orkney – and beyond.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The mental health and wellbeing of professional athletes in general and, in particular, sports which emphasize ‘mental toughness’ and are considered to reinforce masculine stereotypes, has been highlighted as an area of concern. Research conducted at the University of Huddersfield has identified key areas of improvement in welfare support in elite\-level rugby league. As a result of the research, the Rugby Football League \(RFL\) made policy changes \(affecting all twelve Super League clubs across the UK, France and Canada\), which have markedly improved the service Player Welfare Managers \(PWMs\) can provide for players. Benefits include increased awareness, uptake and access to player welfare, and mental health benefits for both players and PWMs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professional rugby players have traditionally had limited welfare support, with the majority of support directed towards improving on\-field support. However, professional rugby players are in a vulnerable position with short careers, uncertain contracts and a reluctance to seek help. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in male elite athletes in team sports is as high as 45% and rugby has been described as having a ‘toxic culture’ of denial of mental health problems. 

 The research, undertaken at the University of Huddersfield, was conducted between 2015\-2016 led by Dr Kiara Lewis in collaboration with Dr Susanna Kola\-Palmer and Dr Alison Rodriguez. The work was also supported by undergraduate and PhD students at the University. The team worked closely with the Player Welfare Director \(PWD\) in devising the study aims and objectives and she \(PWD\) was instrumental in feeding the results back to the RFL \[5.1\]. The research produced evidence on the needs, assets, deficits and future requirements of welfare support which was fed back to the RFL who then made substantial changes to policy and practice to change welfare provision across the sport. Specifically, the research has contributed in the following ways: 

1.  **Demonstrated to the RFL that the players’ attitudes and knowledge of the availability of mental health support is a significant independent correlate of their mental well\-being.** 

 Lewis, Kola\-Palmer and Rodriguez used an anonymous online survey of professional rugby players to assess their knowledge of and attitudes to RFL player welfare. The survey incorporated psychometrically sound, standardised measures of mental health, psychological stress and athletic identity as well as specific questions on the then current welfare provision to assess awareness \[3.2\]. In year one, 77 players completed the survey \(25%\), and in year two 169 players \(47%\) completed the survey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time UK and French elite rugby football league players have been surveyed and levels of symptoms of mental health mapped and, it is also the first\-time elite athletes’ engagement with, knowledge of and attitudes to sport player welfare have been investigated. The relationship between more positive attitudes and knowledge of mental health support to better mental health, is a novel and important finding in RFL \[3.3\]. The results suggest that endeavours to increase positive attitudes and knowledge, and to reduce mental health stigma, may have real benefits in terms of increasing mental health. 

1.  **Emphasised that PWMs perceived they were unable to support all the players’ needs in the time available and felt under considerable pressure themselves with, at times, little support from clubs and coaches.** 

 A qualitative study using total purposive sampling was conducted with the PWMs, in total 11 of the 12 PWMs across the UK and France were interviewed in the first year and 12 of the 14 in the second year. The interviews that were conducted used an asset\-based approach to identify the assets, deficits and opportunities. The findings showed that PWMs perceived demands of the job were, for many, too high on a part\-time basis \(a majority of clubs had PWMs on 3 day a week contracts\) and in some cases was impacting on their own welfare. They felt that they were unable to provide all the welfare support needed and that they were being impeded from their job by a lack of support from the club and coaches \(without buy\-in from the coach, players would not engage\) \[3.1\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 A report was produced for the Rugby Football League \(RFL\) following each year of the study \[5.2/5.3\]. The reports were given to the Player Welfare Director \(PWD\) who took them to the RFL board, Chief Executive Officers and coaches at each club, and the Player Welfare and Education Forum which brings together key stakeholders in player welfare. The reports were therefore viewed by those with managerial and everyday responsibility for player welfare at all twelve Super League clubs \(with responsibility for approximately 400 players\). The research was deemed essential by the PWD for the changes in welfare provision to occur: “ *People are probably sick of hearing the University of Huddersfield Survey said, because I use it all the time, because it does just give the outside validation to something. It creates a greater impression; it’s much more difficult to be argued against when it’s done independently*” \[5.4\]. 

 The research led to the following benefits to the people involved in professional rugby league: 

1.  Increased support for the mental health of PWMs 

1.  Increased awareness of welfare support and more positive attitudes of players 

1.  Employment of full\-time PWMs through a change in RFL policy 

1.  More positive attitude of clubs towards welfare support 

 **1. Increased support for PWMs’ mental health \(Quality of Life impact\):** 

 One of the recommendations from the first report was that a support strategy was needed for PWMs as well as additional qualifications and training \[5.1\]. This was picked up by the RFL and thereafter PWMs were provided with a workshop by Sporting Chance \(who provide mental health support\) to help them in recognising signs of depression. The PWMs have also had to undergo formal supervision through Sporting Chance at least once a year. Additional sessions are now offered if the PWM has had to deal with a particularly traumatic event \[5.4\]. Following the second report the RFL agreed to continue to centrally fund Sporting Chance so their services are free to all players and PWMs who need them \[5.3\]. This has been recognised by PWMs as important in supporting their own mental health; when asked what impact the report had had on him personally one PWM replied “ *The bits of care for us as Welfare Managers has been good. So, the opportunity to speak to somebody from Sporting Chance has been valuable and I have done it a couple of times because we take on a lot, we do take a lot on ourselves, everyone dumps their problems on us at times*” \[5.5\]. 

 **2. Change in awareness and attitudes of players towards welfare \(in particular mental health\) support \(cultural impact\):** 

 The first report recommended that the RFL needs to further reinforce and communicate the importance of player welfare priorities, and players should be made aware of welfare policy and know who their player welfare manager is \[5.2\]. Following the release of the report all players \(currently over 400 players across twelve clubs in UK, France\) were provided with a booklet outlining the player welfare provisions that are available to them. PWMs were encouraged to present to all players at the start of the season and to hold a social occasion for players’ parents and partners to explain the provision that is in place \[5.6\]. 

 The results of the second survey showed that player awareness had improved: 75% of players \(compared with 69% in 2015\) now know their club has a welfare policy and 78% \(compared with 58% in 2015\) know how to access mental health support \[5.3\]. This is supported by player X “ *I wasn’t aware of all the support and the welfare that was around where I feel like \(PWM\) and the club make a conscious effort now and making everything clear of what you can get and help and everything*” \[5.7\]. 

 There are a number of other quotes from the second round of interviews \(following changes made following the first set of interviews\) with the PWMs. These illustrate the PWMs’ experience of the changes in awareness and attitudes of players as a result the research: 

 *“Players are now asking me types of questions which they weren’t asking a couple of years ago, do you know what I mean* \[Interviewer *: yeah*\] *. So yes, its busier, but its busy because a lot of it is now being driven by the lads asking questions as opposed to me having to go to them”* \[5.7\] 

 *“It’s \(Sporting Chance\) vital and again in that culture shift, now that one or two lads have had help and received help and know there’s help out there, it’s encouraging others to speak up”* \[5.7\] 

 Interviewer *: “do you think, has there been any change in the culture of whether or not players will seek help and seek advice?”*  Respondent *: “Yes, yes, because the more it becomes public, as long as it’s out there, the players have sought help and when players are going round doing presentations of, you know, sticking their hand up and saying ‘look, I had depression, I were an alcoholic, I had a gambling addiction’, that sends a message across then, that yeah, it all of a sudden becomes acceptable”* \[5.7\] 

 *“I think speaking as myself, as a former player, I think the cultural changes, the perception of Sporting Chance and the range of services they offer have certainly changed. As I say, it was, at first, it was oh he’s a drug addict, or he’s a gambler or he’s an alcoholic and its certainly not that. I think we really appreciate the vast array of services that they offer”* \[5.7\] 

 **3. Change in RFL policy to ensure all clubs employ a full time PWM \(Public Policy impact\):** 

 The second report \[5.3\], having found that PWMs were struggling with the demands of the job, recommended that the all Super League clubs should have a full\-time PWM \(the majority at this time were employed on 3 days per week contracts as the role was not considered to be as important as other club roles\). Following the recommendation, the RFL announced that all 12 Super League clubs would have a full time PWM \[5.9\]. Further revisions to the Player Welfare Policy included reference to ‘Athletic Identity’ \(as players whose identify was more closely linked to being a rugby player, rather than a husband, parent etc., were at greater risk\), an increase in career 1\-2\-1s, and a more structured policy of targeting ‘hard to reach’ players \[5.10\]. The move to full\-time has been recognised by the PWMs as the most important change for them.  “ *For us, I suppose one of the main things that came out of it \(the research\) was clubs moving to full time provision*” \[5.5\] and how that benefits players “ *the biggest benefit to me of it being full time is the time that I have to spend with players, without any other responsibilities*” \[5.5\], they go on to explain it can benefit both players’ mental health and performance “ *I feel if you get the welfare provision right at the club, there is a, there is added benefits actually from the performance point of view as well*” \[5.5\]. 

 **4. Change in attitude of clubs towards welfare support \(Social Impact\):** 

 In the first report the high risk of depression of players was highlighted. Having received this information there were changes in practices to make player’s mental health more prominent. This is supported through correspondence with the PWD \[5.6\] “ *Information on depression has now meant we have a more strategic way of “screening” the lads every morning. This means there are daily well\-being surveys but also a 6 weekly mental health questionnaire to try and pick up on any signs*” \[5.6\] 

 The RFL Player Welfare Policy has been revised to follow a holistic personal development model. Workshops included time management, mindfulness etc. Our research is referenced in the policy guidance \[5.10\] and attracted lots of media coverage \(over 15 articles in local, regional, national and international news outlets\). 

 This change has been seen from all areas of the RFL structure as described by a PWM: 

 *“I would think more so in the last sort of eighteen months, I think, he’s \(CEO\) coming to understand that the role \(PWM\) is a necessity within the Clubs and I think that, you know, I’m actually benefitting from that*” \[5.8\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through her research on EU Law and specifically on EU migration, Professor Catherine Barnard has played a key role in informing policy makers and the public on the legal aspects of Brexit before, during and since the 2016 EU Referendum. Barnard provided legal input into a series of reports published by the ESRC\-funded *UK in a Changing Europe* initiative and worked directly with MPs, policy makers, journalists, and civil society organisations to inform Brexit debates. MPs and policy makers attest to Barnard’s contribution and her expertise has been much in demand on national radio and television in high profile discussions during the Brexit process. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning this case study stems initially from Barnard’s deep expertise in EU law and trade law. Barnard is the author of two leading undergraduate textbooks in EU law \[R1, R2\] *.* The first is now in its sixth edition and the second in its third edition. In addition, she has published extensively on the impact of EU law on national law, looking in particular at labour and migration law issues. 

 Barnard has also carried out empirical research on these issues under a series of ESRC\-funded grants.  She studied the use \(or underuse\) of employment tribunals by EU\-8 migrant workers in the UK and the implications of the Brexit process for them and other vulnerable workers in the UK labour market \[R3, R6\].  She also examined the narrative of EU migrants being lured to ‘honeypot Britain’ by generous welfare benefits. This research drew on a range of methods including observing employment tribunals and working with the case files of the Free Representation Unit \(FRU\). Key findings were that there was little evidence of migrants coming to the UK simply to claim benefits, and that those appearing before tribunals were often long\-term residents \[R5\]. 

 A further strand of research has looked at Brexit and trade. The ESRC\-funded *UK in a Changing Europe* initiative funded Barnard to work with Emilija Leinarte on mobility provisions in Free Trade Agreements \(FTAs\) as a potential template for the future UK\-EU trade deal. The research involved analysing the citizens’ rights provisions of the UK\-EU Withdrawal Agreement and the evolution of the concept of EU citizenship. 

 *UK in a Changing Europe* also supported Barnard’s research on legal options for free movement post Brexit. Working with Sarah Fraser Butlin, Barnard’s contribution looked at the history of the evolution of the EU rules on free movement, the origins of the idea, and how it has developed since the early 1950s \[R7\]. The work proposed different legal arrangements for ‘managed migration’ options, which included more controls for the host nation along with retaining some of the benefits of existing EU free movement rules. Most recently in the ESRC\-funded *Working Hard or Hardly Working* \(2019\-2022\), Barnard has worked with Fiona Costello and Sarah Fraser Butlin looking at the impact of Brexit on migrant communities, initially through the operation of the EU Settled Status scheme \(EUSS\), and subsequently through the analysis of the work of GYROS, a welfare advice charity in Great Yarmouth, tracing the evolution of claims brought and how they are dealt with.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Advancing public knowledge and understanding** 

 Barnard used a variety of formats \(townhall events, podcasts, vodcasts, blogs as well as a film\) to chart what the UK public wanted out of Brexit in respect of migration and to contribute to improved public understanding of Brexit\-related issues.  Prior to the 2016 referendum, she was involved in numerous ‘town hall’ and ‘Question Time’ style events \(Norwich 27.01.16; Exeter 25.06.16; Aylsham 4.05.16; Spalding 23.05.16; Canterbury 31.05.16 and Belfast 07.06.16\); a panel discussion at UCL, ‘Brexit Divisions II’ 22.03.16; and a students’ mini\-referendum and quick response event\). The vodcast ‘What would Brexit mean for free movement?’ had over 11,000 views. See **\[S1\]** for further details of all the above. 

 Barnard also undertook extensive media engagement \(see **\[S2\]**, with details of over 700 interviews\). These included: interview on immigration, BBC Trending/Google Trending, Nottingham \(16 June 2016\); interview with Time Magazine about the migration crisis \(3 June 2016\); interview with *Sky News* on migration and deportation \(2 June 2016\); interview, *ITV News at 10* about migrant rights \(1 June 2016\); ‘Migrant workers – lessons from the research – and round table with EU migrant workers in the UK’, Radio Cambridgeshire \(31 May 2016\); interview in International Business Times, New York, on Brexit and free movement \(18 May 2016\); free movement of workers in the agriculture sector, *Farmers Weekly* \(6 May 2016\); Migration and the EU, interview with LBC/Heart FM, \(29 April 2016\); Brexit and migration, *ITV news*, \(13 April 2016\); would Brexit make it harder to hire EU workers?, The Guardian, \(30 March 2016\); World at One, interviewed on immigration and changes introduced by renegotiation deal \(20 Feb 2016\). See **\[S3\]** for details of media impacts. These engagements drew directly on Barnard’s migration research \(in particular **\[R4\]**, **\[R5\]**\). 

  

 Extensive public engagement continued after the referendum. On 22 May 2017 she made a launch of a report and film on public attitudes in the aftermath of the 2016 vote. She took part in the Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit, 9\-10 Sept 2017, organised by UCL’s Constitution Unit, which involved working closely with EU nationals contemplating the future of migration. The demographically mixed audience voted in favour of limited controls on migration. It was followed up by a briefing session for MPs in Westminster 13 Dec 2017, discussed by Polly Toynbee in the Guardian \( **\[S4\]**\). 

 Barnard also appeared on television \( *Question Time*, *BBC Breakfast*\) and radio \( *Any Questions*, *Brexit for the Perplexed*, *Law in Action*, the *Today* programme, *The World Tonight*, *World at One* and regularly on 5Live\). Examples of work in the print media include: *Prospect*, 2 Nov 2017, interviewed and featured in ‘Can Britons keep their citizenship after Brexit?’; Economist, 12 Apr 2017; briefing discussion with Anushka Asthana, *Guardian*, on citizens’ rights, 26 June 2017; briefed and was cited in ‘Would Brexit Violate EU citizens’ rights’, *EU Reality Check*, BBC, 4 July 2016\); NS interview with John Humphrys on Today and *BBC World*; interview on *Channel 4 News’* special programme on migration post Brexit with Krishnan Guru\-Murthy, 22 June 2018. The Public Policy Editor at the Financial Times describes in his testimonial how he has ‘often relied’ on Barnard to inform his reporting in much of his coverage of Brexit \( **\[S4\]**\). In addition, the BBC Political Correspondent for the World Service has added on air and in correspondence that he and many other journalists are hugely in debt to Barnard for her willingness to share her expertise and learning, a willingness the Correspondent refers to as a ‘public good’. **\[S5\]** 

 Barnard launched her own podcast @2903cb, made further podcasts with UKICE, and participated in University of Cambridge’s *Talking Politics* podcast \(REF2021 case study being submitted to UoA19\). 

 From a listener to the 5Live, 22 Jan 2019: ‘ *…I just wanted to say how helpful I found your explanation of the Brexit options on the Emma Barnett programme this morning. I’m just the man on the Clapham Omnibus. So nice to have things explained, not simplistically, but clearly.’* **\[S5\]** 

 **Briefing policy makers** 

 Barnard used research findings **\[R4, R5, R6, R7, R8\]** as well as her broader expertise in EU law **\[R1, R2\]** to advise and brief a range of politicians and civil servants, from the UK and EU, on legal aspects of the Brexit process.  This included briefings to MPs in the SNP, Conservative Party, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrat Party \(see **\[S6\]**\). She briefed a core group of Conservative MPs, on the day of the meaningful vote, on ‘What is a Customs Union?’; briefed Rory Stewart MP on the differences between a customs union and a free trade area; worked with House of Commons library staff and MPs on the impact of ‘no deal’; gave evidence to select committees, including the inaugural meeting of the Brexit select Committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee and the Treasury Select Committee; briefed the EU’s Taskforce on Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom \(TF50, led by Michel Barnier\) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Brexit team in Berlin on the politics and policy of withdrawal from the EU in the UK; briefed the Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office on the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Act 2018, the Home Office on migrant rights, and the Department of International Trade on GATS; gave confidential briefings to the Bill team on the early text of the EU\(W\)Bill; and took part in the Bingham Law project, led by Dominic Grieve MP, briefing, inter alia the Solicitor General on how the EU\(W\)Bill could be improved. 

 Feedback and reports from government officials indicate that Barnard’s work had tangible impacts on Brexit debates. A blog post on the problems of putting a definite Brexit date in the legislation was picked up and cited extensively by the Duke of Wellington in the House of Lords and led to an amendment \(which was then partially reversed in the Commons\). Evidence given to the Justice Select Committee was cited by Baroness Ludford in further debates on the EU\(W\)B \( **\[S7\]**\). 

 Barnard worked directly with parliamentarians on what a future UK migration policy might look like. She gave evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee \(Justice and Home Affairs\) on Brexit, human rights, free movement of persons, and alternative remedies, on 2 November 2016. The report was published and featured in the Guardian which referred to evidence Barnard gave.  She gave evidence to the House of Lords Internal Market Select Committee on GATS, 20 October 2016; to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, on the alternatives to free movement of persons with Mats Persson, 27 February 2018; and to the House of Lords European Affairs Select Committee and Justice Committee on the current state of play and the parliamentary infrastructure necessary for scrutiny post Brexit, 22 January 2019 \( **\[S8\]**\). 

 Barnard briefed a number of MPs on migration issues pre\- and post\-Brexit. She was instructed to draft advice for Ian Murray MP when considering an amendment to the Customs Bill \(11 July 2018\), having already been involved in working on and drafting the EU Citizens Right to Stay Bill prior to its first reading 12 July 2016 **\[S2 p. 49\]**. She also wrote a briefing for Yvette Cooper MP, Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, on options available under the EU Citizens Rights Directive. She worked with Peter Hain on the drafting of questions to government ministers on migration; for the government’s non\-response see.  On 2 July 2019, the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee opened an inquiry into post\-Brexit scrutiny of EU law and policy and what changes would be needed to the current scrutiny system, once the UK was no longer involved in EU decision\-making. Barnard was called as one of the first witnesses before the committee. **\[S10\]** 

 Barnard briefed Hilary Benn MP, Chair of the House of Commons Select Committee on the Future Relationship with the EU \(formerly the Select Committee on Exiting the EU\), on a number of occasions.  She advised him on the drafting of an amendment to the Withdrawal \(Amendment\) Bill on 22 October 2019, spoke to an adviser to his Select Committee adviser on Brexit and higher education on 3 April 2017, and gave a keynote speech to an All Party Parliamentary Group dinner on 30 October 2017 **\[S2 p.47, 54, 65\]**. Hilary Benn writes in a testimonial: 

 *‘Professor Barnard has made an important contribution to the work of the UK in a Changing Europe project which has been immensely valuable to me as Chair of the \[Select Committee\] and to the Committee’s consideration of the many complex issues raised by Brexit, including migration and interpretation of treaties and EU law.  We have greatly benefited from Professor Barnard’s testimony in front of the Committee. The fact that she has appeared before us on so many occasions is a testament to her in\-depth knowledge and her ability to explain complex issues.  I also know from the Committee’s team of clerks how valuable they have found the opportunity to share thoughts and ideas with Professor Barnard’.* **\[S9\]** 

 Barnard also engaged widely with civil servants on migration issues. She contributed to a private roundtable with DExEU/Home Office civil servants on the future of immigration policy \(17 July 2018\). She gave a number of invited lectures on migration, including to the Bank of England law and policy teams and to the Bank of England legal team on the Withdrawal Agreement and citizens’ rights and dispute resolution. **\[S2 p. 49\]** In response to a lecture she gave to the Home Office Legal Advisors on migration policy: ‘ *We have received great feedback from colleagues on your session. You managed to bring great clarity and authority to a really complex set of issues’*. \(Home Office Legal Adviser and Director General Legal Services Directorate C, Government Legal Department **\[S11\]**\). Barnard was also involved in a private briefing with officials on the Immigration White Paper. 

 In addition, Barnard has been sought out to talk on the future of migration policy to audiences outside the UK.  She made presentations to the EFTA Court, the FIDE conference, the European Law Academy \(see **\[S1\]** for details\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into the effects of mergers and acquisitions on innovation by Professor Carmine Ornaghi at the University of Southampton has contributed to merger enforcement policies of the European Commission \( **EC**\), the European Union competition authority, particularly in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. 

 Ornaghi’s research has provided ground\-breaking evidence that mergers may have a detrimental effect on incentives to innovate, in particular in those markets where merging companies are developing similar ‘pipeline’ products. Since 2016, his work and expertise have informed and shaped the EC mergers enforcement policy in the area of innovation in two complementary ways: First, by demonstrating the importance of evaluating the overlap between the research activities of merging firms which has, in turn, led to the introduction of more stringent EC remedies in recent major merger cases. Second, by working on two related EC projects which have defined a rigorous quantitative framework for the retrospective evaluation of the impact of merger control decisions on innovation.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The pharmaceutical and chemical industries are among the most research\-intensive industries in the world, and over the last two decades, they have been shaped by a sizeble number of mergers and takeovers. Indeed, many of the world’s biggest drug companies, such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, have been built through a succession of acquisitions. Starting in 2006, Ornaghi investigated the effects of these acquisition deals on the innovation of pharmaceutical firms. This was an area that, until then, had received almost no attention by academics and competition authorities, who were mainly concerned with investigating the short\-run effects of mergers on prices of existing drugs, rather than the incentives to develop new and better treatments. In this context, Ornaghi’s work was among the first to provide compelling \(and concerning\) evidence that mergers may have a detrimental effect on incentives to innovate, in particular in those markets where  merging companies are developing similar ‘pipeline’ products. 

 Ornaghi’s research involved matching financial data from large pharmaceutical firms with patent data from the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States to define a rigorous econometric framework to assess the causal effects of mergers on early\-stage innovation. The resulting two articles published by Ornaghi on mergers and innovation \[ **3.1** and **3.2**\] are among the first and most exhaustive analyses of their kind and their findings have stood the test of time as they have been validated by more recent works. Since then, Ornaghi’s research has broadened to include the effects of competition at large on innovation \[ **3.3**\] and the impact of mergers on inventors’ productivity \[ **3.4**\] as detailed below. 

 **2.1 Effects of Mergers on Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Industry** 

 The first paper by Ornaghi in 2009 \[ **3.1**\] on the effects of mergers on innovation shows that on average, consolidated companies tend to reduce research and development  expenditure and to experience a reduction in the number of patents, compared to non\-merging firms. Ornaghi’s results suggested that mergers rarely generate the knowledge synergies that their proponents often claim. At the same time, the paper shows that acquirers are more likely to target firms with similar technology and drug portfolios, which may lead to higher prices and less incentive to innovate. 

 **2.2 Technological Relatedness and Post\-merger Innovation Outcomes** 

 In a companion paper published in the same year \[ **3.2**\], Ornaghi showed that in the pharmaceutical industry, acquirers are more likely to target firms with similar products and technologies and, at the same time, that there is a negative relationship between the technology relatedness of merging firms and their post\-merger performances. The study represents an important step towards understanding why some mergers have a positive impact on innovative outcomes, and others do not. More importantly, the paper’s findings have important implications for merger enforcement policy: as acquiring firms may deliberately target competitors with similar innovation projects in order to pre\-empt future competition \(a finding confirmed in a recent study with the suggestive title of “Killer Acquisition” by Cunningham *et al*., 2018\), antitrust authorities should impose more stringent remedies, such as the divesture of rights and assets pertinent to one molecule when merging firms have overlapping molecules under development. 

 **2.3 Competition and Innovation** 

 Starting from the analysis of the impact of mergers on innovation, Ornaghi has expanded his line of research by investigating the broader effects of competition on innovation in different industries \[ **3.3**\] **.** Using both patent statistics and productivity growth data, with state\-of\-the\-art econometric techniques to model nonlinearity in the competition\-innovation nexus, this new research produces fresh, robust and exhaustive evidence on the positive impact of competition on innovation outcomes. 

 **2.4 Mergers and Inventors’ Productivity** 

 In 2019, Ornaghi began a related ESRC funded project, “Mergers and Inventors' Productivity in the Pharmaceutical Industry”. While most  existing studies have looked at the impact of mergers on innovation using firm\-level data, this research aims to  examine how mergers influence innovation output of scientists working in the research labs of these companies, using patent and inventor\-level data \[ **3.4**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The idea that mergers and acquisitions can increase market power, but may also bring about cost savings in existing markets, is not controversial. For several decades, these two opposite effects have been considered by competition authorities when investigating the short\-run effects of mergers on prices. But, the effects of mergers on prices represents only part of the story: over recent  years, competition authorities have grown increasingly concerned about the effects of mergers on innovation and  incentives to create new and better products for the market. However, when it comes to evaluating these long\-run effects, economic analysis and, in turn, mergers enforcement is on much less solid ground. 

 Ornaghi’s research and expertise have achieved real\-word impact by informing and shaping EC mergers enforcement policy in the area of innovation in two complementary ways: His research first drew the attention of the EC on the importance of evaluating the overlap between the research activities of merging firms which has, in turn, led to the introduction of more stringent remedies in recent merger cases \(Ex\-ante Merger Control Decisions and Remedies\). Second, building on the underpinning research in \[ **3.1**\], \[ **3.2**\] and \[ **3.3**\], Ornaghi has worked with economists at the EC Directorate\-General for Competition \( **DG COMP**\) and the EC Directorate\-General for Research and Innovation \( **DG RTD**\) to develop a rigorous quantitative framework for the retrospective evaluation of the impact of merger control decisions on innovation \(Ex\-post Policy Evaluation Tools\), which are vital to understand errors made in \(ex\-ante\) merger control decisions. 

 **Ex\-ante Merger Control Decisions and Remedies** 

 From a policy\-enforcement perspective, Ornaghi’s papers, by showing that mergers are more likely to have negative effects when research activities of acquirers and targets overlap, call for a more careful assessment of “early stage” research activities and the introduction of more stringent remedies, such as the divestures of overlapping business activities, that the parties have to agree in order to receive merger clearance. 

 While the EC has conducted innovation assessment of mergers since the early 1990s, until recently, interventions based on innovation concerns has been relatively rare. For instance, in the 73 merger cases examined by the EC between 2015 and 2017, “ *the overwhelming majority of the interventions were based on horizontal static unilateral effects on prices \(66 cases\). Innovation concerns were identified in 10 cases*” \[ **5.1**\], with 7 of these 10 cases related to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. However, following Ornagi’s first paper \[ **3.1**\], described by Professor Massimo Motta, Chief Economist of the EC’s DG COMP from 2013 to 2016, as “ *one of the very few \(if not the only\) papers which were addressing the question of the effects of mergers on innovation*” \[ **5.2**\], the EC has taken a more rigorous approach on assessing the effects of mergers on innovation over the last few years. Motta confirmed that Ornaghi’s academic work shaped the EC’s approach in evaluating the overlap between research activities of merging parties, describing the paper \[ **3.1**\] as “ *very prominent in the analysis at the Chief Economist Team \(CET\), especially when we started to look at the Dow/Dupont merger. Some of the work on patent data done by the CET was inspired by Ornaghi’s paper*” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The cited 2017 Dow/Dupont merger and the 2018 Bayer/Monsanto merger, two of the largest deals of the last decade, were cleared only after imposing remedies worth billions of Euros to remove problematic overlapping between the parties. In her statement on the Bayer/Monsanto merger, the European Commissioner for Competition noted that “ *Our in\-depth investigation raised concerns that the transaction \[would have\] significantly reduced innovation \[…\]. In response, the parties have submitted a remedy package worth well over 6 billion euros. It removes all problematic overlaps between the parties' activities*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Ex\-post Policy Evaluation Tools** 

 From a methodological perspective, the ex\-post evaluation of the impact of mergers on innovation is plagued by a number of challenges, such as \(i\) the construction of a control group of firms which merged companies can be compared to; and \(ii\) the identification of markets where merged companies had overlapping research interests. In the context of a renewed attention of antitrust authorities on the effect of mergers on innovation, since 2017 Ornaghi has worked on two projects by the EC’s DG COMP and DG RTD to develop a clear quantitative framework that the EC can use to retrospectively evaluate the effects of past merger control decisions on innovation, which are vital to understand errors made in the \(ex\-ante\) merger control decisions. These two projects defined the most appropriate econometric techniques to select a suitable control group \(for instance, propensity score technique or synthetic control method\) and how to construct reliable measures of overlapping and similarity between the research portfolio of merged companies. 

 Based on his papers on mergers and innovationwhich served to establishhim as a leading expert on the subject, Ornaghi was asked by senior officials at DG COMP to act as an academic advisor for their 2017 feasibility study on the microeconomic impact of enforcement of competition policies on innovation \[ **5.4**\]. In this advisory capacity, Ornaghi worked with a selected small group of economists to define a sound empirical methodology to evaluate retrospectively the impact of mergers on innovation \[ **5.5**\]. The Principal Advisor in DG COMP responsible for economic evaluation of competition policy stated that "" *Ornaghi’s contribution to this project has been fundamental in understanding the different pitfalls that any study on the impact of mergers on innovation will inevitably encounter and in defining a state\-of\-the\-art quantitative framework that can tackle such empirical challenges in a credible way*.” She concluded that “ *Ornaghi has then made a fundamental contribution to a study that is shaping the future of competition policy in the European Union.*” \[ **5.6**\] 

 Soon after, between January 2018 and April 2019, Ornaghi worked as academic advisor on a second EC research project, “Study on the impact of mergers and acquisitions in the Pharmaceutical Industry” \[ **5.7**\], commissioned by both DG COMP and DG RTD. Officials of DG RTD testified that, during this time, Ornaghi “ *offered invaluable support and advice to DG RTD by providing a range of written reports \[…\] which have been widely circulated within staff of DG COMP and DG RTD \[…\]. Ornaghi had a leading role in discussing the limitations of the study and providing clear guidance on how these could be tackled.*” \[ **5.8**\] 

 Finally, Ornaghi’s papers on mergers and Innovation \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] and competition and innovation \[ **3.3**\] have been largely cited in policy studies such as the 2019 “Ex\-post assessment of merger control decisions on digital markets” by the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\), which evaluates recent merger decisions in the digital sector in the UK with the aim of assessing whether those mergers have had a detrimental outcome on innovation \[ **5.9**\]. Ornaghi’s papers have also shaped  the view of top civil servants as identified by the Principal Advisor in DG COMP \[ **5.6**\] who testified that Ornaghi’s papers “ *were well known among experts of DG COMP, including Dr Giulio Federico, Head of the Unit of the Chief Competition Economist’s Team*”.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease \(DOHaD\) Centre at the University of Southampton has made key discoveries demonstrating that the diet and lifestyle of pregnant mothers can have a critical impact on the long\-term health of their children. The research has shown that epigenetic processes underlie the mechanism of transmission of disease risk, which can be mitigated by changes in lifestyle, and has transformed inter\-governmental, government and non\-government organisation health policies in the UK and internationally. It has led to wide uptake of new guidelines for clinical practice, including e\-learning platforms for healthcare professionals used by 89,000 people around the world. Southampton researchers pioneered the hospital\-based science education programme *LifeLab*, engaging 11,500 teenagers and 334 teachers from 72 schools and motivating them, as evidenced by clinical trial data, to improve their own health and that of future generations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The conditions within the womb have a lasting effect on a child’s life. Known as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease \(DOHaD\) concept, research has shown that exposure to certain environment influences at critical periods of development and growth will have significant consequences for the individual’s short and longer\-term health. Two pioneering Southampton longitudinal cohort studies have been fundamental in the establishment of the DOHaD concept: the Hertfordshire Cohort Study \(active since 1989\) was a retrospective study of adults and includes continuing long\-term follow up and the Southampton Women’s Survey \(active since 1998\) was the first large scale prospective study of women and their children starting before conception. Together these have provided a unique view of how early life exposures establish disease risk, particularly of non\-communicable diseases \(NCDs\), across the life\-course and across generations. 

 Research at Southampton since 2000 has seen the DOHaD field take significant strides forward and its impact has been felt on clinical practice and health policy around the world. In 2003, the International DOHaD Society was established by Professors Mark Hanson, Keith Godfrey and Cyrus Cooper, with an opening address by HRH The Princess Royal; it now has 1,000 members from 50 countries and a dedicated academic journal. Southampton research utilised human cohorts and animal models to identify modifiable early life risk factors, especially before they demonstrated the role of epigenetic processes in the underlying mechanisms of transmission of such risk. Southampton studies caused a major revision of the concept that NCDs are predominantly a combination of inherited fixed genetic risk and unhealthy adult lifestyle, with the realisation that a substantial proportion of NCD risk is not explained by these factors at the population level. Their discovery of epigenetic mechanisms opened new avenues for early prediction and intervention to reduce risk of later NCDs. They demonstrated the important contribution of early life epigenetic changes, related to aspects of maternal diet, lifestyle or adiposity in relation to a range of childhood risk factors for later NCDs in the next generation. These include: childhood adiposity \[ **3.1**\]; a measure of arterial stiffness which relates to cardiovascular function \[ **3.2**\]; and bone density which relates to peak bone mass attained in young adulthood \[ **3.3**\] – all risk factors for later NCDs. The epigenetic marks \(particularly DNA methylation\) are mechanistically important; the Southampton team has shown functionality in the DOHaD lab, taking their ongoing epidemiological cohort studies beyond correlation to causality. The work has highlighted the transmission of risk from parents to offspring by non\-genetic biological and social factors, with particular focus on the preconception and pregnancy phases of the life\-course. Animal studies demonstrated for the first time that epigenetic processes induced in early development by unbalanced maternal diet can be prevented \[ **3.4**\]. The team subsequently showed in animals that risk can be transmitted by both maternal and paternal lines and can be induced even in the early embryo, creating awareness of the importance of the preconception environment \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Studies demonstrating mechanisms underlying potential reversibility of NCD risk for the next generation supported the Southampton approach of taking continued epidemiological cohort studies beyond correlation to causality and to pioneering interventions through new randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\). MAVIDOS is the first major RCT of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, following the finding in the Southampton Women’s Survey that 35% of women in the city are vitamin D insufficient \[ **3.6**\]. Based on this basic and clinical research, the DOHaD Centre has conducted qualitative research to explore how these new concepts can inform health policy, particularly in the prevention of childhood obesity and the application of life\-course concepts underlying DOHaD. Hanson and Cooper served or chaired World Health Organisation \(WHO\) technical and policy meetings to develop the application and measurement of the life\-course concept in health policy for member states.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 University of Southampton research has shown that the environment experienced in the womb, and at conception, can have profound consequences on the long\-term health of a person including the risk of obesity and NCDs. This has had a direct impact on intergovernmental, government and NGO health policy, clinical practice and health literacy in the UK and around the world. 

 **Impact on intergovernmental, government and NGO health policy** 

 According to WHO \[ **5.1**\], the research of Hanson, Godfrey, Cooper and colleagues ‘ *has led to recommendations by WHO in relation to the prevention of childhood obesity, through the ECHO \(End ChildHood Obesity\) Commission and also the Nurturing Care Framework, both of which have been adopted by the World Health Assembly and are now having an effect on government nutritional policy in many countries*’. Specifically, this policy impact at WHO and UN level involved: 

-  Influencing the WHO Guideline on Improving Early Child Development \(March 2020\) \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  Informing the UN’s Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health 2016\-2030 \(published 2015\); DOHaD research by Hanson and Cooper cited on page 103 \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  ‘Catalysing’ the WHO\-coordinated, 10\-year, multi\-country Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative, which is examining the effect of preconception health on markers of metabolic health. \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  Co\-chairing \(Hanson\), of the Working Group on Science and Evidence for WHO’s ECHO Commission. The resulting implementation plan was adopted at the World Health Assembly in 2017, which mandated 194 member states to adopt the plan \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  Introducing the concept of ‘nurturing care’ to promote healthy development across the first 1000 days of life through a co\-authored \(Hanson\) paper in The Lancet \(2017\). The paper underpinned WHO’s Nurturing Care Framework, which was adopted at the World Health Assembly in 2018, again mandating 194 member states to adopt the framework \[ **5.2**\]. 

-  Authoring \(Cooper and Hanson\) the WHO Health Evidence Network report \(2019\): *What quantitative and qualitative methods have been developed to measure the implementation of a life\-course approach in public health policies at the national level?* \[ **5.3**\] 

-  Chairing \(Hanson\) international expert meetings at WHO on the effects of environmental toxicants on development in June 2016 and Nov 2017, which led to the new initiative *Don’t Pollute My Future\! The impact of the environment on children’s health* \[ **5.4**\]. 

-  Informing the WHO\-UNICEF\-The Lancet Commission *A Future for the World’s Children* March 2020 \(paper by Cooper and Hanson cited on page 651\) \[ **5.5**\]. 

 DOHaD research also influenced policy development and debates in the UK. Due to Southampton’s ground\-breaking findings on the effect of maternal diet and lifestyle on offspring health, Hanson was invited by the UK’s Chief Medical Officer to author a chapter on preconception health for her 2014 Annual Report \[ **5.6**\]. For the first time, this report focused on the importance of the preconception environment, making recommendations for greater continuity of health care to reduce transmission of NCD risk across generations and focussing on the most vulnerable sections of the population. In 2018, Hanson made a significant contribution to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology POSTnote *The Ageing Process and Health* \(No. 571, Feb. 2018\), which emphasises DOHaD \(papers by Hanson and Godfrey both cited\) \[ **5.7**\]. Godfrey’s work on preconception health was cited in a House of Lords debate in April 2018 that was called in order to challenge the Government on the steps it was taking to address childhood obesity \[ **5.8**\]. 

 Their research and involvement in policy formulation at an international level led Hanson and Godfrey, in 2019, to establish the first Preconception Partnership, a group of leading epidemiologists, scientists and clinical academics. It proposed an annual ‘report card’ to measure progress in improving a set of preconception health markers. The report card uses metrics from data sources such as the Maternity Services Dataset and the Sexual and Reproductive Health Activity Dataset, and is designed to hold governments to account. As a result, Public Health England \(PHE\) updated their policies on preconception care to identify opportunities for intervention, and issued resources to primary and secondary care trusts detailing the available interventions \[ **5.9**\]. PHE also made an unprecedented move to release national maternity and newborn data to Southampton researchers to assess against the report card. 

 **Impact on clinical awareness and practice** 

 University of Southampton research demonstrating the importance of nutrition before conception and during the first 1000 days of life led Godfrey and colleagues to initiate eLearning platforms to educate the healthcare workforce, in both low\-middle and high income settings. The aim was to impact real\-world healthcare practice in early nutrition at scale. The eLearning programmes in Early Life Nutrition have been developed and distributed to healthcare professionals and young couples in areas such as Africa, Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia. Collectively the platforms have more than 89,000 registered users. \[ **5.10**\] 

 With DFID funding, the team developed an eLearning programme for management of malnutrition. Their evaluation in Ghana, Guatemala and El Salvador for 2015\-2017 showed it cut mortality rates from severe acute malnutrition from 5.8% to 1.9% \(difference \-4.0% \(95% CI \-6.7 to \-1.8\), p<0.001\). The malnutrition eLearning course improved knowledge, understanding and skills of health professionals in the diagnosis and management of children with severe acute malnutrition, and changes in clinical practice and confidence were reported following the completion of the course \[ **5.10**\]. Based on WHO guidelines, the course has been taken by 17,000 health professionals, trainees and educators in 120 countries \[ **5.10**\]. It has improved clinical practices in hospitals and community settings in Ghana which has seen an improvement in mortality rate as demonstrated by a director of the district health directorate, who said: “rehabilitation rate has increased from about 80% to about 95%. And the mortality rate … has decreased to about 50% of what we used to see before the training.” \[ **5.11**\] 

 Southampton research on nutrition in the adolescent, preconception and maternal periods and on transgenerational passage of NCD risk led directly to mutliple guidelines \[ **5.12**\] developed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics \(FIGO\), which represents national professional organisations in 130 countries. The *Think Nutrition First* guideline was chaired by Hanson and launched in 2016 at FIGO World Congress in Vancouver, attended by 5,000 delegates. The FIGO Global Declaration on Hyperglycemia in Pregnancy, co\-chaired by Hanson, was launched at the Congress in Rio de Janiero in 2018, attended by 11,500 delegates. The guidelines were disseminated to 132 Obs and Gynae professional societies globally and translated into several languages. In 2020, Hanson led the development of the Pregnancy Obesity and Nutrition Initiative under the Pregnancy and NCDs Committee at FIGO, which published guidelines on obesity management before, during and after pregnancy. This led to a clinical nutrition checklist being developed for healthcare professionals to assess pregnant women’s diets and identify any nutritional risk in early pregnancy. Early analysis of its use in Hong Kong showed that among the 156 women who used the checklist, 95% had nutritional issues identified. \[ **5.12**\] 

 **Increasing health literacy and inspiring positive lifestyle changes among teenagers** 

 The research on nutrition in adolescence and the importance of the preconception environment to the transmission of NCD risk to the next generation led Hanson, Godfrey and colleagues to develop a purpose\-built teaching laboratory, *LifeLab*, at  Southampton General Hospital to educate school students about how their current health and life choices affect the health of their future children. LifeLab is a structured education programme over a two\-week period. It comprises: a professional development day for science teachers; pre\-visit lessons at school; an immersive, hands\-on visit to the LifeLab facility; follow\-up lessons at school; and a celebration event for all LifeLab students, parents, local health professionals and public officials. 

 The facility was formally launched in 2014. Since then, 11,591school pupils and 342 teachers from 66 schools have participated in the programme \[ **5.13**\]. Schools embed the programme into their science curriculum for Years 8 and 9; it is designed to be linked into several work strands and referred back to over the year. Southampton’s RCT of LifeLab \[ **5.14**\] demonstrated that, prior to participation, 50% of teenagers had an above average score, whereas 12 months after participation the proportion increased to 61% \(adjusted difference between groups = 0.27 SDs \(95%CI=0.12, 0.42\)\). Students also judged their own lifestyles more critically, with fewer reporting their behaviours as healthy \(53.4%\) compared to the control group \(59.5%\) \(adjusted PRR=0.94 \[0.87, 1.01\]\). Additionally, they had greater understanding than control students of the influences of health behaviours on their long\-term health and that of their children; for example, they knew that our nutrition starts to affect our future health before we are born \(p <0.001\) and the food a father eats before having a baby will affect the health of his children \(p<0.001\). 

 Qualitative data \[ **5.15**\] also demonstrated the profound impact that LifeLab has had on the health literacy of students. Representative feedback included: “ *If we change our lifestyle, we can more than halve our chance of getting an illness later on in life”*; *“Eating unhealthy is not only bad for your health but your child's also”*; *“How unhealthy my lifestyle actually is and the small changes that need to be made just to make sure I'm at less of a risk”*; *“I’ve eaten less fatty foods and seen how it could actually affect it \[my health\], before I thought I could just change it and it would all be better, but it can actually affect it long\-term as well*”. There is evidence of the programme inspiring students to consider future careers relating to science and health, and changing perceptions of science as an academic discipline. Representative feedback included: “ *I found them \(the scientists\) really inspirational and am now considering going into nursing or medical care*”; *“They \(the scientists\) made me change my mind about what I went to be when I am older”*. 

 According to the CEO of University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, LifeLab has contributed directly to meeting this aspect of the Trust’s vision: ‘ *We will play our part in the fight to improve population health working with the University of Southampton on their world\-renowned research demonstrating how lifestyle and behaviour not only impacts on an individual’s health but that of future generations* \[ **5.16**\].’ LifeLab resources form part of the Royal Society for Public Health \(RSPH\)\-accredited Level 2 Young Health Champions qualification. LifeLab was awarded RSPH centre status in 2017 and in 2019 won the RSPH national *Centre for Excellence* Hygeia Award \[ **5.17**\]. It was a key part of BBC Horizon episode *Why are we getting so fat?* \(2016\) \[ **5.18**\] which was watched by 1.82m people and was the 11th highest\-rated BBC2 programme that week.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Working with a group of Natural History Museums \(NHM\) in the UK, University of Birmingham \(UoB\) researchers have had three types of **impact on these museums’ practice, participation and engagement,** particularly with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History \(OUMNH\) and Lapworth Museum of Geology in Birmingham \(LMG\). We have: 

1.  Extended NHM reach to include new audiences; 

1.  Changed NHM museum practice; 

1.  Stimulated and led debate among stakeholders, reconceiving the public role of NHMs in the UK and internationally.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 In research developed through two publicly funded projects, Holmes and Tattersdill have shown how the interpretation of natural history in museums from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onwards has been shaped by intense creative engagements with the arts. <ins>Building the Book of Nature: The Poetics of the Natural History Museum</ins> was funded by the Canadian SSHRC \(2015–2017: Janine Rogers, PI, Mount Allison University; Holmes, CoI, UoB; Verity Burke, PGRA, UoB\); this project revealed how the architecture, sculpture and decorative art of NHMs built in the UK, Ireland and Canada from the 1850s to the 1930s convey distinct scientific conceptions of nature. <ins>Narrativising</ins> <ins>Dinosaurs</ins> was funded by the AHRC \(2018–2019: Tattersdill, PI, UoB; Burke, PDRA, UoB\); this project showed how popular images of dinosaurs — profoundly shaped by NHMs and at the heart of their public appeal — have always depended upon an interplay between empirical study and the artistic imagination. 

 The key findings of these research projects include: 

 **RF1**: The architecture of the UK’s major Victorian NHMs was a product of the Pre\-Raphaelite movement in art and poetry, and its reciprocal engagement with science \(RO1\); 

 **RF2**: The design, fabric and decoration of 19<sup>th</sup>\- and 20<sup>th</sup>\-century NHMs across Europe and North America carry meanings fundamental to their history and purpose \(RO2\); 

 **RF3**: The institutional histories and artistic heritage of NHMs bear on, inflect and inform their interpretation of natural history and of humanity’s impact on the environment \(RO3\); 

 **RF4**: Representations of extinct animals through palaeoart in NHMs and beyond further complicate the presumed objectivity of science, sharing techniques with fiction and fantasy world\-building, and revealing the role of the arts in reconstructing the past \(RO4–RO5\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Impact has been achieved through engagement with specific Natural History Museums that has improved their audience \(both in reach and types of visitor\) and changed practice in these museums and beyond. 

 **1. Contributed to audience reach in terms of larger total numbers and more first\-time visitors to** Oxford University Museum of Natural History \(OUMNH\) and Lapworth Museum of Geology in Birmingham \(LMG\). 

 1.i. OUMNH and LMG have been enabled to attract **increased in\-person visitor numbers and audiences who previously would not have visited a science museum by utilising arts programming to present alternative narratives on natural history**. OUMNH has seen a very **substantial rise in absolute visitor numbers**, growing by 25% from 640,000 in 2015 to 800,000 in 2020, a feat attributed by its Director to a ‘sustained period of innovation’ incorporating the arts alongside the science \(S1\). This innovation began with *Visions of Nature* \( *VoN*\), co\-designed by Holmes, which launched in 2016. *VoN* drew 570,000 in\-person visits to its four exhibitions, totalling more than 250 new works devised by over 50 artists, alongside a programme of events and poetry residencies. It increased overall visitor numbers by over 28,000 on the previous year. Further, the museum achieved its stated aim of attracting greater numbers of first\-time visitors. The flagship *Microsculpture* exhibition, as part of VoN, found 44% of visitors were new to the museum, with 45% having come specifically because of the exhibition. OUMNH **increased its overseas profile and gained new audiences** across Europe, North America and the Middle East touring *Miscosculpture* \(RF3; RO3; S1–S2\). 

 **Extended audience reach** was also achieved with LMG’s series of evening arts and science events entitled ‘Lapworth Lates’, aimed at a young adult audience ‘which had historically been an under\-represented group within the Lapworth’s general audience profile’. The initial *Dinosaurs in Popular Culture Late*, devised by Tattersdill in 2018, had 45% attend who were first\-time visitors, and this ‘original model’ has now become ‘a highlight’ in the LMG’s public engagement calendar, helping improve the museum’s offer and regularly attracting 200 to each event. It contributed to a threefold increase in attendance at LMG overall between 2015 and 2019 \(22,000 visitors p.a. increased to 65,000 p.a.\) \(RF4; RO4–RO5; S3\). 

 1.ii. In addition to extending overall audience reach, OUMNH **engaged with two disadvantaged groups \(the homeless and those recovering from brain injury\)** who lack equal access to cultural institutions such as NHMs and who were **empowered to make their own contribution** to the museum’s provision. Through partnerships with local charities, in 2019 OUMNH used the ‘Ruskin 200’ project, co\-curated with Holmes, to engage specific groups in co\-producing exhibition content and the delivery of museum tours. Working with Crisis Skylight Oxford, confidence\-building training in public speaking for **homeless people** was provided, enabling them to lead tours of the museum informed by Holmes’s research \(RO1, RO3\), whilst a collaboration with Headway Oxfordshire supported **people with brain injuries** to create art work inspired by John Ruskin and the museum which Ruskin co\-founded. OUMNH’s own assessment of visitors’ feedback to ‘Ruskin 200’ observed how the museum felt ‘more accessible’ as a result \(S1, S4\). 

 1.iii. These successes in growing visitor numbers were threatened by the COVID\-19 national lockdowns. Holmes enabled OUMHN to open up audience access despite lockdown restrictions by **moving the visitor experience to digital media and innovating with different types of virtual guided tour**. This digital exposure showed the value of combining the arts and humanities with natural history to enhance the public reach of NHMs. A video recognising OUMNH’s 160<sup>th</sup> anniversary achieved significantly better online exposure than the Museum and Gallery industry benchmark and performed over 80 times better on Facebook than OUMNH’s average for a post, while the first of a series of illustrated podcasts received over 800 views on You Tube in the first two months, well in excess of the norm for OUMNH videos \(RF1, RF3; RO1; S1\). **2. Changed practice of particular NHM museums.** 

 We have **diversified and enriched the core provision of NHMs’** public science education and engagement by introducing arts and humanities material and approaches across the breadth of their activities as follows: 

 2.i. **Curatorial innovation** can be seen in the development of **exhibitions able to adapt to different types of science museum and to take different forms**. ‘Drawing out the Dinosaurs’ \(DoD\), co\-curated by Tattersdill in 2018, conceived the history of dinosaurs as an art history as well as a scientific one and was visited by over 21,000 \(RF4; RO5\). This conception was characterised by the Coordinator of the Black Country UNESCO Global Geopark and Keeper of Geology at the Dudley Museum \(DM\) as ‘such a novel and very relatable take on the science and culture surrounding dinosaurs’ \(S5\). It was designed to be able to **capitalise on distinct contexts and reach different audiences** as it toured between three very different kinds of institution, each with a focus on science: first LMG, a university museum; then from 2019 Erasmus Darwin House \(EDH\), an Enlightenment period house; and finally DM, a regional collection. At both LMG and EDH, DoD was the first exhibition held in a new exhibition space, inaugurating a new approach to exhibiting the cultural factors involved in science at both museums \(S3, S5–S6\). In addition, a **mobile, interactive** version of DoD, initially devised as a workshop for a conference co\-organised by Symbiosis \(see 3.ii. below\) in Toronto in 2018, showcased DoD’s new concept and practice to museum professionals \(S7\). This was reprised and revised for a public audience at OUMNH as part of ‘Ruskin 200’, in collaboration with Dr Verity Burke and the Natural History Museum, London \(S4\). 

 2.ii. These NHMs have recognised how **institutional and art histories can inform their exhibits and their use of their premises** as a result of collaborations with UoB researchers \(RF1, RF3\). As a result, **exhibit re\-interpretation** has occurred both with temporary and permanent displays. LMG **secured funding from the National Archives** for an archivist to develop and inform new displays at the museum \(RF3; S3\). The Natural History Museum, London, in 2017, adopted an audio recording by Holmes on its architecture to accompany a permanent exhibit \(RF1; RO1, S8\). In 2019, OUMHN adopted a 20\-year strategic plan that explicitly recognised how the museum’s decorative art and architecture could be used to redisplay collections and open up heritage spaces; Holmes played an integral consultancy role and advised on a successful HLF bid to restore the original decorated entomology museum as a new public engagement space \(RF2–RF3; RO1; S1\). 

 2.iii. UoB researchers have developed **participatory experiences** that enable NHM visitors to **understand the science of natural history through their own artistic practice**. DoD provided direct, hands\-on experience of the crucial role played by art in the apparently objective scientific reconstruction of fossils \(RF4; RO5\). A key exhibit was a disinterred set of dinosaur bones. Visitors drew their own reconstructions of what they imagined the animal might have looked like in life, showing that the ‘correct answer’ — one of four pieces of palaeoart by Mark Witton commissioned especially for the exhibition — was itself a piece of art, not simple scientific fact \(S3\). At OUMNH, visitors to *VoN* and ‘Ruskin 200’ were enabled to develop their own understanding of and responses to specimens and exhibits, to reflect on the meaning of the museum and to evolve **co\-curated exhibits** through creating their own poetry and art \(RF3; RO3; S2, S4\). 

 2.iv. **Using contemporary art to communicate science and changes to the natural world** Following the success of *VoN*, OUMNH has incorporated newly commissioned art into each of its major Contemporary Science and Society exhibitions in what the Director describes as ‘ **a permanent change to exhibition and programming practice**’ \(RF3; RO3; S1\). For example, in the *Bacterial World* \(2018–2019\) exhibition, which drew 175,000 visitors, Luke Jerram’s sculptures of *E. coli* and Elin Thomas’s crocheted models of bacteria grown in Petri dishes ‘were key in conveying the scale and pervasiveness of bacteria’ and were the individual exhibits that visitors were most likely to stop and look at \(S9\). This prompted **OUMNH to adopt a policy** of ‘placing eye catching art “strategically” throughout’ future exhibitions \(S9\). Art is used by NHMs to **enhance the visitors’ understanding of complex ideas** whether by explaining the ecological importance, and threats to, Bee populations \(Kurt Jackson’s multi\-media exhibition *Bees \(and the Odd Wasp\) in my Bonnet*\) or tracing changes to Arctic landscapes and ecologies driven by climate change \( *Artweeks Arctic*\) \(S2\). 

 2.v. The arts and science have been combined in **interdisciplinary education interventions** within these two NHMs. Building on DoD, Tattersdill and Burke created a worksheet on dinosaurs to enhance LMG’s provision for schools which reaches 3,000 pupils per annum \(RF4; RO5–RO6\). As dinosaurs feature in the new KS2 syllabus, NHMs have a key role in supporting school groups in learning about them. Integrating learning outcomes from KS2 science and English curricula, the worksheet provides students not only with different perspectives on dinosaurs but also with a rare and valuable opportunity to bridge the gap between literature and science. Tattersdill and Burke also supported Richard O’Brien, the editor of *Dragons of the Prime* \(Emma Press, 2019\) — a book of dinosaur poems for children with notes by Tattersdill — in leading a poetry\-writing workshop at LMG for children in August 2019. Tattersdill contributed textual notes to ‘point out where the writing gets particularly creative and help you to think critically about the line between fact and fiction’ \(S12\). The success of this workshop has led to the adoption of poetry as a regular component of the LMG’s Learning Programme \(S3\). DoD enhanced education provision at DM too, where it was integrated into the education suite \(S5\). **3. Stimulated debate among stakeholders, reconceiving the public role of NHMs.** 

 New public and political engagement has been stimulated, trialled and fostered \(i\) in the UK through direct interventions with OUMNH and \(ii\) internationally through the creation of a new network to promote the role of the arts within NHMs \(S1, S7, S10, S11\). 

 3.i. OUMNH recognised it needed to act as ‘agents for change’ through informing public understanding about the natural environment in crisis \(S1\). To do this, it mobilised art and science, and drew on its own heritage to galvanise public action. In an open\-access manifesto article, Holmes and the Director of OUMNH Paul Smith argued that the mobilisation of Ruskin’s legacy at OUMNH beginning with *VoN* has set a **precedent for the sector as a whole** in the ways in which it combines science, art and environmental activism \(RF3; RO3; S1\). For example, in September 2019, OUMNH collaborated with the activist organisation Extinction Rebellion on an Art\-Science Extravaganza, including the reading, printing and distribution of poetry commissioned from the three poets from *VoN*, again co\-ordinated by Holmes. Attended by *c*.6000 people in a single day, this partnership engaged the public with research on climate change and environmental damage in a radically new way for an NHM **by using the combination of inspirational art and rigorous science to mobilise the citizenry and empower visitors to make informed decisions in their own lives** \(RF3; RO1; S1\). To articulate NHMs’ new political and overtly environmental role to a public audience, for the post\-lockdown reopening of OUMNH in Sept 2020, Holmes and Smith co\-curated a display setting out, across ten new exhibition cases, OUMNH’s mission as an NHM in an age of environmental crisis, stressing its use of the arts to engage the public with science and to reflect on its significance, and tracing this mission back to the museum’s origins in a collaboration between artists and scientists \(RF3; RO3; S1, S7\). 

 3.ii. UoB researchers have **extended their new model of practice and policy to NHMs internationally**, **stimulating debate among multiple stakeholders worldwide** \(RF2–RF3\). This has been achieved by establishing Symbiosis, a new international network of museums and universities to cultivate the use of arts and humanities within NHMs through collaborative projects, a website hosted by UoB and a series of professional and public meetings in\-person and online \(S7, S10, S3\). In November 2020, Symbiosis reached an audience of over 200 in 27 countries across Europe, Asia, and North and South America through a public, free\-to\-access online conference \(S11\). Symbiosis has been characterised as ‘fruitful, productive and inspiring’ by the Head of the Humanities of Nature Department at Museum für Naturkunde Berlin \(MfN\) \(S10\), an ‘amazing initiative’ by the Deputy Director of the NHM in Porto \(S1\) and as ‘not just valuable, but essential’ by one of the conference speakers \(S11\). Audience feedback from the conference shows active engagement of a wide range of stakeholders including creative practitioners, scientists and members of the public as well as museum professionals globally. For example, through reflections on practice across diverse stakeholder professions, including the team working on the renovation of MfN, informed by discussions of the history of NHM architecture \(S10\), the curator of an upcoming exhibition on the Anthropocene in Stuttgart said the conference had enhanced their preparations for their exhibition, and a writer declared that they ‘would definitely use some of this information in an upcoming novel’ \(S11\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Breast and ovarian cancers are leading causes of death and disability globally. BOADICEA <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02D;</span>a powerful, user\-friendly, web\-based prediction tool <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02D;</span> identifies women at especially high risk of cancer, empowering their decisions about potentially life\-altering preventive actions such as pre\-emptive surgical removal of breasts or ovaries. Endorsed for use by NICE, the American Cancer Society and other major national and international bodies, BOADICEA is used thousands of times daily in 91 countries, supporting women, doctors, and genetic counsellors. Across the world, BOADICEA supports hundreds of thousands of women in making decisions each year, contributing towards lower cancer incidence and mortality, improved quality of life and reduced costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with more than 2,000,000 new cases each year globally. In the UK, it kills over 11,000 women every year. Ovarian cancer, the gynaecological cancer with the poorest survival rate, affects 300,000 women around the world annually, and kills over 4,000 women in the UK each year \(World Cancer Research Fund and Cancer Research UK statistics\). 

 A dilemma for many women – whether to take life\-altering pre\-emptive action to stop the development of cancer 

 Some women are at especially high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer because of their genetic profile and other risk factors. They may have to make decisions about whether to take high\-consequence preventive actions. One such action involves surgical removal of breasts or ovaries and fallopian tubes before any disease is apparent. Another possible pre\-emptive strategy involves chemoprevention, which requires long\-term daily use of hormone drugs \(e.g. tamoxifen\). Although these interventions are effective, they are risky, costly and potentially life\-altering, and the decisions about them are hard to make. 

 A tool to empower personalised decisions 

 Cambridge University\-led research has produced a user\-friendly, web\-based prediction tool to inform and empower women and their healthcare professionals to make these decisions. Known for short as BOADICEA \(after the British warrior\-queen\), the “Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm” has been co\-produced with patients, doctors, genetic counsellors, cancer charities and other end\-users, and has involved researchers from many disciplines over more than 15 years. The initial version of BOADICEA was launched in 2008, and it has been continuously improved since then. 

 Identifying new predictors of cancer 

 The tool’s model incorporates information on multiple genetic and other risk factors identified through advances in molecular epidemiology. Cambridge University\-led research has identified more than 200 common genetic alterations that are associated with breast and ovarian cancers \[1,2\], and developed novel “polygenic risk scores” that can summarise information on many such genetic variants across the genome \[3\]. Cambridge has also led the analytical work that identified several novel breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, including *PALB2*, *CHEK2* and *RAD51D* \[4\] and established the most precise cancer risks for rare genetic alterations in these and other known risk genes \[5<span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02D;</span>7\]. 

 Cambridge University research underpinning BOADICEA includes the development of novel statistical techniques for modelling susceptibility to cancer \[5\], and early adoption of new “chip” technology that can survey the genome to identify new risk factors for cancer \[1\]. These developments generated powerful new data in Cambridge\-led cohorts of cancer patients and healthy individuals, and allowed pooling of data from studies around the world in international consortia led by Cambridge researchers. The consortia include the Breast Cancer Association Consortium \(more than 300,000 breast cancer patients and controls contributed by 110 research groups worldwide\) and the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 \(more than 80,000 patients/carriers contributed by research teams globally\). 

 Improving the tool and facilitating wide access to it 

 Applying novel statistical techniques developed by Cambridge to the data from these large consortia has allowed estimation of cancer risks for genetically susceptible individuals, and identified genetic factors strongly associated with raised risk. These discoveries \[1<span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02D;</span>7\] have been rapidly incorporated into BOADICEA, making the prediction tool increasingly accurate. The genetic discoveries have also been shown to lead to cost\-effective risk\-stratified screening programmes \[8\]. BOADICEA has been independently validated by researchers outside Cambridge, and has been shown to perform well in different countries and circumstances. 

 Since 2014, the prediction tool has incorporated many additional genetic risk factors, as well as behavioural, hormonal, reproductive risk factors, clinical and imaging risk factors \[9\]. In January 2020, the team further enhanced the accessibility of the BOADICEA algorithm by releasing CanRisk \(www.canrisk.org\). This web tool incorporates the latest version of the BOADICEA algorithm, and uses an up\-to\-date and user\-friendly web interface.

 Improving health outcomes for women through precise cancer risk prediction 

 Given the major risks and costs of potentially life\-altering preventive actions in relation to breast and ovarian cancer, patients and healthcare professionals need access to robust, personalised and powerful risk prediction estimates to help make good decisions. Before development of the BOADICEA prediction tool, women at high risk could be identified only by their family history of cancer or by testing for genetic alterations in a few genes \(notably *BRCA1/2*\). Those methods were too crude to enable women to make well\-informed decisions about whether to take – or not to take – highly consequential actions such as pre\-emptive surgical treatment or chemoprevention. 

 A multidimensional approach to personalised risk assessment 

 The Cambridge\-led BOADICEA tool is distinguished by its ability to calculate personalised estimates of women’s future risks of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Incorporating multiple different types of complementary information, it spans the full spectrum of genetic risk factors from high\-impact rare variants to modest but common variants. The tool also calculates the likelihood of carrying mutations in the moderate to high\-risk genes \(including *BRCA1*, *BRCA2*, *PALB2*, *ATM* and *CHEK2*\). 

 Importantly, BOADICEA incorporates information on key non\-genetic factors, including behavioural influences, hormonal risk factors, and mammographic density. The tool assigns appropriate weights to these predictors to generate individualised risk calculations that inform and empower women to make personalised decisions about high\-stakes preventive action. By improving the effective and efficient targeting of interventions, supporting genetic counselling, and enabling women to make decisions based on evidence personalised to them, BOADICEA has helped reduce mortality, reduce distress, and avoided unnecessary procedures and costs. 

 Impact on national and international guidelines 

 The value of the BOADICEA tool is recognised by policy\-makers and cancer organisations globally. In 2017, the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 30 leading cancer centres in the United States, endorsed the use of BOADICEA in its guidelines \[A\]. In 2015, the American Cancer Society, a leading organisation dedicated to eliminating cancer, recommended use of BOADICEA \[A\]. So too have the Ontario Breast Screening Programme \(representing Canada’s most populous province\) and Australia’s eviQ clinical guideline \[A\]. 

 First adopted by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in 2006, BOADICEA is also now recommended by the UK Cancer Genetics Group, the NHS Breast Screening Programme and regional NHS genetic counselling programmes \[B,C\]. It is one of only two breast cancer risk assessment tools recommended by the latest NICE guidelines \(published in 2017\) and NHS Breast Screening Programme guidelines \(2020\) \[B\]. 

 Widespread global use 

 BOADICEA is available free of charge to healthcare professionals everywhere. Since its international launch in 2008, BOADICEA has attracted more than 16,700 registered users from over 70 countries worldwide \[D\]. Worldwide usage grew substantially following updated releases of the tool in 2014, when BOADICEA was customised for multiple countries including the USA, Canada, Australia and European countries. By 2018, over 250,000 risk calculations were carried out using BOADICEA in a single year \[D\]. 

 In November 2019, BOADICEA became the first cancer risk prediction tool to gain approval as a medical device \(CE marking\) from the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) \[D\]. The current version of the web tool, released in January 2020 on the CanRisk website \(https://canrisk.org/about/\), incorporates the latest version of the BOADICEA algorithm and uses an up\-to\-date and user\-friendly web interface to enable rapid and easy risk calculations. By November 2020, only ten months after release, over 3,800 healthcare professionals from 91 countries had registered on  [CanRisk](http://www.canrisk.org/), using BOADICEA to make more than 133,000 new risk calculations \[D\]. Risk\-scoring systems based on Cambridge’s research are also used by commercial software and genetic test providers \[E\]. 

 Empowering women 

 BOADICEA has empowered thousands of women at high risk of cancer to make more informed decisions about disease prevention, including relatives of women who have had breast or ovarian cancer and women with relevant gene mutations. BOADICEA predictions are also widely used by patient\-oriented support groups, including the FORCE Cancer Charity in the United States, which states that Cambridge’s research has *“been critical for developing our resources for people with mutations in these genes, for guiding critical decisions on planning their cancer screening, the timing of risk\-reducing mastectomy and risk\-reducing oophorectomy for the early detection and prevention of breast and ovarian cancer. These are allowing us to provide an enhanced experience to women at hereditary risk of breast and ovarian cancer”* \[F\]. 

 Impact on clinical practice 

 Healthcare professionals in the UK and beyond use predictions obtained by BOADICEA to provide a consistent way of deciding whether to refer individuals for *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* mutation screening and whether to refer women for enhanced breast cancer screening \(e.g. annual mammography from a younger age, or with MRI\). This focuses healthcare resources on women most likely to benefit \[C\], avoiding unnecessary anxiety for those at lower risk and enabling those at higher risk to make prevention and screening decisions sooner. 

 Another important impact is in improving the use of gene panel tests. Around 12,000 of these tests, which analyse multiple genes at once and incorporate several genes and risk estimates identified by the Cambridge team \[G\], are done each year in the UK. But, if targeted at the wrong groups, gene panel tests \(like screening\) can lead to unnecessary worry and cost. BOADICEA is now routinely used by clinical genetics services and breast screening programmes worldwide to triage women for enhanced screening and gene panel tests \[A–C\]. Polygenic risk scores developed by the team have also formed the basis for two large ongoing breast cancer screening trials in Europe \(MyPeBS, n=85,000\) and the USA \(Wisdom, n=100,000\) \[H\]. 

 Clinical geneticists, genetic counsellors, oncologists, GPs and others use BOADICEA to support them in shared decision\-making with patients. Cancer risk estimates for high\- and moderate\-risk genes developed by the Cambridge team have been incorporated into genetic counselling and breast cancer screening protocols in the UK, US, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and other countries \[A–C,I\]. 

 In the UK, the British Society for Genetic Medicine’s Cancer Genetics Group, a national organisation covering clinicians, counsellors and scientists with expertise in hereditary predisposition to cancer, states that risk estimates provided by BOADICEA are *“integral to routine practice in clinical cancer genetics”* and *“essential in the everyday clinical practice in guiding and informing critical decisions for women with pathogenic variants in these genes”* \[C\]. In Canada, risk assessments using BOADICEA are routinely undertaken for patients referred to familial breast and ovarian cancer clinics \[I\]. BOADICEA has been incorporated into other decision support tools for cancer prevention decision\-making \(e.g. iPREVENT \[D\]\). 

 Impact on health outcomes 

 BOADICEA algorithms have contributed significantly towards early detection and prevention of cancer. For example, between September 2015 and January 2019, 2,033 women in Cambridge received detailed genetic testing guided by BOADICEA risk predictions. Around 10% of these women had serious mutations putting them at high risk of breast or ovarian cancer. All women with serious mutations received MRI scans to identify early stage breast cancers and were offered preventive intervention \(removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes or breast\) \[J\]. As another example, between March 2015 and December 2018, 1,052 women in Bristol received detailed genetic testing guided by BOADICEA predictions \[J\]. 

 A reasonable extrapolation of estimates from Cambridge to other settings where BOADICEA is in widespread use suggests that this tool – when coupled with appropriate pre\-emptive action – is contributing to significant reductions in cancer mortality. Prophylactic removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes cuts the risk of ovarian cancer occurrence by more than 90% \( *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews* 2018\), while prophylactic removal of breasts cuts the risk of breast cancer occurrence by at least 80% \( *NEJM* 1999\). Under the assumption of 52,800 risk calculations undertaken in the UK each year \(around a fifth of all tests using BOADICEA are carried out in the UK \[D\]\), genetic testing guided by BOADICEA risk predictions helps avoid around 120 deaths from ovarian cancer and 60 deaths from breast cancer annually \[J\]. Scaled to the worldwide use of BOADICEA, the tool’s personalised risk calculations are thus contributing to more appropriate interventions and better health outcomes for thousands of women.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at Strathclyde has demonstrated that young people born in Central and Eastern Europe who have settled in the UK are disadvantaged in terms of rights and opportunities, including their education outcomes, well\-being and access to services. This research, which involved work with over 1,500 EU\-born young people, informed a unique programme of training, policy and community activities. It has led to significant improvements in policy and practice supporting migrant groups. Events and training materials for practitioners enhanced their understanding of young people’s experiences and barriers to full participation in society, including experiences of discrimination and loss of rights post\-Brexit. Research was used to tackle gaps in service provision and improve public understanding of EU migration across the UK and internationally through blogs, media contributions, campaigns and art exhibitions. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Migration ranks as one of the most important factors of global change and was a defining issue in the UK 2016 Brexit Referendum. After the expansion of the European Union in 2004 and 2007, Britain experienced a significant increase in net migration from the EU states, with over 3,600,000 EU nationals now living in the UK. Since 2008, Sime has led extensive research on migration and migrants’ lives, examining the ways in which structural inequalities and everyday experiences of marginalisation impact young people who have migrated to Britain from Central and Eastern Europe with their families. Across several studies, this research showed that migrant children and young people continue to be disadvantaged by education, immigration and welfare policies across the UK, and highlighted the need for alternative approaches to ensure their needs are met and their rights respected, especially as they have become more vulnerable in the context of Brexit and changes to EU migrants’ rights to live and work in the UK. 

###  Impact of migration on newly arrived Eastern European children in the UK 

 An ESRC\-funded study \(2008\-2010\) investigated the impact of migration on newly arrived Central and Eastern European \(CEE\) children and young people in the UK. Drawing on focus groups with 57 EU\-born young people aged 12\-18 and 23 family case studies, the project found that young people’s relationships with family and friends were significantly challenged by migration, leading to consequences for young people’s agency and well\-being and a sense of transnational rather than local belonging and ontological insecurity \[ **R3**\]. It also demonstrated that young people’s access to services \(education, health, leisure\) \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\] was constrained by their perceptions of entitlement to access, previous experiences of service use and providers’ attitudes. As a result, transnational service use continued for many long after settlement. This study was followed by a knowledge exchange programme \(2012\-13\), also funded by the ESRC, which built on the research to inform policy and practice across a range of services through events. 

###  Roma migrant families’ engagement with education and other services 

 A separate British Academy\-funded study \(2012\-2013\) specifically investigated Roma migrant families’ engagement with education and other services in Glasgow \[ **R4**\]. It analysed data on >400 children’s attainment and used interviews with Roma parents to identify barriers they encountered in engaging with education and other services. The study highlighted the extremely low attainment of Roma children, often linked to experiences of segregation in their birth countries, and significant barriers in accessing key public services. Roma parents’ ability to engage in their children’s education was impacted by their own stigmatising experiences of education. The study recommended a family\-based approach to tackling educational disadvantage, improvements in outreach to make services accessible for families, and mentoring and support for children during key transition points \(i.e. early years to primary, primary to secondary\). 

###  Identity, citizenship and belonging among EU\-born migrant youth 

 An ESRC\-funded study \(2016\-2019\) examined issues of identity, citizenship and belonging among CEE migrant young people aged 12\-18, in the context of Brexit. This is the only UK\-wide project of its scale focusing on young migrants, collecting data with over 1,200 young people aged 12\-18 after the 2016 EU Referendum, and documenting at a crucial time their feelings of belonging and identity, everyday experiences of discrimination and views on the likely impact of Brexit on their lives. In the study survey, 77% of respondents said they experienced racism and xenophobia, with a significant increase after the Referendum \[ **R5**\]. Focus groups with 122 young people and 20 family case studies explored in more depth issues of family relationships, future aspirations and the impact of Brexit on family decisions to remain in Britain long\-term. While young people reported a strong sense of belonging to Britain, Brexit has made them reconsider their long\-term plans \[ **R6**\]. Currently, young EU migrants face ongoing barriers and a precarious future in relation to their rights in the UK post\-Brexit \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. With only 8% of respondents having secured British citizenship, the research revealed the significant risk that young EU nationals may become undocumented and socially excluded. It concluded that, given increasing experiences of discrimination and stigma faced by this group, the UK and devolved Governments must take active measures to ensure the rights of EU nationals are not affected by changes to immigration rules and welfare policies and the introduction of the ‘settled status’ scheme. It highlighted the likely risk of a new generation of undocumented migrants emerging, given the timeline for ‘settled status’ applications, with potential consequences echoing the Windrush generation.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through a sustained programme of briefing key stakeholders, training activities and community outreach, Strathclyde’s programme of research exploring social justice issues faced by Central and Eastern European migrant youth has: 

-  **Informed policy debates and shaped national and local government policy** relating to European migration and rights by providing research evidence through various channels; 

-  **Enhanced practitioner training across key public services** \(education, social work, policing\) and **created research\-informed resources** to teach diversity issues and tackle prejudice\-based bullying in schools; 

-  **Improved public understanding of migration and raised awareness of EU migrants’ rights** through public exhibitions, events and social media campaigns. 

###  4.1 Informed policy debates and shaped national and local government policy 

 The findings on CEE migrants’ use of public services, which highlighted barriers to access and regular transnational health service use \[ **R1**, **R2**\], informed a national evidence review on the impacts of migration in Scotland carried out by the Scottish Government \[ **S1a** pp.42, 46, 66\], leading to new policy aiming to retain migrants in Scotland and making the case for further devolved powers on immigration. The findings on the reported increase in incidents of xeno\-racism experienced by EU\-born young people, their changing plans for the future and the impact of Brexit on their rights to stay \[ **R5, R6**\] have also resulted in evidence\-based policy. A report from the Expert Advisory Group on Migration and Population \[ **S1b** pp.17, 31\] was informed by Strathclyde’s findings on young EU nationals’ plans for long\-term settlement \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. The same findings were cited in the Scottish Affairs Committee’s ‘Immigration and Scotland’ inquiry in 2017 \[ **S2a** Q35\], on young migrants’ experiences of racism and xenophobia and long\-term settlement plans. Prof Sime gave oral evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s Equalities and Human Rights Committee inquiry \[ **S2b** pp.21\-24, 30\-40\] on ‘Bullying and harassment of children and young people in schools’, which aimed to improve the monitoring and tackling of bullying incidents in Scotland’s schools. 

 Strathclyde’s research has highlighted the precarious status of European migrants post\-Brexit. The Office of Scotland’s Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development used the findings to raise the issue of EU migrants’ post\-Brexit legal status in Parliament, especially in relation to the need for families to access information on ‘settled status’ and citizenship routes. To ensure consideration of this within broader UK policy debates, Prof. Sime briefed MPs who made interventions in the UK Parliament on the rights of EU nationals and was invited to give evidence to the All\-Party Parliamentary Committee on ‘Better Brexit for Young People’ chaired by Stephen Kinnock \(in March 2018\) \[ **S2c**\]. The key dimension of this work focussed on tackling the increase in xeno\-racism and securing the rights of EU\-born young people post\-Brexit. The research findings have also been disseminated through workshops and social media campaigns \[ **S4**, **S6**, **S9** and @MigrantYouth\] to ensure that organisations supporting families have access to information on ‘settled status’, so that more EU families secure their status before the June 2021 deadline. 

 Drawing on research with Roma migrants in Glasgow \[ **R4**\], where most of Scotland’s Roma migrant population lives, in November 2016, Sime contributed to an audit of the UK Cabinet Office’s Race Disparity Unit \(RDU\) \[ **S2d**\], created by the UK Government to document inequalities across ethnic groups and improve data monitoring. At the session, involving also the Race Equality Policy Lead for the Scottish Government, Sime highlighted the under\-counting of Roma migrants \(often miscounted as ‘White\-Other’, based on the majority ethnicity in country of birth and/or reluctance to self\-identify for fear of stigma\) and provided evidence on the very low attainment and high dropout rates of Roma children. The RDU published a report in 2017, recognising there was less data for Roma groups, especially new migrants, and said evidence to the audit helped *‘identify those public services where disparities are diminishing and those where work is needed to develop effective strategies to reduce disparities between ethnic groups’* \[ **S2e**, para. 1.16 & 2.10\] *.* The RDU has committed to improve the evidence base for these groups in its Quality Improvement Plan and now monitors more closely outcomes such as education and health. In Scotland, as a result of the research, Glasgow City Council has improved approaches to enhance the achievement of Roma children, including targeted adult literacy classes, mentoring and supporting Roma families to fully engage with services \[ **S3**\]. According to the Support Services Manager, *‘the Strathclyde research has not only helped support the work we undertake in schools, it has also had an impact on how we manage policy, resource allocation and collect and use information centrally’* \[ **S3**\]. It also informed anti\-poverty initiatives to support families applying for clothing grants, free school meals and welfare/rights support \[ **S3**\]. This has particular importance as Roma groups remain more vulnerable to poverty, racism, exploitation and the risk of not securing their ‘settled status’ post\-Brexit. 

 **4.2 Enhanced practitioner training across key services through research\-informed resources to teach diversity issues and tackle prejudice\-based bullying in schools** 

 As migration to the UK has increased since 2004, there was a demand for research\-based training for practitioners working with migrants. Sime’s research informed an extensive training programme for practitioners delivering key services \(education, social work, police, voluntary sector\). Since 2010, more than 5,000 teachers, social workers, students, community work practitioners, police staff and others have benefitted from regular bespoke training events based on materials created by Sime and her team. The training materials have included policy and practice briefings \(over 6,000 downloads\) \[ **S4a**\], a Toolkit for service providers working with migrant children and their families, a guide on ‘How to talk about Brexit with your family’, videos and podcasts. The research \[ **R1**\- **R3**, **R5**, **R6**\] has impacted practice through joint activities with Education Scotland, 40\+ local authorities across the UK and other stakeholders, such as Social Work departments. Other examples of organisations attending included Glasgow City Council, Creative Scotland, Multi\-Cultural Family Base \(MCFB\), Glasgow Roma and Asylum Social Work Team, Glasgow Centre for Population Health, Romanian and Polish Embassies, Save the Children, Barnardo’s, Families Outside, The Scottish Government, Home Office and many more. Overwhelmingly positive, the feedback from events organised described the sessions as *‘excellent and worthwhile’* and *‘much needed’*. Many experienced practitioners reported improved understanding of the needs of migrant groups and better skills in engaging with families, some saying: *‘the seminar has widened my scope of understanding beyond my own service’* or *‘I heard excellent examples of good practice which we are going to implement in my service’* \[ **S8**\]. Many went on to share learning with their practice teams and the research team provided follow up support on numerous occasions through visits to services. Accordingly, there was a significant expansion in practitioners’ confidence in supporting children’s learning and their integration and in offering families support, through inclusive education provision, social work and health practice \[ **S3**, **S8**\]. 

 The overall impact of the research findings into the prevalence of racism and xenophobia linked to EU groups and the risk to migrant young people’s status and rights post\-Brexit has also led to practice\-based activities, helping the wider government and local authorities’ efforts to promote the inclusion of EU nationals post\-Brexit. Sime worked with Scotland’s anti\-bullying service, Respect *me*, to produce a teachers’ pack which was sent to over 2,000 schools and was downloaded more than 1,500 times, to tackle prejudice\-based bullying and improve practice across services \[ **S4b**, **S5**\]. Fully funded by the Scottish Government, Respect *me* led a ‘Choose Respect’ campaign in 2018/19, targeting all schools in Scotland and media channels. The teachers’ pack was also promoted by Education Scotland to all schools across the 32 local authorities through the National Improvement Hub \[ **S7**\], the executive agency of the Scottish Government which ensures the quality of the education system. This has led to thousands of pupils in primary and secondary schools learning about prejudice\-based bullying and empathy and schools adopting better systems of reporting \[ **S5**\]. Sime also used the materials to train 1,200\+ student teachers and social workers at Strathclyde, trained officers of Police Scotland and briefed the Crown Prosecution Service’s National Scrutiny Panel on migrants’ experiences of hate crime. The evidence from the research was also presented in two Royal Society of Edinburgh reports \[ **S6**\]. Both documents were distributed to practitioners, policy makers and service managers at impact events, where Sime advocated for the inclusion of migrants in education post\-Brexit and their citizenship rights \[ **S6a**\] and better access to health services \[ **S6b**\], given evidence from Sime’s research \[ **R1**\] that migrants, including children, are low users of healthcare provision. 

###  4.3 Improved public understanding and attitudes to migration 

 At a time of increased public debate on migration and in the context of Brexit, research led by Sime informed a wide range of public activities aimed at engaging members of the public. Art exhibitions, online blogs and social media campaigns have been used to engage with the general public around migrants’ experiences and attitudes to migration \[ **S9**\]. Two art\-based exhibitions \- the ‘Children’s exhibition on migration’ \(Scotland Street School Museum\) and ‘Here to Stay?’ \(Tramway\) \- were co\-produced with young people and attracted over 7,000 visitors in total \(count from museum directors\), including school children from migrant and non\-migrant backgrounds, their families, service representatives and the general public. The feedback highlighted the positive impact the exhibitions had on public understandings of migration and migratory experiences. Comments after the event included: *‘This exhibition has made me change my views on migrants, I now understand why they leave their countries’* and *‘This is a provocative and complex exhibition about home and identity \- very relatable and an eye opener’*. Many people who attended said they felt challenged on their views on migration and better informed \[ **S8**\]. 

 In addition, Strathclyde’s guide on ‘How to talk about Brexit with your family’, based on work with Youth Advisors, was disseminated to hundreds of schools and online across the UK in 2016\-2019, supported by talks that Sime and the team gave to young people at assemblies/during lessons and at parents’ evenings. These events informed young people on their rights and the need to apply for ‘settled status’ or citizenship and how to report incidents of racism and hate crime. Social media campaigns informed by the research were organised through Twitter @MigrantYouth \(\#heretostay \#migrantyouth \#migrantsrights\), Instagram and Facebook. Activities also took place with migrant families in community centres, churches, museums, shopping centres, reaching thousands \(examples include Exeter Respect Festival, Explorathon, North Devon Diversity Festival, ESRC Festival of Social Science, AHRC Being Human festival\). Significant media coverage has also been achieved through a range of outlets including *Channel 4 News, BBC World Service, Herald Scotland, The Guardian, Huffington Post, LSE Brexit Blog* \(Overall monthly readership: 790,000\) and *The Conversation* \(Overall monthly readership: 2,300,000\). In terms of reach, the Channel 4 News story was viewed more than 50,000 times; BBC World Service Newshour, which interviewed Sime in August 2019, has over 319 million listeners a week; and thousands more were reached through international media \[ **S9**\]. Sime’s research has also strengthened advocacy campaigns for the rights of EU citizens, such as The 3 Million and Migrant Voice. Since 2020, Sime has utilised her position as Vice Convenor of a new non\-partisan network, EU & Me \( [www.euandme.com](http://www.euandme.com/)\), to inform work and engage the general public in constructive debate over Britain’s relationship with Europe post\-Brexit.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 As military operations have evolved over time, the protection of individual rights and the rule of law have lacked clarity. Hill\-Cawthorne’s research has clarified highly contested legal frameworks and led the way in promoting human rights and the rule of law in military operations, particularly regarding detention by States of civilians and fighters, as well as lethal targeting by armed drones. Hill\-Cawthorne’s research findings on the continued importance of human rights law in military operations have been adopted in judgments by the UK Court of Appeal and Supreme Court over the government’s arguments for a much broader detention authority. The research has also been adopted by the UK Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in its oversight of the government’s drone programmes, leading to important policy clarifications by government. Through engagement with the International Bar Association, Hill\-Cawthorne has contributed to an international consensus on the use of lethal drone strikes. By promoting the rule of law in conflict, this research has enhanced the protection of war victims, as well as the interests of international society generally. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning this case study focuses on the legal regulation of detention in armed conflict and of targeting via armed drones. These are the key areas of controversy with respect to international law and military operations. This is because most contemporary military operations are between States and non\-State armed groups \(known as ‘non\-international armed conflicts’\), a category that the major treaties on armed conflict regulate only minimally. The consequence is a lack of clarity over the extent to which international law regulates detention and targeting in such situations. Clarification of the law is thus vital, both for the protection of individuals and to guide States in how to conduct military operations legally. 

 Regarding detention, most of the underpinning research arises from Hill\-Cawthorne’s monograph, *Detention in Non\-International Armed Conflict* \(2016\) \[Section 3, ref 1\]. The monograph remains the only book\-length analysis of the degree to which international law regulates detention in non\-international armed conflicts, and is based on considerable primary research into domestic and international case law and State practice. The principal findings of the monograph are as follows: that the law of armed conflict does not provide a legal basis to detain, and such a legal basis must therefore be sought elsewhere \(e.g. a domestic statute\); that the law of armed conflict prohibits both States and non\-State armed groups from arbitrarily detaining in non\-international armed conflicts; and that international human rights law continues to regulate detentions by States in non\-international armed conflicts. These have all been deeply contested issues amongst States and the monograph is the first and only sustained exploration of them. 

 Hill\-Cawthorne’s 2014 *Israel Law Review* article \[ref 2\] also underpins some of his work with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The article employs a theoretical methodology for developing an innovative argument for understanding the relationship between the law of armed conflict and international human rights law \(a heavily debated issue\). It then uses this to show that the prohibition on the arbitrary deprivation of liberty in international law is absolute and non\-derogable. 

 Regarding armed drones, a co\-authored \(25% contribution per author\) journal article \[ref 3\] underpins Hill\-Cawthorne’s written evidence to the UK Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and his contributions to the International Bar Association’s task force on drones. The article offers the first detailed elaboration of the core international law rules applicable to drone strikes \(under the UN Charter, the law of armed conflict and human rights law\), and is based on legal doctrinal research. One of its principal arguments, which Hill\-Cawthorne developed, is a clear rebuttal of the claim made by certain States, that ‘self\-defence’ actions or the consent of the territorial State offer blanket justifications for drone strikes abroad. This research demonstrates that States must comply with both the law of armed conflict and human rights law in such cases. 

 Based on an in\-depth analysis of case law, State practice and scholarship, Hill\-Cawthorne’s research has systematically clarified the international legal regulation of conflict detention and armed drones. This has been adopted in domestic and international accountability processes, promoting human rights and the rule of law in military operations.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Hill\-Cawthorne’s research at Reading has clarified the most contested legal rules applicable to military operations overseas. It has been adopted in judicial and parliamentary processes scrutinising the UK’s conflict\-related detention and drone policies. It has also informed an emerging international consensus on the law applicable to lethal drone strikes. This has produced important impact, not only in terms of benefiting war victims, but also in upholding the values of the rule of law, which benefits the UK and international society more widely. 

##  Hill\-Cawthorne’s research on detention adopted in decisions by Court of Appeal of England & Wales \(CA\) and UK Supreme Court \(UKSC\) against the UK government’s argument for broader detention powers 

 Detention has been a major feature of recent conflicts involving the UK. In Iraq, at its highest in 2007, the number of detainees held by coalition forces was 26,000. Yet there has been a considerable lack of clarity over the applicable legal framework, with the UK government altering its position over time. Without a clear regulatory framework, the risk of unnecessary detentions increases, as does the risk of detainee mistreatment, as seen, for example, in the UK’s 2011 Baha Mousa Inquiry. Hill\-Cawthorne’s research at Reading has changed this by clarifying the law and influencing court decisions that have rejected the broad detention powers claimed by government. It has also fed into developments on the international scene that seek to clarify the law here. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 In the CA, these two blog posts were cited in the *Serdar Mohammed/Rahmatullah* judgment \(2015\) \[Section 5, source 3\] as authority for rejecting the government’s core legal position that the law of armed conflict gives States broad detention powers in conflicts with armed groups that displace detainees’ rights under the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\) \[241\]. They were also cited by a number of Non\-Governmental Organisations in their intervention in the case before the UK Supreme Court \[source 2\]. 

 Similarly, in the UKSC, Lord Reed cited and relied on Hill\-Cawthorne’s book \[Section 3, ref 1\] throughout his judgment in the *Al\-Waheed* \(2017\) case \[Section 5, source 1\] as authority, for the following, with which the majority agreed: first, that the law of armed conflict does not grant a legal basis to detain in conflicts with armed groups, requiring such a basis to be found elsewhere \(e.g. domestic law\) \[225, 262–3\]; second, that detentions in overseas conflicts remain regulated by the ECHR \[311\]. This was, again, in contrast to the government’s core legal position and the basis of its entire detention operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The result is that detentions must now have a clear legal basis, ensuring that detainees in future conflicts understand the grounds of their detention, enabling them to challenge it where appropriate. 

 On the international scene, there remain major disagreements between States over the applicability of international law rules on detention to conflict. Over several years, including since joining Reading, Hill\-Cawthorne worked with and advised the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention \(UNWGAD\) in order to disseminate his research and assist UNWGAD in its development of universal rules governing detention. 

##  Hill\-Cawthorne’s research on the regulation of drone strikes adopted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights \(JCHR\), leading to significant policy clarifications by the government 

 The rise in the use of armed drones for targeted killings by States has led to confusion over the international law rules that regulate them. Some States have taken a very broad view of their right to use drones. This is especially important as the number of States using armed drones for targeted killings quadrupled between 2013 and 2018, with more States and non\-State actors continuing to acquire the technology. The UK alone has carried out 3,500 drone missions in Iraq and Syria since 2014. Hill\-Cawthorne’s research at Reading has been adopted in the recommendations of the JCHR to the UK government on its use of lethal drones, in which the JCHR calls on the government to clarify its legal positions and ensure all drone strikes comply with international law. This research has also informed some of the key international developments here. 

 Hill\-Cawthorne co\-authored an academic article \[Section 3, ref 5\] with the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions \(Christof Heyns\) and two others \(Akande and Chengeta\) in which they clarify the complex legal framework applicable to drone strikes. Based on the draft of that article, Hill\-Cawthorne and his co\-authors submitted written evidence \[Section 5, source 4\] to the JCHR during its 2016 hearings scrutinising the UK government’s drone programme. These hearings were the result of the government’s 2015 targeted killing of Reyaad Khan, a British citizen who appeared in an ISIS recruitment video. This strike was carried out without parliamentary approval, leading the JCHR to investigate. Hill\-Cawthorne et al.’s evidence was cited and relied upon throughout the JCHR’s report and recommendations \[Section 5, source 5\] \(for example, for the proposition that existing legal frameworks are sufficient to regulate drone use; on the need for the UK to clarify its views on the scope of its right to self\-defence; on the risks associated with flexible interpretations of the international law on the use of armed force; and for the argument that international human rights law represents the default legal regime\). 

 The JCHR recommendations represent a major shift towards accountability by confirming the rules applicable to armed drones \(thus pushing back against permissive legal positions that some States have adopted\) and by calling on government to clarify its drone policy. Indeed, the government was forced to respond with certain clarifications of its policy, including with respect to some of those issues flagged in the JCHR report that specifically drew on Hill\-Cawthorne et al.’s written evidence \(e.g. the scope of the right to self\-defence against armed groups\) \[Section 5, source 6\]. 

 On the international scene, Hill\-Cawthorne was appointed by Human Rights Institute \(HRI\) of the International Bar Association \(IBA\) to a seven\-person international task force \(comprising academics, the Red Cross, and Open Society Foundation\) on armed drones. The aim was to publish an authoritative IBA HRI resolution and background paper clearly setting out the legal framework regulating drones in response to significant disagreements amongst States. These were published in 2017 \[source 7\], and they rely in part on Hill\-Cawthorne’s co\-authored article \[Section 3, ref 3\], notably for the core argument that the legality of drone strikes is to be tested against multiple legal rules. The IBA is the global organisation of law societies. A resolution from the IBA HRI thus carries weight as reflecting the consensus of lawyers worldwide. As more States and armed groups acquire drones, it is hoped that the resolution will promote a universal regulatory framework constraining their use. 

 Addressing the lack of clarity in the protection of individual rights and the rule of law in military operations, Hill\-Cawthorne’s research has been relied upon in judicial and parliamentary accountability processes for UK detention operations and armed drone use. It has underpinned the UK courts’ refusal to uphold the UK government’s core legal position on detention in military operations and prompted clarifications by the government of its policy on armed drones. It has also contributed to the emergence of an international consensus on the legal regulation of armed drones. These are significant developments that improve the protection of individual rights and the rule of law in military operations.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There are a number of invasive open surgeries associated with significant blood loss, excessive pain and a longer hospital stay, greatly affecting patients’ health outcomes. These issues can be minimised through robotic surgery. King’s College London researchers are regarded as pioneers in robotic surgery, particularly in urological cancers. Their work has transformed urology surgery in the UK through national uptake and training of robotic surgery through The Urology Foundation. They have developed the first international curriculum for safe training in robotic surgery and enabled Guy’s Hospital to carry out most of the robotic surgery in the country \(400 cases a year\). King’s research also showed better patient outcomes through robotic surgery and changed the programme of care for prostate cancer survivors to include support for the psychological effects of radical surgery. Additionally, King’s demonstrated the cost effectiveness of robotic surgery, informing national guidelines in the UK and Canada.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer: around 40,000 men are diagnosed with it each year in the UK alone. A standard radical prostatectomy – having the prostate removed – is a complex operation that has a high risk of men experiencing incontinence and impotence afterwards. Despite advances in non\-surgical treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, surgery remains the cornerstone in the treatment of most solid cancers, including prostate cancer. Traditional open surgery is associated with greater blood loss, more pain and longer hospital stay compared to laparoscopic \(keyhole\) surgery  – a minimally invasive alternative with a better prognosis for patients. However, developing proficiency in keyhole surgery involves a  [steep learning curve](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1111%2Fbju.12315&data=04%7C01%7Claura.yoshimoto_turpin%40kcl.ac.uk%7C0b0dfb4600e64965426608d8b7b01c31%7C8370cf1416f34c16b83c724071654356%7C0%7C0%7C637461314300746993%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=HMUGyusNLA%2BNIBeGlgwPQ4zOp0PpVW%2F0MWy0GeKe54w%3D&reserved=0) for surgeons, which many find difficult to overcome. King’s has been at the forefront of a technology\-aided alternative, robotic radical prostatectomy, that has evolved over the last 20 years to become the most effective and common form of surgery for prostate cancer in the UK. This work to refine robotic surgery in the context of urology has also led to progress in the application of robotic surgery in other clinical specialties. 

 King’s pioneers robotic urology in the UK: In 2004, the urology team at King’s established the use of the da Vinci Surgical System, powered by state\-of\-the art robotic technology. The da Vinci allows the surgeon to sit comfortably at a console that scales, filters and translates their skills into the precise movements of robotic micro\-instruments within the operative site. It is equipped with a 3D vision camera rather than the 2D vision cameras of traditional keyhole surgery, with 10 times magnified vision, tremor filtration and wrist\-like micro\-instruments with 540\-degree range of motion. Urologists led this multidisciplinary effort by mentoring colleagues from other areas in robotics sugery such as paediatrics surgery, thoracic surgery, transplantation and gynaecology. 

 **King’s researchers create new robotic tools to advance this procedure and other applications of robotic surgery:** During robotic surgery the surgeon is not in direct contact with the patient and instead performs the surgery through the computer’s console. In initial applications, there was a lack of a sense of “touch” throughout the process, affecting the accuracy of surgery and increasing the risk of side effects. In 2005, King’s academics, with colleagues at the engineering department, sought to change that by making use of haptic technology, which can create an experience of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user and thus improving the practitioner’s experience and surgical effectiveness. Since then, based on this technology, King’s has contributed to the field of the robotic surgery through a number of ground\-breaking developments: 

 \- **Image guidance technique:** Displaying MRI images from the areas affected by cancer to be viewed through the console in the surgeon’s direct line of vision while in surgery **\(1\)**. 

 \- **3D model:** Using 3D printing to create an exact replica of the patient’s prostate using images from an MRI scan and specialised software **\(1\)**. This allows surgeons to pinpoint exactly where the cancer is situated within the prostate, meaning they can plan in advance how to remove the cancer while preventing damage to important nerves nearby. 

 \- **Octopus\-inspired robotic arm:** Creating controllable\-stiffness tools which enable the surgeon to temporarily collapse the device\(s\) during surgical procedures to provide the surgeon with improved views inside the body, or to use the tool\(s\) as a retraction aid **\(2\)**. 

 \- **King’s conducts the first\-ever randomised trial of Telerobotics:** In 2002, King’s conducted the first randomised controlled trial of robotic surgery with Johns Hopkins Hospital, USA. In this study they made use of Telerobotics, the area of robotics concerned with the control of semi\-autonomous robots from a distance, chiefly using a Wireless network \(Wi\-Fi, Bluetooth, the Deep Space Network, and similar\). They evaluated a robot’s ability to use a robotic arm to accurately position and insert a needle into a kidney model to remove stones and compared it to traditional access with a human hand. Analysis of 300 procedures showed the robot to be more accurate than the human hand **\(3\)**. 

 \- **Ultra\-low latency 5G networking:** King’s then went on to collaborate on work to improve the connectivity between robotic devices in different geographical locations. The 5G network, developed in partnership with telecommunications company Ericsson, allows the advanced robotic technology to operate with minimal delays between action and reaction, enabling  a fully immersive experience in real time for users across the world and eliminating the perception of distance **\(4\)**. 

 Additionally, between 2012 and 2017, King’s researchers used a Delphi process \(structured interview method using a panel of experts\) to develop the first standardized curriculum for training in robotic surgery **\(5\)**. Before this, there was no official structured learning for robotic surgery. 

 **King’s collaborative research provides the highest quality of evidence in robotic surgery:** King’s research led to the first ever randomized trial of open, laparoscopic \(surgical diagnostic procedure to examine organs inside the abdomen\) and robotic cystectomy \(surgical removal of all or part of the urinary bladder\). The trial was named CORAL \(Clarification Open Robotic and Laparoscopic\) after initial cohort studies comparing the three techniques **\(6\)**. CORAL found no difference in 90\-day complication rates between traditional and robotic surgery, but it did confirm there were shorter hospital stays and less blood loss when surgery was performed through the robotic arm **\(6\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research by King’s academics has made significant contributions to the rise of robotic surgery, particularly in the field of urology. The first Da Vinci system was installed in the UK in 2001. Now they are distributed in more than 70 NHS hospitals across the country **\(A\)**, with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy being its most common operation. Up to 5,000 radical prostatectomy operations are performed annually in the country, around 60% of which are executed with a robot **\(B\)**. 

 **King’s transformed urology surgery in the UK through national uptake and training of robotic surgery through The Urology Foundation \(C\).** In the early 2000s, Professor Dasgupta was one of the only people in the UK to perform robotic surgery. Recognising his expertise, The Urology Foundation \(TUF\) – a charity created to provide more funding for urology research and training – funded Professor Dasgputa to travel around the UK to provide travel mentorship and training to urology surgeons. 

 Later in 2016, TUF made the decision to create a consortium of five TUF Centres of Robotic Training in the UK, of which King’s – under Prof Dasgputa – was one. As part of the TUF Centres of Training consortium, King’s trained 31 urologists in robotic surgery between 2016\-2019, of which five completed ‘mini fellowships’ at Guy’s Hospital and many more benefiting from the cascade training effect, and transforming the urological surgery landscape **\(C\)**. The CEO of TUF confirmed this work has been instrumental in transforming urological surgery in the UK: “In a relatively short space of time – and with relatively modest funding – the majority of urological patients on the NHS now have access to robotic surgery by skilled robotic surgeons. 92% of prostatectomies, 82% of partial nephrectomies and 52% of cystectomies are now done robotically, meaning that the public are benefiting from this form of minimally invasive surgery and the improved outcomes.” 

 “The benefit to the public of TUF’s robotic surgery training programme – and Prof Dasgupta’s and KCL’s role in this – is transformative and ground\-breaking. In a relatively short space of time, we have opened access to the improved benefits of robotic urological surgery to the vast majority of NHS patients, and it is increasingly becoming the norm in many urological operations. The benefits to patients mean they recover faster and get back to their day\-to\-day lives quicker, and the economic benefit to the NHS of shorter bed stays in hospital are enormous.” **\(C\)** 

 **King’s developed the first international curriculum for safe training in robotic surgery.** Following publication in the British Journal of Urology International **\(6\)**, King’s curriculum was validated in collaboration with the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section \(ERUS\) and has been adapted by a number of other surgical specialties as a gold standard training tool **\(D.1\)**. The curriculum was also adopted as the official guideline for training by the British Association of Urological Surgeons \(BAUS\) and King’s researchers were invited to be part of its guideline panel members, essentially shaping the design of the document **\(D.2\)**. BAUS states that the guideline is relevant to both experienced surgeons learning robotic skills and also to senior trainees learning robotic\-assisted surgery anew. It reviews the skills required within robotics, discusses current training methods for robotic surgery and makes specific recommendations e.g. for modular training. The President of BAUS affirmed **\(D.2\)**: “This paper is the first of its type and could be the model for training documents in other complex areas of urology."" As of September 2019, there were a total of 1220 consultant urological surgeons and 337 trainees in the UK and Ireland **\(D.3\)**. 87.5% of the substantive consultants in the UK are BAUS members **\(D.3\)**. 

 **King’s expertise enabled Guy’s Hospital \(GSTT\) to carry out most of the robotic surgery in the country, around 400 cases a year \(B.3\).** The majority are prostate operations, but also include bladder and kidney surgery. The entire robotic programme carried out at GSTT was developed by Prof Dasgupta **\(B.1\)**. It is now the largest programme in the UK, training two full\-time surgical fellows and more than 50 visiting surgeons a year **\(B.4\)**. 

 In July 2014, the success of Prof Dasgupta’s work was recognised and GSTT received an international award of GBP600,000 from the Vattikuti Foundation \(VF\) to set up the Institute of Robotic Surgery, the only of its kind in the UK **\(B.2\)**. VF is a non\-profit organisation committed to making robotic surgery cost effective and available to underprivileged communities. The CEO of VF said: “Guy’s and St Thomas’ is the epicentre for urology robotic surgery in the UK, and has strong research and teaching programmes thanks to its links with King’s College London and the Urology Foundation **\(B.3\)**.” 

 Since then, the Institute has trained three international fellows a year, many of whom have gone on to become independent robotic surgeons. It has led to >700 publications, device development, and the evaluation of new technologies for use in surgery such as Google Glass, Hololens and 3D printing of organs to guide surgery **\(B.2\)**. 

 **King’s research showed better patient outcomes through robotic surgery.** The CORAL trial demonstrated the benefits robotic surgery offers in comparison with traditional surgery, such as less blood loss, less pain and quicker recovery **\(5\)**. This was further confirmed by the European Association of Urology \(EAU\) Robotic Urology Section Scientific Working Group in a consensus view document published in 2016 **\(E\)**. These benefits were also recognised by patients, as corroborated by one who underwent a procedure performed by Prof Dasgupta: “It’s great that something like this can be used to give surgeons more detail and help them to carry out the surgery effectively, so it was very reassuring to know it would be part of my operation **\(B.2\)**.” A 65\-year\-old patient who went through the same procedure \(also carried out by Prof Dasgupta\), was able to get out of bed and go for a walk just one day after his surgery **\(B.4\)**. 

 **King’s changed the programme of care for prostate cancer survivors to include support for the psychological effects of radical surgery \(F\).** The procedure has a high risk of incontinence and impotence, so, GSTT implemented a pre\- and post\-operative counseling pathway in 2015 to help prepare patients for the psychological and physical effects of surgery ensuring they live a healthier and active life after treatment. Prof Dasgupta supported the pathway by reviewing and analysing patients’ feedback forms, which were key from a strategic point of view to improve patient care. He also assisted in the pathway design, streamlined and designed to be patient centered and efficient for both staff \(the NHS\) and patients. 

 Multiple seminars were conducted throughout the trial of the pathway with pre\- and then post\-operative counselling. All patients that attended seminar sessions were satisfied with the experience. Overall, 99% of patients felt more confident in coping with their recovery after they attended the different seminars and 100% of them felt more confident in coping and understanding the discharge process after they attend their discharge seminar. 

 The Project Manager of the pathway has said: “If this hadn’t been implemented, the situation would be ‘status\-quo’, nothing would have changed for these patients and there would be long waiting lists to see multiple different members of the multidisciplinary team. Prokar’s help in implementing the pathway was extremely valuable and the work shows how important it is to address patients unmet needs to reduce ‘regret’, streamline services and overall improve patient experience **\(F\)**.” 

 **King’s demonstrated the cost effectiveness of robotic surgery, informing national guidelines in the UK and Canada.** Despite improved clinical outcomes, the high cost of purchasing and maintaining the da Vinci system remained a concern for national health services. A systematic review by the King’s team demonstrated that shorter hospital stays alone were not enough to offset the cost of expensive disposables. This led to King’s researchers partnering with colleagues from the Henry Ford Institute in Detroit and Harvard Medical School to show that in order to be cost\-effective, centres needed to perform at least 150 operations per year \(G **\).** After proving the cost\-effectiveness of robotic surgery, the concept of ‘minimum volume’ was featured in the NICE prostate cancer guidance in 2019, designating centres performing 150 procedures/year as cost\-efficient \( **H**\). This resulted in a spike in the use of the da Vinci system in high volume centres to 5\-6 days per week \( **G\).** In 2020, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health \(CADTH\) also utilised the ‘minimum volume’ concept as a standard recommendation for Canadian health care decision\-makers \( **I**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Outputs from our research proposed replacing existing voluntary approaches to race discrimination in the NHS with a strategy of data\-driven accountability and regulatory scrutiny. The resulting large\-scale changes throughout England’s largest employer have had impacts on policy and individual staff: 

 *Impact on NHS Policy through:* 

-  Kline’s highly\-influential 2014 report *The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS,* showing under\-representation of Black and Minority Ethnic \(BME\) NHS staff at senior levels 

-  Introduction in 2015 of NHS *Workforce Race Equality Standard* \(WRES\) drove sustained, large\-scale NHS action on race discrimination – Kline designed the WRES and oversaw its implementation 

-  integration of the WRES into Care Quality Commission inspections 

 *Impact, following implementation of the WRES, on BME staff in the NHS through:* 

-  improved likelihood of being appointed from shortlisting 

-  greater number appointed at senior/Board level 

-  reduction in the likelihood of disciplinary action 

-  adoption of an equality standard by all NHS professional regulators e.g. Nursing and Midwifery Council; General Medical Council 

-  action on bullying

###  2. Underpinning research 

 From 2005 onwards, a group of staff at Middlesex University Business School developed a programme of research focused upon developing and safeguarding worker rights. Research by James, Croucher and Lewis D, variously into health and safety, the enforcement of the national minimum wage and whistleblowing, demonstrated the shortcomings in voluntary approaches to changing workplace behaviours. It showed instead the need for legislative enforcement in changing workplace behaviours and a role for mandatory requirements to ensure the maintenance of worker rights \[3.1\]. Related work led by Roper and Lewis S, **analysed how voluntary national\-level diversity initiatives had been overturned as a result of localised performance management initiatives and financial imperatives, to negatively impact upon NHS diversity management \[3.2\].** 

 In consideration of alternatives to ineffective voluntary interventions in changing workplace behaviours, one particular approach identified through this body of research was the potential of making greater use of data\-driven accountability linked to contractual compulsion and regulatory scrutiny, Kline developed this approach in relation to his analysis of the failure of trade unions and HR services to address challenges facing staff operating in the public sector, specifically within the culture of the NHS \(subsequently published as Carter and Kline, 2017\) \[3.3\]. Kline applied the findings of this research to understanding and addressing race discrimination in the NHS, by means of an analysis of discriminatory aspects of NHS recruitment processes. Initially published in an article entitled *Discrimination by Appointment* in Public World \(2013\), this research was subsequently developed in greater detail in the highly influential report *The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS* \(Kline 2014\) \[3.4\]. 

 *The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS* \(SWPNHS\) examined NHS Trust data on the ethnicity of senior post holders and Board membership in relation to the impact of the previous voluntary Ministerial Race Equality Action Plan \(2004\), and found little improvement on previous under\-representation of ethnic minorities in senior positions. It demonstrated that the proportion of London NHS Trust Board members from a BME background had fallen from 9.6% in 2006 to 8% in 2014, whilst 40% of London’s NHS Trust Boards had no BME members. The proportion of chief executives and chairs from a BME background had also decreased from 5.3% in 2006 to just 2.5% in 2014, and the proportion of senior and very senior BME managers had not increased since 2008. Overall, the likelihood of white staff in London being senior or very senior managers was three times higher than for black and minority ethnic staff. The report’s findings, subsequently expanded via a critical review of international practice, starkly showed the ineffectiveness of the existing voluntary approach to staff development which constituted NHS strategy at this time \[3.5\]. Instead, a different strategy of data\-driven accountability linked to contractual compulsion and regulatory scrutiny for healthcare providers was advanced as a more effective means of challenging longstanding institutional blockages. 

 Following the widespread attention that the SWPNHS report attracted, Kline was commissioned in 2014 to design a *NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard* \(WRES\) as a means to develop such an approach to race equality within the NHS. Building on findings of his report, and in collaboration with colleagues from the Universities of Manchester \(Esmail\) and Harvard \(Priest\), a methodology to underpin design of the WRES was developed. From this, Kline and Esmail designed the specific nine metrics to be incorporated into the WRES, launched in 2015, that NHS providers were required to collect, analyse, and enhance, bringing together essential features of the relative treatment of White and BME NHS staff related to their career opportunities and treatment \[see 5.2\]. 

 Subsequent research by Kline and others has focused upon understanding, evaluating and disseminating interventions on specific aspects of the WRES \(Section 4 below\). Kline \(with Lewis, Duncan\) \[3.6\] published a first ever analysis of the substantial financial cost of bullying and harassment to the NHS in England \(which disproportionately impacts BME staff\), estimated at £2.3 billion per annum. Kline and Atewologun \(2019\) were commissioned by the General Medical Council \(GMC\) to examine the disproportionate referrals of some groups of doctors, notably BME doctors, to the GMC. Results showed the treatment of overseas doctors as “outsiders”. This finding was reflected in flawed induction and integration of such doctors, a pattern of employment of large numbers of such doctors \(as specialist and associate doctors, agency staff, and GPs\) in challenging environments with little support. and their operation in work environments involving blame rather than learning as the key driver \[3.7\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impacts evident from this body of work are of two main kinds: benefits as a result of the enhancement of NHS policy and contracts; and benefits to individual NHS employees brought about by implementation of the Workforce Race Equality Standard \(WRES\). 

####  \(1\) Benefits as a result of enhancement of NHS policy and contracts 

 Prior to 2013, tackling race discrimination in the recruitment, development and treatment of the NHS, workforce of 1.2 million was overwhelmingly devolved to NHS Trusts and other local NHS bodies. Publication of *The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS* \[3.4\] had a pivotal impact on debate, through identifying the scale of race discrimination within the NHS and suggesting ways of addressing this issue. The report was sent to every NHS Trust by NHS England as recommended reading and then became required reading on all NHS Leadership Academy courses. Commenting on the report’s influence, the 

 former Chair of NHS Providers stated: *“I have seen many reports like this over the years and none have had the traction achieved by this report. It has been the trigger for tackling unfairness robustly. I still hear people referring to the report specifically which is remarkable after nearly 5 years and with the sheer volume of NHS policy during that period.”* \[5.1\] 

 Influence of the report was extended when Kline was commissioned to design a Workforce Race Equality Standard \(WRES\) that imposed a contractual requirement for NHS service providers to collect, analyse and publish WRES data alongside an Action Plan, setting out how they would reduce identified patterns of race discrimination \[5.2\]. On this phase of the work, the former Chief Executive Officer of NHS England stated: *“The Snowy White Peaks of the NHS \(2014\) and the resulting development of the Workforce Race Equality Standard \(in which Roger \[Kline\] was centrally involved\) from 2015 onwards, played a crucial role in focussing NHS organisations on the importance of tackling race equality in NHS organisations. It triggered numerous positive initiatives in NHS trusts and other NHS organisations across the NHS which started to help to reduce some of the discrimination.”* \[5.3\] 

 The combination of data analysis and Action Plan became an essential component of the quality regulator’s \(Care Quality Commission \- CQC\) public assessment of the quality of Trusts’ leadership. In 2017, the CQC set out how WRES would be integrated into hospital inspections. The former CEO of the CQC stated that: “ *development of the Workforce Race Equality Standard from 2015 onwards played a crucial role in prompting the Care Quality Commission… to include inspecting against the implementation of the WRES as an element in determining whether an NHS provider was “well\-led” or not. Roger Kline’s work enabled us to take this decision”* \[5.4\]. The *Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCG\) Improvement and Assessment Framework* made it a requirement for CCGs to give assurance to NHS England that their providers were implementing the WRES, and that WRES results and action plans must be part of contract monitoring and negotiation between CCGs and their respective providers \[5.5\]. 

####  \(2\) Benefits following from implementation of the Workforce Race Equality Standard \(WRES\) 

 Following the 2015 launch of the WRES, Kline was seconded on a part\-time basis as joint director of the WRES \(2015\-2017\) to oversee its implementation. In this way his research directly informed the analysis and drafting of the first two annual reports on progress in implementing the WRES \(2016, 2017\), which enabled NHS organisations to understand their own metrics and to benchmark them against neighbouring or similar employers in order to drive progress. In 2018, NHS England chose to invest £1 million a year to extend the WRES programme to 2025. A dedicated WRES team of 7 staff currently manage this application of Kline’s research insights and findings. An independent report evaluated implementation for the first two years \(2015\-2017\), confirming early progress on metrics and the impact on improving diversity on NHS boards \(Dawson et al. 2019\) \[5.6\]. 

 Implementation of WRES has produced a number of significant outcomes: 

#####  \(1\) Impact on diversity in the NHS 

 Over the first four years \(April 2015 – April 2019\), four of the nine indicators showed statistically significant improvement, notwithstanding that embedding these changes will inevitably take longer. The number of BME nurses and midwives in more senior grades \(Bands 6\-9\) increased in the first 4 years \(2015\-2019\) by at least 4,000 more than predicted by annual trends prior to 2015, and the numbers promoted in each year more than doubled. There was also a reduction, during the same period, in the relative likelihood of White staff \(compared to BME staff\) being recruited from shortlisting from 1.57 to 1.45. The total number of BME staff at very senior manager \(VSM\) pay band increased to 143 in 2019, up by 30% from 2016 and BME members of NHS Trust Boards rose from 7.0% to 8.4% in 2017\-2019 \(earlier Board figures are not directly comparable\) \[5.7\]. Kline has sustained this progress through influencing practice via high profile and widely read blogs for the British Medical Journal \[5.8\] and ongoing work with the NHS as a part\-time joint inclusion adviser to the NHS national talent management programme, In 2020 he was appointed a member of the Expert Group advising on the production of an ethical framework for COVID\-19 testing for NHS workers, commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, and invited to become a member of the NHS BAME Clinical Advisory by the NHS Chief People Officer. 

#####  \(2\) Disciplinary action 

 The highlighting through WRES data of the disproportionate disciplining of BME staff led to a new approach to concerns about capability and conduct by inserting an additional layer of accountability prior to any form of investigation. This was intended to reduce both the overall level of disciplinary action and the relative likelihood of BME staff being disciplined. Impact of this measure was reflected in subsequent improved WRES data reporting on WRES Indicator 3. Early implementation at England’s Barts Health NHS Trust of a new protocol in response to this measure led to a substantial reduction in disciplinary cases and a reduced relative likelihood of, BME staff \(compared to White staff\) being disciplined; an initiative that was recommended for wider application by NHS Resolution in 2019, as part of promoting innovative interventions. Nationally, the relative likelihood of BME staff entering the formal disciplinary process compared to white staff has reduced year\-on\-year, from 1.56 in 2016 to 1.22 in 2019 \[5.7\]. 

#####  \(3\) Professional regulators and race equality 

 NHS professional regulators have focused more on equality as a result of embedding the WRES metrics. The Nursing and Midwifery Council changed its Fitness to Practice strategy to stress explicitly the importance of race equality. The former Director of Fitness to Practise, Nursing and Midwifery Council said of this development: *“The \[Middlesex\] work … has significantly influenced the determination of the Nursing and Midwifery Council to address this issue and shaped some of the elements of our recent \(2018\) Fitness to Practice strategy which explicitly acknowledges the importance of the issue of discrimination in patterns of referrals”* \[5.9\]. He goes on to say: “ *I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that you’ve* \[Kline\] *helped ‘move the dial’ on equality for the whole health & care sector*.  In response to Kline and Atewologun’s 2019 review for the General Medical Council \(GMC\) \[3.7\], which identified the reasons why some doctors \- notably BME doctors \- were disproportionately referred within their own Fitness to Practice process, all of the report’s recommendations were accepted by the GMC and a comprehensive implementation programme is currently underway. Evidence provided by Kline in a commissioned study for the Professional Standards Authority \(2018\) also significantly influenced their adoption of a new standard on diversity, which has led all NHS professional regulators to a fresh review of their approach to race equality \[5.10\]. 

#####  \(4\) Action on bullying 

 Kline's 2013 report,  [*Bullying: the silent epidemic in the NHS*](http://www.publicworld.org/blog/bullying_the_silent_epidemic_in_the_nhs), and the subsequent Snowy White Peaks of the NHS report, identified that NHS bullying particularly impacts on BME staff. This directly influenced the inclusion of a substantial section on the disproportionately poor treatment of BME whistleblowers in the Government\-commissioned Freedom to Speak Up Review \(Francis 2015\). Subsequently, NHS Improvement has drawn on this and Kline and Lewis’ analysis of the financial cost of bullying to the NHS and its £2.3 billion cost per annum\], in the production of a new toolkit to promote cultures of civility and respect in the NHS \[5.11\]. This includes a ‘bullying cost calculator’ based upon Kline and Lewis \[3.6\] \(2018\), and forms part of a major anti\-bullying policy initiative. Kline was also invited to join the NHS Health and Wellbeing Expert Advisory Board in 2020, to advise on bullying, whistleblowing and race discrimination and the NHS Improvement Culture Transformation Advisory Group.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Although self\-neglect poses significant risks of harm, or even death, its place in policy was unclear and little was known about effective practice. Sussex research demonstrated the need for clear policy and pathways for interagency collaboration, and identified effective approaches to intervention based on enhanced understanding of self\-neglect’s causes. This directly contributed to legal and policy changes making Safeguarding Adults Boards \(SABs\) mandatory in England and naming self\-neglect a statutory responsibility to be addressed through local health and social care safeguarding policies. The research helped shape those policies, set practice standards and directly influenced professionals’ work with people who self\-neglect. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Self\-neglect encompasses neglecting to care for personal hygiene, health and/or home surroundings, and may result in severe health issues, fire risks and death. Braye \(Sussex\), Orr \(Sussex\) and Preston\-Shoot \(University of Bedfordshire\) worked closely together on a series of studies on policy and practice challenges in self\-neglect and safeguarding, 2009\-2014, across which all three researchers shared equal roles in research design, data collection, analysis and write\-up. Three studies were particularly key: 

 **Governance of Adult Safeguarding and Scoping Self\-Neglect Policy & Practice:** The Department of Health \(England\) \(DH\) funded research exploring \(i\) overall governance of adult safeguarding and \(ii\) conceptual and practice approaches to self\-neglect \(Dec 2009\-May 2010\). Through a rigorous review, policy analysis, and stakeholder workshops / interviews, the research: 

-  explored models of safeguarding governance, identified governance arrangements associated with strong performance, and recommended that government legislate to put adult safeguarding governance on a sounder footing; \(R1\) 

-  mapped the forms self\-neglect can take and how it has been conceptualised and operationalised, assisting policy\-makers, stakeholders and researchers to work towards definitions for policy and practice guidance; 

-  found that English local safeguarding policies rarely covered self\-neglect and UK\-based research literature was scant, highlighting the absence of clarity on service responsibilities for self\-neglect and effective practice; 

-  identified multiple factors contributing to self\-neglect, to inform assessment and aid professional recognition and awareness of the issue, and explored the complex, nuanced nature of mental capacity in self\-neglect decisions; 

-  theorised the legal, ethical and practice dilemmas, exploring why people may apparently ‘choose’ to self\-neglect and how professionals should respond in this situation, by addressing risks while respecting individual autonomy; 

-  explored the range of agencies that should be involved in self\-neglect cases and the need for structures to underpin collaboration, enabling a coordinated and effective response to self\-neglect. \(R2, R6\) 

 **Identifying Good Practice in Self\-Neglect:** DH funded further research into effective practice, to inform major reforms to adult social care legislation \(Mar 2013\-Jan 2014\). Based on a national survey and in\-depth interviews with managers, practitioners, and the largest sample to date within qualitative research of people who self\-neglect, the findings demonstrated how relationship\-based practice, skilled legal literacy, creative interventions, and meaningful multi\-agency working could lead to positive outcomes. They also evidenced how inter\-agency governance, training and supervision, referral pathways, and meaningful data capture can support effective practice. \(R3, R5\) 

 **Learning from Serious Case Reviews \(SCRs\) of Self\-Neglect:** SCRs, now renamed Safeguarding Adults Reviews \(SARs\), are inquiries required in law where there are concerns about agency effectiveness in working to protect individuals from serious abuse or neglect, in order to identify lessons learned. This research was the first to comprehensively collate and analyse SCR/SARs featuring self\-neglect \(Mar\-Aug 2014\). The study identified 32 such SCRs and extracted 19 recurring themes to inform service improvements. \(R4\)

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The research has permeated self\-neglect policy and practice within England at all levels by: 

-  informing the government’s decisions to make establishing a Safeguarding Adults Board \(SAB\) a statutory requirement for all local authorities in England and to impose a mandate to address self\-neglect as a safeguarding matter; 

-  shaping the local policies of SABs across England; 

-  setting the standards against which Safeguarding Adults Reviews \(SARs\) have evaluated systems and practitioners’ decisions, helping to define good practice; 

-  improving frontline practice by providing practitioners with an evidence base enabling effective, ethical safeguarding practice with people who self\-neglect. 

 Beneficiaries include DH and SABs, relevant health and social care practitioners and people who self\-neglect across England. 

 <ins> **1. Impact on National Policy**</ins> 

 The research, through three DH\-commissioned research reports and direct consultation between DH and the researchers, shaped DH policy\-making in two key ways: 

 **A. Making SABs mandatory:** The research showed the need for adult safeguarding governance to be underpinned by legislation, in order to strengthen inter\-agency collaboration, accountability and commitment to safeguarding \(R1\). DH’s then\-Lead for Safeguarding states that the findings were “of use to DH in informing deliberations on what arrangements should be made for Local SABs” and were highlighted in the 2011 Statement of Government Policy. The research thereby informed awareness and understanding among stakeholders during the ensuing process of public consultation, which in 2014 finally resulted in the Care Act placing a statutory obligation on all localities to establish SABs \(S1\-2\). The DH lead further notes that R1 “played a major part in our thinking” about the form SABs should take, guiding the final decision on how much flexibility the Care Act should allow beyond the core membership of the Local Authority, Clinical Commissioning Groups, and the police \(S2\). SAB responsibilities include safeguarding strategy, local policy development and quality assurance of practice, and their inclusion for the first time within legislation significantly strengthened the position of adult safeguarding. 

 **B. Inclusion of self\-neglect within adult safeguarding:** R2 showed that practitioners and agencies were often uncertain of their mandate in self\-neglect. Consequently, people who self\-neglected could by default be left at significant risk. DH’s then\-Lead for Safeguarding notes that social care workers were “expect\[ed\] to resolve issues in the absence of any clear statutory or practice guidance” and that Sussex research \(R2\-3\) was “invaluable in informing the Care and Support Statutory Guidance” \(S2\). This guidance, issued in October 2014, sets out how public bodies must comply with the Care Act. Sussex research “informed and clarified” the national policy definition of self\-neglect that it set out and “informed” the decision that self\-neglect could henceforth require a safeguarding response. This required SABs “to consider systematically how relevant agencies should respond” \(S2\) and raised awareness of self\-neglect among practitioners. By alleviating the previous uncertainty over self\-neglect, this made it less likely that people who self\-neglected would be left to suffer significant harm due to lack of joined\-up working by agencies. DH included within the statutory guidance two example case studies based directly on narratives gathered in R3, to support services and practitioners in recognising self\-neglect and intervening through person\-centred practice \(S3\). 

 <ins> **2. Impact on Local Policies across England**</ins> 

 Through research reports \(R2\-3\), key messages briefings, and direct consultancy work with SABs, the studies also informed policy on a local level, helping SABs to interpret their new mandate. In response to self\-neglect’s new status, all SABs in England had to develop multi\-agency policies and procedures to guide practice. The National SABs Chairs Network noted the value of the research for all members, stating that: 

 “as SAB Chairs, we have promoted Braye, Orr and Preston\-Shoot’s research with partners of our Boards as it provided a framework for reviewing whether current policies, procedures and practice were fit for purpose, as well as evidence for ways of improving the effectiveness of safeguarding interventions in this area of practice” \(S4\). 

 For their Boards, the research \(R2\-6\) “prompted and informed a different approach to working with people who self neglect” among SABs, “stimulating the development of longer term interventions and more supportive ways of working with people,” “prompting the setting up of multiagency panels where complex issues and risks can be presented, discussed and shared,” and “improving practitioners’ organisational, legal and other literacies” \(S4\). Attesting to the extent of the research’s impact is the fact that, while such local policies very rarely acknowledge academic work, 61 SABs’ multi\-agency policies explicitly state that they drew on the Sussex work in preparing the policy or direct practitioners to it for further guidance on good practice \(S5\); others have been implicitly or indirectly influenced. 

 <ins> **3. Setting Practice Standards**</ins> 

 SARs are a key learning mechanism for safeguarding, and feed back into practice and action planning by identifying ‘lessons learned’ from cases which have raised concerns. Although SARs rarely use research directly, 43 publicly available post\-2013 SARs in 36 different authorities of England and Jersey have explicitly drawn on the research findings: as a benchmark against which to evaluate local structures; as the basis for recommendations aimed to improve practice; to frame the dilemmas which confronted practitioners in the case; to identify gaps in assessment; as evidence for the effectiveness of person\-centred and rights\-based approaches; to contextualise local challenges against the national backdrop; to argue for greater resourcing of safeguarding in future; and/or as resources recommended to the local SAB in responding to the SAR’s conclusions \(S6\). In this way, the research drives forward the standards governing self\-neglect work and informing SAR recommendations for service improvement. For example, a South Tyneside SAR described \(S6\) how ‘Adult D’ died of sepsis and multiple organ failure, having been living surrounded by faeces and without heating. It drew on the research findings to note the significance of traumatic life experiences in self\-neglect \(R3\), missed by the practitioners. It further used the research to highlight practitioners’ need for support and practice guidelines addressing the challenges of self\-neglect \(R2, R4\) and prompt the development of an enhanced, research\-based self\-neglect toolkit. Through use in SARs, the research has contributed significantly to changing understanding, policies and practice within services where it is most needed. 

 <ins> **4</ins><ins>. Direct Impact on Practice**</ins> 

 The researchers worked with multiple partners to influence awareness and practice in self\-neglect across relevant professions, through: 115 half\- or full\-day workshops for individual SABs, the Royal College of GPs and Research in Practice for Adults \(RiPfA\) across 52 authorities; practice tools for RiPfA and Community Care Inform; webinars for the Local Government Association and RiPfA; and two research reports \(R2\-3\). Unusually, the Care and Support Statutory Guidance itself signposted practitioners to R2 as evidence for “ways of working that can have positive outcomes for those who self\-neglect” \(S2, S3\). 

 Each delivery partner evaluates training outcomes differently, making a full overview difficult. However, representative examples illustrate the significant impact on understanding and practice. RiPfA, a national registered charity promoting evidence\-based practice with a partner network of over 50 organisations, reported that 89.6% \(n=386\) of respondents in a set of 16 multi\-professional workshops, held in 2016\-17, stated that the likelihood of the research impacting on their practice was high or very high \(S7\). \[text removed for publication\] \(S8\). 

 The research’s insights into the complexities of mental capacity in self\-neglect \(R2, R6\) have repeatedly been highlighted by practitioners. The Mental Health Professional Lead in Wakefield reports that the: 

 “research looking at capacity and self\-neglect is an important bridge between the legislation and social workers’ experience in practice \[…\] These new insights into the assessing of capacity \[…\] allowed us to advise practitioners working through the complexities of confabulation” \(S9\). 

 The impact reaches beyond Adult Social Care. For example, the Adults Safeguarding Lead for an NHS Foundation Trust comments on increased awareness among hospital staff: 

 “the research evidence embedded in the training has really made a difference \[…\] it has just become pretty normal for staff to consider self\-neglect/hoarding and the need for a multi\-disciplinary approach” \(S10\). 

 Because of the changes described above that led self\-neglect to be classified under safeguarding \(S2\), national data are now gathered that enable the scale of the issue to be estimated. NHS Digital figures report that 7790 safeguarding inquiries into self\-neglect were completed under s. 42 of the Care Act in 2018\-19; many more cases are dealt with through other referral routes. Sussex research has been pivotal at all levels – statute, policy and practice – to improving recognition, help and support for these thousands of people in situations of self\-neglect.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The cosmetics industry has a highly significant economic impact in the UK and globally. In order to assist with the safety evaluation of ingredients in cosmetic products we have developed a variety of computational approaches linking chemical structure to potential harmful effects. In addition, the COSMOS Database has provided a rich source of repeated dose toxicity data that has been utilised to update the Threshold of Toxicological Concern \(TTC\) concept. The computational models and TTC have been recognised by international regulatory authorities for their impact on the risk assessment of cosmetics ingredients. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the implementation of the 2013 ban on animal testing of cosmetics ingredients in the European Union, many other countries and regions have followed suit \(Brazil, California etc.\). As a result, safety assessment of cosmetics ingredients requires non\-animal methods, which are acceptable to both regulatory and industrial bodies. LJMU has been at the forefront of developing computational methods that assist in the evaluation of cosmetic ingredients. 

 For over 25 years, LJMU has been a world leader and innovator in the application of knowledge from chemical structure and the implementation of computational methods \(e.g. QSAR and read\-across\) to predict the effects of chemicals on human health. More recently, LJMU led the COSMOS Project \(2011\-2015\) as part of the SEURAT\-1 cluster, which developed alternatives to assess the safety of cosmetics ingredients \[R1\]. A key focus the COSMOS Project was the development of a database of safety data \(such as No Observable Effect Levels \(NOELs\)\) for cosmetics ingredients. LJMU led activities in data collection and evaluation in COSMOS. The resultant database, COSMOS DB, is freely available and maintained as a significant output from the Project. COSMOS has more than 80,000 chemical records with more than 40,000 unique structures. Importantly, there are data from in excess of 12,000 toxicity studies, across 27 endpoints for more than 1,600 compounds. The database has become a fundamental source of information on the safety of cosmetics ingredients, as well as the basis for further analysis and modelling \[R2\]. 

 Data from the COSMOS project have underpinned the derivation and update of Thresholds of Toxicological Concern \(TTC\) values for cosmetics ingredients. LJMU co\-ordinated careful curation of the data through collaboration with scientists from industry and regulatory agencies. For the Repeated Dose Toxicity data included in COSMOS DB, thorough analysis was made to create the dataset of NOEL values from which the TTC value was derived \[R3\]. LMJU performed analysis of the dataset, enriched with cosmetics ingredients and materials, and confirmed it as being suitable to make a risk assessment of ingredients in low concentration, negating the need for any further assessment \(and hence animal or other tests\). This approach was extended to make it relevant for the dermal route of exposure, as is common with most cosmetics \[R4\]. 

 Further analysis of the COSMOS database was undertaken and these repeated dose toxicity data and informatics structure enabled a detailed assessment of the chemistry that underpins organ level toxicity. This has been organised in accordance with the respective Adverse Outcome Pathways \(AOPs\), the AOP paradigm having been endorsed by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\). Structural alerts focussing on mechanisms of action for liver toxicity have been developed which allow for the identification and grouping \(hence a precursor for read\-across\) of compounds with the potential to act as mitochondrial toxicants \[R5\]. Work arising from the COSMOS Project and LJMU has enabled improved reporting of use of read\-across and computational models \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The European cosmetics and personal care market is the largest in the world with €78.6 billion retail sales in 2018, supporting over 2 million jobs directly and indirectly. The safety of cosmetics products must be assured; however, legislation has banned the traditional means of obtaining information through animal testing. Thus, there is a requirement for new methods in the safety assessment of cosmetics. The COSMOS Project supported this requirement by providing access to existing data and computational models through the development of the COSMOS DB, the creation of cosmetics materials enriched TTC values, and models for the screening of compounds for liver toxicity. These initiatives have built on several decades of work by Cronin, Madden, Enoch in the area of data compilation and curation and in silico model development. 

 COSMOS DB is a publicly available resource for toxicological information with a focus on data for cosmetics ingredients. Since the end of the COSMOS Project in 2015 it has been maintained by Molecular Networks GmbH \(Nürnberg, Germany\) and has over 2,800 registered and regular users \[Corroborating Source 1, \(CS1\)\] including manufacturers of cosmetics products. It is used by regulatory agencies, for instance the data from COSMOS DB has been included in the US EPA’s Chemistry Dashboard and Japan NITE’s HESS databases \[CS2\]. Due to the quality of the information and curation, the COSMOS DB has been recognised by the European Union’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety \(SCCS\), the expert group that provides opinions on the health and safety risks of non\-food consumer products including cosmetics \[CS3\]. 

 The COSMOS DB is continually being extended through the COSMOS DataShare Point which is led by Cronin \[https://www.mn\-am.com/projects/cosmosdatasharepoint\]. This initiative has led to a significant increase in the number and type of data, as well as inventories, held within COSMOS DB since the end of the COSMOS project, with significant donations from NITE \(Japan\), Cosmetics Ingredient Review \(US\) and KCII \(Korea\). Biannual meetings are held for users in Europe and the US respectively \(with further outreach to South Korea and Japan\). COSMOS DB is also being sustained through major investment from Cosmetics Europe’s Long Range Science Strategy. The approaches formulated in COSMOS \(e.g. the database, TTC, read\-across\) have been a major influence in Cosmetics Europe’s strategy for systemic toxicity assessment based on non\-animal approaches \[CS4, CS5\]. 

 COSMOS DB itself had a major revamp in 2020 to allow for a more flexible software architecture and, more significantly, the inclusion of models for toxicity prediction. The models included those from the LJMU group for the identification of potential toxicants. These models have been documented and disseminated by EURL\-ECVAM DB\-ALM ensuring widespread uptake \[CS6\]. Taken as a whole, these models, or compilations of structural alerts termed profilers, are able to identify potentially toxic molecules directly or through category formation and read\-across. Cronin et al undertook a number of case studies applying techniques, such as read\-across, to groups of compounds relevant to the cosmetics industry. These studies were reviewed by the OECD with recommendations that the profilers will assist in the reduction of uncertainties associated with the models and their use as New Approach Methodologies \[CS7\]. 

 The outputs of the COSMOS Project in terms of TTC are noted by the SCCS through their opinions \[CS3\] and recognised as a viable method in Next\-Generation Risk Assessment \[CS8\]. In addition they form the basis \(or lowest Tier\) of strategies employed by the cosmetics industry to assess the safety of ingredients, e.g. International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation \(ICCR\) utilises this approach in its Next\-Generation Risk Assessment strategy allowing it to be more firmly based on exposure to an ingredient \[CS9\]. In addition, a further major output of the SEURAT\-1 Project, an ab initio workflow for chemical safety assessment, makes use of COSMOS DB, the updated TTC and the models from COSMOS. The ab initio strategy, or chemical safety assessment workflow based on exposure considerations and non\-animal methods, has been reviewed by OECD which highlighted the possibilities for using multiple data streams for safety assessment decisions \[CS10\] 

 Overall, the outputs from the COSMOS Project have been recognised by SCCS and ICCR for their role in the safety assessment of cosmetics across Europe and beyond without the use of animals. In addition, they have allowed for a dialogue and interchange to be achieved with government agencies.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at Edinburgh Napier University has addressed the requirement for human trust in the capture, storage, use and sharing of sensitive data, notably that collected and used in health care. The patented work has been used in a wide range of applications, such as providing governance of the information sharing within health care and finance, and provides a scientific base for a highly successful spin\-out \(Symphonic Software\), recently acquired for USD31million \(11\-2020\). Our research has led to the development of secure, robust and scalable information infrastructures which benefit both individuals and society in areas such as the health and finance sectors.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Weaknesses in information sharing within the UK’s public sector have led to many issues, such as those identified within the Victoria Climbié case where police forces failed to share important information which might have saved Victoria’s life. Along with this, there are well\-known weaknesses within health care around the lack of data integration of the citizen within their health and social care practices. 

 Over the past decade, Professor Bill Buchanan, Alistair Lawson and Professor Christoph Thuemmler \(a clinical practitioner\) led a team of researchers focused on developing new secure infrastructures addressing these issues, developing novel data governance models which support information sharing and integrate the rights of the citizen. The research addressed gaps around data governance related to ownership rights, governance, and privacy through the creation of a framework that set out new processes relating to citizen\-defined access policies. 

 The research began with a collaboration with Police Scotland, looking at weaknesses around information sharing within law enforcement **\[P1\].** Through this project, the team developed a way of solving the complex problem of the large\-scale integration of rights across interconnected domains, where a domain is defined as the entity which stores citizen data \(for example, storing health data within the NHS, or social care data within Council\-owned systems\). The team created a method of using Binary Decision Diagrams \(BDDs\) **\[O1\]** to model complex policies, which enables novel approaches to integration of risk models **\[O3\]** and the abstraction of legal requirements using a novel data obfuscation method **\[O4\].** The team then evaluated this in the context of protecting citizen data within investigations.  The approach enabled complex sharing policies to be structured, and the detection of rule anomalies \(allowing something, and then disallowing it at another place\) and rule shadowing \(where rules are contained in a large set or where they can be merged\). 

 This research was patented in US, UK and World patents filed in 2013/14, defining a ground\-breaking method of modelling information sharing between organizations and where the permissions for the sharing of information are represented as Boolean functions using Binary Decision Diagrams \(BDDs\) **\[O1\]**. 

 The research, also led by Professor Buchanan \(funded within two EPSRC/Innovate UK funded projects: DACAR **\[P3\]** and Trust **\[P2\]**\) was then further developed by introducing the concept of data\-buckets owned by the citizen **\[O2\].** The team evaluated this in health and social care domains **\[P3\]** in a collaboration with clinical researchers in Imperial College, and clinical staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Trust **\[P2\]** focused on improved health care within the home environment, with a special focus on the risks for elderly citizens. The new platform ensured that the citizen had complete ownership and governance of their own health care data. As well as the health and social care evaluation **\[O2\]** the researchers evaluated this in the context of integration with home environments **\[O6\]**, focusing on citizen rights within information sharing. 

 The team have extended research into the secure and robust storage of data within Cloud\-based systems, using secret encrypted shares to distribute data across multiple Cloud systems **\[O5\] \[P11\]**. This method considerably enhances both the security and resilience of the storage of health care records. It led to new research projects related to trust architectures within health care **\[P4\]\[P5\]** and the detection of frailty in a home environment **\[P6\]\[P10\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The work has led to a highly successful spin\-out, Symphonic Software, which was acquired by Ping Identity in 2020 for USD31million \(11\-2020\). The software infrastructure sold by Symphonic Software has been used within the information sharing of personal identifiable information \(PII\) in health\-care related applications, including health\-care sharing across EU borders, and has had many commercial applications, including the finance sector. Successful collaborations have taken place with a range of companies on citizen\-focused privacy\-related work, resulting in a patent that will be used in the US education sector.  The impacts are summarized in the following sections: 

 **A. Integrating the citizen and their rights** 

 Proof\-of\-Concept funding from Scottish Enterprise **\[P9\]** allowed the underlying research on proving a large scale information sharing architecture in health care to be developed into the sa.FIRE \(Secure Analysis and Filtering Risk Engine\) information architecture engine. This attracted further investment and in 2013, a company was spun\-out: Symphonic Software **\[C2\]**.  By Dec 2020, Symphonic Software had 35 full\-time employees and has been through several rounds of investment **\[C3\]**. It has developed markets around the world, and has been involved in large\-scale integration projects, including health and social care information sharing within the NHS National Services Scotland and Scottish Ambulance Service **\[C2\]**. The developed engine has now been applied to different application areas, including in the finance sector, and in information sharing across the public sector. Symphonic Software’s customer list includes: Ping Identity, NHS National Services Scotland, Tesco Bank, the Scottish Government, Janrain \(part of Akamai\), and OneLondon **\[C2\]**. 

 Symphonic was acquired by Ping Identity in November 2020 for USD31million \(11\-2020\). The CEO and Founder of Ping Identity says: “ *The acquisition of Symphonic accelerates our vision for enterprises to not only maintain security and compliance with confidence, but to easily deliver personalized, trustworthy experiences*” **\[C7\]**.  For the last four years, Ping Identity has been defined as a leader in Gartner’s 2020 Magic Quadrant for Access Management. 

 The CEO of Symphonic says: “ *I would like to thank the University for providing us with the opportunity to scale the research work from the DACAR project and other related research into the creation of Symphonic.  From the core ideas and working within Symphonic, we have developed the fundamental research into a number of sectors and industries, including Health, represented by EU Horizon 2020 work, the NHS in Scotland and in some of the US's largest health\-related organisations. The fundamental ideas that originated in Napier's research work have provided a core focus around the citizen and their rights, and we have appreciated the opportunity to scale the core research principles into a range of application areas”*. **\[C10\]** 

 The information sharing infrastructure developed in the research **\[O2\]** is also being used in the EU\-funded SHiELD \(European Security in Health Data Exchange\) programme of which Symphonic Software is a partner. This aims to share citizen health care data across borders **\[C5\].** Symphonic thus successfully applied information sharing to a range of health and social care applications. The Director/CIO of OneLondon, North London Partners in health and care, says: "" *Symphonic provided us with the services and support to deliver the outcomes needed for the OneLondon information governance programme. The solution is used across the whole of London to protect access to patient data, streamline data governance and improve patient care*"" **\[C2\].** The Head of Finance Crime at Tesco Bank says: “ *Through a collaborative approach, Symphonic provided a sophisticated orchestration layer and policy decision platform enabling Tesco Bank to meet demanding regulatory requirements”* **\[C2\]**. CEO at RAIDIAM – a UK\-based identity company \- explains: "" *Symphonic brings a real step change to digital policy decision making. Their solution makes solving complex business use cases at an internet scale easier to deliver and easier to manage”* **\[C2\].** 

 **B. Citizen\-focused data privacy** 

 Our work around data privacy has led to successful collaborations. A collaboration with HAS Technology focused on new infrastructure for health and social care, leading to wearable technologies to predict the risk of people falling. This won “Innovation of the Year” at the Scottish Knowledge Exchange awards in 2020 **\[C8\]**. 

 The research team has scaled their work into secure storage of citizen data within public clouds, working with Payfont Ltd in the creation of a Cloud\-based architecture which uses data fragments. The developed system is known as ADeCA \(Anonymised Distributed eCloud Architecture\) and is a heterogeneous, keyless, non\-linear, hybrid data architecture that renders data completely fragmented and contextless, making it meaningless to outsiders **\[O5\]**. This won ‘Innovation of the Year’ in 2017 at the inaugural Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards **\[C6\]**. It has resulted in a patent **\[C11\]**, which was acquired by Leading Software Limited in December 2019 and is being applied within an education product within the US. Charlie Morrison, a Director of Leading Software Limited, outlines: “ *We are building on this patent and will provide a solution that could be used globally i.e. in every one of the 61,000 colleges/universities worldwide. It would be a highly secure 'data vault' facility where highly sensitive University/College/High School student transcript files are removed/transferred in from the student records systems and stored separately using ADeCA principles \(as defined in the patent\) in an application that is only viewable or accessible by approved students, admin staff employers and so on, authenticating with multi\-factor tests*” **\[C12\]**. 

 The long\-term drive around trust, governance, consent and privacy resulted in Prof Bill Buchanan receiving an ""Outstanding Contribution Award"" in 2018 at the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards for sustained work within areas such as health care **\[C9\]**. Along with this, the success of this work has supported the university in the creation of the world's first Blockchain Identity lab **\[C1\]** which has a core focus on the citizen and their rights **\[P7\]\[P8\]**, attracting further funding in 2020 **\[C4\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Research into the history of responses to natural disasters has shaped new and globally significant approaches to building community resilience in the face of natural disasters. Bankoff’s international projects served to: reorient the Red Crescent Society’s response to the effects of earthquakes in rural communities by providing training in best practice methodologies to its staff \(Kazakhstan\); highlight the significance of community level associations and improved the quality of NGO interventions in hazard mitigation \(Philippines\); and informed the policy and guidance documents of the Association of Drainage Authorities \(UK\) by offering insights into improving the governance of drainage systems. 
","
 2. **Underpinning Research** 

 Responses to historical natural disasters \(earthquake, volcanos, flooding\) in three international locales has shaped a seminal contribution to **Disaster Risk Reduction** \(DRR\), led by Bankoff and a project team supported by a total of £3.5m in competitive funding. **The impact of this research is extended through the work of NGOs, research institutes, HEIs, and local agencies and communities in locales with enhanced risk of natural disasters**. Appointed as Professor of Environmental History in 2007, Bankoff has established an international profile at the forefront of investigating the past and present importance of local and cultural responses to **reduce risk**, **build community resilience**, **facilitate adaptation**, and so make societies **less vulnerable to natural hazards**, in rural, urban, coastal and estuarine settings. These are often **the forgotten places of global climate change:** Indigenous, post\-colonial and post\-Soviet spaces in which a large proportion of the most disadvantaged of the global community bear a disproportionate effect and cost of climate change and natural disasters. Bankoff’s approach to the broader field of DRR is defined by attention to the epistemologies of cultural difference, by placing local knowledge at the centre of responses to natural disasters. The **World Disaster Report** \(3.1\), which Bankoff co\-edited and contributed seven chapters, foregrounds his **key research insight, that culture must form an integral aspect of DRR in the future**. The Report focusses on the **need for policymakers and practitioners to take account of variations in cultures, beliefs, and attitudes and how their different interpretations of risk** must be integrated into the organizational framework and funding models of international aid organisations as set out in the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action \(‘Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters’\) and underpins the UN’s **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development**. As part of this new approach, the impact of Hull’s research contributes to a more historically aware and people\-centred understanding of DRR: one that is not hampered by methodological silos, context\-bound concepts and methodologies, or lack of dialogue between ‘western’ and ‘second’ or ‘fourth’ world epistemologies. 

 **2.1 Living with earthquakes in post\-Soviet Kazakhstan** 

 As part of **Earthquakes Without Frontiers**, a large multi\-disciplinary NERC/ESRC project \(£3 million\), Bankoff led a seven\-year interdisciplinary humanities and social science research programme that **revealed the low level of earthquake risk perception and preparedness in rural areas of south\-eastern Kazakhstan.** This work was carried out in collaboration with regional and national branches of the **Red Crescent of Kazakhstan**, which subsequently carried out DRR training that was directly informed by Bankoff’s research in affected villages in Turkistan, Jambyl and Almaty. The co\-produced documentary short *Scattered Pieces*, directed by an award\-winning photojournalist, featured a contemporary Kazakh visual artist’s project of using murals and mixed media to communicate risk to residents in earthquake\-prone regions; the film is now part of the Red Crescent’s public communication and education strategy. In collaboration with the **Kazakh Research Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Architecture**, the project also completed a large\-scale survey and assessment of residential buildings in the provincial city of Taraz to highlight issues of compliance with national building regulations, and to identify reasons that determine non\-compliance, and therefore elevate risk. A community\-focussed study analysed residents’ lack of prioritisation of earthquake risk in comparison to floods and mudslides in Talgar, a dormitory town for the city of Almaty. **The results of this research generated multiple pathways to inform agency response, and to increase community resilience via focussed communications of risk to affected and at risk populations**, \(3.2\-3\). 

 **2.2 ‘Co\-volcanic’ societies in the Philippines** 

 Bankoff’s research **has driven a methodological step change in the study of environmental history in the Philippines**, a country where 80% of the population live in close proximity to an active volcano. The vulnerability of local communities was revealed in a project \(2015\-2019\) funded by the **Australian Research Council**, which focussed on Mount Mayon, which has erupted over 50 times since 1616. This research revealed the centrality of historical considerations to understand how risk is ‘constructed’ by a range of often inadvertent interactions between humans and their physical environment. **Communities and their volcanos have co\-evolved, with social systems influencing the behaviour of volcanic systems.** It was found, for instance, that road and rail links historically acted to channel lava and lahars towards communities. This project directly challenges the utility of existing terminological classifications by illustrating that the frequency with which a volcano erupts has much more bearing on DRR than any volcanological classification. Deploying the indigenous concept of **bayanihan the research highlighted how community **vulnerability is the product of culture**, in particular, the way people perceive the world around them and act according to traditional patterns of behaviour over expanses of time, themselves attuned to the *longue durée* of seismic time \(3.4\-5\) 

 **2.3 Local flood mitigation in England** 

 The integration of the nuances of history and culture into DRR was also implemented in an **AHRC\-funded** research project \(2017\-\) led by Bankoff and involving a team including Dr John Morgan \(Manchester\), Dr Leona Skelton \(Northumbria\) and Dr Jane Rowling \(PDRA, Hull\) that analysed archival materials and conducted interviews with flood risk management practitioners and stakeholders in England. This research has been taken up by the UK **Association of Drainage Authorities** as a tool to assess the resilience of a complex network of drainage systems to a measurable increase in annual rainfall each year since 2011. **It develops an approach that views flood as a social construction as much as a physical hazard, and that places people and environment at the centre of a more historically oriented understanding of flooding in England.** Ordinary watercourses constitute the foundation of the UK drainage network and yet their role has been virtually ignored. Widening the focus from the perspective of short\-term risk to longer term understandings of place and landscape revealed how the **incremental development of drainage infrastructure over the centuries** has made optimising the system or radically restructuring it unfeasible. Case studies were conducted in the four flood\-prone counties of Cumbria, East Riding, Lincolnshire and Somerset. **The research highlights the importance of understanding the nature of past developments to the formulation of current and future policy and planning** \(3.6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1. Informing disaster preparedness in a post\-Soviet Republic** 

 Bankoff’s contribution to Earthquakes Without Frontiers \(2013\-2018\) led to **transformational increases in understanding of earthquake hazards** in Kazakhstan and led to policy changes by national organisation, affecting the lives of 4.5 million people. **The Kazakh Red Crescent \(KRC\) benefitted directly** from Bankoff’s research to address the gap in public understanding in one of the globe’s most seismically active regions, by leveraging the concept of *Asar* \- a set of values from Kazakstan’s pre\-Soviet indigenous past and part of a system of **village\-based reciprocity**. According to the **General Director of the KRC**, Bankoff’s research was integral to driving a wholesale shift in approach: ‘Working together, we were able to expand the reach of our organisation to villages where we had not worked before in South Kazakhstan’. Where much earthquake related DRR focusses on the ‘seismic future’ of cities, Bankoff’s work enabled the KRC to adjust its focus to ‘the **countryside and smaller towns, when before most of our attention was on people in larger cities. This shift was driven by our collaboration with this project and has significant long\-term benefits’.** Data and key findings were shared with a range of state agencies and local authorities, and will **‘positively affect the lives of the population of Talgar and Almaty’** \(5.7\). Subsequent publications from this research constitute important new insights that conceptually reframe earthquake risk reduction in post\-Soviet Central Asia \(3.2\-3, 5.8\). The former **Deputy Director of the Red Crescent** states that: ‘Working with Professor Bankoff for such an **extended period of time** provided an important training opportunity for myself and Red Crescent volunteers to **engage with best practice research methodologies** involved in the planning, creation and administration of surveys, sampling strategies, the organisation and facilitation of focus group discussions, and personal interviewing techniques’. The impact of this research **‘materially contributed to the Kazakh Red Crescent’s ability to reduce the future risk of earthquakes’.** Specifically, Bankoff’s work shaped how the KRC approached the challenge of educating the rural segments of Kazakhstan’s 18 million people to the nature of disaster management in a context where the United Nations Development Report concluded that preparation for and understanding of natural disasters was ‘ineffective’. The Deputy Director of the Red Crescent affirms that the collaboration with Prof Bankoff ‘ **has had a lasting impact on myself and the other members of the Kazakh Red Crescent’, with the effect of ‘improving our skills base’. In addition, the project generated vital data assets that ‘provided the Red Crescent with a very important database on rural risk perception on which to base future educational campaigns and relief operations’** \(5.6\). 

 **4.2. Indigenous knowledge and the volcanic environment in the Philippines** 

 Bankoff’s research has added critical, timely and demand\-led expertise in countries where state institutions are less robust and have fewer financial resources to contend with environmental disasters. In the Philippines, Bankoff’s projects have built bridges between state agencies and local communities, driving multi\-level collaboration that has enhanced community resilience through the adoption of **new practices**, the development of new **strategies of risk and response**, and through the creation of ecologies of knowledge\-exchange. This research, as the former **Director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness**, one of the leading NGOs engaged in this field, comments ‘has appreciably contributed to our understanding of such events’ by ‘ **highlighting the importance of understanding people’s pasts in what makes communities vulnerable or resilient’** today \(5.2\).  Over the past two decades, too, Bankoff has been ‘one of the leading scholars in the genre of environmental history in the Philippines and, almost single\-handedly, **pioneered the study and understanding of how societies in these islands have adapted to hazard’** \(5.3 & 5.4\). His research has directly shaped public understanding of the cultures of disaster and their place in Philippine history and civil society: ‘His work on community resilience and how Filipinos have and do organise themselves, what is popularly referred to nowadays as *bayanihan*, has shown why **historical work is relevant to Filipinos today and how we can learn from the practices of our forebears’** \(5.3\). This work forms part of a wider initiative to **democratise the communication of risk** associated with natural hazards, by decentring technical and conceptual registers of western science and making local communities active agents in the communication of risk. This is vital in the Philippines, where over **1.3 million children and adolescents do not participate in education**. The approach to *bayanihan*, which represents a recovery of indigenous knowledge at the intersection of environment and place is now the starting point for the study of local responses to climate change. This approach formed the topic of a November 2020 webinar ‘Structures of Mutual Support’, sponsored by the Metropolitan Museum of Manila and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, in which Bankoff appeared as an expert commentator \(5.5\). 

 **4.3. Community level water administration in the UK** 

 Bankoff’s work on local flooding in England began with his expert contribution to the Independent Review Body created by Hull City Council in response to the extensive flooding that impacted the region in 2007. The ongoing ‘ **Local Governance and Community Resilience to Floods’** project, which builds on and significantly scales up previous work on flooding in the Humberside region \(5.9\), has been designed specifically to support the **Association of Drainage Authorities** \(ADA\) to improve governance structures and reform the sector. These reforms directly affect 2.2 million people in four English counties with a combined Gross Value Added of c. £30b. As ADA’s Chief Executive writes: ‘ **Professor Bankoff’s pioneering research is a key component for delivering this vision that will enhance community\-level water administration and provide better flood risk management and water security in an era when we are fighting for resources to protect our communities from the devastating effects of flooding’** \(5.10\). Since 2018, the research team led by Bankoff has intensely engaged with stakeholders, interviewing local Members of Parliament, local councillors, the Environment Agency, Internal Drainage Board members, farmers and private sector interests to tap local knowledge built on historical experience so as to provide ‘ **valuable impact in terms of how we identify weaknesses in the drainage system and how we provide guidance about flood risk management’** \(5.10\). In this way, ongoing research is building bridges between local communities and state agencies and informing policy with reference to the resonances of past water management experiences and the practical, community\-driven solutions they reveal. This locally informed approach to flood mitigation underpins the UoH’s contribution to **Ark: the National Flood Resilience Centre**, a collaboration with Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, and the **Living with Water Project,** involving the Environment Agency, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, and Yorkshire Water. – this research has made a vital contribution to the significant enhancement in research capacity in this area at the UoH, which is driving global collaborations at scale, including a **British Academy** funded project to examine intercultural and intergenerational knowledge exchange around flooding in Vietnam; the **£1.3m Leverhulme Doctoral Centre for Water Cultures**. Elements of Bankoff’s approach served as the basis for the UoH’s new **MSc in Flood Risk Management**, which includes a focus on holistic and community\-driven responses to flooding events.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 
The Andean religious and cultural heritage has been understudied and its importance has been unfairly downplayed. This is for two interrelated reasons: ethnic groups in Peru, such as the Chanka Indians, lack access to their own religious history; and Andean forms of communication, ‘khipus’, have been disparaged as not being ‘true writing’, while, their sacred nature has been overlooked. Prof. Sabine Hyland’s research on the religious history of the Peruvian Chanka Indians, resulting in the first historical ethnography of them, **\(1\)** **helped to recover and valorise Peru’s religious and cultural heritage, and led to the establishment of the Chanka Museum in 2016, which is used by local Chanka people to learn about their history**. Sabine and William Hyland's research on the Andean system of writing with knotted cords, ‘khipus’ \(which includes the first partial decipherment of a khipu text\) has transformed how this Andean form of communication is understood. It was thought to have been merely a memory aide; by advancing decipherment, we showed that it was actually a complex writing system. Our research **\(2\) has been incorporated into the Peruvian school curricula, reaching over 485,000 people \(Peruvian students\) to date, teaching children about their ancestors’ intellectual achievements.** Our research has also **\(3\) demonstrated how khipus can continue to function as sacred texts in modern Andean villages, such as Collata.** In Collata, a translated copy of our publication has been placed in their sacred archive. Additionally, our khipu discoveries have received international media coverage, and thereby **\(4\)** **increased public understanding of Andean religious and cultural achievements worldwide.** The story of our khipu decipherments has been carried by major news outlets, such as *The Times*, *The Daily Express*, and *All About History* magazine. Our research was featured in *Discover* Magazine \(October 2017\); in a cover article in *New Scientist* \(September 2018\); and in an interview for the BBC World Service show, Outlook. Prof. Sabine Hyland also appeared in two Discovery Channel documentaries to discuss our khipu decipherments.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The religious and cultural achievements of the native peoples of the Andes have often been undervalued and denigrated. Our research addresses this issue by writing the first historical ethnography of the Chanka nation, revealing the impact of colonial Spanish priests and religion on their cultural institutions; and by making advances in deciphering the khipus, the knotted cord Andean system of communication, demonstrating that it was an actual writing system and not just a memory aide. 

 Prof. Hyland published the first history and ethnography of the Chanka Indian nation **\(R1\)** based on extensive archival and ethnographic research, revealing for the first time the complexities of Chanka culture, and the effects of colonial religious institutions on the people. The research revealed the rule of one Spanish priest whose legacy had repercussions on the Chankas’ yearly festivals and their kinship structures into the 18<sup>th</sup> century and beyond **\(R1\)**. In regard to the khipu writing system, Hyland’s research has made, for the first time in 100 years, a series of five key advances in khipu decipherment and philology: it has deciphered the meaning of knot direction in khipus **\(R2\)**; deciphered the significance of ply direction in khipus **\(R2\)**; deciphered the two most common colour patterns in khipus **\(R3\)**; discovered and partially deciphered the first phonetic Andean khipus ever known, demonstrating that the colourful cords represented syllables and could even tell a story **\(R5\)**; and analysed the ways in which khipus are sacred texts and played an integral role in religious festivals **\(R4, R5** and **R6\)**. 

 The appreciation of the Andean religious and cultural heritage has been hindered, in part, by a lack of research on regional groups, such as the Chanka of Andahuaylas, Peru, whose history – particularly their colonial religious history – has been entirely ignored. The Chanka have been stereotyped as brutal ‘savages’ and they have been described pejoratively as ‘bellicose warriors’ in Peruvian textbooks for schoolchildren. Respect for Peru’s spiritual and cultural heritage has also been hindered by the lack of understanding of the nature of the Andean communication system of knotted cords known as ‘khipus’. Most scholars have claimed that Andean khipus were not writing, but merely simple memory aides, implying a low level of intellectual achievement for native Peruvians. The khipus' sacred nature as religious texts in the remote Andean villages that retain them has also been overlooked. Our research has demonstrated previously unknown ways in which Spanish missionaries employed khipus to teach Christian catechisms and other religious texts **\(R4, R5** and **R6\)**. The phonetic khipus that we have studied in the village of Collata are believed to express the sentiments of the local mountain deities.  We are the first researchers to demonstrate how khipus are integrated as sacred texts in Andean life. Deciphering Andean khipus enriches our understanding of Andean religion and culture. 

 Our research **\(R1\-R6\)** has contributed to the recovery of Peru's religious and cultural heritage in two ways: first, by uncovering the colonial religious history of the Chanka people, and second by advancing the decipherment of khipu writing, disproving the dominant view that they were merely memory aides, and demonstrating the role of modern khipus in Andean religious beliefs.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Our research on the first historical ethnography of the Chanka nation and the khipus, the knotted cord Andean system of communication, has \(1\) helped to recover and valorise Peru’s religious and cultural heritage; \(2\) led to our research being incorporated into the Peruvian educational curriculum; \(3\) demonstrated how khipus can continue to function as sacred texts in modern Andean villages, such as Collata; and \(4\) increased public understanding of Andean religious and cultural achievements worldwide. 

 **1\) Our research has helped to recover and valorise Peru's religious and cultural heritage.** 

 Prof. Sabine Hyland’s book on the Chanka nation **\(R1\)** has given Chanka Indians a better understanding of their religious and cultural heritage, a heritage which typically has been disparaged in Peruvian history textbooks. The Andahuaylas Minister of Culture and Commerce wrote: *‘publication of “The Chankas and the Priest” represents a watershed moment for us in Andahuaylas \[home of the Chanka nation\]….For the first time we see our Chanka ancestors humanised; in their actions, we can see ourselves. No longer just ""enemies of the Inka"" or ""bellicose warriors"", Professor Hyland's research and publications have given us a fuller sense of who we are as a people, and the importance of valorizing, perserving and celebrating our cultural heritage'* **\(S1\)**. 

 Our research on the Chanka Indian nation **\(R1\)** resulted in the establishment, in the city of Andahuaylas, Peru, in 2016, of the  [Chanka Museum](https://www.facebook.com/museochankalamas/). The museum features Chanka history displays based on our research where local people learn about their history and spiritual heritage **\(S1\)**. For bringing the voice of the ancient Chanka, their ‘own’ history, to their present\-day ancestors, the Chankas have made Prof. Sabine Hyland ‘ *an honorary Andahuaylina who contributes to the cultural, academic and economic life of this region in significant and long\-lasting ways*’ **\(S1\)**. 

 **2\) Our research has led to changes in the Peruvian educational curriculum to improve religious and cultural awareness.** 

 Our project's discoveries have been incorporated into Peruvian educational curriculums at the **2i\)** national \(the Peruvian Ministry of Education\); **2ii\)** regional \(Cuzco regional government\); and **2iii\)** local \(Collata village school\) levels. 

 **2i\)** After seeing the international media coverage on our khipu discoveries, the Peruvian Ministry of Education asked Prof. Hyland in 2017 to fact\-check and provide photos for an online classroom lesson about our research which the Ministry subsequently prepared for schoolteachers throughout Peru. Titled ‘Our khipus astonish the world’ \( [http://www.perueduca.pe/estudiantes/especial\-del\-mes/nuestros\-quipus\-siguen\-asombrando\-al\-mundo](http://www.perueduca.pe/estudiantes/especial-del-mes/nuestros-quipus-siguen-asombrando-al-mundo)\), this lesson has been accessed by Peruvian school teachers 17,444 times to date, reaching over 485,000 people \(Peruvian students\) and thus approximately 20% of the total number of secondary school children in Peru \(25 August 2020; the website maintains a counter that records only when teachers access the site\). Teachers share comments on the site. Here are four indicative examples: ‘ *How important this article about khipus \[is\]; as teachers we must know more about our ancestors so that we can teach the next generation about our history so that it is never forgotten’* \(28/03/18\); ‘ *Interesting lesson\! What a marvellous legacy our ancestors have left to us... this is a very beautiful subject to discuss with our students’* \(27/03/18\); ‘ *We as teachers need to know more about this topic to teach our students and to call attention to the lives of our ancestors, so that when we make comparisons with other societies, we are not left behind’* \(18/01/19\); ‘ *A great contribution to discoveries about our ancestors, and a great legacy for future generations*’ \(18/01/19\) **\(S2\)**. 

 **2ii\)** In 2015, the Cuzco Province's Ministry of Culture learned about Sabine Hyland's research from a National Geographic documentary about her work \(Decoding the Incas\) that aired in Peru in Spanish. They then asked Hyland to write an article about her khipu discoveries. The Cuzco regional government \(population 2,000,000 people\) prepared and printed this publication at their expense about our khipu discoveries for all the provincial schools and libraries as a resource for teachers and students \(15,000 copies\). The Ministry of Culture in Cuzco wrote, ‘ *\[your research\] has greatly expanded our understanding of the value of the cultural heritage of the Andean people*’ **\(S3\)**. 

 **2iii\)** When community leaders in the Andean village of Collata saw Peruvian newspaper stories about our research on their khipus, they asked Professor Hyland for a copy of the Current Anthropology article **\(R5\)** which triggered the media interest. She provided the article, which they translated, and is now included in the curriculum of the local school. As a village leader wrote, ‘ *We want our children to understand the value of their cultural heritage*’ and therefore ‘ *they need to know about your discoveries about our past*’ **\(S4\)**. 

 **3. Our research has demonstrated how khipus function as sacred texts in modern Andean villages, such as Collata.** 

 The native leaders of the Andean village of Collata placed their translation of our article **\(R5\)** in their sacred archive. This archive consists of a wooden chest that also contains the khipus and colonial documents that serve as the basis of their religious and ceremonial life. The archive is hidden in an underground chamber of the church, indicating the sacred nature of these khipus **\(S5\)**. Village authorities now include a formal consultation of the article in the annual ceremony to install village officials responsible for local religious festivals. Villagers believe that the khipus express the concerns of the mountain deities; when the council of elders decided to show the khipus to us, the first outsiders ever to see them, the mountains signalled their approval by the fact that vicuñas \(one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes\) appeared in the surrounding peaks for the first time in decades. Our partial decipherment of the khipus is thought to please their ancestors and bring prosperity to the community **\(R4, R5**, and **R6\)**. 

 **4\) Our research has increased public understanding of Andean religious and cultural achievements worldwide.** 

 Until Hyland's khipu research, it was thought that Andean Indians had not possessed writing; our research has demonstrated that khipus were a complex, often phonetic form of writing. When our article **\(R5\)** was published, the story was picked up by different news outlets, many of which requested interviews with Sabine Hyland for both print media and radio. Our discovery and partial decipherment of the first phonetic khipu ever found made international news, and was carried by over 11 major news outlets between 2017 and 2019, including *The* *Times* \(circulation 437,352\) and the *Daily Express* on 21 April 2017 \(circulation 397,236\) **\(S6\)**; and a featured interview in *All About History* magazine, October 2019 **\(S7\)**. The story was carried by media in the US, UK, France, Italy, China, Japan, Poland, and Peru; in a feature article in the *Discover Magazine*, October 2017 \(circulation 582,276\) **\(S8\)**; in a cover article in *New* *Scientist,* September 2018 \(circulation 124,623\) **\(S9\)**; and in an interview for the BBC World Service show, Outlook \(‘Deciphering the messages left by the Incas’\), August 2018. Prof. Hyland also appeared in two Discovery Channel documentaries, *Unearthed: Machu Picchu* \(aired July 2017\), and *Unearthed: Inca Cusco* \(aired October 2018\), to discuss the research. In the first *Unearthed* documentary, Prof. Hyland analysed a khipu in Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum and in the second she disseminated her research on Catholic missions in Peru.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Department of Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering has researched the underpinning science and algorithm development for the design of digital control systems and high speed computational simulations of nonlinear dynamic multivariable models of Complex Energy Systems \(CES\). This research has, in collaboration with global industrial and academic partners, developed copyrighted high speed simulation software tools and patented appliance/system controllers on a global scale. Fundamental scientific research in digital nonlinear control theory for the design and modelling of complex nonlinear multi\-input and multi\-output control systems has been published and disseminated in learned society journals and conferences, and the department’s research group iDEAS’s series of one day workshops for industry and academics in Artificial Intelligent Multi\-vector Energy Systems \(AIMES\). The resulting software tools have been applied to real industrial and local authority case studies in partnership with BRE, Arup, Leep Utilities, URENCO, Eastbourne Homes, EDF Energy, Fujitsu/Kawasaki City, Advanced Control Partnerships, M&I Materials and ISIM International. The results from the software tools and controller algorithm designs have to date had a commercial impact in excess of £100Million, sustained 200\+ jobs in the UK and reduced the UK’s carbon emissions by 50,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> *pa* within this REF period.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 1997, Professor John M. Counsell, as a Director of Lancaster University’s EPSRC funded Engineering Design Centre for Computer Aided Conceptual Design, led the development of what is now known as an object\-oriented Meta Modelling approach to the modelling, simulation and design of complex energetic systems and their controllers. The method was named Schemebuilder. In 2007, Counsell, as Director of BRE’s Centre of Excellence in Energy Utilisation, led the application of Schemebuilder Meta modelling methods and Nonlinear Inverse Dynamics controller design to building energy systems. This resulted in the approach being applied in feasibility studies to develop a fully integrated Combined Heat & Power with Photovoltaic generation system controller \[1\] which led to the InnovateUK project CHPV with Arup, BRE and University of Liverpool.  This substantial period of research  into Meta and object\-oriented modelling, computer simulation and the use of intelligent model based nonlinear control of complex energy systems identified the need to: 1\) calibrate energy models with best practice and building regulation methods; 2\) speed up the run\-time of computer simulations and increase the complexity of multi\-vector energy system models dealing with heat, power, carbon emissions, and thermal comfort; and 3\) optimise many other metrics for building regulation compliance. 

 One very complex emerging technology in need of modelling and control was that of Demand Side Response \(DSR\) solutions for scheduling electrical appliances in the presence of intermittent supply of low carbon energy. The underpinning scientific breakthrough was made at the University of Chester in 2016/17 to combine all these technical and functional components resulting from the underpinning research in a highly structured modelling environment where digital nonlinear multi\-input multi\-output controllers for complex energy systems \(CES\) could be designed and simulated at high speed – typically 10 times faster than the current best practice. This aggregation of scientific methods primarily used nonlinear inverse dynamics algorithms, which could be simultaneously used to greatly assist the numerical solving efficiency of the dynamic equations. This approach was applied in partnership with Arup NW, Leep Utilities, Eastbourne Homes, BRE and Fujitsu \[2\], and \[3\]. 

 <ins>The main breakthrough in underpinning research was made at University of Chester</ins> by successfully designing nonlinear inverse dynamic control laws for the high speed and accurate control of multi\-input multi\-output control systems for multi\-vector local energy systems \[4\]. This research output proved that CES and their intelligent optimising controls could be designed using deterministic nonlinear inverse dynamic modelling approaches and provide algorithms to allow rapid computer simulation of these systems’ performances. The high\-speed simulation allows the novel energy system controller design methods and simulations to be incorporated into the design processes of industry for urban environmental design and planning, new local energy systems and in the detailing of energy generating products/systems and their controls. Typically, a CES’s dynamics consisting of five or more buildings would take hours to simulate a one\-year period when assessing annual energy costs, carbon emissions etc. This new integrated approach of controller design and simulation allowed quick and optimum controller design and to simulate annual multi\-vector results in less than 5 minutes. The success of the feasibility studies of this method in 2017/18 has led on to the design and build of software tools at the University of Chester, with Advanced Control Partnerships Ltd and ISIM International, to be used in real world urban design collaborative R&D projects to develop CES and heating products for the UK and Global needs.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Initially, the nonlinear inverse dynamics controller algorithm design approach delivered high speed simulation and high performance controller design utilisedin two very important initial uses: 1/  At the University of Liverpool in 2014 and continued at Chester 2016\+ with the InnovateUK Local Energy Systems programme project CHPV in collaboration with Arup NW, Leep Utilities and BRE. 2/  At the University of Chester in partnership with the University of Newcastle, and later Durham University, through the EPSRC programme Heat Storage’s project Heat STRESS \[2\], \[3\], \[4\]. This project also had industrial participants in an industrial advice panel consisting of representatives of Glen Dimplex, Arup, Fujitsu, Kawasaki City, Eastbourne Homes and BRE. These initial projects helped perfect the software tools developed using both Matlab and ESL in partnership with ISIM International Ltd and Advanced Control Partnerships Ltd. These projects also facilitated the start of the Internet enabled Digital Energy and Autonomous Systems \(iDEAS\) research group in the Computer Science, Electronics & Electrical Engineering Department. This group established the Artificial Intelligent Multi\-vector Energy Systems \(AIMES\) workshops that runs annually and is now scheduling its 5<sup>th</sup> workshop in 2021. Previous workshops have been organised in partnership with University of Manchester and BRE between 2017 and 2020. 

 The underpinning research \[5\] and the new copyrighted software tools Poweriver led to the development of the domestic energy systems models being used as part of the EPSRC Heat STRESS project. In this project, studies were used to assist Glen Dimplex to improve the controller design of its high retention storage heaters Quantum Heaters to enable improved SAP2012\[11\] ratings. Later in 2019\-20 they were used again to potentially obtain further improvements in SAP10 ratings for compliance in Part L building regulation compliance. The improved rating in SAP2012 hugely improved the sales potential of these new heaters, bringing about Quantum Heater sales of over 500,000 heaters in the winters of 2016\-21, a business turnover of c.£100 million and delivering an annual carbon saving of c.50,000 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> as well as safeguarding 200\+ manufacturing jobs at Glenn Dimplex’s factory in Seagoe, Northern Ireland \[Evidence Letter Alan McDonald\]. The modelling has also been used to investigate other novel storage type heating solutions in partnership with Glen Dimplex, which is expected to bring further business growth in 2021 onwards with the release of SAP10. 

 The success of the Quantum heater and home energy modelling tools led to a more ambitious R&D partnership in the use of the modelling tools and controller design methods \[1\] to invent the RISE hybrid heating system by Counsell, Perry \(BRE\) and Khalid \[5\]. Its R&D was funded as part of an InnovateUK Energy Catalyst programme, total funding c.£950K, in partnership with Glen Dimplex, EDF Energy, and Eastbourne Homes. This development is now seeking further investment in partnership with Glen Dimplex, but an immediate impact came from the BRE Prince’s Trust house prototype system, which was used to investigate the feasibility of dynamic carbon emission modelling \[6\]. The resulting dynamic simulation models \[6\]  are now being used in discussion with BRE and BEAMA for the possible use in SAP version 11 for future compliance of England & Wales Part L building regulations. 

 The initial projects of CHPV and Heat STRESS have underpinned the development of sophisticated high speed modelling tools of complex energy systems and are now receiving private company R&D investment from Fujitsu, URENCO and EA Technology. This has provided the iDEAS research group with a further £55K of funding in the REF period. The resulting models are being used to carry out feasibility studies into large local infrastructure projects accounting for potentially £10s millions investment for URENCO in Cheshire and Kawasaki City in Japan.  Further projects are now being established with Eastbourne Homes as part of the EPSRC’s recently awarded grant of c.£360K project “Solar” in partnership with the University of Durham, which is expanding the use of the tools for use in rebuilding and delivering more sustainable built environment infrastructure in Iraq with Al\-Hussain University College.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The **Digital Panopticon** created new opportunities for family historians and students in schools and Higher Education to pursue their own research using the free searchable website’s unique capability to link together over 50 digitised data record sets relating to the offending histories and biographies of 90,000 people tried at the Old Bailey \(1670 and 1925\) \- the most complete record of convict lives ever created. The website, together with the physical exhibitions, public talks/lectures which were formed using the data and the findings, as well as printed/television media which reported or drew upon the research, have demonstrably changed public understandings of criminality in the UK, Australia and the US. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The aim of the **Digital Panopticon** project \(3.1\) was to explore modern issues around the use of imprisonment and re\-offending, using data on people either transported to Australia \(1803\-68\) or imprisoned in the UK \(1853\-1914\). Until the **Digital Panopticon** was launched in 2013 it had been impossible to answer a question originally posed in the 18<sup>th</sup> century by Jeremy Bentham – which was the most effective system of punishment, ‘imprisonment’ or transportation? \(3.2\) Led by the University of Liverpool, professors, researchers, and PGRs from five universities in the UK and Australia joined forces to share methods and ideas. The result was the **Digital Panopticon** website, which combines over 50 datasets about convicts collected together for the first time.  Collating this enormous body of data \(50 million data fields\) made it possible to explore and analyse the lives and criminal careers of over 90,000 individuals who were sentenced at the Old Bailey between 1690 and 1925. The main theme \(Penal Outcomes\), also led by Liverpool, explored the factors – type of punishment, gender, offending record, family relationships, age, re\-offending, and occupation – which either prolonged or shortened criminal careers. Being able to compare in detail large numbers of convicts' offending histories and biographies has allowed us to demonstrate that there were significant factors which supported desistence from offending \(relationship formation, employment, maturation, and the level of reintegration back into the economic and social base of the country they lived in\). At the conclusion we had definitively answered Bentham’s and many other questions, finding that: 

 Non\-custodial sentences \(transportation to Australia\) damaged people’s lives, but not as much as did custodial sentences \(British convict prisons\) \(3.2\). 

 A significant proportion of convicts re\-offended, but transported convicts committed more minor offences than those imprisoned in the UK \(3.2\). 

 Transported women fared better than imprisoned women over the longer term \(3.3\). 

 The children and grandchildren of transported convicts were taller/healthier and had better lives than the children of convicts imprisoned in the UK \(3.4, 3.5\). 

 Non\-custodial sentences for children reduced re\-offending \(3.6\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The **Digital Panopticon** is a freely accessible website with over 300,000 users since 2017 \(5.1\). Described as a vital website for research \(5.4\) *,* user\-beneficiaries ranged from family historians \(“ *To Australians, your project is of national significance. An eye\-opening and jaw dropping project* \[about the\] *foundation of our nation*”, 5.2\); to government ministers \(“ *The project is nationally and internationally significant as it highlights the unique nature of the convict experience in Western Australia and provides a better understanding of our archives and history*”, 5.3\). 

 User\-beneficiaries: pump\-priming family history research 

 By freely sharing our research with the public on the successes and failures of the systems of transportation to Australia and imprisonment in the UK \(something the Australian media described as the “Convict Ashes”, 5.4\), we brought a huge body of data from beyond paywalls to family historians/genealogists. People used data in **Digital Panopticon** together with the online explanatory essays to support large numbers of personal and family research journeys \(5.2\). The results were transformative: “ *Truly heart\-breaking. This is no understatement. Thank you. Thank you. Your project will no doubt reach into many households in Australia and England*” \(5.2\). Many had their family\-stories challenged, confirmed, or explained, and were determined to carry on with their research. “ *I am descended from ten NSW convicts. From the material it appears that after arrival in Australia the women were able to become, or to marry, moderately prosperous and, generally, respectable men … I am now considering how I can use the material I and others have gathered for historical projects*.”  “ *I have been a Civil Servant of some 40 years and worked in Prison Administration for six years I was also an Administrative Researcher to the Inquiry into the Efficacy of the NSW Police Administration. I have used Digital Panopticon to conclude that most transported convicts were far better off after their arrival in Australia*.” \(5.2\). 

 Using Exhibitions from Liverpool to the wider world to change opinion 

 Whilst there was clearly considerable appetite for the website, interest in physical and online exhibitions which used the data was also significant. Partners at the University of Sheffield led on an exhibition \( *Criminal Lives,* December 2018 \- May 2019\) at the London Metropolitan Archives using data from **Digital Panopticon** sourced by **Godfrey** and **Williams** \(Liverpool\-based PDRA\) \(praised by *The Lancet* for its contemporary resonance to debates about contemporary penal reform\). **Godfrey** and **Price** \(Liverpool\-based PDRA\) then organised an exhibition showcasing the impact of punishment on people’s lives at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral \(5\-12 March 2018\) focusing on Liverpool\-born prisoners to embed stories locally \(3.2, 3.3, 3.4\). Forty of the 3,000\+ visitors from Merseyside \(and wider afield in the UK and across Europe\) who saw the exhibition left comments stating that their views of criminals were changed \(“ *relevant and accessible to a wider audience; Brings dead people alive. What a fantastically informative exhibition – I shall never look at criminals in the same way\!*” 5.5\). We were subsequently invited to take the exhibition to Liverpool Legal Aid Offices to give a talk to staff as part of in\-house training. The Diversity Champion in the Criminal Applications Section stated that after staff had witnessed the similarities in the lives of the Victorian and the modern poor, they had a greater appreciation of the difficulties faced by legal aid applicants today: “ *I know we do the unconscious bias training in work, but I think in our role sometimes you can get certain perceptions of criminals. This exhibition reminds you that you can’t do that…it assists us in our day\-to\-day thinking as caseworkers*” *\(5.6\).* 

 As a result of the success of this exhibition **Godfrey** was asked by National Trust Australia to construct a temporary exhibition at UNESCO world\-heritage\-site, Hobart Penitentiary Chapel, Tasmania *.* The co\-produced exhibition and accompanying public lectures focused on the improvement of social policy towards offenders \(“ *a stunning success…one of the most popular historic experiences in Hobart*” *,* becoming a top\-10 tourist site in Hobart on TripAdvisor, 5.7\). Following the 45% increase in footfall, the exhibition was made permanent. Using some of the existing images with new images of US convicts, an online exhibition was held at the Willson Center \(part of the Uni. of Georgia which hosts exhibitions for students and general public\), launched by an online public lecture on unconscious bias. As a result of this exhibition, in March 2020 **Godfrey** collaborated on a grant application with Alabama Department of Archives & History  to digitize records of African American prisoners using the **Digital Panopticon** model. The project therefore continues to impact on the democratization of data in the UK, Australia and the US. 

 Impacting on public debates 

 Since 2014, there has been considerable engagement with international public audiences. In 2015, **Godfrey** gave the Australia Day Address in London, attended by the Australian High Commissioner and Lord Mayor of the City of London \(5.8\) which led to **Godfrey** giving a private lecture to the Judges at the Central Criminal Court, who then used **Digital Panopticon** data for a theatre production, *Trial and Error*, at the Old Bailey \( **Godfrey** provided data from **Digital Panopticon** and co\-authored the script; performances raised £30,000 for The Sheriffs’ & Recorder’s Fund which provides grants to aid the reform of ex\-prisoners, 5.9\). In May 2017 **Godfrey** organised a week of public lectures and *Findmypast\-*supported family\-history sessions in a Scottish bookshop \(over 100 attendees\). **Godfrey and Williams** introduced the website to the Australian public at the *The Big Convict Debate* at Fremantle Prison \(5/2/2018, 300 attendees\) which was held to mark the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of convict transportation to Australia. Published at the same time and authored by **Godfrey and Williams**, the  [*Conversation* piece](file:///C:/Users/andrewdavies/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/REF2021/ICS.GODFREY/(https:/theconversation.com/the-story-of-australias-last-convicts-89723) on the last Western Australian convict was read by over 100,000 people \(77% of readers were Australian\). There followed a series of public lectures across Australia. A talk at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Perth attracted over 250 adult learners, community historians, local politicians and academics \(“ *We’ve never had so many people staying behind to ask questions”,* 5.2\) *.* State politicians and local people debated prison reform following a public lecture in Tasmania, and media interviews on national TV and radio helped to stimulate debates about the use of imprisonment  \(“ *Professor Godfrey has convinced us that the debate over crime and punishment, reform and rehabilitation is as relevant today as it was two centuries ago*”, *Late Night Live*, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 5.4\). The ABC radio interview/public lectures were made available online; and in 2020, the ABC included **Godfrey’**s programme as one of nine prestigious “Big Ideas” in their series of “ *the best of talks, forums, debates, and festivals held in Australia and around the world, casting light on major social, cultural, scientific and political issues*”, 5.4\). 

 **Digital Panopticon** also indirectly impacted on public attitudes, through providing data and inspiration for the cultural industries. Matthew Crampton, co\-author of the play *The Transports*, performed across UK, stated that he came across the **Digital Panopticon** *“when already deeply engaged in writing and telling stories about transportation* \[and that he\] *was able to make good use of this wonderful resource to find and trace individual cases from the Old Bailey to Australia. Particularly useful are the explanatory guides to different records The **Digital Panopticon** has helped me beyond being a useful resource. It has reinforced my belief that, so long as you make the information personal and relevant, you can lead casual observers willingly into highly detailed records.  It is a fine place to start one’s research, plus, of course, an excellent resource for conducting that research* \(5.2 *\)*.” In addition to Crampton’s use of the data, TV Companies have used **Godfrey**’s research findings to mould their programmes. **Godfrey** provided guidance on life\-course offending to various film production companies \( *Wall to Wall, IKON, Lion Films*\), later becoming consultant \(providing research, advising on and writing scripts\) for Series 13 of *Who Do You Think You Are?* **Godfrey** also providing on\-screen interviews for four episodes \(a weekly audience of over 6,000,000 saw the findings of **Digital Panopticon** used to explain the causes of criminality\). **Godfrey** then worked with a Channel 5 production company, explaining how Digital Panopticon biographical data\-linking can be used for non\-Old Bailey cases, transforming academic research into accessible material which would appeal to a wide audience and providing source material/interviews broadcast in 2019 \(5.2\). 

 Creating active learners 

 By creating a website where students can engage directly with data, the **Digital Panopticon** has created active school\- and undergraduate student researchers who are now able to design their own projects. It has become a central part of annually run research\-led undergraduate modules in the UK, Australia and the US \(5.10\). This has helped to transform pedagogic practices using digital humanities to inform, challenge, and stimulate students; to provide an excellent teaching experience for tutors and learners; and to extend the boundaries of the possible with regard to the use of historical data in school and undergraduate settings. Undergraduates have seized the opportunity to manipulate and investigate data on their own, and to construct their own research: In HAA007 Convict Ancestors \(300 students\), University of Tasmania Diploma of Family history students \(many non\-traditional entry and adult\-learners\) are introduced to the Digital Panopticon and trained to search its collections to enrich the study of a single life course. Students on HAA105 Convicts in Context \(210 students\) are provided with a detailed online tour of the Digital Panopticon and shown how to use its features to do more complex searches. They then explore the lives of prisoners who share a particular characteristic \(i.e. convicted of a particular crime, transported to Australia, or imprisoned in the UK\), to use data to, really, make their own research. The freedom was enthusing and invigorating for students \(“ *HAA105 scored 98% approval*”, 5.10\). 

 At the University of Georgia, HIST 3775 students use **Digital Panopticon** to construct a research question and write up either a formal research proposal or a research paper: “ *My students find it challenging to shift from the standard assignment of reading and discussing written sources to conducting data analysis and charting their own course to a research topic and thesis. Nevertheless, it is precisely this kind of novel, hands\-on research project that encourages students to practice self\-activated learning. Some students resist and struggle more than others but, by the end of the process, all of them have expressed their satisfaction with work which they can really call their own…the experience is transformative”* \(5.10\). 

 Using **Digital Panopticon** in this way has not only transformed their undergraduate learning experiences and achievements, but has also provided a route to enrichment of their employment and post\-education experiences: *“…at least a dozen of the students who got their first taste of digital humanities research with Digital Panopticon have gone on to work in the Digital Humanities Center as participants in summer workshops, interns, or as teaching assistants…For the past three years students who prepared the strongest research essay using the Digital Panopticon won the History Department's Award for Best Digital Humanities Project*” \(5.10\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Giblin’s curation of the exhibition *Tremble Tremble* for the Irish Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale, 2017 \(approximately 850,000 visitors\) and its related events – an international five\-venue exhibition tour, launches and book publication – contributed to broader public awareness of the politics of abortion in Ireland and the national conversation on women’s rights. Publicity generated through media coverage and visits by high\-profile individuals such as the President of Ireland highlighted the power of contemporary art to communicate topical urgencies when experienced alongside important political events. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Giblin’s curatorial practice engages with the relation between installation and topical socio\-political issues. *Tremble Tremble* \[3.1\] was commissioned in 2016 for the 2017 Venice Biennale, following a competitive selection process open to applications across Ireland. Giblin’s initial proposal was selected by a panel consisting of Culture Ireland, Arts Council and Government representatives and international experts in the field of contemporary art. She was contracted by Culture Ireland to deliver all aspects of the Irish Pavilion. 

 For this prestigious international platform, Giblin, in collaboration with the artist Jesse Jones, proposed an exhibition about women’s rights that would project the issue of abortion in Ireland onto an international stage. The project was presented as an investigation into female oppression through history, with particular reference to the medieval witch trials in Europe. This research also led to Giblin’s editorship of an accompanying book, which brought together theorists, historians and practitioners \[3.2\]. 

 Giblin undertook her research following her appointment as Director of the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh in November 2016. Her research sought to interrogate the contemporary resonance of historical witch trials. By innovating curatorial methods that could bring new visibility to such transhistorical connections, *Tremble Tremble* revealed the power of contemporary art to intensify longstanding and still topical issues. Giblin drew on staging techniques used in theatre to develop a method she has termed ‘exhibition dramaturgy’. This enabled the creation of performative, immersive and multi\-sensory spaces, and used performance to enhance the exhibition’s political content. Thus, *Tremble Tremble* brought emphasis to the subject of women’s rights as all\-encompassing, dynamic and multi\-faceted. 

 The exhibition was produced as a multimedia installation running on a 25\-minute loop. This involved performed interventions by gallery staff, and state\-of\-the\-art theatre programming technology \(QLabs\) that enabled more control over the staging than is possible with standard multi\-screen installations, to produce a sense of simultaneous unfolding of stories and enhance the experience of immersion. 

 Following the success of the Biennale exhibition, Giblin was invited by 3 major international institutions to tour *Tremble Tremble*: Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore \(ICAS\) at the LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore; Project Arts Centre, Dublin and Museo Guggenheim, Bilbao. She also staged the exhibition at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh. She adapted each installation to its new local context, enabling the broadest possible reach to diverse publics. For instance, in Edinburgh, a Scold’s Bridle was included to reference Scotland’s distinct history of witch trials. The exhibition in Bilbao incorporated historical objects and documents related to witchcraft in the Basque Country on loan from the San Telmo museum in San Sebastian. 

  

 Commenting on Giblin’s curation of *Tremble Tremble*, Jones stated that ‘Tessa’s role as curatorial dramaturg brings new and exciting possibilities \[…\] through her deep knowledge of the role of spectatorship and craft with theatrical devices’, and praised her curatorial process as ‘truly collaborative, as artistic vision meets curatorial vision’ \[3.1\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The five exhibition presentations of *Tremble Tremble* were major public events, drawing approximately 850,000 visitors in total \[5.1\]. 

 Giblin selected the topic of women’s rights for the representation of Ireland at the 2017 Venice Biennale a year before the Irish referendum on abortion.  The exhibition opened on 8 May 2017 and the referendum was held on 25 May 2018, leading to a decision to repeal the abortion ban, also known as the 8<sup>th</sup> amendment. 

 The impact of *Tremble Tremble* on public perceptions around abortion rights was quickly registered, as evidenced by speeches and statements by high\-profile individuals. The Director of the Glucksman Gallery of Contemporary art in Cork wrote: ‘it galvanised those of us who were involved and committed to repeal, by enabling us to envisage an Ireland that chose *Tremble Tremble* for its international representation at Venice, through the confidence of the presentation, the powerful artistic expression and erudition and elegance of the curating, as a way to feel confident about advocating for the change to come’ \[5.2\]. The curator at Guggenheim Bilbao noted that the exhibition had an ‘extraordinary impact on the \[local\] community’: ‘\[t\]he fact that present and immemorial past appeared so closely linked was felt clearly’ \[5.3\]. 

 On 21 May 2017, the Irish President Michael D. Higgins visited *Tremble Tremble*, days before his visit to Rome to see the Pope. This was the first time an Irish president had made a public visit to the Irish Pavilion at the Biennale and the media coverage further thrust the exhibition onto the international stage. RTÉ \( *Raidió Teilifís Éireann*\), Ireland’s national television broadcaster, reported on the visit \(viewed by 295,000\) and commissioned a documentary \(viewed by 64,000\) \[5.4\]. There was particular media interest in the visit, since Higgins had opposed the ban on abortion \(the 8th Amendment\) in 1983. The visit was documented in a YouTube video that drew 1,057 views \[5.5\]. Two weeks after the outcome of the vote, *Tremble Tremble* opened at Project Arts Centre in Dublin in a charged homecoming. Ailbhe Smyth, co\-leader of the YES Campaign to Repeal the 8th Amendment, spoke at the opening of how *Tremble Tremble* inspired voters: ‘you knew, in witch\-like fashion, you knew exactly what we needed to do, and to hear, and to see and to feel’ \[5.6\]. 

 While there is a history of politically engaged art in Ireland, this was the first time the Irish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale had explored contemporary political issues. High\-profile artworld figures commented on *Tremble Tremble’s* timely political content. The Head of Visual Arts at Creative Scotland noted how it encouraged reflection on national politics and their histories and affirmed how contemporary art can ‘motivate us to be more active in the social/civic sphere’ \[5.7\]. The Director of the Glucksman Gallery of Contemporary art in Cork commented that ‘there was a profound connect through the work and its curatorial contexts that enabled audiences a reflective and imaginative connection with women’s rights’, and she noted the importance of *Tremble Tremble* ‘within the specifics of the abortion referendum in Ireland and the wider MeToo movement’. They stated that the exhibition ‘reinforced my belief in the power of contemporary art to shape \[national\] discourse and connect people to issues in a radically thoughtful way’ \[5.2\]. The Director of Arts Council Ireland noted that the visual presentation ‘was both dramatic and visceral and forced the audience to engage with the work and the subject in a very immediate manner \[…\] *Tremble Tremble* was both a catalyst and influence on the repeal campaign’ \[5.8\]. 

 The positive response within social and print media brought *Tremble Tremble* extensive national and international visibility, impacting international perceptions of Ireland. The Director\-General of RTÉ, remarked in an article on RTÉ.IE/culture on *Tremble Tremble’s* ‘massive impact’, ‘very much of the now, given what’s going on here in Ireland’, demonstrating that ‘Ireland is a contender’ and central to important political debates \[5.9\]. *The* *Burlington Magazine* commented on *Tremble Tremble’s* ‘direct feminist message’. *CNN Style* described it as ‘a powerful statement about self\-determination’ \[5.9\] and for *The Scotsman* it was ‘amidst a growing wave of anger from secular Ireland \[..\] perfectly contemporary.’ *Elephant – The Art and Culture Magazine* remarked on the way *Tremble Tremble* emerged ‘from the rising social movement in Ireland that calls for a transformation of the historic relationship between Church and state’. Australia’s *Daily Review* commented on its ‘powerful statement’ about ‘the right to self\-determination’. For the Spanish regional daily paper *Diario de Noticias* \(89,000 readers daily\), *Tremble Tremble* ‘reflects a time of tense debate over the legalisation of abortion in Ireland’ \[5.9\]. Patricia Cronin, an internationally\-recognised US\-based artist, wrote: ‘the exhibition elevated the subject of women’s rights on the world’s stage’, and ‘because Ireland chose \[it\] to represent the country – it gave viewers the explicit impression of \[a\] state endorsed and supported exhibition including the content’ \[5.10\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 This programme of research sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors for mental ill\-health and severe mental illness within members of the UK university student population. Investigation into the help\-seeking behaviours of those at risk resulted in the identification of ‘hard\-to\-reach' groups that would benefit from alternative means of engagement. A programme of resilience\-based training was developed spanning the public, private and third sector. Institutionally, new educational practices were adopted, and practitioners within the counselling service noted a direct and positive impact on waiting lists. Private and third sector organisations reported a positive impact on working practices and wellbeing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research continues to highlight the continued growth of mental ill\-health within the student population. Less attention is placed on identifying those groups who are at\-risk of mental ill\-health compared to those who are at risk of severe mental illness. Delineating these groups would serve two purposes. Firstly, it would allow resources to be directed appropriately, and secondly, it could serve to prevent mental ill\-health developing into severe mental illness. Research has suggested that preventative programmes focusing on resilience would equip students with the skills to manage their mental health and *“would benefit from promoting help\-seeking behaviour to encourage students to seek help before their mental health needs are severe”* \(Broglia, Millings, & Barkham, 2018, p.449\). 

 Broglia, E., Millings, A. & Barkham, M. \(2018\) Challenges to addressing student mental health in embedded counselling services: a survey of UK higher and further education institutions. *British Journal of Guidance & Counselling, 46*\(4\), 441\-455. DOI:  [10.1080/03069885.2017.1370695](https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2017.1370695) 

 **Nature of the research insights:** 

 Consistent with previous studies, **Reference 1** reported more than one third of university students \(in a HE institution in the North of England\) experienced mild to moderate psychological distress and just over one in five experiencing serious psychological distress indicative of severe mental illness. Only 30% of those experiencing mild\-moderate distress had sought professional help within the previous 12 months compared with 58% of those experiencing severe psychological distress. This highlights a considerable unmet need for those not engaging with formal professional help. In contrast to previous research, levels of social support were not found to be related to help\-seeking behaviours. Interestingly, when focusing specifically on depressive symptomology and quality of life within the same sample, **Reference 2** found social support from family and friends to be a significant predictor of depressive symptoms \(which can constitute severe mental illness\) and to increase quality of life within the psychological domain. At a minimum, institutional strategies would benefit from promoting social support as a positive help\-seeking strategy to facilitate avenues of engagement. This would serve to prevent mental ill\-health developing into severe mental illness, particularly for students transitioning into university as well as directing resources more appropriately and effectively. 

 Research has previously linked childhood adversity to severe mental illness, to the extent that it can increase the risk of psychosis threefold. **Reference 3** found 89% of university students reporting low levels of childhood adversity and 11% high adversity. Childhood adversity was related to three types of prodromal symptoms \(hallucinations, perceptual abnormalities negative symptoms\). Interestingly, a novel relationship was found between childhood imaginary companions and hallucinations/perceptual experiences, with the former partially mediating the latter. This, coupled with the fact that stressful experiences further trigger the primary onset of severe mental illnesses such as psychosis, highlights the need for identification of at\-risk groups and allowing for targeted early intervention support to prevent the onset of severe mental illness.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The ‘SoWise Vision Day’, a research innovation and knowledge exchange event led by **Webster** brought together researchers and key local and national stakeholders in student mental health that included representatives from Student Minds, Together Women and YoungMinds. The event aimed to create collaborative working partnerships across sectors to enhance the understanding, learning and participation of stakeholders. YoungMinds delivered an interactive workshop that focused on the importance of resilience to young people. Feedback suggested staff from all sectors would benefit from resilience\-based training. Higher Education staff expressed a need for tailored training to enable them to engage students at risk of mental ill\-health and signpost students to appropriate resources. As a result of the event and based on evidence from **References 1 to 3**, **Webster** designed and delivered bespoke resilience\-based training workshops reaching the public, private and third sectors. 

 **Impact within the public sector:** 

 Resilience\-based training was delivered to staff within all departments across the institution. Student facing materials were developed and incorporated into all levels via specific modules and personal tutoring. An institution wide initiative called *Learning to Be* was developed allowing students access to a six\-week programme designed to develop resilience, increase awareness of mental ill\-health and promote positive coping strategies and help\-seeking behaviours.  Feedback from students included the following: 

 *“Feel like I’ve got a strategy/confidence going into the next semester which is amazing for me”* 

 *“Changed my perspective, dealt with anxieties and given reassurance”* 

 *“All students should do this – they would have benefitted from it”* 

 Subsequently, the institution’s student mental health and wellbeing service delivered sessions to students prior to commencing placement. The service manager states that *“initial audits indicate a reduction in presentation to the Student Mental Health & Wellbeing Service during the usually high\-level periods following placement weeks*.” Following the first COVID\-19 lockdown, the service designed an online course for students including resilience\-based training. Over 200 students participated with the service reporting a positive impact on waiting lists as evidenced in **Source 1**: 

 *“..less than 10 of these Students subsequently refer themselves for further support indicating that the research has contributed to Students being empowered to manage their own mental health and release capacity for Students less able to do so by reduction of our waiting lists.”* 

 **Impact within the private sector:** 

 Ad:Venture requested **Webster** to deliver bespoke resilience\-based training for small business owners. Two\-day workshops provided strategies to foster resilience and encourage positive coping strategies. Twenty\-one regional businesses attended. **Source 2** reports that the information on stress and coping strategies was useful, with particular reference to the emotional aspects of running a business that impact on quality of life and wellbeing: 

 *“Practical resilience topics which I will use as well as strategies to find time for self and to cope / deal with day to day stress”* 

 *“Helped find long term preventative measures to help stress getting too much”* 

 Based on feedback and demand and in the context of the current COVID\-19 pandemic, Ad:Venture have requested these workshops be delivered again in May 2021: 

 *“With Covid\-19 most businesses owners were required to be more adaptive and flexible .., this workshop certainly helped me grow my mindset to support me in this”* 

 **Impact within the third sector:** 

 As a consequence of participating in the SoWise Vision Day, Together Women requested the expertise of **Webster** to design and deliver resilience\-based training for their staff who work with young women with multiple complex needs. The aim was to foster positive coping strategies for the staff and provide techniques that could be used within their practice. **Source 3** indicates the training had a positive impact on the wellbeing of staff including a request for further delivery: 

 *“It was so well\-received and had a really uplifting positive impact on all the staff”* 

 *“We agreed that having workshops like this on a regular basis would encourage staff engagement and improve their emotional wellbeing”* 

 **International reach:** 

 The underpinning research is evidenced at an international level with collaborators in Italy. **Webster** was invited to the International Cognitive Sciences Arena in Italy to act as Senior Scientific Advisor. Based on her expertise, **Webster** was further invited to deliver ‘in\-depth seminars’ to students at the University of Bozen\-Bolzano on topics including student mental health and adolescent resilience \(https://ceslab.unibz.it/events/misc/seminars2020.html\). This collaboration led to the development and launch of a multi\-site international study investigating the impact of isolation on student mental health, resilience and connectedness to learning **\(Source 4\).** A derivative of the study will commence in April 2021 in Australia **\(Source 5\).**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Drawing on two decades of world\-leading research on advanced materials for fuel cells and electrolytes, EaStCHEM Professor John Irvine and colleague Dr. Martin Smith have advised industry and policy makers on solving the technical and economic challenges impeding the use of hydrogen as a fuel for public transport in Scotland. The following have resulted directly from this research and their techno\-economic expertise. 

-  The *Scottish Government Hydrogen Assessment* \(12\-2020\) marks a culmination in policy change towards the adoption of green hydrogen as an integral solution for decarbonization of public transport. 

-  *Aberdeen City Council* has assembled a fleet of 21 hydrogen\-powered buses, which have carried over 1,600,000 people \(passengers\) and travelled approximately 1,000,000 miles, achieving a significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. 

-  The *HySeas* program is delivering the world’s first hydrogen\-powered zero\-emission ferry, including EUR12,000,000 investment for vessel development. 

-  Led by Professor Irvine, The *Hydrogen Accelerator*, with GBP300,000 per year in funding, provides expert advice and support to transport initiatives across Scotland, including building the showpiece hydrogen train, with GBP3,500,000 from the Scottish Government, for the *UN Climate Change Conference* \(COP26, Glasgow 2021\). 

-  *Low Emissions Resources Global Ltd.* \( *LERG*\) has opened a R&D centre at the *Michelin Scotland and Innovation Parc* \( *MSIP*\) in Dundee creating jobs, to exploit materials developed by Irvine for green hydrogen production.

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  The Challenge: technological barriers preventing the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transport 

 Whilst batteries are emerging as a viable and scalable technology to power cars for the domestic market, hydrogen fuel cells are envisaged as a more appropriate technology for clean\-emission public transportation, including for buses, trains and ferries. This is due to the combination of the high energy value of hydrogen that can translate to a greater range for these modes of transport coupled with sufficient on\-board storage of the fuel. In addition, an infrastructure of centralized refuelling depots can be rolled out, using hydrogen generated via electrolysers from electricity derived from renewable sources. Key to delivering this low carbon vision is the technological expertise in the use of fuel cells and electrolysers at scale. 

  

##  Key Research Findings 

 Since 2003, EaStCHEM Professor Irvine has optimised electrochemically active materials for use in high temperature fuel cells and electrolysers, improving their durability and stability, as well as reducing the cost of manufacture.  His landmark early report concerned the development of new fuel flexible solid oxide anode formulations, such as the perovskite composition LSCM, \(La,Sr\)Mn<sub>0.5</sub>Cr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which enable efficient utilisation of fuels **\[R1\]**, including hydrogen **\[R2\]**, for electricity generation. Separately, proton\-conducting **\[R3\]** oxides and hydride\-conducting oxides **\[R5\]** applicable to hydrogen production were developed, led to the discovery of a highly effective route to fabricate electrolytes for electrolysers **\[R3\]**, materials that have ultimately been patented \( [**US7906006**](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7906006B2/en?oq=US7906006),  [**EP1730327**](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1730327B1/en?oq=EP1730327),  [**CA2561852**](https://patents.google.com/patent/CA2561852C/en?oq=CA2561852),  [**US8262896**](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8262896B2/en?oq=US8262896)\) and adopted by industrial collaborators *LERG* \(see section 4.3\). 

 Irvine’s research on solid state materials led to him being PI on large interdisciplinary grants, such as the EPSRC\-funded Supergen project *Delivery of Sustainable Hydrogen* \( *DOSH*, EPG01244X/1 2008\-2012\). This project broadened his research interests into techno\-economic and policy aspects of using hydrogen to power public transportation, in collaboration with EaStCHEM colleague Dr Martin Smith. They pioneered new technologies and became agents **\[R6\]** in policy development for hydrogen rollout. One direct result from this project was the discovery of redox exsolution, which in turn led to the switching phenomenon discovered for steam electrolysis and fuel cells **\[R4\]** – a more efficient technology for producing and using hydrogen.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  4.1. Input to and implementation of transport policy in Scotland 

 EaStCHEM Professor Irvine’s world\-leading research in fuel cells and electrolysers, as exemplified by **\[R1\-R5\]**, together with his and Dr. Martin Smith’s techno\-economic expertise **\[R6\]**, led to both becoming leading technical advisors on the use of hydrogen for public transport in Scotland. Between 2006 and 2013, Irvine co\-founded and led the *Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association* \( *SHFCA*\) bringing together industry, academia and government, to promote the use of renewably generated \(green\) hydrogen and to create significant new industrial activity/jobs. Smith is presently on *SHFCA*’s board of directors. This “ *extensive research experience and expertise…underpin many of the technological and policy activities that have arisen since the inception of SHFCA*” **\[S1\]**. In 2005, Irvine was appointed to the Scottish Government’s *Hydrogen Energy Group* \( *HEG*\), which formulated the initial hydrogen energy policy for Scotland as part of the 2009 *Climate Change Bill and Renewables Action Plan for Scotland*. This activity, together with input from major demonstrator projects, some driven by the technical expertise of and coordinated by Irvine and/or Smith \(Section 4.2\), has culminated in the publication of the Scottish Government’s *Scottish “Hydrogen Policy Statement”* \(12\-2020\) **\[S2\]**, which is an update of the 2015 document *“2020 Routemap for Renewable Energy in Scotland”*, on which Irvine consulted **\[S3\]**. This commits Scotland to the future decarbonisation of public transport using hydrogen, for which the *Hydrogen Accelerator* programme, led by Irvine, is one of the key drivers \(Section 4.2c\). The Scottish government, now committed to a Hydrogen economy, has already coordinated the investment of “ *over GBP40,000,000*”, which “ *has been successfully invested or earmarked for ground\-breaking hydrogen transport projects*” over the past 5 years **\[S2, p39\]**. Based on its assessment, the Scottish Government estimates that the scale of the economic opportunity from the production and use of hydrogen transport will be “ *over 300,000 jobs supported and Gross Value Added \(GVA\) impacts of GBP25,000,000,000 by 2045*” **\[S2, p4\]**.

##  4.2. Demonstrations of the use of hydrogen for public transportation in Scotland 

 Irvine and Smith have both been actively involved in the implementation of the following projects, demonstrating the potential of hydrogen to power clean\-emission public transport in Scotland \(Figure 1\). 

 **\(a\) Aberdeen hydrogen buses.** As a result of the hydrogen energy policy for Scotland set out by the *HEG*, *Aberdeen City Council* assembled Europe’s largest hydrogen\-powered fleet of buses, supported by two hydrogen fuelling stations, funded as part of a 2015 green transport demonstration project \(Figure 2a\). This is one of the world’s largest, fully integrated, green transport demonstration projects **\[S4\]**. Relying on his techno\-economic analysis, Smith built the original project consortium, which led to the project’s GBP19,000,000 EU funding **\[S4, S5\]** across a range of public and private sector partners. 

 In the first year \(2015\-2016\), the fleet of 21 buses, operated by companies *First* and *Stagecoach*, had travelled 250,000 miles carrying more than 440,000 people \(passengers\). Using green electricity generation, there is now a significant 156t CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction per H<sub>2</sub>\-bus per year **\[S5, p32\]**. Studies also showed a 40% reduction in NOx emissions within Aberdeen, which contributes to improved air quality **\[S5, p33\]**. As of 2018, Aberdeen’s hydrogen buses have carried over 1,600,000 people \(passengers\) and travelled approximately 1,000,000 miles. 

 Jo Bamford, owner and Executive Chairman of UK\-based bus manufacturing company *Wrightbus*, remarked on 19\-10\-2020: *“these buses represent much more than Aberdeen striving to reach a clean air, zero\-carbon future. They represent the start of what could be a world\-leading hydrogen economy here in Scotland which will bring with it multi\-million\-pound investments and tens of thousands of jobs.”* **\[S4\]** 

 Recognizing the success of this program, an additional GBP4,500,000 has been awarded by the Scottish Government, as part of its *Scottish Hydrogen Assessment* commitment to decarbonise public transport, in order to procure 10 hydrogen double decker buses to add to the existing Aberdeen hydrogen bus fleet. Overall, approximately GBP40,000,000 has, or is being, invested in hydrogen mobility projects across Scotland, including refuelling infrastructure for Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow as of December 2020 \(Section 4.2c\) **\[S2, p41\]**.

 **\(b\) Hydrogen Ferries.** The *HySeas* program, initiated in 2011 by Smith and *Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd*, aims to deliver the world’s first hydrogen\-powered zero\-emission ferry \(Figure 2b\). Its current phase, *HySeasIII*, coordinated by Smith **\[S6\]**, began in 2018 and targets vessel delivery. *HySeasIII* is funded by the EU \(EUR12,000,000\) in partnership with a consortium including *Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd* \(UK\); *Ballard Power Systems Europe* \(Denmark\); *Kongsberg Maritime AS* \(Norway\); *Interferry* \(Belgium\); *DLR Energy Systems Institute* \(Germany\) and *Orkney Islands Council* as the operator. The first ferry is presently under construction in Glasgow. The ferry will be powered by renewable hydrogen generated from the *SHFCA\-*initiated projects *Surf’n’Turf* and *BIG HIT*, both of which are also based in Orkney with combined investment of GBP13,000,000. These projects represent a substantial economic investment in Scotland and beyond, with accompanying jobs creation. The *HySeasIII* consortium won the 2019 award for *The* *Innovation of the Year* at *The Green Awards.* 

 **\(c\) The **Hydrogen Accelerator** \( **H<sub>2</sub>A**\).** Based on Irvine’s expertise in hydrogen technology and its implementation and his successful leadership of past and present demonstration projects, *Transport Scotland* engaged him to deliver the *Hydrogen Accelerator* \( *H<sub>2</sub>A*\) programme with an initial investment of GBP300,000. Based at the University of St. Andrews, *H<sub>2</sub>A* links academic, public and commercial interests towards the development and deployment of hydrogen technologies and provides expertise and support to the design, development and implementation of transport initiatives across Scotland. As such it plays a central role in defining and delivering decarbonisation in Scotland, supporting the Scottish government’s commitment to its net\-zero target of 2045, including support its ambition to phase out petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032. 

  

 Although only launched in 07\-2020, the *H<sub>2</sub>A* has successfully achieved the following. 

 **i\)** Arranged and awarded a GBP3,500,000 contract to *Arcola Energy*, a leading specialist in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, to build a showpiece hydrogen train \(Figure 2c\) using a Scottish supply chain for the *UN Climate Change Conference* \(COP26, Glasgow 2021\). This has led to the initial creation of 20 jobs to date at *Arcola Energy* located at the *Michelin Scotland Innovation Parc* \( *MSIP*\) in Dundee **\[S7\]**. 

 **ii\)** Following from the successes of the Aberdeen H<sub>2</sub>\-bus roll out, the *H<sub>2</sub>A* has delivered a techno\-economic assessment of and provided the technical specification for the contract negotiations to purchase a fleet of 12 hydrogen buses and the associated hydrogen refuelling infrastructure \(contract tendered: 12\-2020\) that have been ordered by *Dundee City Council* through the Scottish Cities Alliance \(with each bus costed at just over GBP500,000, as part of the EUR25,000,000 *Joint Initiative for hydrogen Vehicles across Europe – JIVE2 –* project\). 

 **iii\)** In collaboration with *Strathclyde Power Engineers*, enabled the specification of a large scale GBP3,000,000 hydrogen and battery testing facility \(LOCATE\) at the *MSIP*. 

 The Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity in the Scottish government said: “ *I’m pleased that we can establish a new Hydrogen Accelerator for Scotland at the University of St Andrews. With their renowned specialism in hydrogen technologies and innovation – this is a perfect match at a time when there is really exciting work in the sector taking place across Scotland*… *I wish Professor John Irvine and his team at St Andrews every success in supporting our flourishing hydrogen sector*.” **\[S8\]**. 

 Of the *H<sub>2</sub>A* and the COP26 hydrogen train project, the Scottish Enterprise Managing Director noted that “ *… this creates quality jobs and supports our national ambitions for a net zero carbon economy*” **\[S9**\]. 

##  4.3. Direct commercialisation of EaStCHEM research for the production of green hydrogen for transportation 

 Since 2017, The *Low Emissions Resources Global Ltd.* \( *LERG*\) has been associated with Irvine and has created 15 research positions \(headcount: 15\) involving the fabrication of electrolysers for H<sub>2</sub> production based on Irvine’s solid\-state electrolytes **\[R3\]**. They have recently relocated to a R&D facility at the *MSIP* in Dundee **\[S10\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Manchester research has directly influenced the thinking, strategies and programming of leading international development actors. Our work on the politics of development has ensured that key development agencies now have a more specific and research\-based understanding of what drives the commitment of political elites and of governments’ capacity to deliver development. This work catalysed DFID and other actors to launch a new wave of programmes that are worth over GBP270,000,000 and reach over 1,000,000 people. These interventions are promoting inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction, helping to create thousands of jobs, improved health and education systems and reduce poverty in developing countries. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research undertaken by the Effective States and Inclusive Development Research Centre \(ESID\) within the University of Manchester’s Global Development Institute \(GDI\) generates answers to the question: *‘What kinds of politics can help to secure inclusive development and how can these be promoted?’* The research identifies how governments become capable and political elites become committed to delivering development across multiple policy domains, including economic growth, social protection, human development, natural resource governance, gender equity and public sector reform. 

 When ESID was established in 2011, the idea that politics mattered had become mainstream within development theory and practice, with a small but growing community promoting the idea of ‘thinking and working politically’. However, there was little agreement about which specific forms of politics shaped which forms of development, how this puzzle should be understood in conceptual terms, or how policy and practice should change as a result of such understanding. ESID constituted the first major international research programme to propose and test new political theories of development and to reformulate them into frameworks capable of delivering both analytically rigorous and strategically relevant insights. It concentrated in particular on \(a\) reformulating ‘political settlements analysis’, with a stronger focus on ideas and international actors; and \(b\) introducing a new level of analysis to explore the politics of particular ‘policy domains’ \(e.g. growth, social protection\). The resulting ‘power domains’ framework was then applied through a rigorous comparative research design across 26 countries. Some of ESID’s key findings are that: 

-  The capacity of states and commitment of political elites to deliver development is shaped by the interaction of two domains of power: the ‘political settlement’ \(which refers to the underlying configuration of power\), and specific ‘policy domains’ \[1,2\]. 

-  Different types of political settlement offer significantly different routes towards achieving inclusive development \[1,3,4\]. 

-  Structural transformation is critical to achieving both poverty reduction and positive synergies between governance and growth. Trajectories of economic growth, and whether they lead to transformation, are shaped by the nature of informal *deals* not *rules*. Understanding the links between political settlements and the deals that shape the economic domain can help generate new approaches to promoting growth, including direct efforts to support manufacturers \[1,5\]. 

-  International efforts to promote social protection and gender equity succeed when aligned with the dominant ideas and incentives within particular political settlements \[4\]. 

-  The quality of service delivery is shaped by how national and local political settlements interact with domain\-level governance arrangements \(e.g. in health and education\) \[3\]. 

-  Political economy analysis must be institutionalised within development agencies to help them generate more relevant and feasible responses within different types of political settlement and policy domain \[6\]. 

 ESID has generated a large number of significant and accessible academic publications that showcase these findings, including 11 books \(9 open access, 6 with Oxford University Press\), >60 peer\-reviewed journal articles and >150 working papers. It has produced >30 policy briefings and delivered an active programme of uptake activities with both international and national policy actors, involving some 150 policy seminars, workshops and conferences, as well as wider engagement through blogs, social media, pod/videocasts and newspaper pieces.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 ESID has significantly improved the extent to which international development agencies grasp the ways in which politics shapes development, and directly steered them towards designing and implementing more contextually relevant and politically feasible interventions to promote inclusive development. Until recently, and by their own admission, major development agencies like the World Bank and the UK’s Department for International Development \(DFID, now FCDO\) were wasting large sums of development aid in pursuit of promoting technocratic and Westernised policy ideas that had little traction in developing countries and sometimes made matters worse. ESID research has had three key impacts: 

 **\(a\) Transforming how DFID understands and promotes economic development.** DFID is one of the largest and most influential international development agencies. It has an annual budget of GBP13,400,000,000 and programmes in all of the world’s poorest countries, with a strong focus on promoting economic development and poverty reduction. 

 In 2012, ESID research director Kunal Sen combined his new theory on the political dynamics of growth with related work by Lant Pritchett \(Harvard\). This led to an influential ESID working paper on ‘deals’ in 2012 that underpinned a programme of research in 10 countries, the results of which were later published in 2018 \[1\]. ESID circulated the paper to governance advisors working within DFID, one of whom invited Sen, Pritchett and others to deliver a series of talks at major DFID learning events, workshops and seminars \[A\]. 

 Senior officials within DFID report that the ESID ‘deals’ framework transformed the way in which it promotes economic growth in developing countries \[A\]. ESID’s deals framework has become institutionalised within DFID’s first ever Economic Development Strategy \(2017\) – its highest\-level statement on growth – and in the ‘inclusive growth diagnostic’ that is used to directly inform DFID’s work at country level. Going further, ESID thinking has directly inspired DFID’s first\-generation of governance\-informed growth programmes. 

 A key example is the GBP100,000,000 Invest Africa Programme \(2017–21\), which aims to encourage GBP1,000,000,000 of additional Foreign Direct Investment \(FDI\) into African manufacturing sectors to help kick\-start the economic transformation required for sustained poverty reduction. This programme was strongly informed by ESID’s work on the dangers of imposing Western\-based regulatory approaches on developing countries; instead ESID proposed channelling investments to the types of firm able to both promote structural transformation and improve the governance environment \[A\]. ESID’s deals framework *“definitely impacted the evidence* \[DFID\] *used for the business case for Manufacturing Africa”* \[A\], a GBP22,500,000 part of Invest Africa that aims to create 90,000 new jobs by 2027. The 2019–20 annual review suggests that it is on track to do so, having already supported 40 FDI investments against a target of 29 \[B\]. ESID research \[1\] has directly shaped new growth and governance programmes in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal, Palestine, Tanzania and Uganda, and the GBP8,000,000 Governance in Action programme in Kyrgyzstan \(which has so far formed seven new coalitions to facilitate governance solutions to unblocking constraints to growth, including legislative change to enable textile businesses to access more markets \[C\]\). 

 ESID’s impact on the promotion of inclusive growth in Africa extends to other policy actors. It was described as of *“incredible value to the Africa programme of the Tony Blair Institute* \[TBI\] *for Global Change”* \[D\]. TBI’s Africa Advisor states that the deals framework has guided its efforts since 2016 to support 15 African governments in delivering inclusive economic growth with an annual budget of approximately USD16,000,000: *“This work has influenced the establishment of new economic enterprises in countries like Togo \(in business process outsourcing which attracted its first 3 investors, worth USD4,400,000 and 1,000 jobs and juice processing 1 investor at USD3,300,000 and 500 targeted jobs\); the facilitation of Liberia SME processors of oil palm \(USD500,000 investment supporting 1,000 farmers\); new investments in car manufacturing in Ghana \(involving a USD15,000,000 investment\) and in Ethiopia’s efforts to establish an FDI\-based pharmaceutical sector \(7 deals closed in 2019 and 2020 amounting to USD332,000,000 and estimated to create 4,500 direct jobs\)*” \[D\]. These interventions show how ESID research has enabled DFID and others to support reforms that are feasible within each country’s political settlement, and offer an informed starting point for promoting the process of inclusive growth and structural transformation required for sustained poverty reduction. 

 **\(b\) Catalysing politically informed programming within DFID’s country\-level operations.** ESID’s impact on DFID’s country\-level operations goes beyond inclusive growth to encompass new approaches to the promotion of better governance and social provisioning. It has had particularly strong impacts in Rwanda and Uganda, in part because ESID researchers discussed their research priorities with in\-country DFID officials before embarking on the research and maintained a high\-level of engagement with both offices throughout. ESID researchers have produced at least 40 publications reporting on its work pertaining to these countries, offered multiple in\-country seminars to DFID staff and been invited to undertake advisory projects and offer advice directly to senior governance advisors and heads of office, all via the ESID ‘power domains’ framework of analysis. As shown below, these efforts have directly shaped DFID’s strategic and programming operations in both countries in ways that have ensured that its approach to promoting inclusive development is now more relevant and politically feasible. 

 **Uganda:** After ESID researchers Hickey and Golooba\-Mutebi produced an ESID working paper on the politics of development in Uganda in 2013 \[2\], they were commissioned by DFID\-Uganda in 2016 to conduct a major diagnostic study to help guide its strategic review process. This ‘horizon scan’ report was presented to the most senior diplomatic and development officials in Kampala and became integral to DFID’s strategic thinking: *“The* \[2016\] *report fed into our bilateral aid review and was a great start to that work”* \[E\]. According to DFID’s Governance Advisor in Uganda: 

 *“We relied on this to inform our design process and content for the multi\-donor Democratic Governance Facility* \[DGF\] *at the time* \[supported with GBP12,600,000 by DFID between 2012 and 2017\] *, and to determine realistically what we could or could not achieve programmatically and in our advocacy engagements and policy dialogues…. It also helped to strengthen DGF II scenario\-planning and risk management to help the programme to be more resilient and adaptive. The report directly influenced the flexible and adaptive approach to programming within our major anti\-corruption programme…. It was central and relevant to our analysis for the Country Development Diagnostic in 2018”* \[E\]. 

 A further political economy analysis undertaken by ESID researchers reshaped the approach of DFID and other donors to working in Uganda’s most marginalised region: it *“completely shaped our initial design for a new development programme in Karamoja”* \[E\], namely the Karamoja Nutrition Programme which was worth GBP28,793,116 and targeted at improving governance and poverty reduction for 450,000 people in the region. Hickey’s presentation of the Karamoja report in Kampala \(October 2018\) had: *“a huge impact on us and USAID and Irish Aid* \[the other major donors to the region\] *. It changed the discussion about Karamoja. Helped us to think about how to work better in an area of protracted crisis”*, including in terms of how to strengthen health systems \[E\]. The business case for the Karamoja Nutrition Programme cites Hickey et al.’s Karamoja report as a vital contribution to the programme design process; official evaluations show that the programme has directly enhanced health governance and nutrition outcomes in Karamoja, establishing multi\-sectoral committees for nutrition in all districts, raising the cure rate from acute malnutrition and significantly reducing the rates of wasting and stunting in children under five \[F\]. 

 ESID research has also directly shaped government policy in Uganda. ESID researchers Hickey and Matovu were invited to present ESID findings to the Annual Budget Conference in Kampala in January 2014, after they had worked with colleagues from Harvard to produce briefing papers on growth and governance in Uganda and facilitate a training workshop for government officials in December 2012. This this led directly to a focus on structural transformation within the government’s 2014–2015 Annual Budget and to an emphasis on both transformation and government implementation capacity in the subsequent National Development Plan 2015–2020 \[G\]. 

 **Rwanda:** DFID’s Senior Governance Advisor in Rwanda testifies that ESID research has had a powerful impact on how DFID has promoted improved levels of governance and poverty reduction in the country \[G\]. ESID’s impact has occurred through the same pathways identified above for Uganda, namely the production of rigorous, policy\-engaged research \[e.g. 3,4\] that is shared directly and iteratively with policy makers. ESID research, particularly its research on public sector reform and growth \[5\], has clearly shaped DFID\-Rwanda’s overall strategic direction and its specific programmatic interventions. In the words of a DFID\-Rwanda advisor, this body of work *“very much influenced our strategic thinking and 5 year planning in 2016”* \[H\]. It has also significantly changed DFID’s work on public financial management in particular, leading to a new focus on performance management through a GBP20,100,000 project on local public financial management and revenue collection in Rwanda \[H\]. 

 ESID’s work on how politics was undermining the quality of primary education in Rwanda \[3\] has also been influential, directly shaping the development of DFID’s GBP9,600,000 Learning for All programme \(2015–21\). The programme aims to achieve more equitable access to education, reduced drop\-out rates and improved learning outcomes, with the primary beneficiaries being children and young people. By 2019 the programme had already supported almost three million learners and trained over 75,000 teachers, well exceeding the initial target of 25,000. A former DFID advisor on education in Rwanda discusses how ESID’s findings directly shaped their approach: 

 *“By having an in\-depth understanding of the political economy of primary education, we could ensure that our investments were targeted at the right areas, and in line with the incentive structure of the Government. An example of this is the need for the programme to target quality, and work at the local level, which was highlighted in the paper* \[3\] *; as well as the disconnect between the education responsibilities of the local education officers, and their reporting lines through the Ministry of Local Government – this led us to task our suppliers to develop solutions to support the officers to ensure their education support was prioritised, while at the same time we worked with the Ministry to try to ensure there were clear lines of accountability and cascading of any changes”* \[H\]. 

 There are also multiple citations of ESID’s work in Rwanda’s most influential policy document, *Future Drivers of Growth in Rwanda: Innovation, Integration, Agglomeration and Competition* \(co\-authored by the World Bank and Government of Rwanda\), which lays out the government’s strategy for reaching upper\-middle\-income status and virtually eliminating extreme poverty by 2035 \[H\]. In both Rwanda and Uganda, ESID reports are used to induct new staff, helping to attune them to the political realities of their new working context. 

 **\(c\) Embedding political analysis within international development strategies and policies.** ESID research \[1,3\] was incorporated into successive World Bank *World Development Reports* \(WDR\), on *Governance* in 2017 and on *Education* in 2018, which have gone on to influence World Bank initiatives in many countries \[I,J\]. ESID research on the political economy of social protection \[4\] has been particularly influential: it provided the basis for a new World Bank report on Social Safety Nets in Africa \[K\] and for the strategic approaches of UNICEF and World Food Programme via invited keynote presentations by Hickey. According to one leading governance advisor: *“I used* \[ESID’s\] *work consistently during my years at the World Bank and in my current role with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade* \[DFAT\] *. In several areas, ESID has been leading global development thinking rather than just translating that thinking into practice”* \[L\]. Within DFAT, the deals approach directly informed the diagnostic tool that provides the methodology for country diagnostics, and ESID *“research in thematic areas like education, natural resources, health and social protection has also been extremely valuable in presenting accessible and operationally relevant material that we have disseminated to sectoral staff”* \[L\]. In addition to the specific impacts on DFID noted above, ESID work \[6\] directly shaped DFID’s New Position paper on Governance \(2018\) and DFID’s political economy analysis \(PEA\) training for advisors via the ‘Informal beginner’s guide to PEA’. 

 As such, ESID has played an important role in ensuring that international development policy and practice has become increasingly well\-informed by political economy analysis in ways that have led to more relevant and feasible operational approaches to promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction. This has been achieved as part of a wider movement to promote the importance of ‘thinking and working politically, an epistemic community that ESID has made distinctive contributions to and which it helps to convene; this was evidenced by ESID’s major international conference in 2019, which attracted the key thought leaders and 200 delegates from the relevant academic and policy communities.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research of Prof. Guy at Swansea University \(SU\) has been instrumental in the commercial success of Innoture Ltd, a leading microneedle \(MN\) company, focusing on their novel anti\-aging regime Radara®, using microneedle patches, with generated sales of GBP50,000 in 2020 even with retail outlets closed due to COVID. Research conducted by Swansea researchers allowed the company to optimize their MN print manufacturing processes, making production more efficient and faster and bringing Radara® products to market 1 year earlier than planned. Swansea\-developed microstructure prototypes for transdermal delivery have also allowed Innoture to develop a new product pipeline around analgesics, with Swansea facilitating the first human trials for the company. Critically, Swansea University research has underpinned Innoture’s ability to secure investment funding of GBP3,000,000 during the REF period, allowing the company to add 12 staff, an increase of 600% from 2014.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Microneedles \(MNs\) that penetrate the top layer of the skin have long promised pain\-free administration of drugs, but, despite a plethora of research publications, very few have ever approached commercial reality. Scalability of production, drug yield and molecular size/type \(solubility\) have severely limited MN application. Professor Guy’s research has effectively solved these issues by providing the underpinning knowledge needed to deliver small molecules and complex biologicals \(peptides and cells\) at high volume from mass\-manufacturable printed patches \(Fig. 1\). His work represents a step change in MN patch technology that has since seen commercial exploitation via a 7\-year collaboration with Innoture Ltd \- taking the technology from manufacture to successful human trials. 

 Since 2011, **Guy** has been developing a range of MN fabrication technologies for silicon and polymer MNs in collaboration with industry and Imperial College London \(Sharma PI\). Innovations in microneedle design \(pitch, length, tip sharpness and material hardness\) have enabled facile transdermal injection leading to a critical process patent for the manufacture of MNs \[ **P1**\]. A key element was a novel “bevelled tip” hollow MN, which led to new collaborations with Prof. Birchall’s group at Cardiff University. **Guy** has led EPSRC \[ **G1, G2**\] and InnovateUK \[ **G3**\] MN projects with Cardiff developing the MN technology for transdermal delivery of large fluid doses \[ **R1**\].

 Given Swansea’s leading expertise in MN manufacturing, characterisation and skin\-testing research, through Swansea’s Centre for Nanohealth \(CNH, of which Guy is a co\-director\), **Guy** initiated a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) collaboration with Innoture in 2013 \[ **G4**\]. Key research outcomes arising from this KTP were the development of novel MN manufacturing processes for screen\-printed polymeric microneedle patches \[ **R2, R3, R4**\]. SU’s critical input \[ **R2, R3**\] included the development of screens, ink constitution and viscosity, ink curing and substrate selection leading to MN optimisation.  \[ **R2**\] detailed how a newly developed bend test was an excellent predictor of amount of ink deposited and was far better than traditional assumptions based on squeegee hardness. The printing of microneedles relies on a different philosophy from traditional printing, where excess ink deposition is regarded as wasteful.  Microneedle printing is pushing the screen\-printing process to the limits of its capabilities in terms of the amount of material deposited. 

 In \[ **R3**\] we visually showed for the first time the separation of the ink filament as the stencil is pulled away from the substrate.  This study is of great importance to the functional printing industry as it is the first time that frequently cited and historical models of the ink transfer process in screen printing have been tested and validated experimentally.  This allows a direct causal link to be drawn between ink characteristics \(elasticity, rheology\) and printer settings, and print topography, based on the simultaneous contact between the printing form, ink and substrate.  Understanding of printing mechanisms, and the effect of process parameters, is key to ensuring defect free and robust manufacture of printed microneedles as well as maximising ink deposit for faster throughput. 

 Prof Guy has led research into the testing and development of MNs in association with active pharmaceutical ingredients \(APIs\) \[ **R4**\]. This involved skin testing research and new methods for assessing transdermal delivery of commercially relevant APIs \(ibuprofen, aspirin and hydrocortisone, galantamine, selegiline hydrochloride \(Sel\-HCl\), insulin and caffeine \[ **R4**\]\). Key characterisation and performance data on Innoture’s MNs \(skin penetration and drug permeation efficacy\) were acquired, with the study providing critical data on the effect of a molecule’s physiochemical properties on its ability to be delivered transdermally, with and without microneedle application. Enhanced delivery of APIs has been demonstrated in **De Mello’s** work \(via extended KTP, \[ **G5**\]\), with the avoidance of hypodermic needle stick pain during anaesthetic administration into the gums of dental patients. 

 Prof Guy’s group in CNH has conducted research into materials characterisation, microneedle sensing \(including the first mediated MN based biosensor for minimal invasive sensing of lactate in interstitial fluid \[ **R5**\]\) and examined the possibility of developing a MN closed loop control system for delivery of precision drugs \[ **R6**\].  Most recently, this technology has been used in the development of a “vaccine smart patch” – for COVID vaccination and diagnosis of COVID antibodies in response to the vaccine.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Improved manufacturing processes/cost efficiencies** 

 Swansea University’s microneedles research underpinned Innoture’s development of the world’s first cosmetic MN patch product, Radara®, in late 2015 \[ **C1, C4**\]. SU’s research on the MN printing process and skin testing of MNs has allowed Innoture to branch into an entirely new business sector \(non\-surgical cosmetic and therapeutics\) through their Radara® products, worth GBP50,000 in 2020 \[ **C1**\]. 

 “*Screen\-printing research at Swansea University was key to developing Innoture’s ability to print MNs in large volumes \(5,600 Radara patches per day\) and at low cost, allowing us to reduce manufacturing costs by 50%”* \[ **C1,** Head of Research, Innoture Ltd\]. 

 Additionally, advances in ink and polymer development, polymer curing, iterative printing process and tip sharpening allowed the company to develop a super\-fast, large volume, screen\-printed MN production process for Radara – establishing a new production line in 2016.  Using Swansea’s processes has saved the company over GBP1,000,000 since 2014 compared to using other commercial facilities \[ **C1**\]. 

 Swansea University’s skin testing research has helped Innoture optimise their Radara® patches, contributing to the launch of the first and second versions of the micro\- channelling patches a year ahead of schedule “ *which allowed the company to double its turnover from 2018 to 2019”* \[ **C1,** Head of Research, Innoture Ltd,\]. 

 A new variation of Radara® for the total eye area is the latest high\-performance eye rejuvenation offering from Innoture and has been developed using SU research \(MN development and hyaluronic acid permeation characterisation\). 

 *“In just two years \(2014\-2016\), we've seen Radara®, our novel anti\-ageing regimen using unique micro\-channelling patches, go from a technological concept to an award\-winning skin care brand \(e.g. Best Home Use Product of Device category, My FaceMy Body Awards 2016\), only with the input of Swansea University research*” \[ **C1**, Head of Research, Innoture Ltd, also see **C3** for award example\]. 

 **New product development** 

 *“Prof Guy and his colleagues at Swansea University have led the way in developing MSt fabrication processes, characterising our MSts, facilitating clinical trials for our products and allowing us to develop a product pipeline incorporating Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients \(APIs*\)” \[ **C1,** Head of Research, Innoture Ltd\]. 

 Innoture’s proprietary platform has the capability to deliver small molecules, peptides and complex biologicals though a MN patch \(less than 1ml\). The ability to deliver large molecules \(above 1ml\) is a step change in transdermal patch technology. SU research has investigated delivery of some larger molecules, including hyaluronic acid and APIs \(ibuprofen, lidocaine\) with MNs, starting in 2016. 

 The foremost pipeline development products are MN pain\-relief patches containing ibuprofen and lidocaine. Transdermal drug delivery research performed by SU under the 2016 KTP was critical in developing MN coatings and drug encapsulation processes for delivery of pain relief APIs \(lidocaine and ibuprofen\) using a MN platform and in validating prototype pain\-relief patches. We were given approval by the MHRA to run a clinical investigation in 2018 to assess the performance of Lidocaine with a MN patch. The results showed a significantly enhanced delivery of APIs over current treatments. 

 SU developed all skin testing protocols and facilities \(Guy and De Mello\), gaining full ethical approval for research on animal and human skin in 2016. This allowed Innoture’s first successful submission to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(UK\) for a clinical evaluation for a pharmaceutical application. The KTP research project with SU also successfully demonstrated a dental product via a clinical trial \(trials conducted at Bristol University in 2018, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03629041\). 

 SU’s research has enabled the design and delivery of a new prototype microstructure patch for drug and vaccine delivery and combining diagnostic sensors with vaccines \[ **C5**\], particularly for viral pathogens such as influenza and COVID\-19. Already, this research has attracted GBP290,000 in grant funding \[ **C5, C6**\]. 

 **Company Impact** 

 SU’s research has directly impacted Innoture’s ability to attract investment, expand Innoture’s workforce and increase Innoture’s share price from GBP8 to GBP20 \(2016 to 2019\) \[ **C1**\]. 

 Innoture secured investment funding of GBP1,000,000 in 2014\-16 and GBP2,000,000 in 2017\-2020 \[ **C1**\]. SU data \(SEM, ethically approved skin testing, mechanical tests, clinical trials data and regulatory approvals\) and optimization of manufacturing processes. undertaken by Prof Guy’s research team, were critical in securing this investment and in the subsequent scale\-up and launch of Innoture’s commercial products. 

 The Radara® patches have been advertised to a global audience through publications such as VOGUE, Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan and Tatler \(see \[ **C2**\] for example\) and is now available through selected retailers, skin care institutes and clinics such as national chain SK:N and Church Pharmacy. Revenues from current Radara® products have risen from GBP10,000 in 2016 to GBP50,000 in 2020 \[ **C1**\] **.** 

 **Employment** 

 Since 2014, the number of employees at Innoture has increased from 2 to 14. 

 *“We have been able to grow our workforce by 12 since 2014 – an increase of 600% \- including employing Swansea University chemistry and engineering graduates, as a direct result of the development of our product pipeline which has grown with Swansea university research input”* \[ **C1,** Head of Research, Innoture Ltd,\] *.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hitchmough’s experimental research has pioneered the application of ecological science and environmental psychology to the design and management of urban green infrastructure for more sustainable urban vegetation, biodiversity, and enrichment for people. His collaborations and projects in China have made available hundreds of new species with the resilience to create more sustainable landscapes. These include new woodland demonstration gardens at the 2019 Beijing International Expo and large\-scale gardens in central Beijing; plus the framework strategy for the ecological restoration of a 1,275km<sup>2</sup> Chengdu mountain range as the world’s largest urban forest. This work has increased appreciation of the value of biodiversity leading to changes in landscape approaches in China. His work in Australia has led to the development of novel plant communities – “woody meadows” – used by the City of Melbourne as part of their climate change adaptation plan.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 From 2000, Hitchmough investigated harnessing the most desirable traits of semi\-natural “wild” vegetation \- high species diversity and ability to survive urban conditions without intensive horticultural management \- to test these characteristics in designed plant communities. Hitchmough pioneered the application of rigorous ecological experimentation on these types of urban plant communities. Much of this research has been published in *Landscape and Urban Planning*. 

 The research aimed to produce attractive plant communities and maximise biodiversity, whilst gaining the popular and political support of urban populations for eco\-centric approaches. A range of novel plant communities was conceptualised, and used as ecological models. Standardised protocols were developed, starting at laboratory scale with individual species, moving to multi\-species microcosm experiments \(R1, R2, R3\), then field scale experiments, and finally landscape practice. Environmental psychology research was undertaken in parallel to understand how urban populations viewed this vegetation, from meadows to woodland \(R2\). 

 The initial research examined establishing herbaceous vegetation from seed sown *in situ,* facilitating the creation of large areas of complex vegetation with limited budgets \(R1, R2, R3\). This determined which species that can be successfully and economically established *in situ*, the seedling density of each species to give the desired designed appearance via random broadcast sowing and how competition from weed seedlings could be minimised \(R1, R2\). Subsequent research investigated planted as well as sewn vegetation. The research was supported through collaboration with the RHS \(Royal Horticultural Society\), grants from the Stanley Smith Trust, and PhD studentships. A Marie Curie TOK grant \(2006\-2009, £256K\) with Jelitto Seeds, Germany, provided data on the emergence characteristics of 1,000 species. 

 The research established that it was possible to create successful designed plant communities for urban landscape space \(R1, R2, R3\), and that energy intensive horticultural management involving irrigation and fertilisation was detrimental to community persistence and attractiveness \(R1, R2, R3\). It also proved that designed naturalistic plant communities could be efficiently and sustainably managed, primarily by using more sustainable nature conservation techniques such as cutting \(R2, R3\). Attractiveness to the public was shown to be strongly correlated with the percentage of the vegetation surface area that was covered by coloured flowers/autumnal leaves \(R5\-R6\) and these key findings were applicable to both herbaceous and woody vegetation \(R4\). 

 Key research findings were applied to landscape practice to test how ecological processes at the research plot\-scale worked when transferred to the large\-scale sites such as at the 2012 London Olympic Park.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The 2012 London Olympic Park changed British attitudes toward ecological vegetation in urban areas. Since 2013 Hitchmough has worked to introduce his green infrastructure innovations in China and Australia. 

 China 

 Utilising the worldwide acclaim from the 2012 Olympic Park work, Hitchmough engaged with key stakeholders in China to promote a shift from traditional, development\-led monocultural designs by demonstrating the benefits of biodiverse, ecological design based on his experimental research. Key priorities were to: 

1.  Use Chinese plant communities as models for urban landscapes 

1.  Encourage the identification, cultivation, and commercialisation of indigenous plant species 

1.  Develop understanding of the political, technical, and organisational barriers to implementing an ecological vision in China 

1.  Demonstrate the viability of new sustainable planting design in a Chinese context. 

 This was done through varied collaborations across China, allowing Hitchmough to develop a reputation as an international expert on ecological planting design using native Chinese species. 

 In 2013, Kaixian city contracted Hitchmough to develop sustainable vegetation designs for their city. Kaixian city developed a new research station to investigate the establishment of 200 herbaceous species using Hitchmough’s methodology. Identified species were used to create the first sown perennial meadow vegetation in China **\[S1\]**. Hitchmough’s planting design was then used in major road interchange planting \(3,000m<sup>2</sup>\) in the city **\[S1\].** Hitchmough was subsequently invited to advise on the redevelopment of NanShan mountain ridge \(approximately 100,000m<sup>2</sup>\). The city developed a nursery to grow local native Chinese vegetation to support the project. This nursery was the first in Western China to encourage the use of locally occurring Chinese species. Additionally, from 2014\-15 Hitchmough further developed his expertise in native Chinese plant species through collaboration with Shenyang Jianzu University. Over 100 species new to cultivation were identified and seeds collected to create a new planting palette for designers **\[S2\].** 

 These collaborations positioned Hitchmough as a leading expert in ecological design with Chinese plant species, a political pre\-requisite to be taken seriously by the Chinese government. This, in turn, facilitated his involvement in large\-scale ecological landscape design projects in China. 

 Beijing\-Xiong’an 

 As Visiting Expert to the City of Beijing \(2016\-\), Hitchmough was asked by the Expo Organising Committee to design one of five 1500m<sup>2</sup> permanent “Master Gardens” at the 2019 Beijing International Horticultural Expo. Building on his experimental research, Hitchmough created a sustainable woodland design, mixing native and non\-native species. Hitchmough then worked directly with the Green Garden Group \(Beijing\) to expand their range of species to include those needed for the Expo. This led to the commercial availability of new species that were previously unavailable in China, and which have since been used in further landscape projects **\[S3\]**. 

 The expo was visited by an estimated 16 million visitors. Hitchmough’s research and the garden were featured on peak Chinese National TV ‘CCTV’ \(1.2bn viewers\) **\[S4\],** introducing audiences to biodiverse, sustainable urban plantings and greatly increasing receptivity to these new ideas from those whole experienced them **\[S5\].** 

 This led to a commission to design the first native Woodland Park in China at Lotus Lake \(1ha\) in central Beijing. This biodiverse, native woodland has been used as a model for the green infrastructure of the new urban woodland rings of Beijing: 

 *“James helped us develop a variety of native woodlands, replacing traditional practices with more sustainable design techniques, and successfully applied these concepts to a new urban forest park in Beijing and other projects in the city. We attach great importance to cooperating with him and to help us integrate new ideas into the green space of Beijing”* **\[S6\].** 

 The City of Beijing’s woodland task force of national experts worked with Hitchmough to critique existing policy and practice to promote new types of green infrastructure. They commissioned a demonstration woodland to show how to apply these ideas to create complex, multi\-species, native woodlands that are highly biodiverse, self\-regenerating, and resilient as an alternative to hundreds of km<sup>2</sup> of traditional, short\-term, monoculture forests: 

 *“These areas will involve hundreds of square kilometers of urban forest…These sustainable, low maintenance and naturalized urban forest can benefit the city more than traditional planting style”* **\[S6\]**. 

 Chengdu 

 In 2018 Hitchmough was invited by the city government of Chengdu \(population 16.33 million\) to lead a competition entry \(with LDA Design and Grimshaw Architecture\) to create a vision for the sustainable development of Chengdu’s 1,275km<sup>2</sup> degraded Longquanshan mountain range that is being subsumed in the city. Hitchmough’s team won with a radical strategy to restore indigenous forest vegetation of the mountain and to create woodland corridors from the mountain range into three nearby cities. This is transforming a vast landscape, reintroducing indigenous species to create a sustainable, ecologically\-focused landscape. This new bio\-diverse, incremental development landscape “frame” has now become the official policy of the city of Chengdu. A member of Longquanshan Urban Forest Park Management Committee stated: 

 *“Professor James Hitchmough's team…proposed to restore the local original forest ecosystem by imitating nature...which are beneficial to water, soil conservation, ecological restoration, and the creation of new local economic models…We have begun to integrate these strategies into the overall planning of forest parks…After one year's observation, the model reflects the aesthetic feeling of naturalism, and the maintenance cost is obviously reduced compared with the traditional method”* **\[S7\]**. 

 Australia: Melbourne 

 In 2013 Hitchmough was invited by the City of Melbourne to develop new types of multi\-species drought\-tolerant vegetation as part of their climate change adaptation plan. He proposed using taxonomically diverse communities of post fire re\-sprouting shrubs \(“the woody meadow”\) to create an entirely new, infinitely sustainable urban vegetation, maintained perpetually floral, and optimal for fauna by triennial canopy removal. In collaboration with the University of Melbourne and $100K funding from the City, the designed “woody meadow” planting demonstrations were created in central Melbourne from 2015 **\[S8\]**. “ *The Woody Meadow project in Melbourne is transforming how we consider our native fauna in the urban setting as something that goes beyond a background green, and instead is highly floral and ever\-changing*” **\[S10\]**. 

 This work received widespread recognition for the value of the concept, with nine Australian local and state government agencies signing up to participate in the next pilot phase of the project in practice \(supported by a $800k Australian Research Council Grant in 2020\). In 2019 Hitchmough was also appointed to design biodiverse, drought tolerant, and human wellbeing\-friendly vegetation for the AUD 1.4bn Arts Precinct Project in Central Melbourne \- the most ambitious urban green infrastructure project in the history of Australia **\[S8, S9\].** The start of the project has been delayed due to the pandemic; however, Hitchmough is involved in the developed design stage. Hassel Studio architects state “ *Without his deep, thoughtful and research based planting proposals, the concept would not have held true through the myriad of political twists and turns and remained intact. Once completed the project will be a once in a generational transformation*” **\[S10\].**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Liverpool’s Geographic Data Science Lab \(GDSL\) applied machine learning to create geodemographic classifications from high\-dimensional spatial data. These classifications are open, reproducible, and more accurate than their predecessors. They have generated extensive impact in the public, private, and third sectors, including on public health, sustainable travel, and promotion of the arts, for example: 

-  Hull City Council built a classification using GDSL’s methodology to boost services and promote the arts for \~260K residents. 

-  Transport for London collaborated with GDSL to create a classification that transformed travel policy development and implementation, benefitting those making \~29M daily trips. 

-  The Office for National Statistics enhanced six impactful surveys using a GDSL classification. 

-  A West End theatre production used a GDSL classification for the regional rollout of shows. 

-  US\-based company CARTO used GDSL’s classifications in their platform \(300K\+ users\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Liverpool’s Geographic Data Science Lab \(GDSL\), which integrates Computer Science, Data Science, and Geography, developed new techniques to create geodemographic classifications using machine learning **\[3.1\]**. These classifications provide summary indicators of the demographic and built characteristics of small areas. For illustration, the *Transport Classification of Londoners* partitions London into small areas and categorises each area as primarily comprising one of nine population categories \(for example, “Students/Graduates,” “Settled Suburbia,” “Detached Retirement.”\) 

 GDSL extended existing clustering\-based approaches for building geodemographic classifications to make their classifications more accurate, open, and reproducible. The main innovations relate to the pre\-processing of input data **\[3.2, 3.3\]**, the stochastic nature of certain clustering algorithms **\[3.2, 3.4\]**, and a framework for open geographic data science **\[3.5\]**. GDSL’s methodology was developed through the creation of five classifications, described next. 

 The *2011 Output Area Classification* **\[3.2\]**, co\-produced with UCL and the Office for National Statistics between 2010\-16, used 2011 Census data to create a national classification. It resolved major issues with its predecessor, the *2001 Output Area Classification*, by being more accurate and fully reproducible. A greater number of transformation and rate calculation techniques were evaluated \(log10; Box\-Cox; inverse hyperbolic sine\). 10,000 initial partitions with random seeds were run and applied to a model selection technique, providing an optimum partitioning of the output areas in the 2011 Census. Other key classifications include: 

-  *London Output Area Classification* \(2014\) **\[3.6\]**: in a collaboration with UCL and Greater London Authority; the first published instance of a regionally tailored classification. 

-  *US Geodemographic Classification* \(2015\) **\[3.4\]**: created with the University of Colorado in 2015. It is the first open classification of the US Census. 

-  *Internet User Classification* \(2014\-15\) **\[3.3\]**: the first classification to aggregate population profiles of Internet engagement. 

-  *Transport Classification of Londoners* \(2016\-17\): developed with Transport for London. 

 Two clustering algorithms were used to create Liverpool’s classifications: *k*\-means \(used in all\) and Ward’s algorithm \( *US Classification*\). Two specific examples of computing challenges on data pre\-processing and stochastic clustering that GDSL addressed were: 

1.  Small\-area estimation \(estimation of statistics for small sub\-populations\): when creating classifications, survey data only detail the characteristics of a small but representative subset of people and areas. But measures for a full extent \(like the whole UK\) are needed for input into the clustering algorithms. GDSL pioneered the first use of supervised machine learning for small area estimation, where a model is trained to predict measures for all local areas. This technique was applied in the creation of the *Internet User Classification* **\[3.3\]** to create full coverage of online engagement data and consumption measures. 

1.  High variability in the quality of output from stochastic clustering methods \(such as *k*\-means\) over different runs on the same data: 10,000 repetitions with different random seeds were performed and goodness of fit was applied to the original data for model selection. However, high dimensionality of input measures \(extreme for the *US Classification*\) meant prohibitively large running times for existing code bases. Several innovations addressed this challenge, including the use of the parallel multi\-core platform H2O **\[3.4\]**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The University of Liverpool’s Geographic Data Science Lab \(GDSL\) drove a step change in the use of geodemographic classifications by government and have improved the efficacy of the targeting of resources in the public, private, and third sectors. Effective policymaking and commercial strategy require a full understanding of small areas and their populations, which only high\-quality classifications provide. Suboptimal classifications lead to poor decision making, which wastes budgets, limits profits, and has negative implications for individuals’ life chances. 

 GDSL’s outputs are the only open and reproducible residential classifications in the UK, in a landscape of expensive commercial alternatives. Moreover, commercial classifications typically provide limited methodological detail beyond their surface\-level representations. By contrast, the classifications developed by GDSL are based on a transparent and reusable methodology. They have created significant impact in the public, private, and third sectors both directly and as a reproducible framework for creating bespoke classifications. GDSL’s impact will be illustrated through the following beneficiaries: local and regional authorities \(Hull City Council and Transport for London\); the Office for National Statistics and users; a West End theatre production; and a leading US\-based location intelligence platform and its users. 

 **4.1 Improving Policy Implementation and Engagement with the Arts in Hull.** Local authorities used GDSL’s methodology to create derivative models. To illustrate, in 2013, Hull City Council, which serves 260K residents, “ *ruled out commercial classifications … due both to their high licensing and maintenance costs… and the loss of accuracy / reliability when mapping national samples to local communities*.” For Hull’s City Council’s Customer Insight Analyst, GDSL’s “ *free\-to\-use, open and reproducible methodology of the 2011 Output Area Classification*” was “ *absolutely crucial*” to create Hull City Council’s own model and “ *ensured that* \[it\] *was robust and based on a sound and tested process*” **\[5.1\]**. Hull City Council avoided commercial alternatives with costs ranging from £10\-100K **\[5.2a\]**. 

 **Improving Service Delivery:** As one example, in 2015, Hull City Council used their classification to improve service delivery in its North Carr Ward. The classification showed that residents preferred co\-located, in\-person services. Hull City Council acted on this to better meet residents’ needs cost effectively. For example, as residents often used North Carr’s new health centre, council staff were relocated there. Co\-location provided residents with a holistic service and ended a 15\-year lease at approximately £70K per year. In total, Hull City Council have saved approximately £164K per year and residents of North Carr gained improved service provision **\[5.1; 5.2b\]**. The classification’s success has “ *embedded bespoke customer insight into* \[Hull City Council’s\] *decision making as a default approach*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Promoting the Arts:** After a successful bid for UK City of Culture \(2017\), Hull City Council created an arts\-focused classification that identified where underrepresented audiences lived. Consequently, three specific wards were targeted to boost participation. Arts Council\-funded groups like *Back to Ours* established Community Hubs and “ *shifted emphasis away from traditional centres \(museums, galleries\)*” by bringing events to these low engagement wards **\[5.1\]**. The success of this approach is evidenced by a 2018 study: the percentage of Hull residents who visited a cultural venue increased from 36% in 2013 to 95% in 2017; residents’ confidence in attending events increased from 43% in 2015 to 52% in 2018; and 70% of residents felt that the City of Culture positively impacted them **\[5.2c\]**. 

 Hull City Council have since advised other local authorities \(like Leicester City Council\) on the creation of their own models **\[5.2a\]**. 

 **4.2 Creating A New Tool to Increase Sustainable Travel in London.** In 2015\-16, Transport for London \(TfL\) collaborated with GDSL’s Singleton to create the *Transport Classification of Londoners* \(TCoL\), which was a “ *key improvement on TfL’s historic dependence on non\-London specific classifications*.” TfL’s Director of City Planning confirmed: *“We approached Singleton for his expert guidance in creating TCoL. TCoL would not be possible without LOAC* \[the London Output Area Classification\] *… Singleton’s LOAC research and data science guidance in facilitating the development of TCoL has proved invaluable for TfL*” **\[5.3\]**. TCoL has impacted 1\) evidence\-based policy development and 2\) policy implementation. 

 **Policy Development:** TCoL was made “ *out of a pressing need to understand transport\-based behaviours and motivations to help* \[TfL\] *plan more effectively for London.”* TCoL was *“crucial in mapping small\-area level differences in Londoners’ propensity to adopt active travel”* which identified key targets for policy intervention. In 2016\-17, TCoL underpinned five reports that examined walking and cycling behaviour and strategies for increasing modal shift, along with a new cycling model. The new model accurately reflects actual route choice decisions made by cyclists “ *improving our ability to model cycle demand and to present the case for cycling investment*” compared to previous models, which “ *rarely capture cycling trends accurately*” **\[5.3\]**. 

 These resources were a significant component of the evidence base of the *Mayor’s Transport Strategy* \(2017\-2041\). The strategy’s central aim is for 80% of all trips to be on foot, by cycle, or using public transport by 2041: *“TCoL has been key in highlighting the policy mix vital to achieve the local contributions towards active travel necessary to enable the London\-wide aim”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 **Policy Implementation:** TCoL is used to implement policy in two ways. First, since 2017, investments costing £200K\+ on TFL’s road network were required to undergo a “Healthy Streets Check” to ensure they met TfL’s targets for improving sustainable travel: *“TCoL is an essential component of this* \[check\] *.”* Since 2019, the check has been applied to all investments, irrespective of size. The check has been successful: in 2019\-20, TfL reported that checked investments resulted in an average increase of 15% in TfL’s health metric **\[5.3\]**. 

 Second, TCoL underpins the implementation of the “Liveable Neighbourhoods Scheme” \(since 2017\). This scheme offers grants of up to £10M for borough\-level projects. One use of TCoL is to help assess proposed projects according to the expected improvement delivered. The most recent round of this scheme corresponded to £53M of TfL funding. An example of a funded project is the development in Lambeth of new pedestrian crossings, improved cycle routes and footways, low traffic neighbourhoods, and a new cycle\-only route \(£9.5M from TfL\) **\[5.3\]**. 

 TfL’s Director of City Planning summarised: TCoL *“continues to be a valuable framework in the formulation of research & policy; improving integrated land use and transport planning; tailoring and targeting schemes and investment; and underpinning the promotion of active travel”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.3 A More Accurate Classification for the Office of National Statistics \(ONS\).** The 2011 Output Area Classification **\[3.2\]** was adopted by the ONS as its official classification **\[5.4a\]**. The improved accuracy of the 2011 Output Area Classification had wide\-ranging impacts via at least six ONS national surveys that used the classification in their non\-response models **\[5.4b; 5.4c\]**. Non\-response of selected participants is a critical issue as it can severely bias survey estimates; non\-response models are used to mitigate this. 

 For illustration, the “Dental Health Survey of Children and Young People” \(2013\) was carried out by the ONS on behalf of NHS Digital. The survey helps a wide range of users, including policymakers and the NHS, to understand how the dental health of each generation of children across the UK is changing. It serves as a crucial component of the evidence base that is used for policymaking over the ten\-year period 2013\-23. In the context of tooth decay, the survey underpinned guidance to local authorities from Public Health England \(PHE\) for setting up toothbrushing schemes **\[5.4d\]**. A June 2018 PHE report noted that 51% of English local authorities had adopted such schemes **\[5.4e\]**. 

 **4.4 Transforming Marketing Strategies for Award\-Winning Theatre in England.** GDSL’s *Internet User Classification* \(IUC\) transformed the marketing strategy of the West End theatre production The Book of Mormon. In 2017, the marketing team was challenged to form a digital advertising strategy for the regional rollout of the shows across England \(for example, Manchester, Newcastle, and Sunderland\). The resulting strategy was based on the Internet User Classification **\[3.3\]**: aggregate population profiles of Internet engagement were used to target specific customer segments. The Marketing Director affirmed that this constituted the *“first instance of this approach being used in live entertainment marketing.”* The IUC was commended for being “ *more detailed than any other tool in the arts marketer’s toolbox over the last fifteen years of our company’s operation*.” **\[5.5\]** 

 **Cost Savings and Revenue Growth:** The regional rollout *“prospered as a result… breaking box office records, playing to 96% capacity and grossing close to £20M from 2019 to lockdown in 2020*. *”* The IUC delivered significant financial benefit, increased the show’s reach, and helped to engage new audiences: *“51% of customers to The Book of Mormon have been first time visitors to the venues and 57% under the age of 35”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 The Marketing Director summarised: *“The application of research by the Geographic Data Science Lab has offered us an unparalleled understanding of potential audiences for our regional expansion and has had a direct impact on our ability to market these shows effectively. Our use of the Internet User Classification improved both cost\-effectiveness \(directly saving the production £60,000 relative to a commercial offering\) and was worth multiple hundreds of thousands of pounds in terms of increased revenue… The success we experienced in marketing The Book of Mormon meant that the IUC was applied to four other high\-profile projects; and is now integrated into the online booking system and intelligence platform of one of our key business partners, TickX”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 **4.5 Powering GIS Software and Improving User Confidence in the Private Sector.** CARTO is a US\-based company in spatial analysis and Geographic Information Systems \(GIS\) development. Their GIS platform has more than 300,000 users. In 2016, GDSL collaborated with CARTO to integrate its *US Geodemographic Classification* into their GIS platform. The Head of Data Science found Singleton’s article **\[3.5\]** on the classification “ *invaluable in understanding the development of geographic segmentation*”. The classification was chosen instead of commercial alternatives, due to “ *both the transparency of the methods and the open source nature of the code and the data”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 Within CARTO’s platform, the US Geodemographic Classification is widely used by the public, private, and third sectors. Here, we illustrate a third sector example: The US\-based Anti\-Eviction Mapping Project \(AEMP\) uses the classification to understand the effects of gentrification and support those affected by eviction. The AEMP primarily operate in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. It guides advocacy by mapping patterns of housing discrimination for use by its partners, such as the San Francisco\-based “Tenants Together”. To this end, the AEMP enriches eviction data with extensive demographic and census information from the US Geodemographic Classification. CARTO confirmed: “ *It is a great dataset for enrichment because it distils much of the complexity of the demographic variables down into human\-readable descriptions of the underlying demographic information at different locations”* **\[5.7\].** The AEMP has been promoted by major NGOs and media platforms, including the World Economic Forum, the Guardian, and the Los Angeles Times. 

 **4.6 Further Reach.** From October 2015 to December 2020, the 2011 Output Area Classification, London Output Area Classification, and the Internet User Classification were downloaded 23,220 times. From May 2017, 507 of these were by local authorities **\[5.8\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Governments and multinational companies use international arbitration to resolve high\-stakes commercial disputes. In 2018 alone, the International Court of Arbitration administered 842 cases worldwide involving over 2,000 parties from 135 countries, with $45 million \(USD45,000,000\), on average, in dispute. International arbitration hearings frequently hinge on witness evidence, yet there were no formal guidelines about who may serve as a witness, or how their evidence should be collected and presented, and such procedures are critical in producing accurate eyewitness accounts. Research conducted at Warwick has fundamentally changed the way in which arbitration practitioners view, collect and use witness evidence. A scientific report for the *International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration* by eyewitness expert Dr Kimberley Wade has led to the creation of the first evidence\-based policy and guidelines for the arbitration community. Wade’s research has also played a key role in professional training programmes for legal practitioners.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Erroneous witness testimony is a significant societal problem within the criminal justice context, with substantial personal and financial consequences for those who are wrongly convicted. Research conducted by **Dr Kimberley Wade, Reader in Psychology**, since 2004 at the University of Warwick has examined the **malleability of witness memory**. Across 45 published studies, Wade’s research shows that adults can be wildly wrong both about details of events they have witnessed, as well as entire, self\-involving events that never happened **\[e.g., 3.1, 3.2\]**. 

 Wade's longest running line of research has explored how **suggestive interviewing techniques** can lead people to construct wholly false memories of significant, personal experiences. In these studies, adults are asked to reminisce about fictitious childhood events, sometimes with the aid of real or doctored photographs to help ""jog"" their memory. These studies have repeatedly shown that healthy adults can come to report detailed and compelling accounts of events that never happened. A recent mega\-analysis led by Wade revealed that 30% of individuals in such memory implantation studies typically report distorted autobiographical beliefs or memories **\[3.3\]**. Crucially, Wade’s work has shown that the propensity of false memories increases when participants are provided with idiosyncratic personal information, encouraged to repeatedly imagine suggested events, or receive verbal suggestions without corresponding photographic evidence. 

 Wade’s research has also demonstrated how witnesses who observe crimes can misremember details after viewing **misleading evidence** **\[e.g., 3.4\]** or discussing that criminal event with others **\[e.g., 3.5\]**. In 2018, Wade co\-led a large\-scale, many\-lab experiment that revealed how co\-witnesses frequently contaminate one another's memory reports when they discuss shared experiences, and this **co\-witness suggestibility effect** is strong, robust and common to many cultures **\[3.5\]**. 

 Wade's research has produced at least four other key applied findings. First, memory distortions can be held with great confidence, emotion, detail and coherency, making it **difficult to distinguish** between genuine and distorted memory reports **\[3.6\]**. Second, people rely on “ **cheap and easy” strategies** to verify their personal memories, a tendency that serves to maintain rather than extinguish memory errors **\[3.7\]**. Third, **false memories can be consequential**: they can influence a person's attitudes, intentions and behaviours. In 2009, Wade developed a novel paradigm to explore the power of suggestive interviewing techniques to induce people to actually testify about, or confess to committing, a mock crime that did not happen **\[3.4\]**. In one study, a significant minority of people accused of stealing money in an online gambling task falsely confessed to the misdemeanour and demonstrated belief in their own guilt. Fourth, a witness’ **personal beliefs and biases** can affect what they remember **\[e.g., 3.2\]**. Taken together, Wade's substantial body of research illustrates the very real risk of witnesses providing erroneous testimony when interviewers—either deliberately or unintentionally—manipulate a witness’ recollections. 

 In terms of psychological theory, Wade's research has shown that procedures which encourage interviewees to speculate about, elaborate on, or imagine counterfactual experiences foster memory distortions. These processes serve to blur the phenomenological difference between internally\-generated and externally\-perceived \(real\) memories, leading witnesses to misattribute imagined events to genuine experiences. Wade's empirical research and theory development highlight the need for research\-led policy, practice, and training on how best to elicit witness testimony and maximise the probative value of witness evidence across various settings, including commercial disputes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Wade’s research has increased awareness amongst arbitration professionals of the malleability of witness memory, underpinned policy and practice and informed professional training. 

 Governments and multinational companies use international arbitration to resolve high\-stakes commercial disputes. The International Chamber of Commerce \(ICC\), International Court of Arbitration \(hereafter, the Court\)—established in Paris, 1923—is the gold standard in arbitral institutions and oversees more than 45 million companies in 100\+ countries. In 2018 alone, the Court administered 842 cases involving 2,282 parties from 135 countries, with $45 million \(USD45,000,000\) on average in dispute. The Court has a Commission of over 1000 senior arbitration experts which creates policy that governs all aspects of the arbitral process. Legal counsel and arbitrators from around the world look to the Commission for guidelines and best practice. 

 In 2015, the Commission established an international *T*ask Force of 152 arbitration experts. Wade was invited to be the first, and only, scientific advisor appointed to the Commission **\[5.1\]**. She joined four senior arbitral experts based in the US, France, Germany and the UK, to steer the Task Force, whose mandate was to consider the practices used in international arbitration and to determine how best to maximise the reliability of witness evidence. The ICC Commission Chair and Secretary stated: *“The need to look at the psychological aspects and impact of memory on witness evidence was crucial to be able to understand the accuracy of witness evidence in the arbitral process and the interdisciplinary nature of the work of this Task Force, which would not have been possible without the research and contribution of Dr Wade*…” **\[5.2\]**. 

 International arbitration proceedings frequently hinge on witness evidence, and the time, effort and cost dedicated to collecting and preparing witness testimony are considered justified because they assist tribunals in reaching just decisions **\[5.2\]**. Yet that justification is brought into question if the witness evidence is unreliable. Despite the vital role of witness evidence in international arbitration, there were no formal guidelines about who may serve as a witness, and how witness evidence should be prepared, presented and evaluated. Through regular discussions with the Task Force, Wade determined that arbitration practitioners frequently prepared and presented witness evidence using techniques that could corrupt evidence and undermine the fairness of the arbitral process. 

 From January 2017, Wade regularly presented to the Task Force and wider Commission, to both in\-person and remote audiences of upwards 150 arbitral experts. During the inaugural Task Force meeting \(Paris, February 2017\), Wade explained the application of scientific research to legal settings, including high\-stakes commercial disputes and the science demonstrating the malleability of witness memory **\[5.3\]**. Wade has also attended regular meetings with the Task Force steering group and directly influenced the group’s strategic approach to affecting change within the arbitration community **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. The task force management group affirms that Dr Wade’s *“contribution to the Task Force cannot be overstated … Without Dr. Wade's research work, knowledge, and relentless dedication, the project would not have been possible”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In 2018, Wade co\-authored a scientific review paper with Dr Ula Cartwright\-Finch, a member of the task force steering group and an international arbitration lawyer based in London **\[Appendix 1 of 5.4\]**. This review was written specifically for arbitration experts and described the relevance of Wade’s research to witness evidence in international arbitration proceedings. The review discussed how suggestive interviewing techniques foster false memories, the co\-witness suggestibility effect, and the consequences of false memories **.** The review also outlined key areas in which eyewitness research is conflicting or sparse and cannot yet inform legal practice. For instance, Wade informed the Commission that research on cross\-examination style questions and their impact on human memory was relatively weak, which led the Task Force to refrain from making new recommendations with respect to cross\-examination in international arbitration **\[5.5\]**. 

 Through ongoing discussions with the Commission, Wade also discovered that many arbitration professionals were sceptical about the generalizability of witness research to civil law contexts. Practitioners claimed they would be unwilling to change their practice without some compelling demonstration that the procedures they currently use for preparing and presenting witness evidence were corrupting that evidence. This led Wade to design and execute \(independent\) applied research at the University of Warwick that clearly demonstrated the extent to which witnesses in arbitration proceedings were prone to providing erroneous testimony. She tested over 300 professionals working across a range of industries and in a wide range of roles, from skilled labourers, senior managers, to CEOs. The results showed that witness memory in international arbitration is subject to the same distorting effects that research has proven exists in other domains. Suggestive interviewing techniques \(e.g., asking leading questions, exposure to misinformation\), witnesses’ personal beliefs and biases \(e.g., loyalty to one’s employer\), and misleading evidence can distort witness testimony in commercial disputes. This research is published in the Task Force's final report **\[5.4\]** and was presented to more than 1000 arbitration professionals at the 2018 annual Commission conference **\[5.6\]**. The work stimulated further witness research in civil law contexts, thereby strengthening and extending the evidence base for informing future guidelines for arbitration professionals. 

 In her role as scientific advisor to the Commission, Wade co\-produced the International Chamber of Commerce’s evidence\-based guidelines on maximizing the probative value of witness evidence in international arbitration. The guidelines were published as part of the Task Force's final report in April 2020 **\[Section 4 in 5.4\]** and Wade’s research played a key role in guiding the remit of the report. Most importantly, the report described multiple measures that arbitration practitioners should adopt to enhance the reliability of witness evidence. For example, the guidelines state that an arbitral tribunal should "" *give instructions to the witness prior to his/her examination at the hearing by alerting the witness about the importance of distinguishing between personal knowledge and information gained post\-event from secondary sources*."" **\[5.4\]**. These recommendations were guided by Wade’s own research and the scientific review written by Wade and Cartwright\-Finch. Highlighting Wade's key role, the Task Force co\-chairs state, "" *The Task Force benefitted from the expertise of Dr Kimberley Wade at the University of Warwick, who undertook a series of field studies designed to determine the vulnerability of memory in the context of a commercial dispute not atypical of the disputes that are routinely resolved in arbitration*” and that they are “ *deeply grateful to Wade for her insights in support of the Task Force*”. **\[5.4\]**. 

 Wade’s research on the malleability of witness memory is frequently used to train arbitration professionals and has influenced how practitioners view and obtain witness evidence. Ula Cartwright\-Finch, the Managing Director of Cortex Capital, a London\-based training firm for the law and financial services sectors, has used Wade’s research to deliver training and advice to more than 900 members of the international legal community, including in\-house legal teams, arbitration judges, and arbitration lawyers at all levels of seniority. Cartwright\-Finch confirms: “ *Both in pitches and in the training sessions I deliver on interviewing skills, I refer to Dr Wade’s studies to demonstrate the applicability of memory research and to underline the importance of handling witness evidence according to the principles discussed in the Task Force Report.”* Cartwright\-Finch adds: “… *I know that lawyers are shifting the way they conduct interviews and making other strategic decisions in their cases as a result of this research, including Dr Wade’s original study with the Task Force.”* **\[5.7\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In this case study, we exemplify how our applied research in Disability Sports Performance Analysis \(DSPA\) has impacted globally on national and International governing bodies \(organisations\), coaches, sport science support staff and athletes \(practitioners\), and the delivery of DSPA \(professional services\). Our DSPA research, through knowledge exchange, has been used to improve the quality and efficiency of DSPA provision; contributed directly to enhanced performance outcomes at the highest levels of international disability sport \(European Championships, World Championships and Paralympic Games\), and resulted in developments in workforce planning and policy change in national and international organisations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Peters received funding from British Wheelchair Basketball \(BWB\) in 2014 to explore the impact of notational analysis, analyst and feedback on performance enhancement in elite wheelchair basketball \(Grant 1\).  The research was undertaken by Francis, who was then embedded as Head of Performance Analysis within the BWB world\-class programme \(based at the University of Worcester Arena, a facility purposely designed for wheelchair disability sport\). Through his emerging and unique ‘lived\-experience’ research insight, Francis delivered synchronous and cyclical learning that was used by BWB day\-to\-day, camp\-to\-camp, championship\-to\-championship and cycle\-to\-cycle to impact the success of their elite men’s, women’s, and junior teams. Due to potential competitive advantage, these data have only been available for publication since 2019. 

 **Performance Analysis Template**: In 2014, we created, validated, and demonstrated the reliability of the first\-ever template for objectively assessing team performance in wheelchair basketball. The research uniquely involved coach and practitioner expert validation, robust intra\- and inter\-observer reliability assessments, and produced original, agreed operational definitions and video\-clip exemplars of each action variable for use across the sport \(Reference 1\). 

 **Team Performance Model** \(TPM\): From data collected using our template at the 2015 Men’s European Championships, we employed logistic regression modelling to explore the offensive and defensive tactics used by the top five finishing teams who as a result qualified for the 2016 Paralympic Games. The final model calculated the interactive effect of game status, offensive and defensive line\-ups, start of possession, end of possession and defensive system used by the opponent and demonstrated 76% accuracy in predicting the probability of winning a game Reference 2\). 

 **Field\-Goal Shooting Model** \(FGSM\): From the 5105 field\-goal shots attempted by the 12 teams competing in the 2016 Paralympic Games men’s wheelchair basketball competition, we created the first valid and reliable template for assessing field goal shooting attempts in elite men’s wheelchair basketball. We then employed logistic regression modelling to develop a final model that included player classification, defensive pressure, pre\-shot action, team ranking, shot clock remaining, shot location, and shot movement that could predict shot outcome with 68% accuracy \(Reference 3\). 

 **Embedding performance analysis and analyst as a learning resource within elite level disability sport**: Francis had previously explored the role of Sport Performance Analysis \(SPA\) in elite team sport \(Reference 4\) in which the importance of the coach\-athlete\-analyst relationship was first established. Peters had also identified from his qualitative analysis of elite disability sport coach narratives, the need for the development and wider implementation of SPA across disability sport to ‘level the playing field’ of sport science provision for elite disability sport \(Reference 5\). Francis has also explored learning from the provision and use of DSPA within Para\-Football \(Reference 6\) providing unique knowledge regarding athletes use of DSPA, the role of the analyst and their cumulative impact on learning and performance. Through researching the use of an online\-learning DSPA portal with elite deaf futsal players, Francis demonstrated increased engagement with and attitudes towards DSPA from coaches and athletes that resulted in enhanced performance.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our DSPA research, through synchronous and asynchronous knowledge exchange, has: 

 **Significantly improved DSPA practice and provision for individuals, teams, and national & international organisations** 

 The project outlined above explored how SPA could be used within BWB’s world\-class performance throughout the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Paralympic Games Cycle and beyond. The foundational development of a performance analysis template created significant advancement in the effective use of game data, providing unique objective insight into team and individual playing performance that has been used widely \(a\-e\), allowing players and coaches “ *to get more detail…It then helped us understand how effective that analysis could be”* \(d\) *.* Francis worked within the sports science support team to raise awareness and understanding of how SPA could be used to enhance learning and understanding, resulting in notable improvements in SPA provision and practice \(a\-g\) as the research “ *allowed for conversations and debates regarding measuring performance that wouldn't have taken place that solved performance problems that were present that hadn't been identified yet*” \(c\). The new template was used to provide objectivity and enhance provision across the men’s, women’s, and junior performance squads from 2015 to 2017: “ *In particular, \[the\] research around offensive and defensive team performance metrics assisted in the playing style, offensive and defensive strategies and line\-up decisions that were adopted*” \(f\). Following dissemination at the BASES 2015 conference, analysts for Para\-Football teams of the Football Association used the fundamental components of the template “ *to ensure the data and information collected on a team and/or individual performance is meaningful and contains context through analysing sequences of events, for coaches and staff to understand the entire picture and develop performance plans based on objective information*” \(h\). Various Para\-Football performance teams have now embedded our DSPA provisions and online learning platforms to aid learning and understanding tailored to individuals’ learning needs \(h\). World Rugby has also incorporated aspects of the template into wheelchair rugby because of our research “ *to ensure meaningful information can be collected by World Rugby analysts moving forward*” \(i\). 

 **Extensively used by elite disability sport coaches, sport\-science support staff, teams, and athletes to enhance performance at the highest levels** 

 The Team Performance Model \(TPM\) and the Field\-Goal Shooting Model \(FGSM\) are comprehensive predictive models of wheelchair basketball performance and were the first in the world to include sequential analysis. BWB practitioners used the TPM to formulate strategic plans and adjust training sessions in the build\-up and during major international competitions e.g., the model formulated optimal offensive and defensive line\-ups at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Paralympic Games and subsequent competitions in 2017 and 2018 across the entire BWB world class performance programmes \(c\-f\). 

 The FGSM was developed to quantify and predict individual and team shooting success whilst incorporating the actions and behaviours of the opposition and helped players “ *to adapt \[their\] game, increase awareness of \[their\] shooting action and encouraged debates around the current practice, training methods, tactics and game plan between teammates, coaches and support staff*” \(b\). The overall work and models “ *directly influenced and positively impacted the ascent of the Great Britain Teams on the world stage, leading to the attainment of three out of four World Champions titles \(Great Britain Men, Great Britain U23 Men and Great Britain U25 Women\) and a silver medal for the Great Britain Women*” \(g\). The ability of the models to simulate and predict the likely outcome of various game situations added game\-changing value to scientists at the England Institute of Sport and coaches within the named organisation \(c\-f\). Coaches, practitioners, and athletes have since embedded the models into different settings in Germany, Spain, Italy, and Canada leading to significant improvements in individual and team performance \(d, e, f\). 

 **Improved the quality, efficiency, and professional standing of DSPA across a range of disability sports at the highest\-level influencing workforce planning in national disability sport world class programmes and international governing body strategy** 

 Our research has been used by several national and international organisations, across an array of disability sports, to enhance the provision, quality, efficiency, and professional standing of DSPA. “ *The changes to current practice based on research findings aided and improved the current methods adopted by staff and the performance team*” \(g\). Our research “ *influenced how British Wheelchair Basketball recruited staff for the start of the Tokyo Paralympic Games Cycle*” and led to a full\-time sport performance analyst being employed to lead the provision \(g\). The Football Association have employed two consultant sport performance analysts to lead the DSPA provisions for the Blind, Deaf Futsal, Deaf Football and Cerebral Palsy teams \(h\). “Based on a key finding within this work…the opportunity for staff to learn British Sign Language has been and will continue to be embedded within camps and away from camps” staff to ensure key performance advantages can be communicated effectively \(h\). World Rugby have subsequently appointed a Game Analyst Consultant to lead the wheelchair rugby provision \(i\). 

 Our research has resulted in the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation \(IWBF\) introducing “a new component within its Competition Strategy to ensure performance analysis provisions and facilities are available at all major competitions”, requiring the inclusion of DSPA provision as a key and fundamental element in all competition bids \(g\). This was first included at the 2018 World Wheelchair Basketball Championships and is included in the rearranged 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games. Furthermore, our research has contributed to the sport’s current classification philosophy, IWBF’s player classification system \(g\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study reports the impact of a research\-informed online course for English teachers, used worldwide and sponsored by the British Council. The course encourages users to challenge the pervasive belief that learning outcomes can and should be determined solely by monolithic native\-speaker norms. As a result of taking the course, teachers and teacher trainers have achieved **new understanding** and are able to adopt a more ‘plurilithic’ orientation to English, in which effective non\-native users, forms, and uses are valued. Incorporating the free course content and activities into their **professional practice**, teachers have helped their students develop more realistic and meaningful learning goals, and trainers have enriched their pedagogical repertoires. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The dominant conceptualisations of English underpinning learning, teaching and assessment in English Language Teaching \(ELT\) are monolithic in nature, based on ‘standard’ native norms. This is becoming increasingly problematic in a world in which most English users are second language \(L2\) speakers, many with their own quite established local varieties \(World Englishes\); indeed, most interaction in English is now between speakers of different first languages, as a Lingua Franca \(ELF\). Prof Hall has been exploring several dimensions of this ‘Global Englishes’ phenomenon for over a decade, and since 2012 has been collaborating with Dr Wicaksono on projects which challenge the exclusive focus on Anglocentric norms in ELT. Hall’s research, drawing on the notion that English is a ‘plurilithic’ \(as opposed to monolithic\) phenomenon, seeks to stimulate change in educational policy and practice towards the adoption of more realistic and socially just goals for ELT. 

 Hall’s plurilithic framework develops ideas from Critical Applied Linguistics regarding the socio\-political nature of named language boundaries, and shows how these ideas are consistent with findings from psycholinguistics about the illusory nature of distinct named languages in multilingual minds **\[3.1\]**. Hall has applied the plurilithic framework specifically to English **\[3.6\]**. Focusing on the polysemy of the word *English*, he distinguishes between two sets of ontological categories, corresponding to language conceptualised as a general phenomenon \(and hence English\[es\] as instantiations of this\) and language conceptualised as a collection of distinct named codes associated with different nations \(of which English is one\). Hall argues that English exists in the first sense by virtue of the existence of language as a human capacity and is independent of our awareness of it. In the second sense, he argues, English exists by virtue of the original existence of a group of people perceiving themselves as a nation, ‘the English’, and those who now trace a cultural lineage with this group. The first set reflects a plurilithic sense in which English is constituted by distributed cognitive resources, social processes and discourse products; in the second set, English is considered a monolithic resource governed by regulative norms. Hall claims that it is this latter sense which underpins most educational practice. 

 Hall and colleagues have conducted a number of empirical studies which illuminate the plurilithic framework, examining both the nature of teachers’ ontological and ideological beliefs about English and the plurilithic nature of English itself. Interview and focus group data from teachers in China **\[3.2\]** and Gaza revealed monolithic beliefs about grammar on the one hand, and more plurilithic orientations in other areas of competence and use \(e.g. pronunciation and vocabulary\) on the other. An analysis of interview data from primary school educators working with L2 English\-using students in England, conducted with Dr Cunningham, inferred monolithic ontological categories of English from the prevalent ‘Standard Language’ and ‘One Nation, One Language’ ideologies prevailing in the educators’ discourse **\[3.5\]**. A corpus study of a user of L2 English operating in an ELF context demonstrated the ‘usage\-based’ idiolectal nature of the grammatical resources brought to effective communication **\[3.4\]**. An analysis of native\-speaker child language data from the online CHILDES database was used to motivate a plurilithic approach to L2 English assessment for an academic/professional readership **\[3.3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In a 2008 position statement on English as a Global Language, *TESOL International* \(the biggest international professional ELT body\) states: “In terms of language teaching, TESOL does not advocate one standard or variety of English over another. Rather, TESOL urges English language teachers to make informed decisions at local, regional, and/or national levels, taking into account the purposes and contexts of use that are most relevant to their learners”. Our research facilitates this process in two interlinked ways, by influencing: \(a\) the awareness, attitudes and understandings of ELT professionals, challenging the conventional wisdom that learning outcomes can and should be determined solely by monolithic norms; and \(b\) ELT professional practice, through the adoption of a research\-informed plurilithic orientation to English in personal and professional training and development, as well as teaching. 

 The main pathway to these impacts is the online course for teachers *Changing Englishes*, originally released in 2013. V.02 was pre\-released to trial users in 2019 and launched for the general public through the British Council’s global TeachingEnglish website in April 2020. A fully upgraded v.02.2 *beta* was released in October 2020 **\[5.1\]**. Its Creative Commons license means it is free to take, and any part of it may be used and adapted for teaching/training purposes. Participants may formally register for the course and be eligible for a Certificate of Completion, or dip in and use however much of the material they wish without registering. Course users are taken through five units of research\-informed interactive material. Units 1 and 2 draw on theory described in **\[3.1\]** and **\[3.6\]**; Unit 3 introduces concepts and data discussed in **\[3.3\]** and **\[3.4\]**; Unit 4 incorporates qualitative data from **\[3.2\]** and **\[3.5\]**. 

 *Reach* 

 Since its original launch in 2013 on the British Council’s global TeachingEnglish website, the course has received thousands of visitors and has been used and cited as best practice around the world. In 2019, 54 teachers from 19 countries registered to take the completely revised v.02 during the pre\-release trial. Since the official release of v.02.1 in April 2020 and its follow\-up v.02.2 in October, it has received 4,499 unique visitors, with 868 returning, from 109 countries **\[5.2\]**. During this period, 495 teachers have formally registered, 43 have applied for and been awarded certificates of completion, and the online Self\-Assessment Tool has been used 481 times. 

 Course content has been incorporated into teaching programmes both in the UK \(e.g. Leeds and Manchester\) and abroad \(e.g. Hong Kong and Malaysia\). The course has been discussed and recommended in several books and over 30 journal articles \(Google Scholar\), from Bangladesh to Ukraine, and has been included on international online professional platforms, such as the international Global Englishes network coordinated by the University of Edinburgh. Material from the course has been reproduced in a blog for ELT teachers, in a teacher training event in Latvia, and a Business English conference in Prague. In the book *English as a Lingua Franca in Teacher Education* \(de Gruyter, 2017\), the authors describe how pre\-service teacher trainees in Brazil were encouraged to identify “websites that could spark ideas about how an ELF perspective could be incorporated into the classroom” and chose *Changing Englishes* as one of the five resources they found most relevant. A presentation by Hall using material from the course, uploaded by an audience member to the digital publishing site Yumpu in 2016, has been viewed 1973 times. As of April 2020, the British Council report on the course had been downloaded 188 times from their website. **\[5.3\]** 

 *Significance* 

 Participation in the course has led to real changes in beliefs and professional practice. Testimony from ten users of v.01 of the course who are now practising English teachers in eight different countries **\[5.4\]** and two tutors who have used the course on UK postgraduate teacher preparation programmes **\[5.5\]** provide evidence of these changes. A teacher from Iraq stated that “Before I took the Changing Englishes course \[…\] I had the belief that there is a standard English, however, once I \[was\] introduced to the concept of “World Englishes” and grasp the idea. Thereafter, I convey the massage to my students here in Iraq”. A teacher from Kazakhstan told us: “I \[…\] use the materials and examples from this Changing Englishes course for my professional development \[…\], workshops for my colleagues and simply in class discussions”. A teacher in Japan uses the course “to create the chance for my students to think about English language \[…\] through discussing in groups about where English language is a planet or a galaxy”.  A teacher from Germany reports that Unit 4 of the course provided a “breakthrough moment” following which he “then tried in \[his\] teaching to welcome and appreciate translanguaging and encouraged students to express themselves with a stronger focus on communicating and getting a message across rather than focussing on pronunciation and grammatical correctness.” The latest teacher to be awarded a certificate of completion \(in December, 2020\) told us in an unsolicited email: “I cannot express how helpful this course has been for me as an English teacher educator in Nigeria. It has gone beyond just CPD, it is a world view changer.” 

 One postgraduate tutor in the UK told us that they use the Self\-Assessment Tool \(based on the questionnaire instrument used in **\[3.2\]**\) and course activities in their Approaches and Contexts in TESOL module, reporting that the course “has enriched my teaching and contributed greatly to the urgent task of adapting ELT professionals’ mindsets to the new realities of global English usage”. Another tutor told us that the course “has led me to include a greater focus in my teaching on how English is conceptualised, especially by teachers, and how these conceptualisations influence both social issues \(e.g. of teacher and learner identity\) and cognitive issues \(e.g. of the problematic nature of monolithic norms as a learning target\)”. 

 Of 23 teachers who completed a v.02 post\-trial survey **\[5.6\]**: 21 agreed or strongly agreed that ‘taking the course has changed how I conceptualise the English language’ and 18 agreed or strongly agreed that ‘taking the course has changed the way I think about my students’ learning goals and outcomes’. One participant commented that “The course helped me to be more aware of the necessity to talk about Changing Englishes in order to bring about change.” Another described her reaction to the course as “Engaged, interested, inspired, astonished”. Comments in the v.02.1 Discussion Board \(totalling 17,000\+ words\) demonstrate how participation in the course changed teachers’ beliefs or provided them with stronger justifications for the beliefs they already had **\[5.7\]**. 

 After six months, we followed up on the longer\-term effects of the course with eleven of these trial users **\[5.8\]**. All participants reported greater levels of awareness and deeper understanding of the plurilithic nature of English, with more open attitudes to learners’ communicative achievements and needs. The following extracts illustrate the range of actions and changed practices that have resulted directly from course participation: 

-  “As a result of the course, I held two workshops for students at a Business University in Riga \(Erasmus Staff mobility\) and it has become an important part of my curriculum for my English class.” 

-  “I no longer insist on teaching just the standard English and, being a teacher of French and a fluent speaker of Italian as well, I'm helping myself with other languages when teaching \(TRANSLANGUAGING\).” 

-  “My ability and conscious effort to deduce meaning from every writing in English, no matter how 'substandard' it might be has improved. \[…\].” The teacher gives an example of a student who relocated from another part of Nigeria with a ‘less standard’ variety of English and was finding it difficult to fit in. “With my experience \[of the course\], I helped him understand what was happening and assured him he was no less than they are but was just from a different background and exposure.” 

-  “Previously I was obsessed with speaking British English and it was a little hard to do. Furthermore, my students found it a little strange. Instead I decided to keep my Iranian identity while talking and while communicating in English which I think would be much more interesting to the people whom I speak with.” 

-  “I pick more appropriate tasks according to my students level and needs.” 

-  “When incorporating videos, I make sure there are non\-native speakers of English involved.” 

-  “In terms of assessment, I double\-check whether the option a student has given me might be right somewhere in the world, and if yes, he / she gets the point for the answer.” 

-  “Unexpectedly, I probably speak my mind more readily in team situations.” 

 One participant in v.02, a teacher trainer from Germany, approached Hall to propose a collaborative project to produce video materials for teacher trainees, taking up a suggestion in Unit 5 of the course. The project was awarded financial support from BAAL’s Applying Linguistics fund in June 2020 and has recruited MA student courses from at least three institutions in Germany, two in Austria, eight in the UK, one in Spain, and two in China. The award committee commended the project for “its timely topic and its potential in challenging Anglocentric norms for English Language Teaching” **\[5.9\]**.

Case studies in this strand often participate in the preservation and recovery of native languages, particularly Gaelic. Welsh-language learning tools, often capitalising on the opportunity for crowdsourcing knowledge online, have made impressive strides in boosting public interest in Welsh learning.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted by Swansea University has established the global historical significance of the South Wales copper industry and has helped to preserve and develop what is left of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks, one of the last remaining substantial built heritage assets in the lower Swansea Valley. The research has had an effect on the Swansea council development plan and the targeted regional investment programme for the lower Swansea valley. It has changed the awareness and understanding of the copper industry heritage in the communities and schools of the lower Swansea Valley, as well as bringing visitor and broadcaster interest.  It has had an effect on the GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package Copr Bay, SME location on the Hafod Morfa site and copper branding of firms in the area. Overall, the research has helped Swansea to develop a holistic historically aware approach to economic regeneration and place\-making to benefit the capacity of the community and economy in the lower Swansea Valley.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the REF2014 Copperopolis case study was all about establishing the global significance of Swansea as a centre for copper smelting. Since then, Swansea historians have uncovered much more detail about the products made from Swansea copper and the markets supplied by them worldwide. This is part of a new ‘turn’ in writing about the history of Welsh industry which goes beyond understanding places and processes of production, to examining the supply of goods and the demands of customers buying Welsh products \(R1\). By using a range of business and commercial records, Miskell and Bowen have discovered more about the importance of copper in the production of key goods used in textile manufacture, maritime, transport and food and drink industries, and about product diversification over time. This new innovative research has moved the narrative away from conventional themes of mineral supply, processing and investment, towards global markets and patterns of consumption. In doing so, it has established the centrality of Swansea copper to global processes of industrialisation and modernisation. In particular, the research has shown that: 

 In the early eighteenth century, the success of Swansea firms in establishing themselves at the centre of the new British copper industry, was their ability to meet East India Company orders to supply Asian markets with a range of products for domestic and decorative use. \(R3\) 

 The production of small, portable barter items like manillas and guinea rods for West African slave traders via Bristol merchants was also part of the output of the early Swansea firms, but occupied a smaller and diminishing part of their product base. \(R4\) 

 By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the willingness of Swansea firms like Vivian & Sons to invest in new rolling mills and steam engine technology meant that they could respond to growing demand for copper sheathing for naval and merchant sailing vessels, supplying shipbuilders and repairers with customized sheathing of different sizes and weights. \(R2\) 

 By the 1820s Swansea copper was also embedded in the growth of the mechanised textile trade with the firm of Williams & Grenfell dominating the supply of copper cylinders for printing on fabric, to Lancashire cotton manufacturers. \(R.2\) 

 The supply of copper vessels including boiling pans, stills and brewing vats to the food and drink industries provided another important source of demand for copper and saw Swansea firms supplying customers as diverse as London copper smiths who made boiling pans destined for the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, to Irish brewers and whisky distillers. \(R2\) 

 By the early twentieth century, a loss of competitiveness as a location for copper smelting saw the surviving Swansea firms focus more on manufacturing, particularly of copper components for locomotives destined for domestic and overseas railway customers. \(R2\) 

 Throughout their history, Swansea copper firms were well\-informed of — and responsive to — the fluctuating demands of global markets and tailored their products accordingly in order to retain their overseas customers and remain competitive. 

 These key research insights have helped the story of Swansea copper to reach a new range of audiences in the public, private and third sector and have provided a stimulus to the next phase of grant capture and development planning for the Hafod Morfa Copperworks site. This is one of the last remaining built heritage legacies of the copper industry in the lower Swansea Valley, an area once popularly known as Copperopolis.  Bowen and Langlands have worked to preserve the site in conjunction with Swansea Council.  Since 2014 their grant capture has sought to focus on continued site restoration as well as initiating the regeneration potential of this built heritage to the redevelopment of the lower Swansea Valley. \(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The uncovering of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s industrial copperworking heritage continues to inform publicly funded programmes resulting in a profound change in attitude across public, private and third sector institutions. Not only has the research been matched to community and enterprise need in the drawing down of over GBP3,600,000 of grant funding **\[G1 – G5\]**, it has impacted upon planning and regeneration policies **\[C1\]**, attracted SME investment **\[C7\]**, and enriched the cultural life **\[C4, 5, 6, 8, 9\]** of wards in the lowest two quintiles of the Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation. 

 <ins> **Influence on public planning and regeneration policy**</ins> 

 The period between 2008 and 2020, has witnessed a sea change in the approach to economic regeneration in the city **\[C1\]**. In the **Swansea Bay City Region Economic Strategy 2013\-2030 \(2013\)**, not a single reference to heritage nor the historic environment was made. The City and Council of Swansea’s own **Unitary Development Plan \(2008\)** made only a passing reference to the role industrial heritage can play in the tourist economy. Even in the **Swansea Local Development Plan Topic Paper: Culture and Heritage \(2013\)**, ‘heritage\-led’ regeneration consisted of limited opportunities within the tourism and built heritage construction sectors. However, the statutory heritage body of Welsh Government, Cadw, sought the help of the university to provide the underpinning historical research for its 2016 Urban Characterisation report on the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C3\]**. This study identified and set out the significance, distinctiveness and unique historic character of the local region. Concurrently, research undertaken by Swansea University historians heavily influenced the production of the ‘master plan’ produced by heritage consultants Purcell for a ‘copperworks’ enterprise and mixed\-use park **\[C1\]**. 

 The City and Council of Swansea’s **Local Development Plan 2010\-2025 \(Deposit Plan, July 2016\)** drew directly on both of these documents in setting out its ambitions for the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks site and its links to the ‘River Tawe Corridor’, listing a ‘heritage\-led project’ to include ‘restoration of historic buildings’ and a ‘heritage visitor centre’ **\[C1\]**. The renewed historic significance of the surviving monuments created the case for World Heritage Site status, and this impacted greatly on policy and decision makers in the region **\[C1\]**. Listed buildings that had been subjected to neglect for decades, despite many attempts to rescue them, now ‘represent a significant regeneration opportunity’ with proposals for the heritage led regeneration of the site being driven by ‘The Hafod/Morfa Copperworks Project’, a partnership project between the Council and Swansea University **\[C2, C10\]**. This regeneration is now being realised publicly by the **Targeted Regeneration Investment Programme \(TRIP\) 2018**, through which the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks is set to receive over GBP2,000,000 of investment from a total of GBP27,000,000 for the south\-west region **\[C1\]**. Head of Economic Development and External Funding at Swansea Council says: ‘ *This is a major turnaround from 10 years ago when the site was covered in vegetation, forgotten and decaying. It can now look forward to a bright, collaborative future, part of a regional investment campaign, understood by key national and regional investment partners, and a place to live, work and play, celebrating the extensive heritage both of the works itself, and the wider legacy in the Lower Swansea Valley*’ **\[C2\]**. From 2015 through to the present day, Swansea University research staff have sat on the project boards for regeneration projects in the area and attended key decision\-making meetings on a range of issues relevant to redevelopment, restoration and public engagement in the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C10\]**. This has served as a key corollary through which the historic significance and heritage potential of the surviving assets has been communicated, in turn supporting the case for TRIP funding. These funds, traditionally reserved for investment in commercial and economic zones \(such as town centres/high streets\), have been targeted at ‘shell and core’ restorations of the physical heritage assets, in a plan to attract high\-end commercial ‘anchor tenants’ to further stimulate economic growth in the region. 

 In a climate where even in Cadw’s own report on **Valuing the Welsh Historic Environment \(2010\)**, primacy was given to the direct ‘economic value’ of the historic environment, the Lower Swansea Valley is experiencing a shift in approach to one that identifies the route to true sustainable economic growth lying first and foremost in the recognition of the historic significance and sense of place. The significance of Miskell and Bowen’s research has been identified by Cadw and the National Lottery Heritage Fund **\[C3\]**. The historical research that has established the importance to Britain of Swansea’s copperworking industries underpins place\-making policies now being advocated at regional and national governmental levels **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins> **The Cultural Impacts of Historic Significance**</ins> 

 Swansea historians led a sustained collaborative engagement campaign ranging from national events with 6,000 visitors \(The Man Engine Cymru, April 2018\), to National Lottery Heritage Fund\-supported renovation work. This has resulted in far greater public appreciation of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s copperworking industries **\[C4, C9\]**. Not only have these enriched the social and cultural life of a deprived area, but they have served to sharpen a sense of distinctive identity shaped by copper heritage, which has drawn the attention of a number of national broadcasters **\[C5\].** This is also evident from the large number of volunteers and visitors to the site over the past 5 years **\[C4\]**, which includes a group of committed people who have formed the Friends of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks group who take care of the site and offer guided tours **\[C9\]**. One of the group’s founders and current Chair, engineer Tom Henderson outlines the long\-term value of Swansea University’s instigation of the regeneration process: ‘ *the awareness of Swansea's past industrial process that Huw Bowen helped kickstart, \[…\] the archaeology, \[…\] archives searches and the oral histories \[…\] that the friends group have carried out have all helped clear the path to tangible progress in regenerating the former copperworks sites in the lower Swansea valley*’ **\[C4\]**. The success of this research\-informed University and volunteer partnership is set out by the Economic Development Officer, Swansea Council stating: ‘ *The collaboration between the council, university, friends and volunteers has shown that the model works well and can achieve excellent results and prove good value for money. We believe that this model can be used in the future for further phases of restoration*’ **\[C2\]**. 

 Research into the investment of Swansea copper firms in the latest plant and machinery has given impetus to the Musgrave Engine restoration project **\[G3\]**. The Musgrave Engine – the last surviving remnant of the advanced steam\-powered rolling technology in use on the Hafod Morfa site – is now being refurbished and rehoused as a visitor attraction. Involving primary school children in this process has done much to enrich local awareness of this vital cultural asset. As one teacher from Hafod primary says, **‘** *We have also learned a lot from our involvement in the Musgrave restoration project. Outreach workshops, creative sessions and trips are very beneficial to us in our learning*.’ **\[C8\]** 

 <ins> **An Attraction for Regional and SME Investment**</ins> 

 Swansea University’s research on the historical significance of the copper working industries to the Lower Swansea Valley has led ultimately to the iconic metal itself playing a major role in the construction, branding and public communication of a GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package for a new district in Swansea: **Copr Bay.** The landmark construction of the new district will be a copper bridge, and artist and designer Marc Rees notes that it, *‘represents the transition from the past to the future. It symbolizes Swansea’s aspiration to evolve, grow, flourish and become even more exciting but still very much rooted in a sense of place’* **\[C7\]**. The process of public consultation for this project is set to be informed by technologies developed through EPSRC funds allocated by CherishDE to the Hafod Morfa Copperworks as a ‘Resource Constrained Community’ **\[G2\] \[C7\].** 

 The historic significance of the copperworks, and the role the metal played in the emergence of a global distilling industry **\[R2\]**, is a key attraction for **Penderyn**’s desire to build a new distillery and visitor centre on the site **\[C7\]**. Research carried out at Swansea University has established the historic importance of whisky distilling firms as customers of Swansea copper firms, and is set to inform the content, interpretation and display within that visitor centre, creating a new narrative around how the copper goods produced in Swansea went on to have a global impact **\[R2\]**. Drawing on GBP3,500,000 of NLHF investment and an additional GBP4,000,000 of private sector investment, the future of the Power House, one of the site’s most important heritage assets, has been secured for at least another 100 years **\[C6\].** Within, copper equipment and technology will be utilized as part of an industrial process, 15 FTE jobs will be created and a 50,000 visitors will be attracted per annum. 

 An increased affinity for the copper ‘brand’ was exemplified by Swansea City FC’s adoption a copper heritage theme \(2015\) within the hospitality part of their Liberty Stadium \(located on part of the Hafod\-Morfa site\), a process informed by our researchers. A new white and copper playing kit for season 2015\-16 was also launched accompanied by a promotional video drawing directly on research by Swansea historians. Indeed the region is now furnished with a range of SMEs trading on the copper brand, including Copper Bar, Copperfish, Copper Bay Digital, Coppergate and the Copper Jack \- an illustration of how the historic and global significance of copper to the region, a narrative largely promoted by research at Swansea University, has created a brand identity that local businesses take pride in trading on **\[C7\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Watt has built upon impact demonstrated in REF2014 to achieve greater complexity and formalised engagement with contemporary political problems in Mexico. His role as a legal expert witness has resulted in the granting of legal asylum \(in the UK and the US\) to several individuals escaping persecution by organised crime groups and in securing the release of undocumented migrants from incarceration. By holding democratic institutions to account through, for example, founding the Red Universitaria y Ciudadana por la Democracia \(the University and Citizen Democracy Network\), he has proactively put pressure on government processes, including the 2018 general election, to ensure fairness and transparency. His international media work has been key in raising awareness of Mexico’s social and political problems and he is now frequently called upon by US and UK legal firms to provide expert witness testimony for Mexican nationals fleeing persecution. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Watt is co\-author of *Drug War Mexico* \(R1\), which is a leading publication in engaging specialists and lay readers alike on the topic of narcotrafficking in Mexico. The book’s key insight is that the expansion of neoliberal economic policies in Mexico contributed directly to the growth of organised crime and strengthened the links between drug cartels and state actors and institutions. While this was a relatively controversial thesis at the time of publication, this perspective is now widely accepted in the scholarly literature. The volume is used on university curricula in the US, Canada, the UK, and Mexico itself. Watt’s approach moves away from the commonplace reduction of Mexico’s everyday violence to typical actors \(drug lords, gangs, and cartels\), and instead emphasises the socio\-structural context, and interconnection, of: neoliberal domestic economic policies, land reforms, relations with the USA, and institutional corruption. As a result, *Drug War Mexico* was praised in the *Journal of Latin American Studies* for its “excellent regional analysis” \(2013\). 

 Deep geo\-cultural knowledge has been the basis for both Watt’s subsequent research and his impactful activities. As well as being a leading authority on the history of narcotrafficking over the past four decades, Watt writes on related cultural problems for Mexico that are of contemporary relevance: human rights abuses, restrictions on freedom of expression, and the security crisis. On these issues, he co\-authored an article on Mexico for a volume on security and violence in the Americas \(R2\), and published both a peer\-reviewed article and a co\-edited volume \(R3, R4\). These pieces expand on Watt’s assertion that the growth of organised crime has been facilitated by official complicity and neoliberal reforms, which favour the wealthy, but which also contribute to widespread economic precarity and social instability. The latter brings together internationally renowned scholars with expertise on human rights in Mexico; Watt co\-authored the introduction. 

 Watt is now researching the recent rise of the far right and what he interprets as neo\-fascist politics, contextualising the phenomenon against the political history of countries which, in his view, are most clearly affected by austerity and neoliberal economic policies. This new body of scholarship draws on Watt’s previous research on US foreign policy towards Mexico, particularly in light of President Trump’s border wall initiative; and it expands beyond Latin America with a global perspective, complementing his previous concern with regional dynamics.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2014, an NGO providing legal aid to international exiles invited Watt to act as an expert on contemporary Mexico as a consequence of his 2012 co\-authored book: *Drug War Mexico*. Watt is now listed on the webpage of IRRI Rights in Exile Programme \(S1\), and as a result has been asked to provide expert witness reports on the current political climate and breakdown in the rule of law in Mexico for legal cases involving Mexican nationals seeking asylum in the United States \(US Citizen and Immigration Service\) and the United Kingdom \(UK Immigration and Asylum Court\). Watt’s reports have been used as evidence in US and UK immigration trials to assess the credibility of claims made by citizens fleeing persecution by organised crime syndicates and state actors. Watt has supported eight Mexican nationals in total, and has prepared twelve reports ranging from 4,000 to 6,600 words since 2015, along with oral testimony for some cases \(S2\). This entailed both a wide breadth of geo\-cultural knowledge, and significant depth of time invested, with life\-changing effects on individuals. 

 In one instance during 2015\-16, Watt provided three reports and in\-court oral testimony over the course of the case and its two appeals in London, for Wilsons Solicitors, to significant effect. The case involved a Mexican national who had been the victim of repeated violent assaults and threats and then subsequently tracked down when she attempted to escape the clutches of one of Mexico’s most violent crime organisations. Asylum in the UK was granted to the claimant as a result of Watt’s testimony. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 The claimant’s life was probably saved, for they were at risk of being tortured and murdered had they been deported to Mexico. Similarly, The Capitol Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition \(CAIR\) in Washington DC, which in 2015 commissioned a pro\-bono report by Watt for a client fleeing persecution by an organised crime group, noted that, “ *\[t\]he report was incredibly thorough and well\-researched, and was frequently cited throughout the attorneys’ briefs. The case resulted in a successful grant of deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture for our client.”* Watt was called on again by the same organisation in 2020 on behalf of a client, who, having fled Mexico after severe threats of intimidation and the murder of family members by a drug cartel, was living undocumented in the US. A letter from CAIR asserted that, *“the judge decided in favor of our client and directly quoted Dr. Watt’s declaration in her oral decision, a testament to just how valuable Dr. Watt’s contributions were for this case”* \(S4\). 

 Watt’s research has also prompted activism outside the courtroom, in an effort to safeguard democracy. Together with his then\-PhD student Rupert Knox, Watt co\-founded the Red Universitaria y Ciudadana por la Democracia \(RUCD, or the University and Citizen Democracy Network\), an international pro\-democracy network that raises the concerns of corruption and electoral fraud in Mexico and abroad. Their first initiative was the training of a UK observatory team in Mexico to offer solidarity to citizens, deter election malpractice, and report foul play in Mexico during the July 2018 presidential elections. In the run\-up to the vote, more than 130 candidates had been murdered and journalists attacked. Watt led a 26\-strong UK delegation for the RUCD who, in collaboration with 200 Mexican and 100 international visitors, monitored the country on election day. A collective report presented to a press conference in Mexico City on 3 July concluded that the team had encountered minimal tampering and irregularities \(S5\). The document was submitted to the database of the National Electoral Institute, the Electoral Tribunal, and the *Fiscalía Especializada para la Atención de Delitos Electorales* \(FEPADE\) \- the office which considers cases of electoral fraud. Watt’s assessment was cited in the day’s news \(e.g. *20 minutos*, 2 July 2018\). Despite fears of widespread intimidation of voters and electoral fraud, the election was regarded as one of the freest and cleanest in recent decades, with the successful candidate winning through an unprecedented landslide, which saw the ruling party defeated in nearly every state and in all three branches of government. Father Alejandro Solalinde, perhaps Mexico’s most respected and internationally recognised human rights defender, and who collaborated with the UK delegation, told *The Morning Star* that the international observers had “helped save Mexico” from fears that the election would feature widespread fraud and corruption \(S6\). Watt’s deep knowledge of contemporary Mexico, derived from his research, was key to the planning of the monitoring exercise \(S7\). 

 Watt’s expertise ensures his status as the go\-to external voice on Mexico’s present\-day social problems \- he is frequently asked for comment and shapes international debate. Between 2016 and 2018, Watt was interviewed by Sky News four times on violence and drugs cartels in Mexico \(S8\). Watt’s appearances were prompted by his article on the capture of the leader of the Sinaloa cartel for *The Conversation* in 2016, which was read almost 23,000 times. In February 2018, Watt featured as the sole guest on TeleSUR’s *Interviews From Mexico* English\-language broadcast \(30 minutes\), a programme that examines current issues with “those who know them best”. The episode explicitly discussed Watt’s academic research into the war on drugs, the narco industry, the corruption and its consequences in Mexico — and was broadcast all around the world \(S9\). Following the broadcast, the Mexican broadsheet *La Jornada* based a news article on Watt’s academic opinion the following day \(16 Feb 2018\) because he had become known to the media as an expert on the country with an outside perspective. Watt’s voice and its amplification in the media thereby importantly supports public scrutiny within Mexico itself.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ill\-treatment of detained persons, whether at time of arrest, during pre\-trial detention, or following conviction, is a systemic issue in many Eastern European countries. For example, detained persons may be coerced into confessing crimes; prisoners can be held in poor conditions and subjected to violence by guards. Murdoch was invited by the Council of Europe and beneficiary governments to help tackle this problem in North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Georgia. Through fact\-finding research, legislative/policy recommendations and practitioner training, Murdoch’s work has underpinned changes to law, policy and practice, including: \(i\) the establishment via legislation of an independent body to safeguard the rights of detainees in North Macedonia; \(ii\) improved understanding amongst the Bulgarian judiciary of human rights standards for detainees; \(iii\) better standards for detainees held in Temporary Detention Isolators in Georgia.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Jim Murdoch is an international human rights expert with an extensive body of work in human rights law. A key focus of his research has been the European Convention for Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. In 2006, following a period of doctrinal research into the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, and the reports and recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \(CPT\), he published an authoritative monograph setting out the legal requirements in relation to human rights\-compliant treatment of sentenced prisoners and those detained pre\-trial **\[O1\]**. At the request of the Council of Europe \(CoE\), Murdoch has also co\-authored \(with Roche, a Council of Europe consultant in policing and human rights\) guidance on human rights compliance for police officers and law enforcement officials **\[O2\]** and \(with Jiřička, Head Psychologist, Czech Republic Prison Service\) similar guidance for prison staff **\[O3\]**. 

 Murdoch’s doctrinal research is complemented by empirical research, undertaken on a country\-by\-country basis, as to why these standards have not been met in the case of that specific country. This research is conducted at the invitation of the CoE, as part of a number of Joint Programmes, beginning with the Joint Programme of the European Union and the CoE into Combating Impunity through the Introduction of Effective Investigations. In 2009, the Joint Programme appointed Murdoch as one of two long\-term experts, a highly\-prestigious appointment. In 2012, Murdoch was awarded the Pro Merito Medal of the CoE—the highest distinction granted to individuals or organisations in recognition of their commitment to the CoE’s values and work. 

 The role of the experts is to research ill\-treatment of prisoners and detained suspects in member states on behalf of the CoE, and to work with governments, policymakers and practitioners to develop country\-specific solutions. The countries which Murdoch has investigated to date are Ukraine, Georgia, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan and Kosovo. 

 When tasked with an investigation by the CoE, Murdoch is provided with a brief setting the parameters of the project. Murdoch conducts research in the state, involving semi\-structured interviews with practitioners \(e.g. Ministers, senior officials, judges, judicial training institutes, lawyers’ associations, NGOs\) and doctrinal analysis of domestic legal models and norms. He produces a final research report setting out his findings as to why the state is failing to comply with human rights standards, which may include problems at the levels of legislation, policy and practice. The report also recommends changes required to address these problems. 

 The work carried out in Ukraine and Georgia formed the basis of a REF impact case study in 2014. The focus of this case study is work carried out in North Macedonia and Bulgaria, as well as a second project undertaken in Georgia since REF2014. The key research findings in each were: 

-  In North Macedonia, complaints of police and prison officer ill\-treatment of detainees were routinely ignored, making the extent and nature of human rights violations difficult to quantify. Murdoch recommended the establishment of an independent body to “police the police”, safeguarding prisoners’ rights and ensuring violations come before the domestic courts, and identified the criteria that the body would need to satisfy to comply with human rights standards. 

-  In Bulgaria, the domestic courts were failing to correctly apply human rights standards when faced with applications by detainees. Murdoch recommended a programme of judicial training to build capacity and foster attitudinal change amongst the judiciary in relation to their understanding and application of appropriate human rights standards. 

-  In Georgia, the treatment of those detained in “Temporary Detention Isolators” did not comply with appropriate human rights standards. Murdoch identified areas of concern and made detailed recommendations to facilitate compliance with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\). 

 Final research reports for these countries have been provided to the CoE **\[O4\]\[O5\]\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Murdoch has worked with the CoE and beneficiary governments to implement the recommendations contained in his research reports on North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Georgia, strengthening the human rights of detainees in these countries. The prison population figures given below are drawn from the  [<ins>CoE Annual Penal Statistics</ins>](http://wp.unil.ch/space/files/2019/06/FinalReportSPACEI2018_190611-1.pdf) as at 11 June 2019. 

 **4.1. North Macedonia: an independent body to safeguard the rights of detainees** 

 Prior to Murdoch’s involvement, there had been a number of adverse rulings against North Macedonia in the European Court of Human Rights on the basis of its failure to effectively investigate allegations of the ill\-treatment of detainees by the police. In June 2015, the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Macedonia asked the CoE for assistance in tackling the problem and this led the CoE to fund a EUR130,000 project:  [<ins>Support to the Establishment of an External Oversight Mechanism in North Macedonia</ins>](https://www.coe.int/en/web/criminal-law-coop/home-fyrom-oversight). 

 It was under the auspices of this project that Murdoch was invited by the CoE, along with two other experts, to carry out doctrinal and empirical research to identify a feasible, human rights compliant solution. The research findings were reported in **\[O4\]**, which recommended the establishment of an independent oversight body to “police the police”. The research identified a human rights compliant model for the proposed “External Oversight Mechanism” \(EOM\) that had the support of the vast majority of respondents \(a two\-tier model involving both the public prosecutor’s office and the ombudsman’s office\). This proposal was implemented in October 2018, when the Macedonian Parliament passed amendments to legislation regulating the office of the Public Prosecutor and to the Criminal Procedure Code \(confirmed by amendments to various laws **\[E1\]**, conclusions from CoE Round Tables **\[E2\]** and an email from the Project Officer **\[E3\]**\). 

 This legislation clarified the obligations on police, prison officers and prosecutors in relation to the human rights of prisoners and provided for the introduction of the new EOM **\[E1\]**. In February 2019, Murdoch participated in three workshops with c.100 high\-level police and prison officials, as well as government representatives, judges from first instance and appellate courts and the Prosecutor’s Office, to deliver guidance on the standards required for human rights compliance and raise awareness of the establishment of the EOM **\[E2\]\[E3\]**. The EOM became operational in 2020 **\[E3\]**. The CoE official who worked closely with Murdoch on this project confirmed, “the valuable role that Professor Jim Murdoch’s research played” in securing this outcome **\[E3\]** and the project was presented as one of the Council of Europe’s Criminal Law Co\-operation Highlights of 2018 **\[E4a\]** and 2019 **\[E4b\]**. 

 The ultimate beneficiaries of the work will be members of Macedonia’s prison population of c.3,000 \(those detained pre\-trial and sentenced prisoners\) who, as a result of Murdoch’s research, should be treated by the police in accordance with human rights standards and will have redress to an independent oversight mechanism if issues of ill\-treatment do arise. 

 **4.2. Bulgaria: improved understanding of human rights standards amongst the judiciary** 

 Prior to Murdoch’s involvement, the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) had held in numerous cases that the conditions of detention in Bulgaria were incompatible with Article 3 of the ECHR \(the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\). In 2015, the ECtHR found that there were systemic problems within the Bulgarian prison system and set a deadline of 18 months within which the government was required to implement measures to address them. This led the CoE to fund a EUR400,000 project to support effective and comprehensive prison reform in Bulgaria in conformity with ECHR standards:  [<ins>Support for the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights judgments and CPT standards and recommendations in Bulgaria</ins>](https://www.coe.int/en/web/criminal-law-coop/prison-reform-bulgaria). One of the objectives of the project was to “enhance the capacity of judges and prosecutors regarding the general prohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment as established in the jurisprudence of the ECtHR” \(confirmed by report **\[E5\]**\). It was in support of this objective that Murdoch undertook the research reported in **\[O5\]**. 

 In 2017, following Murdoch’s recommendations in **\[O5\]**, the Bulgarian government introduced a judicial training programme to enhance awareness of human rights standards and foster a culture of respect for their application in relation to prisoners \(confirmed by letter **\[E6\]**\). Murdoch worked with a Bulgarian judge and lawyer to develop a curriculum for judges at all levels on the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, with a focus on prison conditions, assessment of prisoners’ complaints and awarding compensation **\[E6\]**. In 2018, Murdoch delivered a three\-day training workshop to members of the body responsible for training judges, in addition to 17 judges who sit on the higher\-level courts **\[E6\]\[E7\]**. These officials are, in turn, delivering the training to lower\-level judges, allowing the work to cascade down through the system **\[E6\]\[E7\]**, training the approximately 2,000 judges working in the Bulgarian courts. Feedback from judges who took part in the training has been “very positive” **\[E6\]**. As one of the judges involved stated, “\[it\] helped the audience \[of administrative judges\] gain enough self confidence in understanding and applying the new legal provisions in Bulgarian legislation and respective practice of the ECHR” **\[E6\]**. The project was presented as one of the Council of Europe’s Criminal Law Co\-operation Highlights of 2017 **\[E7\]**. 

 The ultimate beneficiaries of the work will be the c.7,000 members of Bulgaria’s prison population \(both those detained pre\-trial and sentenced prisoners\), who will be better placed to effectively challenge their conditions of detention in the domestic courts \(as cases will be heard by judges who are familiar with relevant human rights standards\). 

 **4.3. Georgia: better standards for detainees held in Temporary Detention Isolators** 

 Murdoch’s work on improving prison standards for sentenced prisoners in Georgia was part of an impact case study submitted to REF2014. Since then, Murdoch has had further impact in Georgia, this time on the treatment of those detained pre\-trial in units known as “Temporary Detention Isolators” \(TDIs\). An assessment by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \(CPT\) in 2014 found a number of areas of concern regarding TDIs, including initial medical examinations, provision of information about rights and general conditions of detention. 

 In 2014, the CoE funded a EUR199,700 project aimed at enhancing human rights protection in TDIs:  [<ins>Capacity Building of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia to Ensure/Enhance Adequate Human Rights Protection in Temporary Detention Isolators</ins>](https://police.ge/en/ministry/structure-and-offices/international-relations-department/donor-coordination/proeqtebis-shesakheb/completed-projects/saqartvelos-shinagan-saqmeta-saministros-shesadzleblobata-gaumdjobeseba-adamianis-uflebebis-satanado-datsvis-uzrunvelkofistvis-droebiti-motavsebis-izolatorebshi-treiningebisa-da-mushaobis-akhali-standartis-danergvis-gzit). A key aim of the project was the development of standard operating procedures for TDI staff based on relevant human rights standards. It was in pursuit of this aim that Murdoch undertook the research reported in **\[O6\]**. This led to new human rights compliant standards being drawn up by the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, procedures which the Ministry explicitly stated were, “developed on the basis of the recommendation provided by James Murdoch” \(confirmed by project summary **\[E8\]**\). Murdoch approved the final draft **\[E9\]**. These were passed by Ministerial Decree in August 2016 and came into force on 1 November 2016 \(confirmed by Order of the Minister of Internal Affairs **\[E10\]**\). They provide various additional protections against ill\-treatment for detainees, including the right to a medical examination prior to detention \(Article 6\), restrictions on measures of immobilisation \(such as handcuffs\) \(Article 14\) and various other rights such as the right to receive information in an understandable language, the right to information about the health of family members and the right to conduct religious rituals \(Article 23\). 

 The ultimate beneficiaries of the work will be the c.12,000 detainees who pass through TDIs annually. There is already some evidence of this ultimate impact. In 2018, the CPT undertook a follow\-up assessment of detention conditions in Georgia **\[E11\]**. Overall, the delegation “received a very positive impression” \(para 21\) and found that standards in relation to medical examinations \(paras 24, 25\), information about rights \(para 26\) and general conditions of detention \(para 28\) had improved since their last visit in 2014.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research \(ICR\) carried out early phase trials of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, as well as early and late phase trials in ovarian and prostate cancer, leading to impact on: 

-  **Patients.** Olaparib improves quality of life and extends periods of remission for patients with homologous recombination repair \(HRR\) gene\-mutated cancer. 

-  **Clinical Policy.** Olaparib is approved for HRR gene\-mutated ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer therapy. 

-  **Pharmaceutical Industry.** In 2020, AstraZeneca reported olaparib \(Lynparza\) sales of over USD1,776,000,000 worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background.** Homologous recombination repair \(HRR\) is a mechanism in cells to repair double\-strand DNA damage. Germline mutations in HRR genes, such as *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, confer increased risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. 

 **First clinical trial of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor.** ICR investigators in the Biological Sciences Unit of Assessment \(UOA5\) expanded the understanding of BRCA1/2 function and provided evidence for the sensitisation to PARP inhibition in *BRCA*\-mutated cells. This work prompted the first phase 1 trial of olaparib led by Professor Johann de Bono \(ICR Team Leader\). This trial, published in 2009, demonstrated that olaparib, a novel, potent, orally active PARP inhibitor, had durable clinical effectiveness in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer patients carrying mutant forms of *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* **\(Ref. 1\)**. The treatment of *BRCA* mutant cancers with a PARP inhibitor was the first demonstration of the use of a synthetic lethality strategy in the clinic. Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of deficiencies in two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in the genes individually does not. 

 In 2012, Professor Stan Kaye \(ICR Team Leader\) led an international and multi\-centre phase 2 study of olaparib in *BRCA*\-mutated ovarian cancer which confirmed the high level activity of this class of drug and established the likely importance of dose, recommending monotherapy with 400mg olaparib twice per day as a suitable dose to explore in further studies **\(Ref. 2\)**. Further trials of olaparib and other PARP inhibitors in ovarian and breast cancer have resulted in various regulatory approvals and patient impact as described in *Section 4*. 

 **DNA\-repair defects in prostate cancer.** Based on the promising therapeutic exploitation of the synthetic lethality between PARP inhibition and *BRCA* mutation combined with emerging data suggesting that HRR defects are common in prostate cancer, Professor de Bono’s team hypothesised clinical benefit from olaparib for a subset of prostate cancer patients. Professor de Bono and Professor Emma Hall led the clinical trial, TOPARP\-A, in which 50 metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(mCRPC\) patients were enrolled and next\-generation sequencing was used to identify mutations in DNA\-repair genes—including *BRCA1/2*, *ATM*, Fanconi’s anemia genes, and *CHEK2*. The results of the trial showed approximately 25% to 30% of all sporadic, castration\-resistant prostate cancers have defects in HRR genes. This suggested that a common subset of metastatic prostate cancers can be molecularly stratified for treatment. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in mCRPC patients who had defects in HRR genes led to a high response rate **\(Ref. 3\)**. In TOPARP\-B, patients with mCRPC were preselected for HRR alterations and treated with olaparib in two dose cohorts. The data from TOPARP\-B confirmed the antitumour activity of olaparib against metastatic prostate cancer with particular HRR gene aberrations, with the highest responses observed in patients with metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer with germline \(inherited\) or somatic \(tumour\) *BRCA1/2* aberrations **\(Ref. 4\)**. 

 Results from the phase 3 PROfound trial, led by Professor de Bono, showed improved progression\-free survival with olaparib in men with mCRPC who have HRR mutations and have progressed on prior treatment. Patients with HRR mutations who received olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who received a control therapy despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib \(19.1 months vs. 14.7 months\) **\(Ref. 5\)**. 

 Alongside this work, Professor de Bono’s team, working as part of the Stand Up to Cancer\-Prostate Cancer Foundation Prostate Dream Team, created a comprehensive map of the genetic mutations within mCRPC. They established a multi\-institutional clinical sequencing infrastructure to conduct prospective whole\-exome and transcriptome sequencing of bone or soft tissue tumor biopsies from a cohort of 150 mCRPC affected individuals. Aberrations of *BRCA2*, *BRCA1*, and *ATM* were observed at substantially higher frequencies \(19% overall\) in metastatic disease compared to those in primary prostate cancers **\(Ref. 6\)**. Thus showing approximately one in five advanced prostate cancer patients could benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **First regulatory approvals of olaparib \(trade name Lynparza\).** The ICR\-led phase 1 and phase 2 trials **\(Ref. 1** and **Ref. 2\)** resulted in further phase 2 trials of olaparib in ovarian cancer. The pivotal trial, Study 19, was performed in high\-grade serous ovarian cancer patients with platinum\-sensitive relapse. This study showed increased progression\-free survival which was even more pronounced in patients with germline/somatic *BRCA1/2* mutation, 11.2 months compared to 4.3 months. These results led to olaparib approval in December 2014 by both the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) and the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of women with *BRCA1*\- or *BRCA2*\-mutant high\-grade serous ovarian cancer, or fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who have had either a complete or partial response to platinum\-based chemotherapy **\[A\]**. In the EMA assessment report of olaparib **\[A\]** both ICR trials described above are presented in the table of 8 supportive clinical studies. The phase 1 trial **\(Ref. 1\)** is one of two phase 1 trials listed, Study 00002, and the phase 2 **\(Ref. 2\)** is one of two “Key Supportive” trials listed as Study 00012. 

 The inclusion of both *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* germline and somatically mutated tumours in the approvals made olaparib the first targeted treatment for an inherited cancer disorder. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) approval of olaparib in this indication followed in January 2016. The Appraisal Committee *“concluded that a drug treatment that improves quality of life and extends periods of remission for patients with BRCA mutation*- *positive ovarian cancer would be highly valued by patients and their families.”* **\[B\]** 

 **Further regulatory approvals.** The phase 3 SOLO\-1 trial demonstrated that ovarian cancer patients treated with olaparib as first\-line maintenance therapy experienced 3 more years of progression\-free survival than those given placebo, a significant benefit not usually seen in oncology trials. *“Women with ovarian cancer are often diagnosed with advanced disease, which unfortunately is associated with poor long\-term survival rates. The newly\-diagnosed setting is our best opportunity to achieve a sustained remission, since once a patient’s ovarian cancer recurs, it is typically incurable. The SOLO\-1 results demonstrate the potential of Lynparza maintenance therapy earlier in the treatment pathway and reinforce the importance of identifying a patient’s BRCA mutation status at the time of diagnosis – these results could change the way we treat women with advanced BRCA\-mutated ovarian cancer*.” **\[C\]** 

 Based on the results of the SOLO\-1 trial, olaparib has been approved in the EU, US, Canada, Japan and Brazil for first\-line maintenance of germline/somatic *BRCA1/2*\-mutated high grade epithelial ovarian cancer **\[D\]**. Olaparib is available on the NHS via the Cancer Drugs Fund as a first\-line maintenance treatment. Each year, approximately 700 women in England with advanced ovarian cancer are expected to benefit from this new treatment option **\[E\]**. Based on the results from the PAOLA\-1 phase 3 trial, olaparib was recommended for approval in EU as first\-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab for HRR\-deficient advanced ovarian cancer in September 2020. 

 As of 2020, olaparib is approved in 78 countries for the treatment of ovarian cancer **\[F\]**. 

 **Impact in prostate cancer.** Based on the results of TOPARP\-A and B **\(Ref. 3** and **Ref. 4\)**, a phase 3 trial of the olaparib in mCRPC, the PROfound study, was initiated. Results from this trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the primary endpoint of radiographic progression\-free survival with olaparib in men with mCRPC who have HRR gene mutation and have progressed on prior treatment \(e.g. enzalutamide and abiraterone\). Further results from the trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the key secondary endpoint of overall survival with olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in men with mCRPC selected for *BRCA1/2* or *ATM* gene mutation **\[G\]**. 

 Based on data from the PROfound study olaparib was approved by the FDA in May 2020 and by the EMA in November 2020 in *BRCA* mutant prostate cancer. Rucaparib, another PARP inhibitor was also approved by the FDA at the same time based on the results from TRITON\-2. The rucaparib approval is an accelerated one, which will require the results to be replicated in a confirmatory trial. Olaparib remains the only PARP inhibitor to have demonstrated it can improve overall survival, versus enzalutamide or abiraterone for men with *BRCA* or *ATM* mutations. 

 Before the prostate cancer approvals, olaparib had already been used to treat more than 30,000 patients worldwide and this will only increase as there were approximately 1,300,000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2018. Approximately 10\-20% of men with advanced prostate cancer will develop mCRPC within five years and HRR gene mutations occur in approximately 20\-30% of patients with mCRPC **\[H\]**. This therefore represents a large amount of patients that could benefit from olaparib treatment. 

 ICR research contributed to the understanding that approximately 20\-30% of mCRPCs have mutations in HRR genes that may make them sensitive to PARP inhibitors **\(Ref. 5** and **Ref. 6\)**. As a consequence of this increased understanding and the importance of these findings, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) 2018 guidelines were updated to recommend consideration of testing mCRPC patients for germline and somatic mutations in DNA\-repair genes \( *BRCA1*, *BRCA2*, *ATM*, *PALB2*, *FANCA*\), and referring patients who have these mutations for genetic counselling. This information can be used to refer mCRPC patients with DNA\-repair gene mutations *“for early use of platinum chemotherapy, or eligibility for clinical trials \(e.g. PARP\-inhibitors\)”* **\[I\]**. 

 **Impact in other cancers.** The first approvals of PARP inhibitors were in ovarian cancer but there has been impact in breast and pancreatic cancers. As of 2020, olaparib is approved in 76 countries for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and in 55 countries, including the US, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer **\[F\]**. 

 **Pharmaceutical industry impact.** Olaparib was initially developed by the British company KuDOS, which was acquired by AstraZeneca in 2006. In 2020, AstraZeneca reported olaparib \(Lynparza\) sales of over USD1,776,000,000 worldwide compared to USD1,198,000,000 in 2019. The growth is in part as a result of regulatory approval for expanded uses in various cancers **\[F\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research undertaken on computational social science analysis of consumer behaviour within the N/LAB of Nottingham University Business School led to a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with OLIO \(the world’s largest food sharing network\). Through a series of multi\-year computational research projects this knowledge exchange relationship has helped to secure the financial performance of the platform and has enhanced practice for supporting poverty alleviation. The research influenced policy and practice, particularly in the Greater London area on food poverty, reaffirming the need for improved food insecurity policy and changing the practical implementation of measurement at local authority level.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prosocial exchange systems are free online services that support peer\-to\-peer resource sharing. In 2014, research led by Harvey **\[1\]** found that many people use these services during times of disruption in their lives such as moving to university, getting divorced, or experiencing bereavement. Following **\[1\]**, Harvey and the research team partnered with a prosocial exchange system, Streetbank, to develop a computational network analysis method for analysing user behaviour at scale **\[2\]**. Results revealed that reciprocity is rare between people using such systems and that most tend to act either as a donor or as a recipient rather than both. This behavioural split is primarily a consequence of socio\-economic differences – those that have resources to share, and those that do not. Research funding from the EPSRC **\[G2, G3\]** significantly contributed to developing research findings and helped to support the development of methods on other transactional datasets. Though previously unquantified, the newly developed research method enabled the team to show that these services are carrying a massive hidden burden of poverty in the UK. 

 As a growing number of people in the UK are experiencing ‘in\-work poverty’ and emergency food assistance in the UK has dramatically increased, the research team led by Harvey, turned attention to prosocial exchange systems and redistributed food. In 2017, Harvey, working with colleagues in the Neo\-Demographic consumer analytics lab at Nottingham University Business School \(N/LAB\), a multi\-disciplinary team of social and computer scientists, partnered with OLIO. OLIO offer an application that helps people share food surpluses and reduce waste. OLIO is the largest application of its kind in the world with over 2,600,000 registered users and since 2016 has facilitated the sharing of millions of portions of surplus food. The hidden poverty burden is especially acute for services such as OLIO, which help redistribute surplus food. Food waste and food insecurity are pernicious problems at the core of two sustainable development goals. Though often studied separately, if either issue is to be solved, there is an urgent need to understand their relation. Harvey, Smith and Goulding therefore further developed the method pioneered in **\[2\]** to conduct a massive social network analysis to examine food sharing behaviour at scale **\[3\]**. The results showed that for OLIO, like other prosocial exchange systems, the majority of users act either as donors or recipients, and this behavioural split is primarily attributable to socio\-economic factors. 

 The behavioural findings spurred an ongoing research relationship between N/LAB and OLIO to further understand what proportion of people who receive food through prosocial exchange systems are experiencing severe food insecurity and are therefore not adequately captured by existing national deprivation measures. Due to the massive size of OLIO’s user base this question required the development of novel computational social science methods combining both network analysis and machine learning techniques. This necessity lead to Harvey and N/LAB partnering with OLIO to successfully apply for an Innovate UK\-funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership in 2019 **\[G1\]**. Through an embedded KTP associate, N/LAB used machine learning on network data to develop a novel approach to model, predict, and visualise food insecurity across the UK **\[4, 5\]**. This is unprecedented for an area of social research that normally relies upon expensive and time\-consuming surveys with small samples. Furthermore, the research approach provides unrivalled insights when compared with standard existing measures such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation, which is only released every few years and does not include a specific measure of food insecurity.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since 2018, Harvey and colleagues from Nottingham University Business School, through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) have collaborated with OLIO to share knowledge surrounding food redistribution, food insecurity and how to best use and understand the data, which OLIO collects from its users **\[G1\]**. OLIO is a mobile and web\-based service that helps people share food surpluses and reduce waste. It is the largest application of its kind in the world. OLIO summarise that they intend to ‘help create a world in which nothing of value goes to waste, and every single person has enough to eat – without destroying our planet in the process’ **\[B\].** 

 OLIO’s registered users generate an enormous amount of data which can be interpreted to understand how and why people redistribute food through the app. This work has informed the way that Olio operates. OLIO state that ‘Harvey and the N/LAB team \[have\] significantly helped OLIO to understand the data we collect from our users and how to best interpret it. Specifically, Harvey’s research on reciprocity helped enable us to understand how people use our app. For example, we discovered that 15% of our users both donated and received food items. The remaining 85% only engaged in one mode of behaviour. This new understanding helped inform strategic decisions regarding the direction of OLIO and contributed to key decisions regarding how to best use data to ensure a viable business model, without negatively affecting our most vulnerable users’ **\[B\].** 

 **Informing OLIO’s strategy to protect vulnerable users** 

 OLIO is still in the early stages of monetisation and is cautious about charging users that may be vulnerable to food insecurity. OLIO is currently developing a freemium model of revenue generation designed so that the application can remain free whilst also offering a core group of users premium features at a cost. The initial market segmentation research produced by N/LAB demonstrated unequivocally that there is a behavioural split between users on the platform who tend to act primarily as donors or recipients. A social network analysis quantified reciprocity on the platform and provided OLIO with behavioural insights of peer\-peer food sharing at scale **\[1, 2, 3\]**. This behavioural segmentation provided the initial managerial insight necessary to recognise that the platform is inadvertently carrying some of the hidden hunger burden in the UK and demonstrated that OLIO’s data had the ability to map and highlight food insecurity. 

 OLIO faces a continual problem of user classification in terms of identifying those users who can act as a source of revenue, and those who are unsuitable to charge given their exposure to food insecurity. Therefore, the company began to examine other sources of revenue, which made use of their valuable data and Harvey’s research, which demonstrated how to best understand and interpret it. To be more specific, food insecurity is hard to identify using traditional demographic approaches as poorer users can be in the same postcode as affluent users, which renders orthodox geo\-demographic techniques inappropriate. 

 In response to the challenge of identifying food insecure OLIO users, Harvey and the research team developed an entirely new method of food insecurity prediction using machine learning on behavioural network data. This work **\[4, 5\],** which summarises firstly, the machine learning approach used and secondly, the development of a first\-of\-its\-kind food insecurity prediction digital map for the UK \(as shown in Figure 1\) is now deployed by OLIO in practice. The approach provides a mechanism to help protect the welfare of vulnerable users. The aggregated anonymised results are now used by OLIO to study food insecurity in real\-time across the UK and offer support to those most at risk. As OLIO’s marketing manager notes: 

 “N/LAB’s machine learning approach to modelling food insecurity has been fundamental to our understanding of the problem and ensuring the social welfare of our users. For example, in the UK alone, as of April 2020, 8% of a sample of 93k transactional users in the UK were identified as food insecure...The research has enhanced our ability to support food insecurity alleviation.” **\[B\]** 

 **Preventing food waste and building relationships with external partners** 

 Furthermore, Harvey’s research **\[3\]** enabled OLIO to better understand user behaviour on the platform and inform a strategy of engaging with ‘external partners such as supermarkets who could share surplus food with our users and therefore prevent food waste. For example, we have now partnered with Tesco across the UK to redistribute directly from stores’ **\[B\]**. 

 Tesco state that this partnership aims ‘to help reduce food waste in stores across the UK’ and that a successful six\-month trial in 2020 at 250 Tesco stores resulted in nearly 195,000 portions of food being saved, nearly 4,200 people being fed and the equivalent of 93,000 meals being saved’ **\[F\]**. Therefore, Harvey’s research helped inform OLIO’s ongoing business strategy and their commercial partnerships which led to a prevention of food waste in 2020. OLIO notes that this provided ‘enormous social and environmental value’ **\[B\]**. 

 **Informing OLIO’s business model and monetisation** 

 According to OLIO, Harvey’s research and the subsequent analysis and understanding of OLIO’s data encouraged the organisation to ‘begin seeking new funding streams to ensure we could keep providing OLIO’s service to vulnerable users without having to charge them’ **\[B\]**. As the Covid\-19 pandemic took hold in 2020, the UK’s food system endured sharp and profound supply and demand shocks. These shocks exacerbated food insecurity as panic buying, social distancing, and furlough schemes all created challenges for the emergency food assistance services. It quickly became apparent that OLIO’s ability to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity across the UK could be of enormous value to policymakers dealing with the economic consequences of the virus. This situation presented an opportunity to develop the food insecurity prediction approach as a commercial data product, and support income generation for the organisation without charging those most at risk. The approach developed by N/LAB was therefore leveraged by OLIO to secure income, develop the service, and support the financial longevity of the organisation. 

 “N/LAB’s research was integral to helping ensure OLIO’s long\-term viability through our recent funding success from Innovate UK’s ‘The Sustainable Innovation Fund: SBRI phase 1’ worth approximately £47,000.” **\[B\]** 

 **Informing policy surrounding food insecurity** 

 In 2020, the machine learning approach to predicting food insecurity caught the attention of policymakers too and OLIO were asked to contribute to food insecurity policy debates by the Mayor of London’s team. OLIO’s CEO participated in a London Assembly policy debate on food insecurity and introduced N/LAB’s approach **\[4,5\]** which is transcribed as follows. 

 “What I have heard you saying is that currently there is not enough data and when there is, it is done by a survey which is a one\-off, it is expensive and it is a single point in time. Perhaps there is some stigma also. …. We recently partnered with Nottingham University and have built a highly predictive model that is able to demonstrate food poverty down at a local ward level over time for the whole of the UK but also specifically for London. We could contribute this data to help solve the measurement challenge … I know the Mayor of London had a survey of about 6,000 people. We have a data set which is over 55,000 people, which is available real\-time and which has none of the expenses of a survey and is based on people’s behaviour rather than what they are putting their hand up and saying … The other point I would say as well is that our data is showing that the correlation between food poverty and overall deprivation is 0.4, so there is some correlation but it is not an exact correlation. That, for me, reinforces the fact that we need specific measures for food poverty, because it is a very unique thing.” 

 OLIO CEO speaking at London Assembly public policy debate on Food Insecurity **\[C\]** 

 The outcome of this policy debate led to firstly, a recognition of the need for distinct food insecurity policy measures from Greater London Authority **\[D\],** because the prevalence of hunger is not properly accounted for through standard deprivation measures such as the *Index of Multiple Deprivation.* Additionally, the debate led to a change in policy direction for London local councils such as Havering Borough **\[E\]** who have now actively partnered with N/LAB and OLIO to implement localised food insecurity prevalence maps which are now being practically used for emergency food assistance intervention planning **\[Figure 1\].** 

 The pandemic demonstrated the fragility of food access for millions of people in the UK and highlighted the urgent need for robust policy of food insecurity measurement at scale. As the Principal Social Policy Analyst at Greater London Authority suggests: 

 “We are highly supportive of N/LAB’s work, as it helps to confirm the policy need for food insecurity measurement in the country and supplements previous work done by the GLA on this issue… We know that there are disadvantages in using survey methods to assess food security, social desirability biases being one, as well as in using proxies like the existing Index of Multiple Deprivation, which is updated only very infrequently, so we welcome innovative methods that use behavioural and/or real\-time data to provide other views of how many Londoners are affected by food insecurity, especially since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.” **\[D\]**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Increasing renewable energy is necessary to meet UK and global carbon emission reduction targets. To connect renewable energy technologies into the energy network, the power capacity of existing electricity infrastructure must increase. University of Manchester research has developed models and methods that have: improved the selection of conductors; developed composite insulators; and improved understanding of the electrical and mechanical performance of conductors. Collectively, this has enabled new overhead line designs to be produced that increase power flow whilst reducing existing noise problems. Specifically: 

-  National Grid estimate knowledge generated has provided cost savings of approximately GBP11,000,000 to the UK energy network, and benefits valued in the millions of GBPs for North American energy transmission system operators; 

-  Design and testing support underpinned a new design \(T\-pylon\) for a GBP214,000,000 overhead line to connect Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station to the National Grid. The reduced visual impact is valued between GBP12,000,000 and GBP39,000,000; 

-  The research has helped solve long\-term noise issues on a Cheshire \(UK\) electricity line, providing immediate noise relief to the community; 

-  National Grid have secured GBP8,100,000 to further research the uprating of overhead lines.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 The High Voltage Laboratory at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) undertakes research into transmission, distribution, expansion and innovation of the UK energy supply network. This is driven by the need for innovation in high voltage transmission overhead line infrastructure, especially in order to meet national scale carbon targets. Funded by industry, the UK Government and the EU, there are three distinct, globally leading areas of research: 

1.  *Polymeric insulators and composite cross\-arms* 

 Between 2004 and 2013, four research projects \(total value GBP890,000\) on ageing of polymeric insulators were funded by National Grid \(two projects\), Scottish and Southern Energy \(SSE\) and UK Power Networks. These projects resulted in seminal work on ageing processes, especially on silicone rubber materials \[1\], and frameworks for management of such assets in service \[2\]. National Grid and SSE funded further projects \(GBP473,000\) on composite cross\-arms \(2010\-2014\). This latter work, on novel insulating overhead line structures, identified opportunities for tower compaction by integrating the tower cross\-arm and insulator functions, and resolving the challenges associated with electric field grading of complex insulator structures \[3\]. This research challenged the existing qualification procedures for insulators being used for structural purposes – proving the capability of the novel, non\-circular insulator cross\-section. This procedure is now patented \(patent WO2011/021006 A2 granted in UK, India, Canada, China, and Brazil\), and detailed monitoring of this insulation has improved confidence in both technology and application. 

1.  *Conductor electromechanical performance* 

 Starting in 2007 within the 4\-year EPSRC/Supergen\-Amperes project, a performance model of overhead line \(OHL\) conductors was developed that provided improved design rules \[4\]. Following this, a knowledge transfer project funded by National Grid \(2011\-2012\) further developed the methodology for calculating conductor electromechanical performance and ageing under operating conditions \[5\]. This then led to a UK Power Networks \(UKPN\) project \(2012\-13\), which considered case studies for increasing UKPN’s OHL corridor power efficiencies and generated knowledge of the implications of different novel conductor technologies \(in particular sag, tension and reliability constraints\). Building on \[4\] and \[5\], research funded by The Centre for Energy Advancement through Technological Innovation \(CEATI, 2017\-18\) on conductor vibrations identified that standard practices are not suitable for novel HTLS conductor technologies. 

1.  *Conductor acoustic performance* 

 National Grid funded the GBP781,000 ‘Acoustic Emissions From Overhead Lines’ project \(October 2009 to February 2014\) *.* A unique experimental facility was developed to directly measure noise from energised conductors. This work produced an evaluation strategy for noise generation from various conductors \[6\], which National Grid used to select optimal conductor designs. As part of the research, field\-modelling techniques over a range of size scales were developed and an understanding of noise generation dynamics was generated from smaller scale measurements and modelling. For the first time, the root cause of low\-frequency noise from a particular type of conductor, found to behave anomalously by National Grid, was established \- the acoustic emission below 1 kHz is determined by the size distribution of surface water droplets.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context of impact 

 The energy sector accounts for GBP86,600,000,000 of UK economic activity with National Grid’s Electricity Transmission \(NGET\) group alone being responsible for over 7,200 km of overhead lines, and turning over GBP3,400,000,000 in 2018/19 \[A\]. Utility networks are historically robust, using traditional technologies to deliver power. As renewable energy is added into the network, capacity must be increased at specific locations. This, combined with growing consumer demand \(through an increasingly electrified lifestyle, such as electric vehicles\) and an ageing network that requires asset management, means these networks must now adapt to be able to continue to provide reliable electricity. 

##  Pathway to impact 

 Since 2004, UoM have been a strategic partner of NGET and this research has directly fed into industry led projects \[A\]. The three distinct research themes combine to benefit the design of overhead lines. The research has optimised holistic overhead line design and utilisation, which is an improvement on the previous approach of optimising individual components. 

 Between 2004 and 2014, NGET funded research \[1\-3\] into ageing of composite insulators in overhead lines. Subsequently, in 2013, Rowland, Cotton and Peesapati were invited to join the team responsible for supporting the design, finite element analysis modelling and type\-approval of the new NGET line designs \[A\]. They therefore directly fed the research into practice. In November 2020, using the lessons from the UoM research, NGET secured GBP8,100,000 of funding from Ofgem’s Network Innovation Competition \(NIC\) to research the uprating of their overhead lines \[B\], with an additional GBP1,100,000 being funded by National Grid \[C\]. 

 Similarly, the EPSRC Supergen Amperes project \(2007\-2010 \[4\]\) and subsequently the EPSRC Supergen Top and Tail Project \(2011\-2014\) brought UoM together with multiple utility companies. Following the end of the Amperes project, Kopsidas continued to work with NGET and UKPN through a Knowledge Transfer Account project on real network constraint issues \[5\]. This knowledge has also been transferred into practice internationally through FP7 activity and work funded by the Canadian consultancy, CEATI \[D\]. 

 In 2014, NGET successfully trialled the acoustic modelling solutions \[5\] on a problem line in Cheshire, proving the viability of the UoM research \[6\]. Ofgem Network Innovation Allowance \(NIA\) funding \(GBP875,000\) was obtained to replace the existing \(noisy\) conductor and prove the technical modelling \[A\]. 

##  Reach and significance 

###  i\) Environmental benefits from novel designs 

 UoM work on composite insulator reliability \[1,2\] and its application \[3\] enabled NGET to accept wide\-bodied silicone insulators onto its lines as a standard product. Type\-approval regimes and design capabilities developed by UoM enabled the novel T\-Pylon design, shown in Figure 1 \[A\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. The new design has reduced the environmental impact of the line, and will enable the connection of the new GBP20,000,000,000 Hinkley Point C Power Station, with reduced impact on the community and environment. This connection is a key part of the government’s plan to reduce carbon emissions and will help deliver power to six million homes \[E\]. An NGET commissioned ‘willingness\-to\-pay study’ shows the benefit provided by the T\-pylons is valued at between GBP12,000,000 and GBP39,000,000 \[F\]. \[Text removed for publication\].

 The UoM work on composite cross arms \[3\] directly led to NGET’s programme of tower upgrading, using retro\-insulated cross\-arms. NGET have committed to a GBP9,000,000 research programme \(commencing early 2021\) to develop an innovative method for uprating overhead lines, allowing the voltage on 275 kV overhead lines to be increased to 400 kV \[C\]. NGET predict “ *uprating lines in this way could allow 45% more power to be carried on some existing routes and support significant reductions in UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions – 39,000 tonnes. This could deliver up to GBP286,000,000 of efficiencies to consumers*…” \[C\]. 

 NGET have used the framework developed in \[6\] \[Text removed for publication\]…and resulted in the Award for the Built Environment Category in the 2015 IET innovation awards \[G\].

 In 2019, Balfour Beatty was awarded the GBP214,000,000 contract to deliver the new T\-pylon overhead line at Hinkley Point \[H\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

###  iii\) Informing investment decisions 

 Low\-noise conductor designs can be up to five times more expensive than standard conductor designs. However, the UoM research \[6\] demonstrated that the selection of these conductors significantly reduces the risk of adverse audible noise impacts in noise sensitive locations. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 3M also acknowledge the value of the UoM research measurements. Following the trials conducted as part of the NGET funded research \[6\], NGET selected the 3M ACCR \(Aluminium Conductor Composite Reinforced\) composite overhead conductor because it was quieter than comparable conductors. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

###  iv\) Contributing to professional development and expertise in the UK National Grid 

 Since 2017, NGET have used UoM research \[1\-6\], and the expertise of Cotton and Kopsidas \[text removed for publication\]. Cotton is part of the Technical Advisory Board for the project \[A\]. 

 To date, NGET have recruited 8 UoM PhD graduates from the high voltage laboratory team following the research projects described above. Since 2014, UoM have also trained 31 existing NGET employees through the Electrical Power Systems Engineering MSc. \[Text removed for publication\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Excess dietary sodium is a major public health problem worldwide. In 2013 Professor **George** showed for the first time that long\-term consumption of sodium\-containing effervescent, soluble and dispersible medications caused significant increases in cardiovascular events and incident hypertension. These findings were adopted by the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency. The labelling, Summary of Product Characteristics and patient leaflets of such medications manufactured, sold or consumed in Europe must now warn consumers of the associated risk and state their sodium content. Subsequent analysis has shown prescribing of these medications to have reduced significantly since 2013. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The causal link between sodium intake and cardiovascular risk is well established. By the early 2000s, considerable efforts were being made to reduce population salt intake via the diet. **George**, however, recognised that a significant sodium load can be ingested via certain medications such as effervescent, dispersible and soluble formulations. The recommended sodium intake for an adult in the UK is 2.4 g per day \(104 mmol\). However, dispersible and effervescent formulations of paracetamol \(500 mg\) can contain as much as 18.6 mmol and 16.9 mmol of sodium per tablet respectively; the maximum daily dose of eight tablets therefore results in the ingestion of 148 mmol and 135 mmol of sodium respectively **\[R1\]**. This, when added to a typical Western diet, could result in very high sodium intake; however, before **George**’s work there was no requirement to highlight it with a warning in labelling or prescribing advice. 

 Irrespective of the associated anion, sodium loading is detrimental in terms of circulating volume expansion, potentially leading to hypertension and other downstream cardiovascular events, particularly stroke and myocardial infarction. The major impact of sodium ingestion on hypertension results from increased Na<sup>\+</sup> re\-absorption in the renal tubules via Na<sup>\+</sup>\-water exchange; diuresis is therefore the cornerstone of hypertension management in salt\-sensitive patients. Sodium loading of healthy individuals impairs vascular endothelial function, left ventricular relaxation and cardiac repolarisation. Some of these effects may be independent of blood pressure in hypertensive patients. 

 In 2013, **George** and colleagues published a nested case\-control study in a validated general practice database of 1.29 million UK residents **\[R2\]**. Cases \(n = 61,072\) who received at least two prescriptions of a sodium\-containing effervescent, soluble or dispersible medication between January 1987 and December 2010 were compared with an equal number of well\-matched controls prescribed medications containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredients in non\-effervescent/soluble/dispersible form. The mean follow\-up time was 7.23 years. The median sodium consumption from sodium\-containing medications alone in the study was 2.5 g/day, exceeding the current recommended sodium daily intake of 2.4 g/day **\[R3\]**. 

 The study identified a seven\-fold increase in the risk of developing hypertension \(odds ratio 7.18; 95% confidence interval 6.74 to 7.65\), a 16% increase in a composite primary endpoint of incident non\-fatal myocardial infarction, non\-fatal stroke or vascular death, a 22% increase in risk of incident stroke and a 28% increase in all\-cause mortality **\[R2\]**. The key difference between the cases and controls was their sodium intake via effervescent, soluble and dispersible medications. 

 A test for linear trends identified a significant trend in the dose\-response relationship. When a propensity analysis was performed to account for prescription bias the propensity scores for cases and controls were very similar \(0.93 vs 0.92\). 

 This study suggested that physicians should prescribe sodium\-containing formulations with caution and avoid administering them to patients at risk of hypertension. Furthermore, patients prescribed these formulations should be carefully monitored for the emergence of hypertension.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Before 2013 the risks of long\-term consumption of sodium\-containing effervescent, soluble and dispersible medications had not been characterised and manufacturers were not required to highlight the sodium content of prescription or over\-the\-counter medications. **George**’s work **\[R2\]** therefore highlighted an important but overlooked source of ingested sodium. Subsequently, information campaigns, regulatory action and lobbying ensured proper labelling of sodium\-containing formulations to help prescribing professionals and consumers of over\-the\-counter products make informed decisions when choosing which products to use. 

 **Changes in prescribing as a direct result of George’s work** 

 Analysis of prescribing trends using The Health Improvement Network \(THIN\) and Prescription Cost Analysis databases indicated that **George**’s publication **\[R2\]** influenced prescribing practices for sodium\-containing medications in the UK **\[E1\]**. Interrupted time series analysis of THIN data showed that the monthly prescribing rate of sodium\-containing formulations was stable between 2009 and 2013; however, following publication of \[ **R2\]** the slope reduced significantly by 0.26 per month \(95% confidence interval \-0.45 to \-0.07; p=0.009\). The slope for non\-sodium standard formulations did not change. 

 **Regulatory and labelling changes** 

 **George**’s work triggered action on salt in effervescent medications at both UK and EU level; according to the Director of Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines, MHRA **\[E2\]**: 

 The paper was evaluated and discussed at several of the Agency’s Commission on Human Medicines \(CHM\) Expert Advisory Groups \(EAGs\) in 2013/2014…There was agreement that the labelling of sodium in product information at the time of the paper, did not provide meaningful information to guide clinicians, pharmacists or patients and help them choose appropriate medicines in terms of sodium content. 

 All Expert Groups advised that the high levels of sodium in some medicines, particularly those that dissolve, should be highlighted in the product information of all medicines containing different levels of total sodium. 

 The UK presented the issue and its expert advice to several European bodies in 2014/2015 including the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee \(PRAC\), the Excipients Drafting Group \(ExcpDG\), the European Medicines Agency’s Paediatric Committee \(EMA’s PDCO\) and the Co\-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures \(CMDh\). 

 **George**’s results were also highlighted in a report presented to the UK Parliament in 2015 by the Commission on Human Medicines and the British Pharmacopoeia Commission **\[E3\]**. 

 Responding to **George**’s findings, the EMA commissioned a Europe\-wide signal detection programme to assess the impact of sodium\-containing medications on cardiovascular health. In 2015 the PRAC published new guidance for sodium labelling and recommended an update to the EMA Excipient Guidelines **\[E4, E5\]**. 

 In October 2017 the European Commission updated its Excipient Guideline to require all Marketing Authorisation Holders to submit Variation Documentation within 12 months. The labelling of medicines manufactured, sold or consumed in Europe now features warnings about the effects of sodium loading with prolonged use. For medications exceeding 17 mmol/tablet the Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet must both state how much sodium they contain. 

 **Impacts on professionals – doctors, prescribers, pharmacists and dispensers** 

 **George**’s work and the consequent change in labelling regulations have triggered changes in prescribing advice which have been promulgated internationally via websites aimed at prescribing professionals \(e.g. \[ **E6\]**\) and influenced recent updates to NICE Guidance; for example, the August 2020 update to NICE guidance on “Analgesia \- mild\-to\-moderate pain” **\[E7\]** contains a scenario on paracetamol which advises: 

 Avoid effervescent preparations of paracetamol where possible, particularly in people with hypertension, heart failure, and renal failure — if oral paracetamol is required in a person with swallowing difficulty, use paracetamol suspension in place of effervescent preparations \(which contains up to 6 g salt in a 4 g per 24 hours dose\). 

 \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Impacts on consumers/patients** 

 Educating clinicians about the risks of consuming high\-salt containing medications helps to protect patients receiving them by prescription; however, many over\-the\-counter effervescent medications also contain high salt concentrations. Package labelling and inserts must now provide consumers of over\-the\-counter products with the information they need in order to make an informed decision about their use \(e.g. **\[E9\]**\). 

 **Influence on the wider debate on dietary sodium intake** 

 In 2014 **George** was invited to join Consensus Action on Salt and Health \(CASH, now called Action on Salt **\[E10\]**\). This group of 25 internationally recognised scientific experts has persuaded the Department of Health \(England\) to mandate a further 10% reduction in salt thresholds from its 2012 targets with the aim of saving 6000 lives each year. 

 The Director of Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines at the MHRA confirms that **George**’s study “raised an important potential public health issue” **\[E2\]**. European Medicines Labelling Legislation changed as a result, thus reducing the prescribing of potentially harmful high\-sodium medications, ensuring the provision of better information to consumers of over\-the\-counter medications and contributing to efforts to reduce dietary sodium intake worldwide.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A consequence of research by the AAD Cities Research Group at London Met is a paradigm shift in how policymakers, urban developers and design practitioners in Brussels understand industry and the importance of integrating it into the urban fabric. In Brussels, the research made visible the opportunities for use\-mix and intensification; raised awareness of the industrial economy and its challenges; provided public and private actors with strategies to make space for industrial activities; and facilitated the development of new approaches to integrating industrial accommodation within the city. It also provided methodological support to research and design projects by Architecture Workroom Brussels; helped to shape the strategic vision of Brussels state developer Citydev, who have subsequently developed 25 sites for industrial use, \(retaining 1250 industrial jobs in Brussels\); and informed the design of some of the most complex urban development sites in Brussels.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Retaining and intensifying industry in contemporary cities is an important priority for sustainable growth. The definition of industry includes: manufacturing, storage and distribution, waste management and recycling, wholesale markets. Industrial activity meets the expanding just\-in\-time needs of cities, without excessive trip generation and associated carbon emissions. Industry is an important component of a diversified economy that offers employment opportunities to suit all; is resilient to economic, technological or social shocks; and creates entrepreneurial endeavour generating enterprise valuable for the wider economy. However, prior to Brearley and Clossick’s involvement, industrial uses in Brussels were frequently undervalued and brushed aside by policymakers, including the Belgian Secretary of State for Urbanism, who in 2013 publicly stated that the recycling centre and concrete factories in the north of Brussels should be replaced with offices and parks. 

 Since 2013, design\-based research by Brearley and Clossick has explored how to reveal and promote the integration of industrial activities in European cities. A substantial part of the work has focused on industrial areas in Brussels, asking if and under which conditions \(physical, economic, social and political\) industrial uses can be intensified through the introduction of innovative types of industrial accommodation; and how the political and cultural attitude towards industry in the city can be shifted. Brussels has a number of industrial sites threatened by redevelopment for other, higher\-value uses, including Buda, Vilvoorde and Molenbeek. Brearley and Clossick engaged with these localities and with local, regional and national stakeholders, as well as with an extensive team of collaborators from AAD Cities and beyond \(R1, R2\), through **four concurrent action research** **strands.** 

 <ins> **Surveying and mapping**</ins> to reveal the geography of the industrial economy, past and present. A key innovation of this work was the adoption of an original ‘industrial audit’ methodology refined in London \(R1\), based on the collection of architectural, qualitative and quantitative data, and disseminated through graphic displays in publications and exhibitions \(R3\). In Brussels, Brearley and Clossick ran workshops with Departement Omgeving in collaboration with Architecture Workroom Brussels \(AWB\) for the *A Good City Has Industry* project \(R2, R4\). The major insight was that by differentiating nuanced industrial/economic activities and making them visible to stakeholders, then policymakers, communities and designers can appreciate their civic and economic value. 

 <ins> **Envisioning**</ins> future scenarios for these localities through research by design: AAD Cities, led by Brearley and Clossick, delivered 18 five\-day participatory workshops over five years as part of the Flemish Government’s TOP Noordrand initiative involving architects and planners \(R1, S9\). The briefs for the participants were formulated with stakeholders including AWB and Departement Omgeving. A key insight was that the intensification of industrial areas is achievable in economic, architectural and urban terms \(R2\) but that the value of such development is not necessarily apparent to property owners, developers and policymakers without showing them alternative scenarios through design. 

 <ins> **E</ins><ins>ngendering collaboration**</ins> between the agencies involved, especially cross\-border between Brussels and Flanders. The introduction of new types of development requires public agencies to work in collaboration with each other and with property owners, developers, and businesses. Through his 2019 BSI\-citydev.brussels Chair, Brearley facilitated two research by design workshops with Citydev, and delivered three university lectures and one inter\-university lecture \(R5\). A key insight was that to collaborate, public agencies need to meet on neutral territory, such as the one afforded by the endeavour of *A Good City Has Industry* \(R2\), and be brought together by an external party with respected expertise, but without a political or geographic bias. 

 <ins> **Advocating**</ins> the ideas generated through surveying, mapping and envisioning to accelerate the retention and revalidation of industry in Brussels. The team focused on dissemination and persuasion through design research workshops; a video produced with AWB \(R4\); multiple meetings with stakeholders; a public lecture \(R5\); 30 further public talks in Brussels, Rotterdam and across Europe \(including Berlin, Amsterdam, Moscow, Vienna, London\) \(R1\). A key insight was that multiple modes of engagement work for advocacy: talks, exhibitions, publications. In particular, ‘walking and talking’ is an effective means of communication of the value of industrial activities. The key condition for its effectiveness is the neutrality of Brearley, Clossick and the AAD Cities team as outsiders. 

 This research has developed through a co\-productive, design\-based, and action\-oriented methodology, and crucially, through the engagement of key stakeholders at all stages of the research—including policy makers, urban developers and design professionals from Brussels, Flanders and beyond. As a result, Brearley and Clossick’s work has reached and benefitted a wide audience.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Across Europe, economic and urban trends underline the need to reaffirm the place of industry in our urban areas. In Brussels and Flanders, the research has demonstrated that industrial activities are an important part of contemporary urban life, and has contributed to creating a paradigm shift in how policymakers, urban developers and design practitioners understand industry and the importance of integrating it into the urban fabric; resulting in: accelerating new approaches to urban planning and real estate development; transferring methodologies for research and development and encouraging experimentation in urban and architectural design. 

 **1\) Accelerating new approaches to urban planning and real estate development.** Engagement with the research accelerated public agencies and urban developers in Brussels and Flanders towards changing their programmes and strategies. Brearley and Clossick’s extensive participation in debates as politically neutral outsiders—framing justifications, documenting industrial sites, and exploring design scenarios for their future transformation—helped public entities such as the **Brussels Bouwmeester** \(the chief architect’s office\) to “raise awareness that a good city has industry \(...\), that industry belongs to the city” \(S1\). Kristiaan Borret, chief architect, said the work was particularly helpful in making the issue visible to policymakers, planners and designers, for instance through the IABR architecture biennale held in Rotterdam in 2016, so as to gain support towards the development of real projects \(S1, S2 pp.5\-6\) **.** An opinion echoed by **Architecture Workroom Brussels** \( **AWB\)**, who said that the *Atelier Brussels: The Productive Metropolis* \(where Brearley was *Atelier Meister*\) “accelerated the urban policy conviction that keeping economic activities within the urban fabric is a crucial component of preparing cities for a sustainable future” \(S5\), and has put Brussels at the forefront of thinking in Europe about how to approach the industrial economy: “Brussels has now taken a leading position in innovation, in urban planning and development ... research contributed to accelerating the changes and putting these ideas on the agenda of the right stakeholders” \(S5\). In Flanders, Brearley and Clossick’s contribution helped the regional planning office **Departement Omgeving** “to show local authorities why and how to integrate the productive economy in the city” and to encourage policymakers to support regeneration plans that make space for industrial accommodation \(S3\). In these cases, the research has strongly contributed to making the ‘productive city’ a central concern in the urban policy, planning and architecture discourses of Brussels and Flanders. 

 This contribution led to two consequences: \(a\) in 2017, informed by his conversations with Brearley and his exposure to the Productive Metropolis workshop series in 2014\-2016, Borret launched the first in a series of design competitions celebrating the integration of productive activities in Brussels \(S1\). As a result, the approach to urban design in the north of the city, particularly around the Port of Brussels region, has shifted away from relocating industrial activities outside the city, towards retaining them. This includes for example, the Material Village \(which won the Steel Construction Awards 2018 in the category 'industrial buildings' and featured on the cover of Architectural Review\) which was developed by Citydev and occupied by MPRO—a material/logistics hub which supplies the Brussels construction industry \(S5 and S8\). A consequence of this has been retention of at least an additional 1250 jobs within the city borders rather than being lost or re\-distributed \(S5, S2\). \(b\) Following Brearley’s efforts as the BSI\-citydev.brussels Chair in 2019, **Citydev**, public development agency and landowner, have shifted their attitude, recognising that hybrid developments mixing industry and other activities are desirable. They have taken 25 such projects forward since 2013 \(S2\); and have initiated a collaboration with the Port of Brussels to facilitate the development of integrated logistics and manufacturing at scale. “The accumulation of theoretical exercises can fuel real projects'', explained Benjamin Cadranel, CEO of Citydev. “We are about to launch Phase Two of Greenbizz, which is in \[the Port\], \[with the\] ideas that were developed in the workshops \[with Brearley\]” \(S4\). 

 **2\) Transferring methodologies for Research and Development.** The capacity of public agencies and urban developers to understand and articulate the need for industrial accommodation in urban areas has been increased by the adoption of research methodologies based on the work of Brearley and Clossick. Stakeholders mentioned two methods above others: the innovative ‘audit’ method \(R1, S9\) developed to study the relationship between industrial activities and urban space—adopted in Brussels by collaborators \(Citydev, Departement Omgeving and Architecture Workroom Brussels\), which revealed remarkable economic and civic diversity; and the use of ‘walking and talking’ as a method of enquiry. In Brussels, over the period 2013–2020, these methodologies have been widely adopted both by the investigative unit **AWB** \(S5\) and public agency **Departement Omgeving** \(S3\), in particular following their collaboration with Brearley in the Atelier Productive Metropolis and the Flemish Government’s TOP Noordrand initiatives respectively. These agencies have successfully utilised both the audit methodology and the walking and talking approach to persuade decision\-makers of the value of understanding the city through an industrial lens, and of the potential of promoting urban developments that accommodate industrial activities rather than pushing them to the outskirts of cities or beyond. 

 Such engagement has relied on Brearley and Clossick’s position as outsiders who can present challenging concepts apolitically, as Roeland Dudal, AWB, noted: “\[Brearley\] sometimes has provocative ideas, which he presents in such a way as you feel immediately comfortable with them, because they come from his interest and from a conversation with those concerned. It's not: ‘I know everything and you must listen to me’, it is: ‘I'm listening, but why didn't you imagine *this*?’ \[This\] has had a huge influence on the way people work together” \(S5\). Jan Zaman, Departement Omgeving, explained: “The connection between the research methods and the capacity to persuade \[stakeholders\] has been another important learning point from our collaboration”. \(S3\). Dudal spoke specifically about the impact of the audit methodology: “The mapping that was tested in Old Kent Road \[in London\] has been imported by AWB” and Departement Omgeving. It “is a tool of urban economic policy: what kind of economic activities are happening where, a more fine\-grained reading of urban activities… where a lot of the urban economic activities are taking place within the urban fabric, but outside the traditional zoning for industrial activities” \(S5\). 

 **3\) Encouraging experimentation in urban and architectural design.** An important question for urban developers working toward the inclusion of industrial activities in Brussels and Flemish cities is how to enable the successful coexistence of productive uses with residential and commercial ones in practice. Brearley and Clossick’s investigation of the history and present conditions of industrial sites in Belgium, together with a deep understanding of industrial processes and economies, have encouraged landowners and developers to experiment with designing and building innovative structures. In detail: \(a\) in the Buda area, after a study visit to London hosted by Brearley and Clossick in 2015, the **Van Assche family** redeveloped their ex\-industrial building into an innovative co\-working, industrial and workshop space ‘Firma’. The site would otherwise have been redeveloped as residential and the industrial workspace would have been lost \(S6, S7\). Fifty small businesses can rent desk space and industrial space in a unique facility in that region of Brussels. The start\-up cost for these small businesses is reduced as a result of this innovative approach to redeveloping the space; \(c\) following Brearley, Clossick and collaborators’ mapping of relevant stakeholders and sites in the Brussels region, and supported by their advocacy efforts, the **Brussels Bouwmeester** has persuaded landowners and developers to realise mixed residential/industrial schemes that included either industry or logistics at the ground floor \(S1\); \(c\) in 2020, **Citydev** is proceeding with five ambitious mixed industrial and residential developments in the Molenbeek and Anderlecht areas, the first two of which, NovaCity and CityCampus, are under construction \(S4\). As Zaman explained, as a result of changing economic and environmental priorities, methodologies such as those created by Brearley and Clossick, are enabling policymakers to envision sustainability programmes such as Flanders’ aim of ‘zero net land take’ by 2040 including a stop to greenfield developments \(S3\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) has focussed on effluent behaviour at the Sellafield nuclear site, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear facilities in the world. This research has been undertaken by UoM academics \(Morris/Shaw/Lloyd\), PDRAs \(Smith/Foster/Neill\) and PhDs \(Weatherill 2013\-16; Konovalovaitė 2013–17; Lopez 2015\-18; Winstanley 2016\-19; Neill 2015\-18; Foster 2015\-18\), alongside industrial partners working within the Sellafield Effluent Centre of Expertise \(ECoE\). The ECoE is an ongoing research collaboration between the University of Manchester, Sellafield Ltd. and the National Nuclear Laboratory \(NNL\) since 2012. 

##  Research problem 

 At Sellafield, radioactive effluents arise both from fuel reprocessing, and the management of legacy ponds and silos, which are a range of older facilities containing highly radioactive “sludge”. The UK Government’s Office for Nuclear Regulation \(ONR\) have instructed the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the organisation responsible for operating Sellafield, to prioritise reducing these risks. The optimal management and treatment of the ponds, silos, and reprocessing effluents is crucial to both reduce the hazard, and protect the environment. The legacy ponds and silos are the highest hazards at Sellafield: their safe decommissioning is a programme of the utmost national and international importance. 

##  Research programme 

 Since 2013, to address these challenges, a UoM programme of research has covered three areas: 

1.  *Iron oxide flocculation and radionuclide removal during reprocessing effluent treatment* \[1,2\]: The Sellafield Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant \(EARP\) treats acidic, iron containing radioactive effluents from nuclear fuel reprocessing. As Sellafield moves from reprocessing activities to decommissioning \(2019 onwards\), EARP will need to treat various effluents, including new clean\-out effluents with different chemical compositions than previously treated effluents. The EARP process neutralises the acidic, radioactive effluents to form an iron floc that scavenges the radionuclides from solution. The treated aqueous effluent is then safely discharged to the environment under authorisation. UoM research into the EARP floc formation pathway identified that previously undiscovered Fe<sub>13</sub> Keggin moieties were present under very acidic conditions \(pH <0.15\) \[1\]. Counter to classic nucleation and growth models, as the pH was increased, the Keggin clusters aggregated to form the iron floc particles \[1\]. Further research provided detailed insight into the mechanisms of uranium, plutonium and thorium adsorption/removal on the ferrihydrite floc \[e.g. 2\]. 

1.  *Colloid stability and radionuclide behaviour in spent fuel pond effluents* \[3,4\]: The effluent from the Sellafield Legacy Ponds and Silos \(SLPS\) nuclear fuel ponds is radioactive and treated at Sellafield in the Site Ion Exchange Plant \(SIXEP\) before authorised discharge to the environment. Effective effluent treatment reduces the high hazard of these facilities by supporting essential operations to empty and decommission the ponds and further leads to reduced radionuclide discharges to the environment. UoM research \[3, 4\] provided fundamental understanding of uranium colloid stability and speciation in conditions directly relevant to the Sellafield nuclear fuel ponds. 

1.  *Biomass characterisation and control strategies in spent nuclear fuel ponds* \[5,6\]: In order to decommission the SLPS facility, nuclear materials must be removed from the legacy ponds and treated in additional facilities. Within the ponds, microbial biomass growth can reduce pond visibility, which in turn affects the transfer of nuclear material through the facility. For the first time, the UoM research \[5, 6\] provided detailed information on the microbial ecology of these ponds before, during and after bloom periods, and identified that photosynthetic microorganisms were responsible for the loss in visibility during blooms. Identifying the causative organisms of these blooms is vital to underpin biomass control strategies at Sellafield.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 The Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria \(UK\) has been operating since the 1940s. It is at the heart of the UK’s nuclear fuel cycle, and activities at the site are now moving towards the safe packaging and storage of higher\-activity radioactive wastes and the clean\-up and decommissioning of the site. The Sellafield complex accounts for approximately 76% of the UK’s decommissioning legacy, and as of 2019, the estimated cost for decommissioning the site was at least GBP94,000,000,000 with a timeframe of over 120 years \[A\]. 

 During ongoing site operations and decommissioning, two types of radioactive effluents are generated. Firstly, acidic radioactive effluents from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, and the subsequent clean\-up of legacy reprocessing facilities are treated in the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant \(EARP\). Secondly, neutral to alkaline radioactive effluents from the Sellafield Legacy Ponds and Silos \(SLPS\) are treated in the Site Ion Exchange Plant \(SIXEP\). The SLPS are the highest nuclear risks and hazards at Sellafield and removing the radioactive material to reduce those risks therefore carries a level of urgency \[B\]. 

##  Pathways to impact 

 Formed in 2012, the Effluent Centre of Expertise \(ECoE\) is a collaboration between UoM, Sellafield Ltd. and the NNL. The aim of ECoE is to “ *provide fundamental understanding of the underlying processes impacting on effluent management…. which in turn provides direct cost savings and risk reduction and therefore increases stakeholder confidence in operational activities*” \[C\].  Regular \(bi\-annual\) technical meetings are held between the ECoE partners to discuss key results as they are identified, with subsequent publication of the research in papers and PhD theses. State\-of\-the art research methodologies \(Transmission Electron Microscopy, preparation methods and microbial ecology characterisation\) have been transferred directly into industry via the ECoE \[D\]\[E\]. 

 These results have *“already been applied to optimise operations in EARP and ponds and silos*” \[C\].  Whilst UoM has several long\-standing research collaborations with stakeholders at Sellafield, the impacts described below stem from the fundamental research conducted in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences \[1\-6\], and partly build upon research conducted in the Department of Chemistry at UoM which is discussed in an impact case submitted to UOA 8. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

 In summary, research within the ECoE \[1\-6\] enabled Sellafield to significantly reduce radioactive discharges to the environment from the site \[D\]\[F\]. Improved understanding of the chemical and microbial processes within these effluent treatment facilities has allowed Sellafield to optimise plant performance thus enabling high hazard reduction \[D, F\], and to predict the performance of EARP and SIXEP with greater confidence. Sellafield have estimated savings of over GBP24,900,000 as a result of the operational changes underpinned by the ECoE research \[D\]\[E\]\[F\]. Key highlights are given here: 

###  \(i\) Iron Oxide formation and radionuclide removal in EARP: reduction in environmental discharge 

 UoM research on iron oxide floc formation pathways \[1\] was discussed with NNL and Sellafield in 2013/14 \(prior to publication\). This discussion highlighted that effluent streams in EARP with higher initial pH values, may be less effective at removing radionuclides from effluents than previously thought. As a result, Sellafield changed the acid dosing of EARP effluents, specifically increasing the level of acidity in the effluent prior to neutralisation in order to enhance Fe<sub>13</sub> Keggin formation and radionuclide sorption \[F\]. This change significantly reduced the “ *alpha radioactivity environmental discharges from this effluent treatment facility to the Irish Sea”* \[F\]. Specifically, in high challenge liquor batches there has been a “ *reduction in alpha activity discharge to the sea \[by\] 90%*” \[F\]. In the case of <sup>241</sup>Am, this reduction due to acid dosing changes also has regulatory significance as it *“forms part of Sellafield’s demonstration of applying BAT \(Best Available Techniques\) within the Environmental Permit which forms part of \[Sellafield’s\] legal consent to operate.”* \[F\]. 

 Additional research on radionuclide removal within EARP \[2\] provided detailed understanding of the retention mechanisms of key radionuclides on plant. These results directly informed predictive models for radionuclide behaviour, including plutonium, in the EARP system “ *that will be used to plan future operations and to ensure radioactivity is abated*” \[F\]. Sellafield confirmed this research has “ *significantly improved effluent treatment processes in EARP… assisting the decommissioning process, overall leading to reduction in discharge and assisting in the clean\-up of Sellafield site. These improvements support the optimisation of site decommissioning, which is a multi\-billion pound project…These improvements would not have been possible without the research*” \[F\]. 

###  \(ii\) Uranium colloid stability: improved management of spent nuclear fuel pond decommissioning 

 During decommissioning of the SLPS, removing highly radioactive sludge reduces the hazard in the ponds, a top priority decommissioning need. During pond retrievals, “settling” must occur to separate liquids from the highly radioactive solids. The associated radioactive liquors are then treated within SIXEP. Previously, these liquors were collected in an effluent collection vessel \(ECV\) where the radioactivity in the liquors was increasing with each retrieval. The uranium colloid stability research \[3, 4\] was discussed within the ECoE during 2015/16 \(prior to publication\). Underpinned by this new understanding of dynamic colloid behaviour \[3, 4\], in 2017, Sellafield adopted new protocols for plant operations and pond effluents management, and have confirmed *“without the University of Manchester research this new fundamental understanding would not have been developed.”* \[D\]. 

 The new protocols include new ECV mixing regimes implemented to reduce the colloid concentrations in the ECV *“which in turn reduced both alpha activity and turbidity in the system by over 95%* \[and\] *total beta activity concentrations by 69%”* \[D\]. This has also reduced the processing time on plant, resulting in estimated cost savings of GBP500,000 over the lifetime of the retrievals programme \[D\].  Reducing colloid concentrations in the ECV has also reduced the level of monitoring and surveillance required on site, leading to estimated cost savings of GBP2,000,000 over the lifetime of the retrievals programme \[D\]. Likewise, increasing the rate of waste retrievals has reduced batch processing times, resulting in further estimated cost savings of GBP10,000,000 over SIXEP’s operational lifetime \[D\]. 

 The results in \[3, 4\] also directly informed decisions to reconfigure the effluent discharge route. This has sustained in\-pond visibility at a level that enables retrievals from the SLPS to continue, resulting in a further operational cost saving estimated at GBP10,000,000 over the lifetime of the retrievals programme \[D\]. Overall, the research has enabled “ *high hazard reduction; a reduction in the effluent activity challenge; the avoidance of delays to retrievals that would deliver potential cost savings in the order £10M\+* \[more than GBP10,000,000\] *; simplification of effluent treatment; \[and\] improvements to the characterisation of high activity samples*” and is integrated into the Sellafield “Alpha Guidelines Document”, the primary information source on the behaviour of alpha emitting radioactivity in the SLPS \[D\]. 

###  \(iii\) Biomass characterisation: control of microbial bloom events and enabling movement through the Fuel Handling Pond 

 As discussed already, safely removing highly radioactive sludge from the SLPS is essential to reducing the hazard of these facilities. However, microbial blooms in the SLPS can reduce pond visibility, which in turn can severely delay sludge retrievals \[E\]. In 2018, UoM research utilising the DNA analysis pipeline demonstrated in \[5,6\] enabled the predominant photosynthetic species that cause these microbial blooms in the Pile Fuel Storage Pond \(PFSP\), to be identified \[E\]. As a result, an optimal, targeted frequency of the ultrasonic biomass control units in the PFSP could be selected to control the species in the pond enabling Sellafield to implement effective bloom control strategies \[E\]. 

 Sellafield amended these ultrasonic settings in April 2019. After this and for the remainder of 2019, there were 40% more days with sufficient visibility to enable pond retrievals to occur when compared to 2018 \[E\]. Furthermore, retrievals were possible everyday between 1 January 2020 to 15 March 2020 \(74 days\), compared to only 26 days in the same period in 2019 \[E\].  Each day that in\-pond retrieval operations are impacted by an algal bloom is *“estimated to cost the programme in excess of GBP50,000*” \[E\], already representing a cumulative saving of GBP2,400,000. Given the retrievals programme is likely to last 10 years\+ \[B\], the benefit of targeted algal bloom control will run into millions of pounds \[E\]. Additionally, enabling the PFSP decommissioning programme to run on time, increases confidence in the programme of key stakeholders including the site operators \(NDA\), regulators \(ONR and Environment Agency\) and the general public \[E\]. 

 DNA sequencing using the DNA profiling pipeline demonstrated in \[5, 6\] has also been used to characterise several hydraulically connected ponds including the First Generation Magnox Storage Pond \(FGMSP\) and the Fuel Handling Pond \(FHP\). Controlled movement of material between these ponds is necessary to repackage degraded spent fuel materials and thus reduce hazard. These methods and data showed that each pond has a distinct microbial community adapted to live in that facility, despite being hydraulically connected.  Sellafield therefore concluded *“that there were minimal risks of cross contamination \[of biomass\] causing visibility problems*” \[E\]. This negated previous concerns that movement between ponds potentially seeds bloom causing microorganisms, and “ *helped \[Sellafield\]* 

 *with the decision\-making process to allow the transfer of fuel between the two facilities and* 

 *in doing so has allowed the FGMSP high hazard and risk reduction programme to progress*” \[E\]. Permitting the transfer of fuel from the FGMSP to FHP has led to major cost savings \(estimated at greater than GBP10,000,000\) \[E\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Briggs** and her team’s research on the effects of distracted driving has generated impacts relating to policy; practitioner strategy and education; and public attitudes and awareness. This was achieved by the provision of evidence to the Transport Select Committee, leading to their recommendation to change legislation, and by working closely with the National Police Chief’s Council \(NPCC\) to provide evidence\-based education for their national enforcement campaign. The team’s work has been used by road safety charities in lobbying government and documenting a shift in public attitudes to distracted driving. Their findings have also been widely discussed in the popular media. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Briggs** and her team’s research has provided new theoretical and practical explanations for the deteriorated performance of drivers using mobile phones \(both handheld and handsfree\). This highly applied research has important road safety implications as self\-reported phone use by drivers continues to increase \(RAC, 2020\), despite legislation banning handheld use. The number of individuals killed or seriously injured on UK roads is no longer in year\-on\-year decline. In 2019, 1,752 people were killed – an average of 5 per day. 17% of all recorded incidents were attributed to ‘impairment or distraction’, with 67% explained by ‘driver error’. Although the number of deaths directly attributed to handheld phone use was relatively low, handsfree phone use could explain a significant proportion of ‘driver error’ deaths – the largest category being ‘failure to look’. **Briggs**’ research addresses the cognitive roots of distraction, highlighting that current law fails to address the serious safety issue of handsfree phone use by drivers. 

 Research into mobile phone use by drivers has emphatically demonstrated that handsfree conversations are equally distracting as handheld, leading to increased accident risk and decreased hazard detection ability. However, while much of this work explains findings in relation to generalised increases in mental workload, **Briggs** and her team by contrast, provide new theoretical explanations for the specific ways in which phone use affects cognitive and perceptual processing, contributing to ‘failure to look’ accidents. 

 Building on initial work **\[O1, O2\]** that identified the cognitive and perceptual roots of distraction by exploring the impact of stress on performance, the team’s imagery research **\[O3\]** provided the grounding for a new theoretical explanation for deteriorated driving performance. This work involved measuring driver performance during a handsfree phone call and recording the eye movements of participants. Findings demonstrated that phone conversations draw on visual resources that are also required for visual perception of the driving scene. This competition for shared cognitive resources, in shared brain areas, resulted in phone\-using drivers having significantly reduced hazard detection abilities, longer reaction times for critical events, and reduced visual processing of the driving scene. Importantly, eye tracking data allowed **Briggs** to demonstrate that distracted drivers could suffer from ‘inattention blindness’: they *viewed* hazards but did not actually *see* them *,* due to their attention being allocated elsewhere. This research provided a domain specific explanation for deteriorated driving performance of phone\-users rather than explaining findings in terms of generalised cognitive workload. 

 Building on this work, **Briggs** and her team explored how a driver’s expectations of ‘normal’ driving affects how phone\-using drivers apply their attention **\[O4\]**. This research demonstrated how phone\-using drivers cope with over\-stretching their attention by processing only information consistent with ‘normal’ driving whilst filtering out other, unexpected information. This research demonstrated that phone\-using drivers over\-relied on their ‘attentional set’ for normal driving, to the extent that they missed highly salient items in the driving scene. This leads to decreased situational awareness which ultimately contributes to poorer driving performance and increased collision risk.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Briggs**’s research has had three types of impact: \(i\) influencing policy recommendations for change to legislation, \(ii\) practitioner/professional engagement and education, and \(iii\) increased public awareness and understanding. 

 **Influencing policy recommendations for change to legislation** 

 In April 2019, **Briggs** and Hole submitted evidence to the Transport Select Committee’s consultation on road safety, leading to **Briggs**’ invitation, in June 2019, to provide expert evidence to the committee. The subsequent committee report, in August, heavily cited the team’s research and recommendations **\[C1\]**. It supported and endorsed, for the first time, the view that legislation should be changed to also ban handsfree phone use and that education and public awareness are critical to reducing offending and associated road deaths. The Chair of the Transport Select Committee described **Briggs**’ evidence as “ *very* *compelling”* commenting that it *“\[…\] was very significant in shaping our thinking and our conclusions as a Committee. We wouldn’t have made that recommendation if we hadn’t heard her evidence – it gave us the confidence to make quite a bold recommendation to Government”* **\[C1\]**. These recommendations are therefore directly tied to **Briggs**’ evidence given in the consultation, demonstrating both influence on the debate and demonstrating acceptance of the theoretical explanations offered by the team’s research. The Chair further commented *“There was considerable media interest and I think the coverage of it challenged many people to consider the risks \[…\] I hope it has encouraged drivers to adopt safer behaviours, including not using their mobile phone even if it is hands\-free”.* The Government response, published in December 2019, supported the need for increased public awareness and education and for the ‘tightening up’ of loopholes in mobile phone law – a factor on which **Briggs** specifically provided evidence **\[C1\]**. The proposed change to the law is due to be implemented in early 2021. 

 **Briggs** and Hole have since submitted further evidence on mobile phone offending to the Department for Transport’s Roads Policing Review \(October 2020\) **\[C1\]** and have created policy documents aimed at non\-academic audiences, which explain the relationship between research findings and recommended best practice. These have been endorsed and promoted by the charities ‘Roadsafe’, ‘RoadSafetyGB’ and The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety \(PACTS\). **Briggs** has further been asked to provide expert evidence for the Metropolitan Police in Jan 2021, regarding a collision case involving handsfree phone use, which they are bringing to trial. 

 **Practitioner professional engagement and education** 

 **Briggs**’ team have carried out extensive work with the police. This work has shaped the top\-level policing approach taken to education and enforcement campaigns on driver distraction. In partnership with Keele University, with funding from the Road Safety Trust, the team devised an evidence\-based approach for the National Police Chief’s Council \(NPCC\) mobile phone enforcement campaign in March 2020. This involved knowledge exchange consultations with multiple forces to ascertain how education is usually shared and discuss how an evidence\-based approach could meaningfully contribute to behaviour change. The team produced 65 drag\-and\-drop Tweets, FAQs, suggestions for challenging resistance to mobile phone messaging and a press release. Resources were delivered directly to all 43 UK police forces, who used them during the 2\-week safety campaign, introducing a UK standard approach to this campaign for the first time. The Twitter campaign had a reach of 250K, despite the onset of lockdown in week 2, and was described as ‘ *a very helpful and valuable resource*’ by the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners \(APCC\). The Executive Business Manager for the NPCC, commented: *“It is very important that the messaging in place during the operation is evidence\-based and engaging \[…\]. The resources provided by Dr **Briggs** are highly effective in communicating the serious dangers of phone use by drivers and ensure there was consistency in the messaging being delivered by police forces across the UK during the operation and to achieve a greater likelihood of the messages impacting drivers in the intended way”* **\[C2\]**. 

 Following invitations to provide education to key stakeholders in core aspects of road safety, including The National Roads Policing Operation and Intelligence group \(NRPOI\) and Highways England, **Briggs** was invited to speak at the National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme \(NDORS\) conference. **Briggs** is now working with NDORS, who are responsible for creating all police\-referred driver education courses, to produce evidence\-based online courses in light of COVID\-19. The first element of this work, which investigated participant feedback on current online courses, was completed in November 2020. Further work, including a funded PhD and the design of validated measures for behaviour change, will commence in January 2021. 

 **Briggs** worked with the Police Federation to update two chapters of both ‘RoadCraft’ and ‘Motorcycle RoadCraft’, the training manuals used for UK police officers and emergency responders. **Briggs** added research on driver distraction and guidance on defining best practice. Since publication, in October 2020, 33 emergency service organisations across the UK have purchased e\-books which are made available to all staff; approximately 3,000 hardcopy books have been sold \(75% to practitioners, 25% to civilians\); 12 police forces have purchased site\-wide licences and 500 individual licences have been sold to other road safety organisations **\[C3\]**. The team’s research has therefore influenced national level authoritative, professional guidance on best practice for emergency responders. 

 Using The Open University’s world\-leading online education platforms, the team have further created online interactive, evidence\-based educational resources aimed at the wider public. These give users first\-hand experience of the distraction imposed by phone\-use. The first interactive went live in July 2019 and has been completed by 10,900 people to date. It has been adopted by Thames Valley Police as an educational tool for offenders and has been used in local council and NPCC national level campaigns **\[C2\]**. The second activity, launched in November 2020, focused on hazard detection and driver confidence. To date it has been completed by 3,636 individuals. Data show that around 50% of respondents use their phone while driving, and of those 72% said that having completed the activity they will now either avoid all phone use or limit their handsfree use when driving. 89% said the activity had increased their awareness and understanding of the issues associated with phone use by drivers, and 32% claimed they knew nothing about the dangers of phone use prior to completing the activity **\[C4\]**. 

 **Increased public awareness and understanding** 

 The team’s research was used by road safety charity, ‘Brake’ in their, 2016, ‘Phone Smart’ campaign. Brake said the research had provided “ *important new insight to the dangers of hands\-free phone use, which we have utilised in our campaigning efforts to raise awareness of these dangers and seek behavioural, and ultimately legislative, change*” **\[C5\]**. **Briggs** was invited to speak at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents’ \(RoSPA\) national road safety conference, in 2017, which led to an endorsement from RoSPA and publication of the team’s research findings in their widely circulated road safety factsheet. RoSPA commented “ *We have used this in numerous driver training presentations to employers as part of our managing occupational road risk work. It has also reinforced our position that hands free use should not be legally permitted”* **\[C5\]**. Both Brake and RoSPA have used this research to define best practice and regularly lobby government to address the issue of handsfree phone use. **Briggs** also authored a preface for the joint Direct Line and Brake survey report \(Jan 2020\) on in\-vehicle distraction **\[C6\]** which provided evidence of a documented shift in public attitudes to phone use \(e.g. 51% of the 1,009 respondents reported that they thought handsfree phone use was as distracting as handheld use\), showing a greater awareness of the dangers of handsfree use. The team’s research has also been cited in the position statement for best practice for employees by the Royal College of Nursing **\[C6\]**. 

  

 The team’s research has also enjoyed significant international media interest, demonstrating public reach. In 2016, this resulted in several radio and television interviews including Radio 4’s Today programme \(7.1 million weekly listeners, **\[C7\]**\). The link between these impact activities and the underpinning research is evident as the 2016 paper is in the top 5% for media interest and impact of all 15 million outputs tracked to date and is the top paper for attention score across all tracked outputs of a similar age **\[C8\]**. Public engagement work, adding to increased public debate and awareness also followed publication of the team’s 2018 paper. This included **Briggs**’ appearance on BBC News \(Aug 2019, with reach across all coverage totalling over 14 million, **\[C7\]**\); co\-authored pieces for The Conversation and Good Motoring magazine; and working as an academic consultant on a BBC ideas film based entirely on this research, which between Aug 2019 and Dec 2020 had 103,000 viewers **\[C9\]**. 

 In September 2020, the research was used during ‘Project Edward’, a Europe\-wide safety campaign, run by the Association for Road Risk Management \(ARRM\) and supported by the NPCC and the Department for Transport. **Briggs** produced multimedia educational resources on workplace driver distraction which were shared on the campaign website, along with links to several other of the team’s resources, including their newly launched ‘Driving Change’ website **\[C10\]**. Project Edward’s Campaign Manager described the resources as “ *invaluable”* and commented that the varied approach taken *“\[…\] ensured that research findings were clearly communicated in a targeted manner, for use by members of industry, company policy makers and road safety professionals”.* The campaign received 56 million impressions on Twitter, reaching 7.2 million individuals in a week. The Campaign Manager commented that the campaign *“\[…\] significantly increased awareness amongst several different important audiences”* with the team’s materials being particularly impactful: “ *Driver distraction was the most viewed page on the website across the whole week with approximately 500 unique page views on its first day, compared with others which had around 150\-250 views each day”*. He further commented: “ *Feedback I have received from relevant individuals in industry who have seen the research indicates that they have been impressed by it and it has made them think differently”* **\[C10\]**. Highways England will also be sharing the team’s resources in their new Driving for Better Business campaign website which will launch in January 2021. 

 Across all impacts cited, the team’s research has informed and influenced the awareness, attitudes and understanding of key stakeholders and the wider public by stimulating debate, providing an evidence\-base for policy recommendations and authoritative guidance, and providing targeted education which challenges conventional wisdom.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research has led to higher quality true crime television programmes, rooted in cutting edge empirical enquiry.  Our research has directly shaped programme narratives, improving the rigour and accuracy of 131 episodes across five series made in the UK, Ireland and distributed globally, representing a step change from the low quality, populist media, driven by stereotypes and prejudices which previously dominated such genres. The key beneficiaries are the television channels CBS Reality and Sky Crime, the online streaming service Netflix, multiple television production companies in the UK and Ireland and the audiences of the programmes they make.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 We have developed an international reputation for explaining the complexities of homicide in a manner accessible for non\-academic and non\-specialist audiences. We are an established primary point of contact to inform crime content for Netflix, CBS Reality and multiple production companies in the UK and Ireland. 

 We undertook the first study in the UK to approach serial homicide from a victim perspective.  It focused upon victim socio\-demographics instead of offender motivation and biography, which had characterised earlier scholarship influenced by psychological focus of the FBI’s work in this area \(R01\). Uniquely, our findings established five main victim groups targeted by British serial killers; established through interviews with serial killers and victim groups, observations of a serial homicide police investigation and analysing official inquiries as well as police and court records. Our research highlighted that victim groups reflect wider structural power relations and inequalities \- a significant departure from the orthodox focus upon the psycho\-social development of individual serial killers. R01 has since been cited by over 100 other scholarly works, representing considerable recognition in this relatively small sub\-specialism of homicide studies. 

  

 Theoretical development continued in R02, which outlined an integrated, multilevel explanation for homicide. This identified the individual, community and societal factors that combined to create the conditions in which serial homicide occurs. This was significant in that it was the first study in the world to apply concepts of *pseudo\-pacification* and *special liberty* to homicide. 

 Pseudo\-pacification challenges the orthodox narrative that violence has declined throughout modernity, arguing that it has instead changed in shape and form. Special liberty describes the tendency of the neoliberal citizen to do whatever necessary to secure their own interests, regardless of the impact on others – a clear trait of contemporary serial homicide offenders. The integration of these concepts moves the study of serial homicide beyond a focus upon harmful individual values and behaviours, understanding them as inextricably linked to wider political and economic factors. The publication of R02 in the highly regarded, peer\-reviewed journal, *European Journal of Criminology*, is testament to its quality. 

 In R03 we developed a methodology to enable empirical enquiry through the collection of primary data – the criminological autopsy. We then applied this to the Dunblane mass murder. The criminological autopsy utilises ethnographic\-style observations and data collection in the places of the locality and a structured review of documentation relating to the case. For example, the Cullen Enquiry into the murders, the perpetrator’s personal letters and the accounts of secondary victims. This approach has since informed further scholarship in the serial homicide field, notably Wattis’s multiple works on Peter Sutcliffe, the so\-called “Yorkshire Ripper”. 

 Our ground\-breaking research into ‘hitmen’ \(R04\) was the first study to identify cases of contract killing in Britain during the rise of neoliberal political economy.  We explored the physical locations of contract killings and the nexus between public and private space through thematic analysis. We collected data on demographic and criminological variables relating to contract homicide convictions to develop the first typology of British hitmen. Our research challenged the common portrayal of hitmen as expensive, underground, and elite: we found the reality was much different and these killers operated at a more public, open and relatively affordable level. 

 Our research progressed to examine networked technology \(R05, R06\), exploring the significance of digital connectivity and social media for homicide. R05 was the first homicide study to examine social networking sites, analysing 48 international cases where Facebook had been used by perpetrators. This led us to establish a typology of how offenders use Facebook. R06 broke new ground as the first to empirically explore perpetrator use of social media by formulating and applying our new methodology – *Ethnographic Media Practice Analysis for Criminology \(EMPAC\) \-* to examine the use of a range of digital platforms by three perpetrators in the USA and Canada. EMPAC is a framework for analysing individual cases, and consists of a series of themes, terms and questions, enabling both an analysis of individual experiences and the broader contexts within which these lived realities exist.

 <ins>Increased stakeholder participation, empowerment and engagement</ins> 

 Our research has directly influenced the development of 131 episodes of programming across five series, with both national and international audiences, reaching around of 330 million people. This is evidence of the unit’s considerable capacity to influence perceptions of crime and criminality across the globe. According to industry calculations, DW and EY generated advertising value equivalents \(AVE\) in excess of £9million, through media coverage of their research and associated programming during the assessment period \(S01\). 

 Our involvement and research insights enhanced the legitimacy of programming, increasing stakeholder confidence in the productions and the likelihood of their participation. We also advocated the need for the perspectives of stakeholders, such as psychologists, police detectives, families and friends of victims and perpetrators to be heard, which led to these individuals’ voices being included in the programmes. 

 *“Having the strong academic research behind the programme gave the families of the victims the confidence to be part of the programme and share their experiences, with the hope of preventing it from happening again”* Director of Programming, CBS Reality \(S02\) 

 *“Professor Wilson’s involvement in the programme was important in bringing other experts on board due to his status as an established scholar in this field. This also enhanced the confidence of the audience in the validity and reliability of the programme’s investigation and conclusions.”* Executive Producer, BBC Studios \(S02\) 

 The involvement of such stakeholders represented a meaningful change in the way true crime programming has been produced. As opposed to families simply being ‘talking heads’, reinforcing a producer\-led narrative, our research, in placing victims and their families at the heart of cases, ensures that their voices have informed programme content. The cooperation of such stakeholders was a necessary step in creating rich, informative programming that highlighted the previously misunderstood aspects about serial homicide and professional killers. 

 <ins>Informing, enriching and influencing television content</ins> 

 Our research acted as an evidence base to enable programmes to move away from a focus on homicide offenders to better encompass social and political\-economic contexts \(S03\) 

 Furthermore, programmes have directly used our work to highlight the structural inequalities that lead to vulnerabilities in specific victim groups. R05 was drawn upon in exploring Stephen Port’s use of *Grindr* as a *predator* serial killer. *Click for Murder* highlighted the broader context of homophobia identified in R01. *Murderers and their Mothers,* referred to the social and cultural ideological frameworks around gender roles to increase awareness and understandings of individual behaviour. 

 Our typology of homicide perpetrators and social media use \(R05\) informed the concept for the highly successful Netflix show Click for Murder, which was also screened on CBS Reality. 

 “*Research such as Dr Yardley’s paper ‘Making Sense of Facebook Murder’ creates a strong starting point for television series in the true crime genre*” \(S02\). 

 R04 provided the structure for, *Assassins: Ireland’s Contract Killers,* which aired on Irish channel TV3. By applying our academic knowledge on British Hitmen to Irish cases we were able introduce the concepts to Irish audiences and programmes \(S03\). 

 BBC documentary *Jack the Ripper: The case reopened* \(2019\), was shaped by our multilevel model of homicide and serial homicide \(R01, R02\) and applied both the victim\-centred approach \(R01\) and criminological autopsy \(R03\). This programme was made by the BBC Science department and their use of our research is testament to the quality of our scholarship. This programme secured considerable reach for our research with viewing figures of 3.6 million people of different ages and genders from across the social class spectrum \(S02\). The Executive Producer for BBC Studios stated, 

 *“\[the\] criminological autopsy technique was an important component of the programme’s content. Professor Wilson’s research informed the content and structure of Jack the Ripper: The Case Reopened and played a significant role in producing a forensic, empirical and rigorous programme that stood apart from other programmes about unsolved murders which tend to focus heavily on style, dramatic reconstructions and opinion.”*\(S02\) 

 <ins>Enriching the narrative to influence television portrayals of homicide</ins> 

 Our research has directly informed TV programme narratives, challenging orthodox understandings of homicide \(R01, R02\) by emphasising *how* homicide is presented and examined. Traditionally, homicide is presented as an act perpetrated by someone who is inherently ‘bad’. The analysis is often abstract, focusing wholly on the psychology of the perpetrator, and precluding a consideration of *how* their harmful behaviour developed within the familial, community, social, cultural and political context, which creates a misinformed idea in the minds of the audience. Instead, our unique approach enabled production companies to create a detailed picture of the crimes and the forces that drove the criminal\(s\). This serves the audience by demonstrating how the range of factors, operating at different levels, combine to create the circumstances in which perpetrators decide to kill \(S04\) 

 *“…Your research enables our shows to go into more depth and therefore gives the audience a deeper understanding and more information. This is vital as the true crime genre progresses – we can’t simply say ‘who dunnit’ – we need to say ‘why’ and look at how we can prevent it in the future…your insights definitely help drive the storytelling of each programme”* CEO, Woodcut Media \(S02\) 

 *“The involvement of the criminologists from Birmingham City University has resulted in insight\-led Sky Crime programmes, shaped and informed by their cutting\-edge research…resulting in detailed and educational Sky Crime programmes.” Scheduling Controller, Sky Crime* \(S02\). 

 EY’s research \(R05\) has been particularly significant in shaping the narrative of *Click for Murder,* 

 *“The paper informed how our series could look at individual cases and discuss how and why the murderers acted as they did and how social media enabled their crimes……it did give us a strong editorial basis for Click for Murder. We also used it as the basis for analysis within each programme and for PR purposes…her research and onscreen commentary as an expert criminologist underscored the journalistic thrust and narrative of these programmes and others”* \(S02\). 

 *Click for Murder* was also successful in communicating our multilevel understandings of homicide, as evidenced in a TV Guide review which typically receives 2.5 million hits per month \(CBS, 2017\), 

 *“One of the excellent things about the series is that it is not tunnel\-visioned to see social media as the one and only cause of heinous crimes. It is not just the online world that is presented as a danger on the show, as others factors are taken into consideration too. It is refreshing to see a crime documentary tackle the fatal consequences of stigmatisation and repression of homosexuality, for example.”* \(S01\) 

 <ins>Increasing audience awareness, understanding and engagement</ins> 

 Our involvement in informing television content has equipped and stimulated programme audiences by enhancing their awareness and understanding. As a result, audiences are more engaged due to the new knowledge. One production company executive stated, 

 *“By drawing on factual research, it is easier to mould and shape the programme to allow the audience to have an in\-depth understanding of a specific area of crime. Rather than looking at a single crime case in isolation”* \(S02\) 

 Our commitment to explaining the complexities of homicide in an accessible manner for the general public has ensured that audiences learn and understand specialist terminology associated with homicide, as well as the potential indicators of criminal behaviour. The Director of Programming for CBS Reality stated that, 

 *“Crime documentaries often bandy around a lot of 'lingo' describing perpetrators, without actually providing the audience with a comprehensive understanding of what that means.  By collaborating with experts such as those mentioned above, we provide new and accurate information to an audience who believe they already know everything about crime, victims and perpetrators. As such the audiences consume the programmes with more dedication and interest as they are also learning than programmes on many other channels.*  *By providing the general public with factual research base information, not only does it make better programming, but it also provides them with knowledge to enable them to understand people, and in many cases red flags of crimes, far better. It helps people determine warning signs that may otherwise have passed them by allowing them to protect themselves and their families, and in some cases, gives them the catalyst they need to remove themselves from a situation which may be destructive.”* \(S02\) 

 *“Criminologists at Birmingham City University have succeeded in building relationships with media organisations and in doing so have put their research to work in gradually shifting popular attitudes towards serious forms of violence.”* Scheduling Controller, Sky Crime. \(S02\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Hadi Larijani and his team’s work demonstrated Low Power, Wide Area \(LPWA\) networking protocol \(LoRaWAN\) to be an effective and reliable method for smart sensor communication in Urban Environments \[G1\]. Following its first large scale study in a Scottish city, the Scottish Government subsequently acted and rolled it out across the country. The Centre of Excellence for sensing, imaging and Internet of Things \(CENSIS\) \[C1\] stated, that GCU “played an important part in a wider programme of activity led by CENSIS to establish a Low Power Wide Area Network \(LPWAN, specifically LoRaWAN\) testbed in Glasgow.” Work with the companies Stream Technologies and Gas Sensing Solutions has led to a better understanding of the capability of LoRaWAN for smart sensors in cities and for fundamentally managing the power requirements for long\-term use without intervention, contributing to the acquisition by multi\-billion dollar company ARM and 20% increase in sales, respectively.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research in engineering applications of advanced machine learning and AI using Random Neural Networks \(RNN\) started in 2004 at GCU. This research has since involved more than 20 academics and research students. There are two research groups \(Cyber Security, Networking, and Communications \(CSNC\) and AI \+ IoT Research Lab\) that are part of the SMART Technology Research Centre. 

 Larijani’s research contributions during this assessment period can be grouped in three main areas: 

1.  Smart building energy management systems using wireless sensors and IoT. 

1.  Accurate performance evaluation of low power wireless network \(LoRaWAN\). 

1.  Application of LoRaWAN for smart transport, disaster management, and telehealth. 

 Buildings consume 32% \(24% for residential and 8% for commercial\) of the global energy consumption, 19% of total energy related CO2 emissions and 51% of total electricity consumption. The smart building energy management system developed at GCU \(hardware and software\) was shown to save more than 30% energy and have the same thermal comfort \[R1\]. 

 In 2014 a project with Gas Sensing Solutions Ltd. \[G2\], a Scottish gas sensing company showed that with LoRaWAN and cloud technologies, a suitable gas sensing solution could be developed so that sensors could communicate and their battery life extended, in some cases indefinitely \(using Photovoltaic charging\). This technology was further expanded by using Cloud infrastructure to manage cooling in buildings \[R2\]. The project determined whether random neural networks \(RNN’s\) could provide necessary intelligent self\-learning \(ISL\) and adaptive management capability for autonomous carbon dioxide/ humidity/ temperature wireless sensors within buildings – energy and indoor air quality demand control and management with minimal human intervention \[R3\]. Traceall Global Ltd bring significant experience in use and deployment of wireless sensor networks for buildings, logistics and healthcare applications. 

 In 2015 this work was also extended \[G1\] to the oil and gas sector and led to the study of security threats in LoRaWAN. This also resulted in a journal paper \[R4\] which reported on the use of LoRaWAN with security, and how can we implement security on these small devices. A pilot study was conducted in implementing edge security using Random Neural Networks and this led to the new KTP within IoT security. The main findings were that a multi layered approach for LoRaWAN and IoT security is required with elements of security embedded in the edge devices \[R4\]. Human safety using secure occupancy was reported in \[R5\]. 

 More recently the LoRaWAN technology has been evaluated for disaster management \[R6\], and results have shown that due to its low power and wide area coverage it would be the ideal solution for post geological disaster implementation as a rapid response or as a backup for these eventualities. 

 Larijani and his team have generated nine journal publications in IEEE, ACM, and IET journals, one patent, and presented at 15 international conferences.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact 1. General policy to roll out the technology</ins> <ins>s</ins><ins>pecific to application areas</ins><ins>:</ins> 

 The research, development, and analysis of low power wireless networks \(LoRaWAN network\) for environmental sensing conducted by Glasgow Caledonian University has been instrumental in the development of Scottish smart cities. 

 GCU research has helped companies to develop smart solutions in cities for environmental sensing \(air pollution\) \[C1\], traffic management, building energy management \[C2\], intelligent lighting, and for the rural areas of developing countries. The first KTP project between GCU and Stream Technologies \[G3\] led to a pilot project in Glasgow in collaboration with Strathclyde University, Glasgow University, and CENSIS. As a direct result of these projects the Scottish Government has rolled out LoRaWAN networks across Scotland and an IoT network infrastructure for environmental sensing, disaster recovery and smart cities has been developed. The UK government is now funding similar initiatives. 

 <ins>For specific projects and applications:</ins> 

 Stream Technologies published two White papers for their customers highlighting the benefits of LoRaWAN. GSS solutions was able to implement their sensors for Schneider Electric. In Stream’s White paper \[C7\] “the results encouraging in the assessment of the LoRaWAN technology. For 'set and forget' sensing where two\-way communication is not a requirement and where occasional missing packets are not an issue, the uplink success rate in a multi\-gateway environment is very good.” The \(CEO\) of Stream in an interview with IoT Now \[C8\], stated, “with Glasgow Caledonian University we are exploring the concept of harvesting energy from broadcast sources such as television and radio transmissions and the irony hasn’t escaped us that we’re looking to use energy from one radio source to power another. How cool is that?” 

 <ins>Impact 2. Creating new business, improving the performance of existing businesses</ins> <ins>f</ins><ins>rom Stream T</ins><ins>echnologies testimonial \[C6\]:</ins> 

 Gas Sensing Solutions Ltd.: The project with GSS \[G2\], using Cloud infrastructure to manage cooling in buildings \[R3\] led to increased sales of GSS by over 8% \[C9\], and they are now entering the market of smart sensors. The AI developed by GCU and tested in real world environments has been a major contributing factor to this development. 

 Stream Technologies: Work in collaboration with GCU through the two KTPs \[G3, G4\] established Stream Technologies as a key player in the LPWA IoT sector \[C3, C4\]. It led to the creation of a Glasgow and subsequently Scottish LoRa network and consortium, which cemented the company’s role in the growth of Scottish IoT via pilot projects, bootstrapping IoT Scotland and the validation of Geolocation on LoRa networks \[C3, C4, C5\], as well as the invalidation of RF power harvesting as a usable power source of LPWA. As a result of their expertise in LoRa developed through the KTPs \(as well as cellular and satellite connectivity\), Stream Technologies was acquired by ARM in June 2018. The combination of Stream’s technology with Arm’s Mbed IoT Device Management Platform will provide a basis for a combined physical and software platform. ARM claimed that customers would see a number of key benefits from the Stream acquisition and integration with ARM’s Mbed IoT Device Management Platform, including: 

-  Single pane of glass that provides customer visibility and management capabilities throughout the device’s lifecycle – deployment, connectivity, provisioning, management, and updates. 

-  eSIM orchestration that communicates and connects policies enabling zero touch onboarding that drive efficiencies and scale of IoT connections. 

-  Global aggregation across network types and flexible wireless connectivity options that can be optimized across devices, regions, and use cases that are deployed. 

-  Simplified billing and reconciliation through APIs and automated controls that can charge based on any event for increased flexibility. 

-  Connect and manage any device regardless of network type to steer reliable and trusted data, seamlessly push new updates and features, and optimize quality\-of\-service and latency for troubleshooting.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Leeds Trinity University’s \(LTU\) research \(led by Dr Martin Barwood\) describes the safe and effective use of a novel performance and health enhancing intervention, namely L\-menthol application and ingestion. This published guidance has been issued to sports practitioners, exercise scientists, coaches, athletes and clinical \(e.g., thermal physiologists\) professionals to inform best practice when administering menthol as a nutritional supplement, ergogenic aid and therapeutic intervention to alleviate heat strain. The research outcomes have impacts on \(i\) Internationally distributed and embedded advice on safe concentrations, preparation protocols and use of menthol\-based interventions benefitting practitioners and professional services; \(ii\) the development of menthol\-based products for ingestion and application in athletes and multiple sclerosis sufferers; and \(iii\) improved exercise outcomes for hard\-to\-reach groups. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Context:** Competitive sporting events and recreational activities in clinical groups can be limited by unpleasant perceptions of thermal discomfort and sensation \(i.e., feeling unpleasantly hot\). Accordingly, clinicians, exercise scientists, practitioners and elite sports organisations have become interested in interventions that relieve thermal discomfort and thereby enhance performance or exercise outcomes. Where the environmental conditions are extremely hot and additionally limiting \(i.e., Tokyo 2020 \(2021\) Olympic games; 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup\) evoking perceptual improvement magnifies the benefits and can aggregate to marginal gains that enhance performance or exercise outcomes. 

 Menthol is a naturally occurring cyclic terpene alcohol that is extracted from plants of the *Mentha* genus \(e.g., peppermint and corn mint\) and evokes a fresh pleasant taste and cooling sensation when applied to mucous membranes or the skin biochemically mirroring temperature change within the range of 8 to 28ºC. Menthol\-induced stimulation of thermal receptors during periods of heat stress has consistently been shown to improve thermal comfort \(i.e., feels more comfortable\) and decreases thermal sensation \(i.e., feels cooler\) which is ergogenic in endurance sports and may also be of relevance to clinical populations. An expanding body of research using menthol is evident in the current REF census period, yet few studies have reported the thresholds for the safe and effective administration of menthol interventions with a lack of authoritative guidelines particularly for use in hard\-to\-reach groups such as elite athletes and those with clinical thermal impairments. Guidance on safe products for use in these scenarios is similarly lacking. 

 **Nature of the Insight:** The impact contributes to LTU’s “Enhancing Human Performance” research theme and used an international consensus\-based approach to developing authoritative guidance \(paper 1\) on the safe and effective use of menthol\-based interventions in preparation for use prior to and during the upcoming Olympic Games \(Tokyo 2020 \[2021\]\) and beyond; thereby enhancing the understanding of safe practice and identifying intervention opportunities. These recommendations and our prior empirical work \(paper 2\) have been fundamental to the development of specific consumer products, including menthol\-containing ingestible gels and sprays applied directly to the skin; the latter for use in clinical trials. 

 Our consensus guidelines were formed with 13 internationally recognised experts from a range of backgrounds linked to elite sport and health providing a clear pathway for dissemination to enhance understanding. We established an agreed risk of heat related illness, including an impairment to sweat response \(paper 2\), associated with the improper use of menthol\-based interventions confirming the need for guidance. Upper limits were established for safe use of menthol applications to the skin \(0.8% for menthol sprays and 8.0% for menthol gels\) with safe doses for ingestion not to exceed 0.5 g∙L<sup>\-1</sup>. Cases of lethal doses of menthol application and ingestion were collated and established at 50 to 150 mg∙kg<sup>\-1</sup> of body weight. Caveats were established for the evidence base underpinning safe use in under\-researched groups including females, elite athletes and an absence of work in Paralympic athletes was evident thereby informing our onward guidance. World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\) codes were not infringed with the use of menthol\-based products at published concentrations although the possibility of cross contamination between supplements was noted thereby stimulating our inclusion of a menthol product preparation protocol. Where menthol dispersions were considered \(paper 2\) we established the efficacy of more stable ingredients for effective menthol dispersion to the skin to minimise skin irritation thereby changing active ingredients and informing product development.

-  Key findings include: 

  -  Menthol application to the skin was noted to increase the risk of heat\-related illness at some concentrations; caution was urged in using this modality in our onward guidance. 

  -  Safe doses for menthol mouth\-rinsing were established up to 0.1 and not to exceed 0.5 g∙L<sup>\-1</sup> thereby informing safe concentrations for product development. 

  -  Safe doses for menthol application were established as 0.8% for menthol sprays and 8.0% for menthol gels but are noted as surface area, concentration and exercise protocol dependent. 

  -  Lethal dose ranges were established from reports from animal and human studies; set at 50 to 150 mg∙kg<sup>\-1</sup> of body weight. 

  -  Consensus guidance on safe preparation protocol to minimise risks to health included: preparing menthol interventions from crystals in ventilated environments, using food grade hazard certified sources of menthol, applying modest \(but not excessive\) topical applications in accordance with manufacturer instructions, and delimiting doses to those that have been examined in the peer\-reviewed literature to ensure menthol use minimises the health risk to the end user.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our strategy for impact involved taking our research on developing consensus guidelines for the safe and effective use of menthol and co\-constructing research agendas with academic and user groups.  We developed academic partnerships with elite sport organisations \(e.g., Australian Institute of Sport \- AIS; High\-Performance Sport, New Zealand; Arkea Samsic Pro Cycling Team, France\) to enable a direct pathway to inform coaches, practitioners and athletes. We also partnered with health focussed research groups \(e.g., Mary Mackillop Institute for Health Research, Australia; School of Health and Social Care, Teesside University, U.K\) to enable wider application to health scenarios; our advice was later adopted by University of Sydney, Australia. This approach has enabled: professional standards and guidelines to be influenced by our research; professional bodies and learned societies to use our research to define best practice; as a result practices have changed including the implementation of new protocols and discontinuation of previous, less effective and less safe practices; the guidelines have informed two types of product development which has extended to the trialling of a new clinical intervention to alleviate heat strain in multiple sclerosis sufferers. 

 Accordingly, in relation to elite sport guidance issued to athletes, coaches and practitioners by the Australian Institute of Sport has changed providing a traceable reference to inclusion of our research in authoritative guidance \(source 1\). Best practice guidance issued by the AIS now recommends the discontinuation of the application of menthol creams or gels whilst recognising menthol\-based body sprays as the preferred method \(source 1\) thereby confirming evidence from our experimental trials \(paper 2\). In relation to nutrition, the AIS Sports Supplement Framework now considers menthol to be a “B Group” supplement \(source 2\) defined as having “Emerging scientific support” but “deserving of further research” whilst recognising it could be performance enhancing. Our pathway to the education of hard\-to\-reach groups such as elite athletes is confirmed by source 2a  \( [https://www.ais.gov.au/nutrition/supplements\#group\_b](https://www.ais.gov.au/nutrition/supplements)\) and source 2b. Accordingly, our work has improved the understanding of international sports organisations and the guidance issued to its practitioners, coaches and athletes on the safe and effective use of an ergogenic and nutritional supplement as evidence by these changes. 

 The expanding use of menthol\-based strategies by elite athletes has been acknowledged and predicted to grow by practitioners and scientists \(source 3\) describing elite level sports performance in hot environments \(i.e., Doha, World Athletics Championships; source 3\). This provides traceable references by practitioners to research papers confirming that the need for guidance was warranted and has been met. Our consensus guidance \(paper 1\) has informed the product development stages and guidance for effective use of a cooling menthol energy gel trialled in elite and national standard athletes \(source 4\). Our published upper threshold for menthol ingestion was incorporated in these studies \(0.5 g.L<sup>\-1</sup> or 0.5% concentration\). Athlete testimony confirmed our consensus view of the upper threshold for menthol concentration in ingested supplements at which negative health outcomes \(e.g., sickness, gastrointestinal disturbance\) were noted for some athletes \(source 4\) above which an improved exercise outcome is unlikely in this hard\-to\-reach group. Nevertheless, no performance decrement was reported even at the higher concentrations. Our published protocol for preparation of the menthol gels was adopted and advocated in this study by using food grade menthol secured from a reputable resource, with an associated hazard statement, and cross checking with WADA for cross\-contamination for banned performance enhancing substances prior to use. This provides traceable reference to research papers describing the use of our guidance and its impact. 

 In relation to health, our consensus guidance and empirical work \(papers 1 and 2\) has achieved recognition by clinical researchers \(i.e., University of Sydney, Australia; source 5\) culminating in the development of a new clinical intervention. As a result of our guidance \(source 5\), researchers at the University of Sydney \(Australia\) have prioritised the inclusion of a menthol\-based spray in clinical trials to alleviate heat strain in multiple sclerosis sufferers. Our long\-standing partnership with an independent chemical consultant \(source 6\) has informed the iterative steps to finalise the chemical constituents of the new menthol\-based spray for use in these trials thereby improving product quality. The included spray minimises skin irritation \(which was confirmed as efficacious in our prior research; paper 2\) thereby enabling a new product to be adopted for use \(source 5 and 6\). The trials are pending and have been delayed by the Covid\-19 pandemic. However, based on our consistent evidence of thermal perceptual improvement in healthy controls \(paper 2\), we anticipate a positive health outcome of enhanced perception and improved exercise tolerance in multiple sclerosis sufferers. 

  

 In summary, research led by Dr Barwood et al. at LTU since 2016 has clearly informed the scientific evidence base underpinning the safe and effective use menthol\-based products in hard\-to\-reach groups. Pathways to impact have included: working with partners, and engaging stakeholders and beneficiaries.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through his direct and sustained engagement with parliamentary committees and foreign policy\-making communities in the UK and overseas, Professor Whitman’s research has significantly improved Government understanding of, and directly informed policy debate on, the implications of Brexit for UK\-EU foreign, security, and defence policy collaboration. 

 Whitman’s research has also been widely used and cited by UK and European think tanks in conveying to policy\-making communities the foreign, security, and defence policy consequences of the UK’s departure from the European Union. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Whitman’s research provides the first systematic analysis of the changing EU\-UK relationship in foreign, security, and defence policy as a consequence of Brexit. This builds on his extensive research and publications, conducted since the early 2000s, that have connected the issues of EU foreign, security, and defence policy, the interrelationship between national and European foreign and security policies, and the UK’s European foreign policy. 

 The research underpinning this case study has been carried out by Professor Whitman through the University of Kent’s Global Europe Centre, which is dual\-sited at the University’s Canterbury and Brussels campuses. During the REF2021 period, his work has been underpinned by EU and UK research awards, including an ESRC UK in a Changing Europe Senior Fellowship, which provided a key pathway to impact. 

 The insights generated by Whitman’s work span three main areas: 

1.  **The implications of Brexit for the UK’s European foreign policy.** Whitman’s research, conducted since 2016, addresses the impacts and effects of Brexit on the UK's national foreign, security, and defence policies. His extended and extensive analysis of the interrelationship between EU and UK foreign, security, and defence policy has demonstrated the complexities faced by the UK in recalibrating this relationship in the context of Brexit **\[R1, R2, R6\]**. 

1.  **The EU’s foreign policy\-making system**. Whitman’s work has contributed significantly to the conceptual, theoretical, and empirically based understanding of the EU’s international role. He has conducted extensive analysis of the evolution of the EU foreign policy decision\-making and implementation systems, and the role of the UK within the EU foreign, security, and policy\-making processes **\[R4, R5\]**. The research has drawn comparisons between the UK and other member states regarding the interrelationship between national foreign and security policies and those of the EU. It demonstrates the challenges presented by Brexit to the EU's foreign, security, and defence policies, and provides insight into the process of negotiating Brexit from the perspective of the EU **\[R1, R3\]**. 

1.  **The UK’s European diplomacy**. Whitman’s analysis explores how the UK has sought to combine UK and EU policy instruments in its European diplomacy. His work since 2016 has assessed the intermeshed nature of UK\-EU foreign, security, and defence policy, and explored issues of UK policy effectiveness within the EU **\[R3, R4\]**. This research has highlighted the high degree of consistency in UK European foreign policy across successive UK governments since the 1990s and the extent to which evolving practices of UK participation within the EU have made UK foreign and security policy intermeshed with the EU decision\-making practices and policies, and the challenges this presents for Brexit **\[R1, R5\]**. 

 A hallmark of Whitman’s work has been his ongoing collaboration with practitioners and policy experts within international affairs policy institutes, including Chatham House \(the Royal Institute of International Affairs\) in the UK, and overseas \(Belgium, Norway, Sweden\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Whitman’s research on UK and EU foreign and security policy has impacted Britain’s policy approach to Brexit both directly, through his work with parliamentary committees and Whitehall departments, and indirectly, through his sustained collaborations with think tanks, policy communities, and specialist journalists in the UK, Europe, and internationally. It has also enhanced understanding of the issues amongst the wider public, through his extensive media engagement. 

 Different stakeholder groups have benefited from Whitman’s research, and illustrative examples of impact across three constituencies, including evidence of key claims, are as follows: 

 **Parliamentarians, select committees, and senior civil servants within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Ministry of Defence** 

 Since 2016, Whitman has directly contributed to the UK Government’s understanding of the implications of Brexit by assisting Parliament in its work on Brexit\-related foreign and security policy issues, and providing by\-invitation briefings to senior civil servants, both in the UK and overseas. In particular, Whitman has advised on the challenges posed by detaching the UK from EU foreign, security, and defence policy arrangements and institutions, and explained the limitations of existing third\-country arrangements \(such as with Canada and Norway\) as future models for the UK. 

 Whitman has been invited to provide oral evidence to House of Commons select committees, including several appearances before the Foreign Affairs Committee and Committee for Exiting the EU  **\[e, f\]**. Hillary Benn MP, Chair of the Committee for Exiting the EU, described Whitman’s insights in January 2018 as: ‘extremely helpful \[...\] \[his evidence\] will really assist us with our work’. 

 In addition to giving public evidence, Whitman has taken part in in\-camera knowledge exchange activities with the International Development and Public and Constitutional Affairs Committees, and his written evidence was utilised in select committee reports of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords in 2018 **\[g, h\]**. 

 Whitman’s evidence has been cited by the Chairs of Parliamentary select committees. His analysis was directly quoted by the Chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee when questioning the Foreign Office’s Permanent Secretary during an evidence session \( **November 2016**\): 

 Similarly, the Chair of the Committee for Exiting the EU Committee referenced Whitman’s ideas in an opinion piece \( **March 2017**\): 

 [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/hilary\-benn/brexit\-patriotism\_b\_15079646.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/hilary-benn/brexit-patriotism_b_15079646.html). 

 Whitman has been asked to brief senior civil servants in the UK and overseas on his findings, and has delivered master classes to staff responsible for developing policy on Brexit within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence, and House of Commons committee since 2016. 

 Internationally, he has been invited to provide briefings on his research to the US State Department \( **January 2017**\), the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia \(simulcast from the Australian Diplomatic Academy to all overseas diplomatic missions\) and New Zealand \( **2019\)**; and to provide specialist briefing for state government in Australia and lectures to specialist public policy\-making audiences in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan \( **2019 & 2020**\). 

 **UK and European international affairs think tank communities** 

 Whitman’s research on EU\-UK foreign, security, and defence relations and their Brexit\-related aspects has deepened and enhanced the understanding of think tanks and policy institutes and their audiences. Central to these activities with the wider policy community was his appointment as an Associate Fellow of Chatham House \(the Royal Institute of International Affairs\) \( **since 2014**\). Through this by\-invitation role he initiated, coordinated, and delivered a range of workshops, sandpits, briefings and publication activities, making a significant contribution to the Institute’s work on the Brexit\-related aspects of EU\-UK foreign, security, and defence policy relations. 

 Published work based on these activities have included a set of Chatham House *Expert Comments* and a policy paper on the external affairs of the UK Devolved Administrations in the context of Brexit **\[d\]**. As the testimonial from Chatham House notes: 

 ‘Richard Whitman played a key role in our work on Brexit. His research  has  helped drive forward the agenda on important policy issues, such as the external affairs of the Devolved Administrations and the future of the E3 \[…\]. Richard's work has reached a key policy audience, with our partners in government and elsewhere noting the value and influence of the work.’ **\[a\]** 

 A number of research institutes outside the UK have commissioned Whitman to deliver briefings and policy papers, including Egmont and the European Policy Centre \(Brussels\) in **2016** **\[c\]**, the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in 2018 \[b\], the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs \(NUPI\) in 2018 \( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMG70dBf98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMG70dBf98)\), the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Aussenpolitik \(Berlin\) in **2017**, the Australian Institute for International Affairs \(AIIA\) in 2019 and 2020, and the New Zealand Institute for International Affairs \(NZIIA\) in 2019. 

 **Enhancing public understanding** 

 Through his media work, Whitman has also influenced the broader public discourse and understanding of Brexit\-related issues. He has worked to build close relationships with specialist journalists to ensure that media comment is authoritative and factually correct, and the findings of his research have been cited by specialist correspondents in major print publications such as the *Financial Times* **\[i, j\]**. 

 In addition, Whitman has produced by\-invitation op\-ed and other commentary pieces to stimulate comment and debate on the UK\-EU foreign policy\-making system, relating this to appropriate news and other EU referendum and Brexit developments.

 Research conducted by the University of Bristol’s Human Rights Implementation Centre has provided the intellectual and empirical impetus for changes to the policies and practices of UN treaty bodies, the African Commission and African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, state authorities, national human rights institutions, and civil society organisations as they implement human rights law. These changes have resulted in improved: 

-  **visibility** of decisions and their implementation status; 

-  **monitoring** of the implementation of judgments, decisions and recommendations; 

-  **governmental strategies** on human rights law compliance; 

-  **practitioner working methods** for drafting and filing human rights cases.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Previous research identified an ‘implementation crisis’ in enforcing rulings of UN and regional human rights bodies, suggesting that even successful litigation may not result in justice for victims ‘on the ground’. Research by the University of Bristol’s Human Rights Implementation Centre \(HRIC\), supported by significant ESRC funding **\[3.3\]** between 2015 and 2019, analysed over 100 decisions from regional and UN supranational bodies against nine states in Africa, the Americas and Europe, to consider the extent to which States implement rulings, and how that implementation is monitored **\[3.1\]**. An innovative process\-tracing methodology tracked what happened \(at the national level\) to decisions after their adoption by supranational bodies. HRIC researchers held side events at UN meetings, attended nine sessions of the African Commission, held seminars in the African States that were the subject of the study \(Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Zambia\), and conducted over 300 interviews with various actors including government representatives, civil society organisations \(CSOs\), parliamentarians, the judiciary, victims, and members of UN and regional treaty bodies and courts. This programme of research provides new evidence on what affects the implementation of human rights law, including the emergence of three key factors: a\) inter\-authority communication and visibility of decisions; b\) the role and influence of various human rights actors including victims; and c\) litigation strategy. 

###  A. Inter\-authority communication and visibility of decisions 

 HRIC research found that various national bureaucratic and technical processes need to be triggered if the decisions of human rights bodies are to be implemented **\[3.5\]**. States may fail to comply, not because of a lack of willingness but, rather, due to a lack of clear processes for implementation or defined lines of responsibility. The research rebutted assumptions that the specificity in decisions is a primary determinate or catalyst for implementation **\[3.4\]**, **\[3.6\]**. It found that other factors, such as the visibility of a given decision, are also crucial in how State authorities respond. HRIC’s research **\[3.1\]**, **\[3.3\]**, **\[3.4\]** found a sporadic and inconsistent flow of communication between the international and national levels, and among national actors \(such as parliaments, national human rights institutions and CSOs\). Consequently, those who have a responsibility for implementing a given decision do not always know about it, and information on what measures the State has taken may not be disseminated. This hinders implementation advocates \(victims, lawyers and civil society\) from taking further action designed to secure full implementation. Furthermore, decisions are mostly addressed to ‘the State’, but this fails to encapsulate not just the range of different executive bodies that are needed for implementation, but also the legislature and judiciary and the particular challenges they may face. Consequently, HRIC’s research demonstrated the need for a more coordinated approach and for practical tools to respond to decisions, such as databases and national processes. 

###  B. Role and influence of various human rights actors 

 HRIC’s research found that the visibility, legitimacy and credibility of the supranational bodies **\[3.1\]**, **\[3.2\]**, **\[3.4\]**, and the lack of clarity surrounding their own role **\[3.4\]** are also crucial factors in the implementation of human rights law. While treaty bodies may have a number of procedures at their disposal to monitor implementation of their own decisions, HRIC research found that some, such as holding hearings, may have particular impact, but many are not used fully. The role of the victims themselves can be influential **\[3.1\]**, **\[3.4\]**. Similarly, at the national level, while mechanisms and actors exist, such as national human rights institutions, they are often not employed as often as they could be **\[3.1\]**, **\[3.5\]**. 

###  C. Litigation strategy 

 Litigants and victims often consider implementation only once a decision in their favour has been adopted. Yet, HRIC research found that how requests for remedies are both determined and worded can influence the bureaucratic processes that need to be used in their implementation, the state authorities’ response to them and, ultimately, their successful implementation **\[3.3\]\-\[3.5\]**. Consequently, one of the HRIC’s key findings was the need for litigants to consider implementation at the outset and build this into their strategies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The underpinning research detailed above has been used to help bring about improvements to the policies and practices of key UN treaty bodies – the Human Rights Committee, the Committee Against Torture, and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women – the African Commission, African Court, governments and civil society organisations \(CSOs\). 

###  Improved visibility of decisions and status of implementation within the African system 

 As a result of HRIC’s engagement with the African Commission **\[3.3\]**, it held a panel during its Session in the Gambia, October 2018, and invited HRIC researchers to regional seminars on implementation of decisions. The Commission’s strategy **\[5.4\]** and revisions to its new Rules of Procedure \(Rules 125\(2\) and \(10\)\), adopted in June 2020, incorporated two of HRIC’s recommendations: first, that the African Commission call on other actors, such as national human rights institutions, to provide it with information on the measures taken by the state to implement the decision and remedy the violations to the victims; second, that the Commission will start to publish information on its website on the status of such implementation. These measures will increase the visibility of the decision and the availability of information on its implementation, ultimately improving the likelihood of implementation. 

###  Improved monitoring of the implementation of judgments, decisions and recommendations of UN and African bodies 

 The UN Treaty Bodies \(including the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture \(SPT\), the Committee on the Rights of the Child\) are independent bodies that monitor implementation of their respective human rights treaties. HRIC’s research **\[3.2\]**, as well as Evans’ ten\-year practical experience as Chair of the SPT, resulted in the establishment of a high\-level group to develop a common position by Treaty Bodies for the General Assembly’s 2020 review of the UN human rights treaty body system. This process was achieved through Danish funding of a Wilton Park Meeting and Outcome Document **\[5.5\]** and a key meeting in Copenhagen. The meetings generated the position adopted by the Chairs of Treaty Bodies in June 2019 and which now represents the position of the Treaty Bodies entering into the 2020 Treaty Strengthening process. That the position of the Chairs of the Treaty Bodies, led by Prof Evans, is taken seriously is attested by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights **\[5.8\]**. Much of what they proposed is already being operationalised. 

 One of the most radical proposals – conducting reviews of human rights reports in regional settings rather than in Geneva – has now been implemented in March 2020 by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, meeting for the first time in Samoa. The opening of that session **\[5.9\]** makes it clear it is doing so because of the Chairs' position: ‘ *This is an historic and ground\-breaking moment for the history of United Nations human rights treaty bodies. For a long time, stakeholders and beneficiaries, including Governments and civil society organizations, have been asking to have meetings of treaty bodies closer to where they live. The Chairs of the treaty bodies in their most recent meeting in June of 2019, identified “review in the region” as one of their priorities for the future of the treaty body system. They agreed “that there are considerable benefits in conducting dialogues with States parties concerning their reports at a regional level”. So here we are\!*’ **\[5.9\]**. Research from HRIC staff **\[3.2\]**, therefore, has had far\-reaching impacts not only on the strategic direction of the UN treaty bodies’ work but also on their practical operations. 

 Based on their research **\[3.1\]**, **\[3.3\]**, HRIC staff, on the advice of the litigants, were granted leave to submit an *amicus curiae* brief in a Ruling on Reparations pending before the African Court against Kenya \(App.No.006/2012, *African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights v Republic of Kenya*\). The amicus related to the implementation of the judgment and has been cited as influential in the litigants’ arguments: ‘ *the submissions’ focus on the level to which the Court should detail the specifics of the remedy will be crucial to establishing a meaningful ruling which is capable of implementation. In addition, the focus on possible Court monitoring of the steps that the State has taken to execute the judgment will assist with setting a vital precedent for state reporting in respect of all future Court reparations rulings*’ **\[5.1\]**. The African Court has since sought further advice from HRIC on how it could hold compliance hearings. 

 Drawing upon HRIC research **\[3.1\]**, **\[3.2\]**, Murray commented on the framework proposed by a legal expert appointed to develop an implementation strategy for the African Court. One of her key recommendations was that the State be explicitly required to identify national focal points to facilitate follow\-up communication with the Court. This and other suggestions from HRIC research were incorporated into the strategy, with the expert noting that Murray’s comments ‘ *made so much sense that I reworked the draft framework based on them*’ **\[5.3\]**. The revised strategy, with the incorporated comments, was ultimately adopted by the African Court **\[5.10\]**. This will direct how the African Court approaches its role in monitoring implementation and what it will require of States. 

 Working closely with the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions \(NANHRI\) and drawing upon HRIC research that underscores the role of other actors **\[3.1\]**, Murray drafted NANHRI’s *Guidelines on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions in Monitoring Implementation of Recommendations of the African Human Rights Bodies*. These were adopted by NANHRI in 2015. As NANHRI attest: ‘ *The Guidelines have also been utilised in NANHRI’s support to \[National Human Rights Institutions\] in targeted countries such as Cote d’Ivoire and Kenya, where follow\-up activities on implementation of specific decisions of regional human rights bodies have been conducted. They have also been utilised in regional workshops for exchange of NHRIs experiences in the monitoring of implementation of decisions of regional human rights bodies, which have evolved to the Annual Exchange Forum at the margins of the Ordinary Sessions of the African Commission of Human and Peoples’ Rights. In light of this, it is without doubt that the Guidelines have immensely contributed to the improvement of NHRIs’ role in monitoring implementation of decisions and recommendations of regional human rights bodies in Africa*’ **\[5.6\]**. 

###  Improved Zambian governmental strategy on international human rights law compliance 

 One of the key findings from HRIC research was the importance of having domestic mechanisms that coordinate or take responsibility for the implementation of decisions **\[3.5\]**. The Zambian government, backed with funding from the Open Society Foundations, notes the crucial role of the HRIC, which led to the government amending its strategy on compliance and establishing a database to facilitate follow\-up and improve inter\-ministerial coordination. The Solicitor General noted that the HRIC involvement ‘ *has supported ongoing efforts to streamline the national process for the implementation of recommendations. … In particular, with your continued support, we are in the process of establishing a database for all communications, decisions and recommendations and reports received by the Ministry of Justice from the UN and African human rights bodies*’ **\[5.7\]**. 

###  Improved strategy and practice of leading human rights litigators 

 Drawing upon the findings of the ESRC\-funded project **\[3.3\]**, Murray developed a strategy for CSOs that litigate before supranational bodies, outlining practical ways that those organisations can encourage implementation. Murray is Vice Chair on the Board of the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa \(IHRDA\), one of the leading litigators in the African system. The Institute used her strategy to craft the reparations in their submissions when they filed the *Kilwa* case \(Communication 393/10: *IHRDA, ACIDH and RAID v DRC*\) **\[5.2\]** relating to the massacre of over 70 people in Kilwa. Victims were granted compensation of over USD2.5 million and the Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\) was called upon to prosecute those responsible, including a mining company complicit in the violations; provide apologies and construct a memorial; give psycho\-social support for victims; and rehabilitate the socio\-economic infrastructure including the school and hospital. The strategy was the basis for a workshop with local partners and victims in the DRC after the African Commission adopted the decision in 2018 when subsequently working towards its implementation. 

 The Chief Executive of IHRDA said the Murray strategy ‘ *has since become one of the most important and useful documents for the IHRDA. …It has made us rethink and refine our work on implementation. We now, for example, begin to think about implementation from the time a case is conceptualized, not after a decision is adopted or judgment delivered. We also have used the Strategy to develop roadmaps on implementation of decisions and judgments we have won recently*’ **\[5.2\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof Radosevic’s research explores innovation processes and ‘technology upgrading’ in emerging and transition \(i.e. post\-communist\) economies. He concludes that, in such economies, ‘smartly’ adapting and implementing existing technologies, with regard for local conditions, is often more appropriate than prioritising innovation. The smart specialisation approach reflects ’new’ industrial policy thinking which assumes that constraints to growth are not known in advance but need to be ‘discovered’ through an organised policy search process and appropriate methodology. This contrasts with conventional views on innovation policy. The research influenced perceptions of policymakers and international organisations: The European Union \( **EU**\); United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \( **UNECE**\); Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \( **OECD**\); European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \( **EBRD**\), and the World Bank. It impacted design and shaping of innovation policy across Central and Eastern Europe \( **CEE**\) and Former Soviet Union \( **FSU**\), with particular reference to developing smart specialisation policy and assessing the success of innovation policy. This allowed the development of more effective innovation policies.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For more than 20 years Prof Radosevic has explored innovation and technology as drivers of growth in emerging and transition economies. Specifically, his research points to differences in modes of innovation and innovation policies of countries whose growth is driven by technology import and non\-R&D capabilities \[ **R1**\]. The central idea comes from Schumpeterian growth theory \(Aghion et al.\) which argues that countries behind the technology frontier grow based on technology transfer and production capabilities rather than on frontier technology generation \[ **R2**\]. The challenge is how to design industrial and innovation policies so they promote modernisation and drive structural change in economies whose firms are laggards or followers. 

 Research by Prof Radosevic and colleagues has applied and developed this theoretical understanding of technology\-based growth in a specific region of the contemporary world: emerging and transition economies of CEE and FSU. Their new conceptual framework is called ‘technology upgrading’, defined as the process of enhancing technological capabilities of firms, sectors, regions or countries, as outlined by Radosevic and Yoruk in their 2018 journal article, \[ **R3**\]. Technology upgrading is not about the simple accumulation of stock of capital or productivity improvements at the existing technological level; rather, it is about the accumulation of a range of diverse capabilities \(production, technology, R&D, etc.\), their structural transformation and the coupling of domestic technology efforts to technology transfer. This framework has been empirically explored through comparative metrics and is being further developed by Prof Radosevic and colleagues in ongoing research. It is much more policy relevant for these economies than conventional innovation indexes like the Global Innovation Index. 

 Similar to other emerging economies, CEE economies do not grow based on research\-driven innovation, whereby domestic research produces innovation that leads to growth; instead, their innovation activities are about absorption and adaptation of knowledge embodied in imported equipment and inputs. However, this situation has not been reflected in policy, which has tended to be overly focused towards the traditional idea of research\-driven growth \[a finding within **R4**, **R5**\]. Existing policies neglect sources of productivity growth, such as management practices, skills, quality, and engineering. CEE countries would be better served by enacting policy that encouraged improvements in production and engineering capability \[ **R1**\]. This, in turn, would generate the demand for local R&D and innovation, which is currently low. 

 The research that forms the basis for the impact described in this study shows that the EU consists of a grouping of countries whose firms operate at quite different distances from the technology frontier. The future growth of Central and Eastern Europe \( **CEE**\) depends on upgrading technology and exporting and coupling domestic with international technology efforts, while improving their position in global value chains \[as detailed in **R4**, **R5**\]. A critical insight from Prof Radosevic’s research is that regional strategies are overly inward\-looking and that much more inter\-regional cooperation and opening regions to cooperation with global value chains is needed. Prof Radosevic explored this issue in his co\-authored paper which was published in full as a European Commission Joint Research Centre working paper, and in reduced form as an academic paper \[ **R4**\].  In a 2015 book chapter, Radosevic found that current policies in the region are not geared to these tasks, despite the availability of huge financial opportunities in the form of EU structural funds \[ **R6**\]. 

 The underpinning research received external funding, including European Commission \( **EC**\) H2020 and FP7, as well as Prof Radosevic’s appointment to a succession of expert assignments the EC Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy, the UN Economic Commission for Europe programme, World Bank, and German Organisation for International Cooperation. Funding was also received from the Romanian Agency for Higher Education and the EC for a book project.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prof Radosevic is recognised as one of the leading European academic specialists in innovation policy issues and as the leading expert for innovation and economic growth in the former socialist countries. According to a Head of Unit in the EC Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy \[ **A**\]: ‘Professor Radosevic has made an essential contribution to the development of innovation policies for less developed regions, which is recognised not only in the European Commission, but also by the World Bank, the OECD and many of our Member States’. Radosevic’s research has generated two lines of impact: firstly, within the EU, and secondly, outside the EU. 

 **Impact in the EU:** **Influencing the design and shaping of innovation policy in less developed EU countries and regions, with particular reference to smart specialisation policy: taking into account inter\-regional and global value chains.** 

 Prof Radosevic’s contribution is based on a body of research exploring the interaction between innovation and growth of CEE countries \[ **R1\-6**\] and expertise on translating research into policy. Between 2014 and 2020 Prof Radosevic assisted the EC Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy in evaluating \`smart specialisation' strategies in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Slovenia and also worked directly for the Croatian government. The Secretary to a Government Office in the Slovenian Ministry of Economy \[ **B**\] described his advice as being among ‘the most useful comments I have ever received to a programming document \- and I am working on this for the last 15 years’. From 2015\-19 Prof Radosevic served as Special Advisor to the EC Commissioner for Regional and Urban Policy. These high\-level appointments directly engaged Radosevic in the shaping of regional innovation policy in the EU. 

 **Prof Radosevic brought together policymaking communities**. 

 For example, as part of its activities to improve inter\-regional cooperation in smart specialisation, the EC asked Prof Radosevic, with Jacek Walendowski, to co\-author a comparative analysis, assessing synergies and areas of potential cooperation related to Smart Specialisation Strategies in Central Europe: this was published in 2016 as a 173\-page EC report. Based on this, Prof Radosevic was invited to moderate a Networking Workshop on Smart Specialization Cooperation in Central Europe in Zagreb in December 2016. Additionally, supported by funding from the Romanian Agency for Higher Education, Prof Radosevic gathered a group of 17 world and European experts in innovation policy to explore critically Smart Specialization Strategy \( **S3**\) in comparative international context \[ **R6**\].  With Dominique Foray \(Lausanne University\) and Kevin Morgan \(Cardiff University\), Prof Radosevic was invited to several important policy events, and they co\-authored two policy papers \(all authors having equal roles\) addressing the relationship between EU S3 and Research & Innovation policies \[ **C.1**, **C.2**\]. 

 **Radosevic’s research and advice helped shape EC policy**. 

 According to \[ **A**\], a Head of Unit in the EC Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy, ‘Radosevic’s work was particularly influential in shaping the conclusions that the European Commission drew about the need to adopt a specific approach to innovation in less developed Member States, in its Communication \[to the European Council and Parliament\] on Smart Specialisation and accompanying working document’ \[ **D**\]. Communication \[ **D**\] twice \(pp. 24, 32\) refers to research \[ **R4**\] by Prof Radosevic in the context of increasing realisation that the smart specialization strategies in 2020\-2027 period should strengthen the role of inter\-regional and global value chains. 

 \[ **A**\] further comments: ‘His work constituted a major contribution to the development of a new policy instrument for interregional innovation investments to be launched in 2021, which will have a dedicated budget for strengthening global chains in less developed regions… His work on innovation, productivity and global value chains in Central and South Eastern Europe has made a significant contribution to shaping the development of the policy… Many of Professor Radosevic’s suggestions in relation to smart specialisation in less developed regions and interregional cooperation were taken into account in the Commission’s 2018 legal proposals for Cohesion Policy, which have since been endorsed by Member States and the European Parliament’ \[in Communication **D**\]. 

 Furthermore, Radosevic’s joint advisory work with Profs Foray and Morgan helped shape the relationship between R&D and regional innovation policy in the next EC programming period \(2020\-2027\) \[ **C.1, C.2**\]. Their policy paper \[ **C.1**\] was one of the key materials accompanying the EC’s 2018 launch of a programme to support ten EU regions and two small member\-states \(Lithuania and Slovenia\) ‘develop or redesign strategies for regional economic transformation based on their smart specialisation priorities i.e. the regions' niche areas of competitive strengths’ \[ **C.3**\]. 

 **4.2. Impact beyond the EU. Developing a framework for assessing innovation policy in the UNECE \(UN Economic Commission for Europe\) economies: Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Western Balkan economies; applying S3 in EU candidate and Neighbourhood countries.** 

 In 2014\-2020, Prof Radosevic was involved in analyses of the innovation capacity of the UNECE economies. As a member of the UNECE Team of Specialists on Innovation and Competitiveness Policies, Radosevic has generated significant methodological impact in UNECE economies, which also has the potential for application to other emerging economies. 

 Since 2014 Prof Radosevic has acted as an expert assessing the innovation capacity of Ukraine, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Based on a favourable assessment of prior work in 2011 for Belarus, Radosevic was invited by the UNECE to participate in the second assessment of Belarusian innovation capacity, published in 2015 \[ **E**\]. \[ **F**\], an Economic Affairs Officer at UNECE, highlights Radosevic’s active involvement in developing ‘national reviews of innovation policy carried out at the request of UNECE Member States’, which he identifies as ‘the flagship capacity building product of the UNECE Innovative Policies Development Section.’ In 2015, Radosevic was invited by UNECE to contribute to a review of methodologies for assessing innovation capacities in UNECE. In 2018, Prof Radosevic was invited to develop a benchmarking exercise for assessing innovation policy in emerging economies, which would be suitable and implementable in UNECE economies. The draft methodology was discussed with UNECE economies country representatives and experts at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kyiv on 14.11.2017. Subsequently, the methodology was adapted and converted into the UNECE Policy Innovation Outlook \[ **G.1**\]. 

 Radosevic led on the production of a formalised method for assessing innovation policy which was piloted in the six Eastern Partnership countries \(Armenia, Azerbaidjan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine\) and in 2019\-20 as the Assessment Framework and Measurement Methodology for the Sub\-Regional Innovation Policy Outlook \( **SRIPO**\) \[ **G.1\-G.3**\]. This tool is based on research papers by Prof Radosevic, e.g. \[ **R3**, **R6**\]. The project, funded by **SIDA** \(Swedish International Development Cooperation\) was ‘based on a solid understanding of the economic, political, structural, historical, and institutional factors that strongly influence innovation\-led development’ in the region \[ **G.2**\], reflecting Prof Radosevic’s expertise in this area. \[ **F**\], a UNECE Economic Affairs Officer, notes that in 2020 SRIPO is being peer\-reviewed ’by leading international experts’ for extension to other UNECE countries. \[ **F**\] acknowledges ‘the exceptional impact of the conceptual and intellectual contributions \[to the project\] provided by Professor Radosevic.’ 

 Furthermore, because of his research on innovation capacities and innovation policies in emerging economies \[ **R2**, **R1**\], in 2016 Prof Radosevic was asked by the EC Joint Research Centre in Seville to explore the conditions under which the EU’s Smart Specialisation model \( **S3**\) could be applied in the EU enlargement and neighbourhood \( **E&N**\) countries \(i.e. the 7 candidate and 16 countries neighbouring the EU\). Radosevic was the main author of the ensuing \(2016\) report \[ **G.4**\], which has informed the EC’s development of its S3 approach to E&N countries. 

 Based on his understanding of innovation and industrial policy issues in the post\-Soviet region \[ **R2,R1**\] and his previous work on the analysis of innovation capacity in Ukraine, Prof Radosevic was invited by GIZ \(German Agency of International Cooperation\) to assist the Ukrainian government in its ongoing work on industrial policy and, as a continuation of this work, Prof Radosevic was asked by World Bank to lead a small team of researchers to explore technology upgrading in Ukraine, including its ICT sector. In 2019 the WB published their report ‘Path for Ukraine’s Economic Growth’ \[ **H**\], which directly draws on research by Prof Radosevic on technology upgrading. He also spoke at a number of internal events organised at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 

 In summary, as \[ **F**\] comments, Prof Radosevic ‘has contributed significantly to policy reforms to support sustainable development in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia’.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Alternative cultures, defined as self\-organised events and spaces of a creative nature, are important markers of urban vitality. Working in conjunction with nightlife activists in Geneva, and with festival directors from Prague Fringe, Hollands’ long\-term research on such urban cultures has created beneficial impacts for independent nightlife and festival stakeholders by: \(a\) raising their profile and representation in contributing to urban creativity; \(b\) aiding their capacity, networks, and sustainability; and \(c\) challenging existing policy\-making to recognise and account for the importance of the alternative sector in fields like culture, licensing, and tourism. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Hollands’ long\-term research and engagement with alternative urban cultures **\[PUB 1\-6\]** has been instrumental in defining them as self\-organised events and spaces of a creative nature, including independently organised nightlife and arts spaces, and some types of fringe festivals. It has also critically questioned some of the limits of standard models of urban regeneration achieved through mainstream cultural provision and conventional tourism, such as gentrification, over\-tourism, and a ‘one size fits all’ governance \(particularly licensing\) regime. Finally, it has asserted the important idea that ‘real’ urban creativity is rooted in the strength and sustainability of its alternative cultures, spaces, and movements, and that they provide the basis for imagining more democratic and sustainable models for cultural and tourism policy. Hollands’ research has been supported by the ESRC, with two grants, first in 2000\-2002 to investigate the operation of urban night\-time economies \(including alternative nightlife\) **\[GRANT 1\]**, then in 2008\-2009 looking at the transformative power of an alternative arts organisation **\[GRANT 2\]**. This research was supplemented by a later Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship \(2015\-2017\) which examined the potential alternative cultural organisations and movements have for enhancing urban creativity and change **\[GRANT 3\]**. Within these broader fields of enquiry, the two areas that have been directed to impact have been on defining and nurturing creative alternative nightlife and arts spaces in Geneva \(for the past decade\), and a body of work championing Prague Fringe as engendering new forms of cultural and tourism experiences \(going back nearly two decades\). 

 For instance, Hollands’ pioneering work with Paul Chatterton \(Newcastle University at the time\) on the night\-time economy, led to their significant research\-based methodological distinction between ‘alternative’ and ‘mainstream’ nightlife cultures and spaces **\[PUB 1\]**. In contrast to the alcohol based, commercial monoculture of the mainstream, they emphasised the experimental, accessible, and self\-regulating ‘do\-it\-yourself’ character of alternative nightlife, found in independent bars and clubs, cultural/ art squats, and the ‘free party scene’. They also outlined the need for this alternative sector to protest, organise, and create progressive pressure groups to challenge the dominance of the ‘corporate nightlife machine’. These research findings have had a particular resonance over the last decade with the alternative creative sector in the city of Geneva, which has had to combat soaring property prices, increased gentrification of cultural life, and draconian legislation preventing alternative venues from thriving \(i.e. anti\-squatting and licensing restrictions\) **\[PUB 2\]**. In 2010 Geneva experienced a wave of ‘night protests’ which set in motion a whole series of public reports, events, and debates centrally informed by Hollands’ and Chatterton’s research and methodology **\[PUB 1\]**. This impact pathway culminated in the creation and operation of an influential nightlife pressure group, called the Grand Council of the Night, as well as the emergence of other alternative cultural sector organisation, activity, and decision\-making **\[PUB 3\]**. 

 A related stream of research is Hollands’ work on the alternative cultural sector in Prague, particularly through his long\-term engagement \(18 years\) with the Prague Fringe, an independent and annual performer\-led theatre festival. Prague is an ideal case study because after the ‘Velvet Revolution’ in 1989, it rapidly developed as a culture\-led city experiencing significant ‘over\-tourism’. Following an initial report in 2005 concerned with how the Prague Fringe might survive in a city exploding with commercial culture and conventional tourism, Hollands produced three additional independent audience demographic and economic impact research reports on the fringe based on over 800 survey respondents \(2007, 2012 and 2016\) \(see webpage  [http://www.praguefringe.com/about/research/](http://www.praguefringe.com/about/research/) for report details\). The overall research focus has been on the need for the city council culture department to recognise the alternative cultural sector in Prague \(including the fringe\), specifically through the provision of separate funding streams **\[PUB 4\]**. Hollands further developed the idea that Prague Fringe was emblematic of an ‘alternative form of cultural tourism’ **\[PUB 5\]**. In this regard, the research demonstrated that small independent fringes like Prague are characterised by different forms of cultural production and exchange, non\-hierarchical structures \(including being gender friendly\), high levels of accessibility, and unique social bonding between performers, audiences, locals, and tourists. Also, it was noted that the Prague Fringe was importantly located in a less visited part of the city \(avoiding ‘tourist bottlenecks’\) and was also characterised by high levels of repeat visitors amongst its audience. In his most recent independent audience study/ impact report produced on the Prague Fringe **\[PUB 6\]**, Hollands’ research documented the combined economic, social, and cultural benefits of the festival for the city.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Details of the research impact will be presented as two case studies. Case 1 is concerned with enabling alternative nightlife in Geneva, while Case 2 focuses on the impact of research supporting the Prague Fringe. Whilst there are slightly differing emphases within the cases, the main types of impact discussed and evidenced here focus around: \(a\) raising their profile and representation; \(b\) contributing to capacity, networks, and sustainability; and \(c\) challenging orthodox policy thinking in the cultural, licensing, and tourism fields. 

 *Case 1. Alternative nightlife in Geneva: Enabling recognition/ representation, networks, and capacity* 

 The major impacts of Hollands’ research in Geneva include fostering alternative nightlife recognition and representation, as well as aiding the networking strategies and capacity of independent creative spaces. Pathways to creating this impact require a brief elaboration. Following an influential public presentation of their research **\[PUB 1\]** at the Electron Festival in the city in May 2010, Hollands and Chatterton’s ideas were directly picked up and implemented by a prominent cultural city councillor, André Waldis. This led to their ‘nightscape methodology’ of distinguishing alternative from mainstream nightlife being adopted in a highly influential survey of Geneva nightlife commissioned by the city culture authorities entitled *Journey to the End of the Night* \(2010\). The main finding of the survey was that there was a lack of alternative nightlife provision in the city, and this prompted a high profile week\-long public debate in 2011 called ‘General State of the Night’. Hollands was a keynote speaker and made specific recommendations about the need for the alternative sector to raise its profile and gain public representation through networking and making alliances **\[PUB 2\-3\]**. As a result of this event, a unique ‘pressure group’ concerned with nightlife issues comprised of professionals, practitioners, managers, and researchers, called the Grand Council of the Night \(GCN\), came into being in 2011. Within the entire REF impact period, the GCN has sought to raise nightlife issues and influence policy and law\-making particularly as they relate to the independent sector. Due to the direct impact of Hollands’ research recommendations **alternative nightlife concerns have been specifically well represented on this body to the present day**. Hollands’ influence is evidenced by a testimonial from the ex\-president of the CGN, who said, *‘In forming the group, we were conscious from Hollands’ research, that it was important that the alternative sector had adequate representation and a strong voice in the organisation…’* **\[IMP 1\]**. Alternative representation on the GCN body is also evidenced by the fact that four prominent alternative cultural organisations, the Association for the Living Reconversion of Spaces, Motel Campo, L’Usine, and the Federation of Kugler Artists, have served as members of this important nightlife pressure group throughout the entire REF impact period **\[IMP 2\]**. In addition to influencing the constituency of this lobbying body, the GCN has also used Hollands’ research to help create policies and laws that are advantageous to sustaining the alternative nightlife sector **\[IMP 1\]**. Specifically, they utilised the important idea of his that to maintain nightlife ‘diversity’ and encourage independent nightlife spaces, exceptions in the law \(specifically in the area of governance and licencing\) would have to be fought for **\[PUB 1\]**. In this regard, the CGN actively and successfully lobbied for exceptions in the formation of a new licencing law \(passed on January 1, 2016 **\[IMP 3\]**\), which allowed for events that are ‘primarily cultural’ not requiring state approval of an alcohol license, thereby benefiting alternative cultural providers in terms of avoiding extra costs and ‘red tape’. For example, one co\-founder of an alternative venue said of the legal exception: *‘It’s lighter in terms of infrastructure, we don’t have the same constraints, and we have more flexibility’* **\[IMP 4\]**. 

 Hollands and Chatterton’s alternative nightlife typology referred to above **\[PUB 1\]**, and Hollands’ related research **\[GRANT 3\]** emphasising the importance of developing a collective infrastructure for this sector **\[PUB 2\-3\]**, has also led to other significant impacts concerning **increasing networks and capacity of independent creative spaces**. For example, his research and participation in the event ‘Cultural Resistance, Urban Activism and the Arts’ workshop \(held in Leeds Sept 8, 2015 and attended by Geneva activists\) has fed into the networking activities of other cooperative ventures in Geneva beyond just nightlife. One such cooperative, the artist\-led Ressources Urbaines \(founded in December 2015\), who work with city authorities in Geneva to identify empty buildings and help to provide affordable spaces to alternative groups, have used Hollands’ research work to aid their infrastructural and decision\-making strategies. A spokesperson for the group has said *‘Hollands’ definition of what is meant by alternative and his research on the importance of creating an alternative infrastructure was useful for us in terms of our networking strategies and deciding on which kind of cultural practices we wanted to actually support’* **\[IMP 1\]**. The research has aided the organisation to distinguish exactly which types of artist groups they should offer spaces to, which has included helping hundreds of alternative artists to gain a foothold in the city. For example, they obtained places for 80 independent artists in one space alone in September 2017 **\[IMP 5\]**, offering further evidence that the research has indirectly contributed to increased growth in the alternative creative sector in Geneva. 

  

 *Case 2. Prague Fringe: Raising profile, ensuring sustainability, and influencing policy thinking* 

 The major pathways to impact in this case study include the production of audience and impact reports containing recommendations, a special participatory workshop \(see details below\), and interviews with key policy personnel in the city, with the main beneficiaries identified as fringe stakeholders \(directors and fringe staff, as well as audiences, performers, and culture/ tourism personnel\). Regarding **raising the profile** of the Prague Fringe to a range of constituents, Hollands’ 2016 impact report **\[PUB 6\]** has helped create awareness of not only what Prague Fringe is, but what extra benefits it can generate economically \(bringing in GBP640,000 into the city in 2016\), socially and culturally. Three hundred copies of the report were distributed to key stakeholders \(listed above\), and the Prague Fringe website containing the report has attracted over 2000 visits during the last three years. In addition to this, the research report was specifically sent to various culture and tourism personnel in the city to showcase the Fringe and was followed up by taped interviews. One prominent senior tourism and culture official said that the report showed *‘…the importance of the position of the festival in Prague’*, and that Prague Fringe *‘…has some special role’* in the city, while a spokesperson from Prague City Tourism said *‘…it has been more visible this year’* \(2017\), evidence that the report has helped **raise the festival’s profile** as a significant cultural event for two key decision\-makers **\[IMP 6\]**. A second type of impact of the research concerns its **beneficial effect on the Prague Fringe’s sustainability and growth \(capacity\)**. At the launch of the 2016 report, at a participatory workshop \(including fringe audience members, performers and staff\) entitled ‘Loving Your Work': Engagement, Impact, and the Prague Fringe’ \(October 2016\), presentations by two of the fringe directors revealed the importance of Hollands’ research in helping to sustain funding for the festival, with one key audience member and fringe supporter, later remarking *‘…without it \[the research\] I don't know if \[Prague Fringe\] fringe would have survived’* **\[IMP 7\]**. More specifically, one director of the Prague Fringe has said of Hollands that *‘…his research work has been utilised to secure future funding and helped shape decision making as we seek to make our fringe more responsive to our various stakeholders*’ **\[IMP 7\]**. Further evidence that Hollands’ 2016 research report findings have impacted on Prague Fringe funding and capacity, comes from the fact that it has helped them secure baseline funding by the local council from 2017 onwards \(CZK30,000 a year\), and aided capacity, in the form of a 30% rise in ticket sales from 2013\-2018 **\[IMP 8\]**. This has been achieved, in part, by recommending a ‘student discount scheme’, but also using Hollands’ research findings that the majority of fringe audience is female **\[PUB 5\-6\]**. This finding was utilised to help brand the 2018 event as ‘female friendly’ **\[IMP 9\]**.  A final type of impact **has been to use the research on Prague Fringe to influence alternative tourism strategies.** Research on the Prague Fringe shows the advantages of alternative forms of culture in terms of tourism, as fringe\-goers stay longer, are more likely to be repeat visitors, and inhabit less busy areas of the city than conventional tourists **\[PUB 5\-6\]**. In an interview with Hollands, a Prague city councillor with a special remit for culture and tourism, acknowledged that his research findings **\[PUB 6\]** show that alternative spaces like the Fringe *‘…is the way for the future development of tourism’* **\[IMP 10\]**. Additionally, after a visit by Hollands in May 2016 to discuss these issues with a senior strategy official of Prague City Tourism, the Prague Fringe, plus a range of other alternative cultural venues, were featured in the main 2017 spring tourism brochure for the very first time **\[IMP 10\]**, demonstrating that the research has influenced how key actors connected to city tourism are beginning to see the benefits of alternative cultures in both marketing and policy thinking. 

 In summary, while each case study here is unique, impacts common to both have been strategically focussed around raising the profile of the sector, increasing capacity, networks, and sustainability, and intervening in current policy thinking and decision\-making. Championing the alternative sector has been vital not only to its survival and growth, but in challenging the limits of current cultural and tourism policy orthodoxies.
