 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Identification of early\-stage lung cancer saves lives.  Liverpool’s lung cancer risk\-model has provided the UK with a clinically\-efficient, cost\-effective method for targeted referral of high\-risk individuals. Liverpool led the only random clinical trial to demonstrate that this risk\-based approach can be successfully used to identify patients for lung cancer screening. The findings played an essential role in establishing the potential of lung cancer screening for early diagnosis in the UK, with adopted protocols enabling early intervention now being used to inform approaches in Europe and China.  Notably, our work underpins introduction of the first NHS England \(NHSE\) lung screening programme \(>GBP70,000,000 between 2019 and 2023\), delivering lung health\-checks in seventeen localities utilising Liverpool’s risk model, as a model for national upscaling.  NHSE predicts identification of 3,400 cancers for early intervention by 2023. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **The Liverpool Lung Project \(LLP\) Risk Model** was developed from the LLP<sub>v1</sub> case control and cohort population \(LLP<sub>v1</sub>, JK\-Field\-PI\) \(3.1\). The LLP risk model was validated in two international case\-control studies UK cohort \(Area\-Under\-the\-Curve \(AUC0.82\) \(3.1\).  The risk model has been recently validated in the 76,000 UK Lung Cancer Screening \(UKLS\) responders to the first questionnaire \(AUC\-0.81\). The risk model has evolved and been updated to LLP<sub>v3</sub>, using sex and age specific incidence for the whole of England, providing a better estimate of absolute lung cancer risk \(3.3\).  LLP<sub>v2</sub> was used to select high\-risk individuals for the UKLS trial\-2011 \(JK\-Field Chief\-Investigator\) \(3.2\).  It was the largest clinical UK trial on the lung NCRI Portfolio \(2011\).  LLP<sub>v3</sub> has been recommended for implementation in the large NHSE lung screening programme \(3.3\). 

 **The UKLS trial:** true population\-based trial, including all Indices of Multiple Deprivation with 250,000 individuals approached \(3.4\); barriers to uptake were analysed; high\-risk population identified utilising the LLP<sub>v2</sub> \(5% risk over 5 years\) \(3.1\); unique set of findings; volumetric assessment of pulmonary lung nodules used in Radiology Reporting.  UKLS trial had well\-defined Care Pathway for the clinical management of patients with CT detected nodules; 67% were early\-stage lung cancer \(T1A/B N0\) \(3.5\); a very high proportion of the lung cancer patients identified by CT screening were suitable for surgical intervention \(83% vs 20% in routine clinical practice\) \(3.5\) \(3.4\); low benign resection rate 10%; psychological impact was found to be transitory; smoking cessation was successfully implemented \(3.5\); integrated smoking cessation with screening \(3.6\); UKLS cost\-effectiveness providing cost per QALY of screening, resulting in an estimate of around GBP8,500 per QALY gained for screening, well within the NICE guidelines \(3.4\). 

 **Implementation.** The UKLS trial outcomes were immediately taken\-up by the Liverpool CCG and setup of a Service Evaluation of lung cancer screening in the hard\-to\-reach areas in the Liverpool region \(JK\-Field on Liverpool Healthy Lung Project \(LHLP\) Steering Committee and joint evaluation with Queen Mary London\). The Liverpool CCG invested GBP3,000,000 into the LHLP. 2,591 patients were recruited in Liverpool, utilising the LLP<sub>v2</sub> risk model and demonstrated 2% lung cancers. 

 The UKLS publication stimulated similar early lung cancer screening projects in Manchester, Nottingham, London and Yorkshire.  In January 2019, NHSE announced a GBP70,000,000 investment into ‘Targeted Screening for Lung Cancer with Low Radiation Dose Computed Tomography’.  The Protocol for the Targeted Lung Health Checks Programme was prepared by NHSE Lung Cancer Screening Advisory Group \(JK\-Field Task & Finish Group\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Context.** Lung cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer \(21% for the UK between 2015 and 2017\).  There are 1,740,000 deaths per annum worldwide \(projected to rise to 2,890,000 by 2030\) with 25% of those occurring in Europe.  In 2012 Oxford health economists estimated that the cost to the UK economy was GBP2,400,000,000 per annum, higher than for any other cancer.  Although late\-stage lung cancer has a very poor prognosis, early\-stage cancer can be successfully treated by surgical intervention if diagnosed early.  Therefore, an effective method of detecting early\-stage cancer has the potential for significant long\-term economic and clinical impact. 

 Equivocal data from the 2011 NLST US lung screening trial did not prompt implementation of screening programmes \[5.1\].  A major barrier in the UK and Europe was the expense of large\-scale referral for lung screening \[5.1\].  The Liverpool LLP risk model introduced a more targeted framework of pre\-selection for screening, enabling high\-risk individuals to be identified, thereby providing a clinically efficient and cost\-effective approach to saving lives \[5.1\].  The Liverpool\-led UK Lung Cancer Screening \(UKLS\) study supplied robust new evidence, which accelerated implementation of lung screening programmes \[5.2\], as acknowledged by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition \[5.3\]. 

 **UK screening implementation and policy planning.** The Liverpool\-led UKLS directly led to five other local health providers introducing screening projects \[5.2\], and the NHS England \(NHSE\) lung screening programme \(GBP70,000,000 investment, 2019\-2023\), incorporating the Liverpool LLP risk model in screening programmes in ten additional sites \[5.4\].  NHSE is now delivering expanded lung health checks in seventeen localities \[5.4\].  NHSE predicts identification of 3,400 cancers for early intervention by 2023 \[5.4\].  In addition, the LLP risk model is being used to inform progress in policy and planning at EU\-level \[5.4, 5.10\].  NHSE’s programme is intended for future UK upscaling \[5.5\]. The NHSE Senior Programme Manager, NHS England & NHS Improvement stated that 14,000,000 high\-risk individuals are projected to be screened for lung cancer by 2028 \[5.5\]. Wales and Scotland are also now exploring implementation of lung screening referencing UKLS and LHLP and JK\-Field is an advisor to this work \[5.5\]. 

 The Independent Review of Adult Screening programmes in England \(2019\) references Liverpool’s role in the rationale for the new lung screening programme \[5.3\]. CEO of the Roy Castle Lung cancer Foundation acknowledged the contribution of LLP and UKLS to the NHSE programme \[5.6\]. 

 **Health economics and patient benefits.** The initial Liverpool\-led UKLS study demonstrated to UK government the financial feasibility of a programme of lung screening.  Independent health\-economic analysis established a quality adjusted life year \(QALY\) cost of GBP8,466, well within NICE guidelines \[5.7\].  Significantly, Liverpool has a disproportionately high incidence of lung cancer and UKLS demonstrated an effective way to tackle this \[5.2\].  Prompting immediate implementation \(2016\) of the UK’s first, and to date largest, lung screening pilot, ‘Liverpool Healthy Lung Project’ \(LHLP\), with an investment of GBP3,000,000 by the Liverpool CCG to tackle local health inequality.  Evaluation of ‘Liverpool Healthy Lung Project’ \(LHLP\) in 2018 showed that 1 death was avoided for every 300 scans and 86% of diagnoses were early\-stage, with 193 confirmed new Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder diagnoses, and 18% of current smokers agreeing referral to a cessation clinic \[5.2\]. Results from the NELSON lung cancer screening trial study in the Netherlands \(2020\) further confirm the merits of lung screening, achieving 24% mortality gains. 

 **International implementation.** As a measure of the extended reach of Liverpool’s impact in the field of lung cancer screening, a European expert on lung screening and recent Senior Editor of the British Journal of Radiology has commented that UKLS had “a major impact” on implementation of a UK programme, and notes JK\-Field’s “inexhaustible drive” to support international uptake, through major contributions to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and in interpretation of key European trial results \[5.6\]. JK\-Field was also invited to review lung screening in China, resulting in ten recommendations \(2019\) and is cited in China’s lung screening guidelines \[5.8\].  His Nature review of lung cancer screening \(2020\) presents international colleagues with a framework for further international implementation \[5.9\]. 

 The UKLS trial was the only RCT to demonstrate that a risk\-based approach can be successfully used to identify patients for lung cancer CT screening.  Together with the nodule management approach, that risk\-based approach has been recommended for adoption into policy by the European screening professions and EU Commission \[5.10\].  JK\-Field is called on to advise European countries \[5.10\], in particular the utilisation of the LLP<sub>v3</sub> risk model in Germany \[5.2\].  JK\-Field led the European Commission policy on lung cancer screening \[5.10\], led a roundtable discussion of European experts and also co\-developed the ‘European Position Statement on Lung Cancer Screening’ \[5.10\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Shared decision making \(SDM\) supports patients to make the best treatment choice after reviewing evidence\-based options with their clinician. Cardiff researchers led a major research programme which identified barriers to SDM implementation and developed a new ‘three\-talk’ SDM model, training and improved patient decision aids for use in clinical practice. The Cardiff model formed part of a Welsh training programme, with evidenced benefits \(e.g., the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service\). The dental workforce in Wales further adopted Cardiff SDM approaches in a training package released in late 2020 \(delayed from summer 2020 due to Covid\-19\). Cardiff’s research findings also provided evidence for UK SDM healthcare policies, and international guidelines which set minimum standards for patient decision aids. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Shared Decision Making \(SDM\) is widely accepted and evidenced as the gold standard approach to making healthcare decisions but is rarely implemented in routine practice. Patient decision aids are a critical tool in SDM, as a means of helping people make informed choices about healthcare that take into account their personal preferences. Cardiff research, via The Making Good Decisions in Collaboration \(MAGIC\) Programme, identified the key barriers to SDM implementation and produced a new model, as well as optimal formats for patient decision aids, and a training programme to facilitate SDM use in clinical settings. 

 In 2010, the Health Foundation commissioned MAGIC, a large\-scale SDM implementation programme working with clinical teams and patients in routine healthcare settings **\[G3.1, G3.2\]**. MAGIC was a joint research programme between Cardiff and Newcastle Universities where Cardiff led on developing a new SDM model for clinical practice, and Newcastle led on alternative ways to support SDM engagement and measurement within organisations, with both teams leading on different forms of training and patient decision aids. Via MAGIC, the Cardiff team identified barriers to successful implementation of SDM. For example, they found that clinicians **\[3.1\]**: 

-  believed that they already involved patients in decisions about their care; 

-  often reported that patients did not want SDM; 

-  lacked the right tools to implement SDM; 

-  did not have time to focus on SDM due to other demands on time. 

 The team also found that: 

-  patients felt unable to participate in SDM due to lack of knowledge, or due to the power imbalance in the clinician\-patient relationship **\[3.2\]**; 

-  providing patient decision aids \(e.g., information leaflets, website links\) to patients after consultations did not facilitate improved SDM **\[3.1\]**; 

-  there was no meaningful way of capturing the difference that SDM made to patients **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.1 Developing a new model for SDM in clinical practice** 

 The Cardiff team addressed these barriers by developing a new model designed to guide clinicians on how they could integrate SDM in patient consultations. The ‘three\-talk model’ was based on three stages of patient engagement **\[3.1, 3.3\]**: 

-  The first – choice talk – ensured that the patient knew that options were available and that they had choice in their decisions. 

-  The second – option talk – described the options available, including their evidence base \(risks and benefits\). 

-  The final stage – decision talk – focused on patient preference and sought to arrive at shared treatment decision. 

 The Cardiff team also found that the most important factor in enabling SDM was the communication skills of the clinician during a consultation **\[3.1\]**. They used their model to form the basis of an SDM Train the Trainer programme, where individuals receive training and then go on to train colleagues. The programme was underpinned by Cardiff’s research into the key barriers of SDM implementation, specifically that normalising SDM requires intensive work to ensure clinicians understand the purpose of involving patients in decisions about their care **\[3.3\]**. The SDM Train the Trainer programme combined skills training workshops, role play scenarios, and implementation planning, ensuring that clinicians and healthcare managers could routinely embed SDM in clinical practice, with adaptations across different clinical settings **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\]**.  The role play scenarios, in particular, were found to help clinicians explore what matters to patients, significantly improving communication of treatment risks and addressing attitudinal barriers **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.2 Understanding use of patient decision aids** 

 As part of their research, the Cardiff team also identified the most effective ways to share information about treatment options and risks using patient decision aids. Patient decision aids aim to provide evidence\-based information to help patients understand treatment risks and benefits, allowing them to engage in informed and effective decision making. Although multiple types of patient decision aids had been developed previously, the Cardiff team found that the most effective approach was a simple format based on frequently asked questions from previously tested tools **\[3.1\]**. Crucially, this approach of laying out each treatment option with its pros and cons, when used *within* a consultation, enabled clinicians to undertake SDM with patients, leading patients to better understand their choices. Clinicians reported a ‘handover’ effect with the use of the decision aids, with patients becoming more confident engaging in collaborative dialogue **\[3.1\]**. 

 With various patient decision aids already in existence and others in development, a means of verifying their credibility was required. Elwyn and Edwards used their research expertise to support development of the first internationally\-recognised quality criteria framework for patient decision aids **\[3.5\]**. Joseph\-Williams and Edwards subsequently coordinated research to identify minimum certification standards for new patient decision aids, which included forty\-four items split into three new categories: 1\) qualifying criteria – required in order for an intervention to be considered a decision aid; 2\) certification criteria – without which a decision aid is judged to have a high risk of harmful bias; and 3\) quality criteria – these strengthen a decision aid but do not present a high risk of harmful bias if not met **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff’s research on SDM was applied to support more effective clinical decision\-making as follows: 

-  training of NHS and Public Health Wales healthcare professionals throughout Wales, using the Cardiff ‘three\-talk model’ to support improved SDM in their organisations; 

-  embedding of SDM into clinical practice in the Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service \(Aneurin Bevan Health Board\), with agreement in place for this to be expanded across the dental workforce across Wales \(Covid\-19 impacted\); 

-  new UK SDM policies and international standards for the creation of patient decision aids in the US, Canada and Norway. 

 **4.1 SDM training in NHS Wales** 

 The Cardiff team worked with NHS Wales to embed and improve SDM as part of Public Health Wales’ ‘Making Choices Together’ programme \(2018\-2020\) **\[5.1\]**. Maria Gallagher, Senior Service Improvement Lead for Making Choices Together, confirmed: “ *The Cardiff team’s understanding of the barriers to the adoption of shared decision making…as well as expertise gained through development of patient decision aids and the 3 Talk Model…provided a strong foundation from which to deliver the programme*” **\[5.1\]**.The Cardiff team developed a training package based on the ‘three\-talk model’ **\[3.1, 3.3\]** which Gallagher stated was “ *delivered to two cohorts \[between 2018\-2020\] using the ‘train the trainer’ approach* **\[3.3\]**, *with 80 NHS Wales and Public Health Wales staff attending.  From our follow\-ups, 52 of those staff were still actively delivering training.”* **\[5.1\]**. Two more detailed examples of training aligned to Cardiff’s research are as follows. 

 **4.2 SDM embedded within clinical practice in Wales** 

 Based on involvement in the Cardiff Train the Trainer programme, a number of Welsh health services now actively use Cardiff’s SDM approach within their clinical practice: 

 **a. Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board** 

 Cardiff’s training resulted in all 120 clinical staff in Aneurin Bevan University Health Board’s \(ABUHB’s\) Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service being trained in SDM, with SDM now being used routinely throughout the service **\[5.2\]**. For example, SDM forms part of all mandatory treatment pathways that lay out evidence\-based treatment options for clinicians, with simple patient decision aids also used where available during consultations as recommended by the Cardiff research **\[3.1\]**. Rob Letchford \(Clinical Lead, ABUHB Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy\) noted that the training empowered clinicians “ *to have early conversations with patients so they could understand the options and risks and make good decisions about their treatment”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 This approach also had a positive impact on interactions with patients and explanation of treatment options. Sam Haworth\-Booth, ABUHB Musculoskeletal Service Manager, noted that before implementing Cardiff’s SDM approach, the Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy service saw a number of patients reporting a lack of awareness about their treatment \(particularly for knee replacements\), including the risks, the short\-term and long\-term impact on their lifestyle, and likely outcomes **\[5.2\]**. To respond to this need, the team decided to trial an SDM approach through the ‘three\-talk model’. Haworth\-Booth noted that *“Cardiff University’s Three Talk Model and the training and support we received through Making Choices Together provided the necessary framework for us to implement shared decision making in our practice”* **\[5.2\]**. The approach was trialled in 2017/18 and rolled out in 2019 for all 100 clinical and support staff. It has also been integrated into the service’s mandatory in\-house postgraduate training for physiotherapy staff \(approximately 20 per year\), as well as the clinical reasoning training which all team members attend at least once per year **\[5.2\]**. Haworth\-Booth noted that SDM has helped the Service to achieve “ *better structuring of our initial contacts with patients and information sharing*”, and a more consistent approach to outlining treatment options **\[5.2\]**. 

 **b. The dental workforce across Wales** 

 The Cardiff approach to SDM was also central in ongoing changes to dental services across Wales, which affect approximately 5,000 registered staff including dentists, hygienists, dental nurses and patients. Kirstie Moons, Associate Director for Dental Team Workforce Planning and Development for Health Education and Improvement Wales \(HEIW\), stated that the changes will improve patient services, and aims to take “ *a more patient\-centred approach to decisions about treatment”* as “ *decisions have historically been taken by dental professionals and passed on to patients in a patriarchal approach”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In 2018, the Cardiff team worked with HEIW’s Quality Improvement \(QI\) Educators to develop Cardiff’s training materials, described by Moons as “ *fantastic*” **\[5.3\]**, into an online training package available to all registered dental staff. Moons stated that *“Cardiff University’s research on shared decision making has produced a model that can be readily implemented in a clinical setting, supported by quality training materials*” and this was “ *a key element underpinning the delivery of our service reforms”* **\[5.3\]**. The training was launched in November 2020 \(delayed from summer 2020 due to Covid\-19\) and sessions with dental practices across Wales are now booked for 2021. A Prevention Plan leaflet for patients, based on the Cardiff approach to SDM, has been provided in digital format to all dental practices in Wales. Moons noted that all 5,000 NHS dental staff will be required to undertake the training as part of a contract reform process, and dental practices will be expected to evidence that they are using SDM **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.3 Influencing UK and international frameworks around SDM and patient decision aids** 

 **a. NICE guideline on shared decision making** 

 Cardiff research influenced the development of the NICE guideline on shared decision making. Published in December 2020 for public consultation, the draft guideline \(GID\-NG10120\) makes several recommendations based on Cardiff research, particularly in respect of embedding SDM at an organisational level **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\]**. The research influenced three of the key recommendations **\[5.4**, pp6, 8\-9 **\]**; for example, Recommendation 1.1.7 indicates that, as part of support for skills and competences, organisations should “ensure that training and development for practitioners in shared decision making includes the following: understanding the principles that support shared decision making based on the three\-talk model” **\[5.4**, p.6 **\]**. 

 The guideline goes on to explain the elements of the ‘three\-talk model’ **\[5.4**, p.14 **\]** and the value placed on the model by the guideline committee: “The committee heard expert evidence about using the three\-talk model as a way to structure the shared decision making process and they agreed that the interventions that showed an effect were all consistent with one or more of the stages of the three\-talk model. As well as this, the committee agreed that the three\-talk model was simple to understand and use and that made it useful in all healthcare settings” **\[5.4**, p.19 **\]**. 

 **b. Scottish Action Plan for shared decision making** 

 Cardiff’s approach to SDM is also cited in NHS Scotland’s *Making it Easier: A Health Literacy Action Plan for Scotland 2017\-2025,* published in 2017 **\[5.5a\]**. The Action Plan aims to improve people’s health knowledge, in part through a move to a culture of SDM. It refers to the findings of the MAGIC Programme **\[3.1, 3.2\]**, specifically the need to embed the SDM process across healthcare teams **\[5.5a**, p41 **\]**. The MAGIC Programme is also cited throughout the Scottish Government’s *What Works to Support and Promote Shared Decision Making: A synthesis of recent evidence* document. Particular reference is made to the MAGIC project findings about barriers to SDM implementation, the skills and tools needed by clinicians, and the need for organisational buy\-in **\[5.5b**, p23 **\]**. 

 **c. International Patient Decision Aid Standards \(IPDAS\)** 

 The International Patient Decision Aid Standards \(IPDAS\) collaboration has defined best practice in the development, content and evaluation of patient decision aids globally since 2005. Paper **\[3.6\]**, which contains the minimum standards for patient decision aids, was adopted in its entirety by IPDAS as one of the three versions of its standards – referred to as version 4.0 **\[5.6\]**. In the UK, the NICE guidelines on shared decision making recommend that all staff working in healthcare settings have access to quality patient decision aids as assessed against IPDAS standards **\[5.4,** p.11 **\]**. Additionally, IPDAS confirms that: “version 4.0 was used to inform the certification/approval programs established in different countries *”* **\[5.6\]**, for example: 

-  Washington State Authority passed legislation \(prior to the REF period\) that required patient decision aids to be evaluated using IPDAS; since April 2016, the State Authority has certified 41 patient decision aids, in areas such as maternity, joint replacement, end of life care and cardiac care **\[5.6, 5.7\]**. 

-  In Ottawa, patient decision aid developers must demonstrate that their aids meet the IPDAS criteria, before being approved by the Ottawa Patient Decision Aids Group **\[5.6, 5.8\]**. 

-  The Norwegian Directorate of Health also used IPDAS version 4.0 criteria to inform a set of quality criteria when reviewing patient decision aids for inclusion on the Norwegian health platform **\[5.6, 5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through policy interventions at globally popular social media companies, Dr. Ysabel Gerrard’s research has made platforms safer for people with eating disorders. Social media companies have been heavily criticised for lax regulation of posts about eating disorders, but Gerrard’s research has directly led Instagram and Tumblr to improve their policies and better protect vulnerable users. This research has transformed how potentially harmful posts are advertised on social media and changed the rules on what people are allowed to do and say. Extensive international media coverage of the findings has raised public awareness of eating disorders, encouraging people to seek help and, ultimately, save lives. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Rationale:** Eating disorders are on the rise in the UK and internationally, particularly among young women. According to Beat, the UK’s eating disorder charity, anorexia is the psychiatric condition with the highest mortality rate \( **R1**\). Before Gerrard’s research\-led interventions, social media platforms were plagued with content posted by users to promote the worsening of eating disorders like anorexia: so\-called ‘pro\-ana’ posts. Social media companies write their own policies and remove content that breaks the rules, via *content moderation.* But their policy teams previously lacked the expertise to understand what happens in eating disorder communities and how they should decide which posts to remove. This resulted in years of public criticism of inaction. Gerrard’s research addressed this issue, filling gaps in policymakers’ knowledge about how, exactly, people break social media companies’ rules to enact harmful behaviours. Following extensive media coverage of Gerrard’s research, Instagram and Tumblr approached her to lead transformative changes to their content policies. 

 **Research:** This impact case study draws on findings from three publications \( **R1, R2, R3**\). The underpinning research was conducted during Gerrard’s first year at the University of Sheffield, using digital methods such as covert online observations. 

 **Findings:** Gerrard’s research filled three main gaps in knowledge: 

1.  **Hashtag moderation:** Social media users often use hashtags \(e.g. \#proana\) to expose their posts to people beyond their ‘friend’ networks. Gerrard revealed that Instagram and Tumblr failed to restrict access to all hashtags that promoted eating disorders, exposing vulnerable users to distressing content \( **R3**\). *This finding highlighted the need for Instagram and Tumblr to restrict users’ access to <ins>more</ins> potentially harmful hashtags.* 

1.  **Username moderation:** Social media users generally choose a username, and while some people use their real name, others apply pseudonyms. Gerrard’s research discovered that Instagram and Tumblr did not restrict access to searches for usernames containing terms that promote eating disorders \( **R3**\). *This finding highlighted the need to develop <ins>new</ins> content moderation techniques that prevent users from choosing usernames that could be harmful.* 

1.  **Recommendation systems:** Social media platforms often show new content to users by collecting data on their browsing habits and using this to show them other things they might be interested in. However, Gerrard’s research revealed that Instagram and Tumblr recommend troubling content that promotes eating disorders, including for ‘miracle’ diet products \( **R1, R3, R4**\). 

 Gerrard also published her findings in a *WIRED* magazine article \( **R1**\), in order to share the findings with technology industry workers from a broader range of companies.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Gerrard’s research has led to wide\-scale policy changes at two of the world’s most popular social media companies: Instagram and Tumblr \(1 billion and \~400 million active users worldwide respectively, Statista, 2020\). \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 Her work also attracted the attention of the UK Government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation \( **S2**\) stating “ *The research highlighted the need for Instagram and Tumblr to <ins>change</ins> how their recommendation systems work, to avoid suggesting dangerous content to vulnerable users*”. Instagram and Tumblr have acted on all of the research recommendations. 

 Gerrard’s findings prompted multiple forms of impact for three beneficiaries: policymakers at Instagram and Tumblr, social media users who are suffering or recovering from an eating disorder, and members of the public. The significance of the impact is as follows: 

 **Instagram:** As a direct result of the media coverage Gerrard’s research \( **R3**\) received, she was invited to become a member of Instagram and parent company Facebook’s Suicide and Self\-Injury \(SSI\) Advisory Board, to contribute expertise to content policies about eating disorders \( **S1**\). 

 \[Text removed for publication\]. Gerrard’s research brought to the Board: 

-  First, the research and its subsequent publicity – which influenced a BBC investigation \( **S5**\) – \[Text removed for publication\] led to users searching a *“much greater”* range of hashtags. This information has decreased the number of pro\-eating disorder posts on Instagram: \[Text removed for publication\]. Thanks to Gerrard’s interventions, this means fewer people are posting dangerous content to Instagram and are instead using the platform’s resources to seek help. 

-  Second, Gerrard’s research informed a new Instagram policy banning advertisements for weight loss products making ‘miraculous’ claims about their power to help people lose weight \( **S6**, **S4**\). Gerrard was the only expert cited in Instagram’s press release, which said: “ *We’ve sought guidance from external experts, including Dr Ysabel Gerrard in the UK, to make sure any steps to restrict and remove this content will have a positive impact on our community of over 1 billion people”* \( **S6**\). The Girlguiding charity was one of many organisations to highlight the value of the policy, saying “ *every step like this helps build a world girls want to live in”* \( **S7**\). 

-  Third, the research led Instagram to transform how it recommends content to users on its Explore page \(which shows users new images they might be interested in seeing\) \( **R1, R2, R3**\). \[Text removed for publication\]. As a result, Gerrard worked with Instagram to tighten the criteria a post needs to meet before it can be recommended to people. This will decrease the chance that users will be exposed to posts promoting eating disorders. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 **Tumblr:** Tumblr has changed its content moderation policies in <ins>two</ins> key ways as a direct result of Gerrard’s research. First, after an invited visit to meet with Tumblr’s CEO and key policy figures, the company changed how it recommends eating disorder\-related content to its users: \[Text removed for publication\]. Without this research, Tumblr would not have taken urgent steps to reduce the risk that graphic content might appear on a users’ feed. 

 Second, Gerrard authored Tumblr’s resources for Mental Health Awareness Month \( **S9**\). Almost 400 million Tumblr users can access Gerrard’s post to learn about eating disorders and be signposted to health services. \[Text removed for publication\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Damian Tambini’s research concerns the governance of mixed public–private media systems as a core institution of democratic legitimacy. His research led to the establishment of new legal concepts and frameworks for constraining the rapidly growing power of platforms, protecting media plurality when assessing media mergers, and regulating election campaigning in the UK and Europe. Tambini’s research on self\-regulation restrained the UK government from pursuing an internet regulation model that blurred the boundary between illegal and harmful content, which would have undermined freedom of expression. The research informed new Council of Europe \(CoE\) standards that shape the regulation of platforms and inform binding legal decisions by the European Court of Human Rights on media regulation and free expression. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Tambini’s 2008 book *Codifying cyberspace* \(co\-authored with Danilo Leonardi and Chris Marsden\) became an early and influential examination of self\-regulation of online harms, and of the complex relationship between freedom of expression, media law and self\-regulation **\[1\]**. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach informed by legal scholarship and regulation of ‘analogue’ media, it set out a distinctive, holistic approach to understanding the political economy of digital platforms and the possibilities \(and limitations\) of media governance tools **\[1\]** **\[2\]**. 

 In 2012, Tambini and Craufurd Smith showed that the historical emergence of media plurality law since the mid\-20th century established a rationale for interventions to protect media plurality that has not been erased by digital abundance. The research set out the limitations of the media plurality tests used in many democracies, revealed the weakness of arguments for deregulation, and showed how indices used in competition law could be adapted to measure public exposure to news and thereby establish fixed limits on media ownership **\[3\]**. The research examined why the algorithms used by new internet intermediaries complicate regulatory interventions. It then set out how public interest tests and other checks on media power could take these challenges into account **\[2\]** **\[3\] \[4\]**. To identify the implications of these market transformations for public media, Tambini led a 56\-country study **\[5\]** that revealed an overall decline in the audiences for public service broadcasting and state\-controlled media between 2005 and 2010. The study found that digitisation and increased choice did not make publicly funded media untenable, and that digitisation did not appear to have led to increased state control of public service media **\[5\]**. 

 By contrast with research on the value or limitations of either market or public sector approaches, Tambini examined the overall challenges faced by mixed public–private media systems in democracies. His research showed how communications regulators must be able to draw on a range of fiscal, competition and content policy tools to protect the public interest in a digital environment, innovatively combining self and co\-regulation **\[2\] \[6\]**. In response to a government proposal that new legislation should place platforms under a duty of care to their users, Tambini emphasised the need for a *differentiated* duty of care that creates lower compliance costs for some platforms and some categories of harm by distinguishing legal and illegal content **\[6\]**. In the *Journal of Media Law* **\[6\]**, Tambini pointed out that the proposed blurring of the line between legal and illegal content could have a significant and problematic impact on freedom of expression, and set out how combining clear legal standards with market incentives could reduce online harms without undermining free speech and democracy. 

 Tambini has paid particular attention to the use of internet intermediaries such as social media for electoral campaigning, which have great potential to undermine democratic legitimacy. His analysis of how these intermediaries have evolved into media gatekeepers showed how the actions of companies such as Facebook depart from previous normative expectations for ethical behaviour and public accountability, and risk new forms of targeted propaganda **\[2\] \[4\]**. His research investigated Facebook campaigning during the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 General Election **\[4\]**. Through interviewing campaigners, and reconstructing their profiling practices, analysing publicly available campaign spending data, and combining this with data scraped by an innovative crowdsourcing platform, Tambini showed how Facebook was driving a new approach to campaigning by offering a one\-stop shop, selecting and filtering information and targeting it based on increasingly elaborate data profiles. He further showed how this has undermined the legal frameworks that limit the role of financial contributions in elections with the aim of maintaining a level playing field, instead enabling campaigners to game campaign regulation **\[4\]**. He has monitored how public policy responded to such changes with new approaches to mitigating the effects of platform power **\[2\]** **\[7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Tambini’s work on how media policy can constrain media power and thus protect democratic legitimacy during the current digital transformation impacted on three areas: regulation of online political campaigning; media plurality law and regulation; and platform governance. His research has directly impacted decisions by the UK government, regulations of the communications regulator Ofcom, and recommendations from numerous parliamentary committees and government policy. His research has had an impact on decisions of communications regulators and electoral commissions across Europe and, in particular, on decisions of the CoE, the body that makes Recommendations \(non\-legal binding acts\) on how the 47 member states should protect democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Recommendations are to be implemented in the national law governing the 820 million citizens of CoE states. 

 **Online political campaigning** 

 In 2015, Tambini was appointed as an Independent Expert of the CoE’s Committee of Experts on media pluralism and transparency of media ownership. In this capacity, he was asked to prepare the CoE’s new feasibility study on the internet and elections. This study, which drew on the underpinning research on media plurality and on the limits and scope of internet self\-regulation **\[1\]** **\[2\] \[7\]**, set out a new approach based on Tambini’s advice that new forms of online campaigning should engage the CoE’s duties to protect democracy and human rights such as freedom of expression. The final report, *Internet and electoral campaigns* **\[A\]**, directly cites **\[7\]** in identifying weak points in electoral and media legislation. It concluded that the current regulatory framework no longer suffices for maintaining a level playing field for political contest, restraining media power, and limiting the role of money in elections. Consistent with Tambini’s research recommendations, the report argued that data protection law, campaign finance regulations and media law interventions needed to be combined in a holistic approach to reform. 

 The report was cited by the Venice Commission, which provides legal advice to EU member states, in its 2018 report on disinformation **\[B\]**. It led to the CoE announcing in July 2020 that it would prepare a new Recommendation on the internet and elections **\[A\]**. 

 Tambini’s research on online political campaigning was described as ‘timely and prophetic’ **\[C\]** by Urška Umek, Secretary of the CoE’s Steering Committee on Media and Information Society. Tambini has served this Steering Committee as a member of its Committee of Experts on Media Pluralism and Transparency of Media Ownership \(MSI MED\) from 2015–17 and its Committee of Experts on Media Environment and Reform \(MSI\-REF\) since 2019. MSI\-REF will prepare a standard\-setting proposal on election communication and media coverage of electoral campaigns, and establish guiding principles for media and communication governance to address the shift from established channels to social networks and related risks \(manipulation of public opinion, lack of public trust, information disorder\). Describing how Tambini’s research can contribute towards the fulfilment of these objectives, Umek said: ‘... this will provide a really good basis for any standard setting or guidelines which may be undertaken by the CoE’ **\[C\]**. 

 Tambini’s research on online political campaigning has also influenced and informed public debate about the integrity of elections. *The Observer*’s 2018 revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data to target its users with political messages in 2016 prompted growing public disquiet about the role of social media in elections, the power of digital platforms and the inadequacy of current regulation. Tambini's research contributed in the expert debate to a shift from a focus on individual misdemeanours to the wider question of the evolution of media power and regulation of intermediaries. This drove debate on the legal and policy frameworks and options for reform, and contributed to an enhanced public understanding in the UK on how the democratic process risked being undermined. It shifted the discussion from largely technical issues towards the normative and policy principles at stake **\[4\]**. Carole Cadwalladr, the journalist who broke the story, quoted Tambini extensively in her newspaper articles between 2016 and 2019 **\[D\]**, and has attested to the policy relevance of his research and its role in catalysing debate on this issue: ‘Damian Tambini’s research is extremely useful in setting out the legal and policy frameworks and options for political advertising. He has been instrumental in pushing the debate forward on new forms of propaganda and their corrosion of trust in democracy’ **\[E\]**. 

 Tambini contributed articles to *The Guardian* \(November 2016, April 2018 and June 2018\) and the *New Statesman* \(April 2019\), and gave a public lecture at the National Theatre in February 2018 **\[F\]**. These interventions helped to illuminate previously obscure technical issues of media regulation, and enabled civil society to engage with these issues at a time when their impact on democratic legitimacy was widely seen as in crisis. The 2016 *Guardian* article was widely shared, receiving 240\+ comments. Tambini’s relevant policy briefs have also achieved high download figures: a policy working paper on online campaigning was downloaded 7,682 times; another on fake news, 14,839 times; and a chapter on social media and elections **\[4\]**, 2,874 times **\[G\]**. These interventions contributed to a change in the direction of UK government policy on political campaigning from a laissez\-faire approach to a more pro\-regulation approach. Tambini \(with Martin Moore\) also contributed to the Electoral Reform Society’s *Reining in the political ‘Wild West’: Campaign rules for the 21st century*, warning that digital campaigning was outpacing the slow work of European and national regulatory reform **\[H\]**. 

 **Media plurality law and regulation** 

 The legal concept of media pluralism emerged to protect democracies from the propaganda effects of newspapers and broadcasters in the second half of the 20th century. Tambini’s work on this subject has influenced UK policy debate, led regulators such as Ofcom to apply the law and concept of media plurality to internet intermediaries in new ways, and informed CoE standards on media plurality and transparency of media ownership. 

 In 2014, Tambini was invited to present evidence to the House of Lords Communications Committee Report on media plurality and ownership. The Committee’s report **\[I\]** cites the underpinning research findings on media plurality and the importance of a national market focus for regulation. The following year, Ofcom submitted advice to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on a measurement framework for media plurality. Informed by Tambini’s finding that intermediaries’ impact on news flows must be taken into account by regulators \(cited in Ofcom’s November 2015 report **\[J\]**\), Ofcom advised the Secretary of State to consider the specific features of online platforms rather than treat them as news sources or wholesalers. Since 2015, when Ofcom calculates the impact of a proposed media merger, the regulator has taken into account the role of online platforms in news flows. The existence of this framework has deterred further consolidation between new media and mainstream media companies, offering democratic processes some protection from new concentrations of media power. 

 Between 2015 and 2018, Tambini also served as a member of the CoE’s Expert Group on Media Regulation and Plurality. Selected as a rapporteur for this group, Tambini has drafted a series of reports and co\-drafted Recommendations. Tambini’s research informed a new Recommendation on media plurality and transparency of media ownership **\[K\]**, adopted by the CoE in 2018. The new standard provided for in the Recommendation recommends that the 47 national signatories to the CoE Convention legislate so that citizens know who owns news companies, including \(for the first time\) those that distribute on digital platforms. This will be implemented in each national signatory’s domestic law. 

 **Platform governance** 

 Tambini’s advice to the UK government and Parliament has also focused on counteracting disinformation on digital platforms. He appeared before several parliamentary inquiries charged with tackling this issue, including private briefings to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee Inquiry on ‘fake news’ and the House of Lords Digital Democracy Committee. His submitted evidence on internet self\-regulation \(based on **\[1\]** **\[2\]** and **\[4\]**\) was cited extensively in the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications’ *Regulating in a digital world* report **\[L\]**. Tambini’s interventions helped to shape government policy by identifying ways that market solutions can be combined with competition regulation and co\- and self\-regulation **\[2\] \[6\]**. Tambini gave evidence against an ad hoc approach that seeks to regulate individual speech acts, advocating an approach that addresses systemic and competitive problems. This was the approach adopted by the House of Lords **\[L\]** report and confirmed by the government response to that report **\[M\]**, further confirmed in the 2020 appointment of Ofcom to the role of the Digital Authority, also recommended by the House of Lords report. 

 Tambini’s research on the need for a differentiated duty of care **\[6\]** prompted the government to change its governance approach from that outlined in its 2019 *Online harms* White Paper. The original White Paper envisaged a unitary regime applying to all internet intermediaries, and both harmful and illegal content. Tambini’s contribution to the subsequent consultation **\[6\]** set out a new approach that established stronger duties of care for the larger platforms and illegal content, and a transparency regime for others. The government’s response to consultation **\[N\]** contains a proposal for such a differentiated duty of care. This change was described by Graham Smith on the media blog Inforrm **\[O\]** as ‘perhaps the most significant policy development compared with the White Paper’, while Smith also attributes this change to Tambini's submissions to the consultation. A 2019 House of Commons Library briefing paper on social media regulation **\[P\]** set out Tambini’s critique of a uniform duty of care in detail. According to Nicola Aitken, head of Online Counter\-Disinformation for the UK government, his research had ‘been really valuable in helping us shape our thinking and policy proposals on disinformation’ **\[Q\]**. 

 In December 2020 Tambini accepted an invitation to be a member of the UK government’s Counter\-Disinformation Policy Forum. This group of 20 external experts includes all major social media platforms and eight academics working directly with the Minister of State to design co\-regulatory solutions for COVID\-19 disinformation. Tambini was repeatedly invited to present his research to the international body representing European Communications Regulators. 

 Tambini’s work on platform governance impacted European regulators. In 2019 Tambini was invited by the CoE to submit a report on policy approaches to information disorder. The report **\[R\]** provides a template for CoE policy in this area.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Until 2015, all jobseekers in Germany were legally required to sign ‘integration agreements’ \(IA\) – contracts which stipulate jobseekers’ rights and obligations in the job search process. Research led by Prof. Gerard van den Berg at the University of Bristol demonstrated that IAs are not beneficial for individuals who have good prospects of becoming re\-employed within the short term. 

 As a direct result of this research, in 2015 the German government swiftly abolished compulsory IAs for jobseekers with good employment prospects. The policy change, which remains in place today, affects up to 1.4 million jobseekers each year. It has led to time savings for the unemployed and employment offices alike, with caseworkers now able to help their clients search more intensively for vacancies. Further, the change has improved the job seeking experience by creating more trusting relationships between jobseekers and their caseworkers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Integration agreements \(IA\) play a role in many unemployment insurance \(UI\) systems around the world. An IA is a mandatory contract between a jobseeker and their employment office which stipulates the jobseeker’s rights and obligations in the job search process. It is signed by the jobseeker and their employment office caseworker. IAs are a legal requirement of the job seeking process in Germany and were an important element of the reforms to the country’s social insurance and welfare system that took place in the early 2000s. This wider package of reforms has been widely credited as pivotal in the resurgence of the German economy since 2005. 

 However, there is no clear evidence on the effectiveness of IAs in helping jobseekers re\-enter employment. Questions have, thus, been raised over their impacts. For instance, there are concerns that IAs may consume time and energy that could otherwise be used to support jobseekers more intensively in their job search process. Further, they may be a source of friction or annoyance given that they do not represent a mutual agreement between jobseeker and employment agency. 

 Van den Berg has helped fill in key knowledge gaps by providing valuable evidence on the effects of IAs in Germany.  He was asked by the German Federal Employment Agency to assess the effect of IAs on job search outcomes for unemployed individuals. This invitation came thanks to his world\-leading reputation in econometrics; in 2009, van den Berg was the first scientist outside of natural and medical sciences \(and the only economist until 2013\) to receive the highly prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Professorship Prize \(i\). 

###  Do IAs help the unemployed find work? A randomised controlled trial 

 In collaboration with the German Federal Employment Agency, van den Berg led a research team in the design of a randomised controlled field experiment of 5,300 newly unemployed workers across Germany \(3.1, 3.2\).  He conducted the study in conjunction with the Institute for Employment Research \(IAB\), an office of the German Federal Employment Agency. The IAB, which has a comparable standing in Germany to that of the Institute for Fiscal Studies \(IFS\) in the UK, jointly implemented the study with van den Berg’s research team in 2013. They trained hundreds of caseworkers throughout the country and set up a digital randomisation tool that randomly assigned jobseekers to one of two IA ‘treatments’: 1.\) signing an IA three months after entering unemployment, or 2.\) signing it six months after entering unemployment. 

 The data from the experiment became available on 15 April 2015. Van den Berg and his team analysed these data during May\-July 2015. This critical stage of the research immediately followed his appointment to the University of Bristol on 1 May 2015. The early stages of the investigation – designing and setting up the study – had taken place in Germany whilst van den Berg was employed at the University of Mannheim. He first wrote up his analysis of the trial results in a paper published in 2016 by the IAB \(3.2\), and later in a working paper, published by the University of Bristol in 2020 \(3.1\). 

 The experiment built upon preliminary stages of the project, whereby surveys with caseworkers \(conducted 2012\-2013\) revealed that nearly three\-quarters would prefer to decide on a case\-by\-case basis whether and when to sign an IA. Respondents felt that the associated time savings could be used to help jobseekers search more intensively for vacancies**Footnote:**

[http://doku.iab.de/kurzber/2014/kb2214.pdf](http://doku.iab.de/kurzber/2014/kb2214.pdf) 
. 

 Van den Berg designed a novel econometric approach for evaluating the rich administrative and survey data that emerged from the trials. Together with Gesine Stephan \(Professor, IAB, Friedrich\-Alexander\-University Erlangen\-Nuremberg\), Barbara Hofmann \(Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Mannheim and IAB Nuremberg\) and Arne Uhlendorff \(Postdoctoral researcher, CNRS, CREST, IAB\), he compared outcomes for the two different IA treatments one year after each person first entered unemployment. The study also considered the likely employment prospects of the individuals, as judged by their caseworkers, in terms of qualifications, the local job market for their profession and other such influencing factors. 

###  ‘No significant effect’ 

 The central finding from the analysis was that, overall, IAs had no significant effect on durations of unemployment. However, outcomes varied according to jobseekers’ re\-employment prospects. IAs had an insignificant effect for individuals who were already considered by their caseworkers to have good prospects of finding work within the short term. The evaluation concluded that IAs do not speed up the re\-employment of these individuals, who represented 41% of jobseekers in the study. Conversely, there was a small positive effect for those who signed an IA at three months who were classed as having poorer labour market prospects and who were predicted by their caseworkers to be unemployed for more than six months.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 On average over 2015, approximately 1,950,000 people, or 4.6% of the labour force**Footnote:**

 OECD Labour Force Statistics 2019, Germany,  [https://doi.org/10.1787/a4d8a3eb\-en](https://doi.org/10.1787/a4d8a3eb-en) 
, were unemployed in Germany at any one time. Relative to that stock, the flow of people becoming unemployed each month was very substantial, around 250,000 each month, which is the relevant base population for this case. Introduced in the early 2000s in Germany, IAs for the unemployed provide some transparency and are intended to make the job seeking process more efficient and binding. However, previous to van den Berg’s research \(3.1, 3.2\), it was not *a priori* clear if they also improved the labour market prospects of unemployed individuals. 

 The research findings provided clear evidence on the effects of IAs for the unemployed in Germany. Notably, they showed that IAs did not speed up re\-employment for individuals with good prospects of finding work within the short term. These findings have affected many of these individuals and their employment offices through the abolition of compulsory IAs under certain circumstances as detailed below. 

###  Abolition of compulsory IAs for jobseekers with good prospects 

 The study led to a formal and comprehensive change in Germany’s IA policy. Specifically, the German Federal Employment Agency decided that, from December 2015, the use of an IA for a client with good labour market prospects will be at the discretion of their caseworker during the first three months of unemployment \(5.2\). 

 The German Federal Employment Agency’s decision to change the IA guidelines was made very quickly after the research team completed the evaluation and communicated its results at a policy meeting \(held 21 July 2015\) with the German Federal Employment Agency and relevant Ministries. This was thanks to the research team’s internal role within the IAB, and collaborative nature of the work with the Agency, who consequently had high levels of trust in the evaluation’s results and recommendations. 

 Several official sources confirm this impact of the study on the policy. Official German Federal Employment Agency guidelines regarding the use of IAs, dated 8 December 2015, stipulate this policy change and explicitly refer to the results of the evaluation study as the motivation: 

 “*The research project on Integration Agreements \(IA\), about the moment at which IA are signed in Unemployment Insurance, has shown that IAs are generally useful as a policy instrument in job search assistance and advice, but that they fulfil their role better if used in a more flexible way. In particular, among clients with favourable employment prospects, the early usage of an IA is often unnecessary.”* \(translation from German\) \(5.1\). 

 The Director of the IAB, also a member of the board of the German Federal Employment Agency, comments: “ *The evaluation study by Van den Berg and Stephan played an essential role in the decision to change the policy rules for the Integration Agreements. ... Without their study, it would not have been possible to assess the effectiveness of the policy. ... I can also personally attest to the fact that the study results have been pivotal in motivating the policy change.*” \(5.2\). 

 The impact of the study on IA policy is further corroborated in an IAB policy brief \(2018\): “ *In response to the findings of van den Berg et al. \(2016\) the Federal Employment Agency adjusted their guidelines for dealing with integration agreements in the unemployment insurance system \(SGB III\). Since December 2015, placement specialists and career counsellors have more discretion in deciding on the date of the initial integration agreement for a sub\-section of jobseekers in the jurisdiction of SGB III. This flexibility is based on the idea that the placement specialists can best assess in which cases an immediate integration agreement is required*.” \(translation from German\) \(5.4\). 

 The role of van den Berg’s research is again highlighted in a 2018 report from the German National Audit Office concerning IAs for welfare recipients \(5.3\). The National Audit Office argue in this report that IA policy usage should account for variations in the labour market, citing van den Berg’s research on IAs for the unemployed \(3.2\) to build their argument. 

 IAB conducted a survey with over 2000 randomly selected caseworkers in May 2016, six months after the policy change to explore its implementation \(5.5\); of this number, 850 responded. Of the 88% of the respondents who were aware of the policy change, approximately two thirds were taking advantage of the additional discretion. 

###  Benefits to jobseekers and employment offices 

 The policy change has led to time savings for employment offices and jobseekers alike. Discussing the contents of an IA and signing it usually takes 10 to 15 minutes per client \(5.2, 5.5\). To put this into perspective, 41% of jobseekers in van den Berg *et al’s* study \[3.1\] had high employability and the Director of the IAB reports that “ *the number of newly unemployed clients with good prospects can be as high as 1.4 million per year*” \(5.2\). Thus, the overall amount of time saved across the population is considerable.  This time saving gives caseworkers more time to devote to helping their clients find vacancies and return to work.  IAB’s 2016 survey \(5.5\) showed that caseworkers used the time savings for several purposes: 

  -  For the consultation \(79% of respondents\) 

  -  For a more intensive joint job search \(66%\) 

  -  For documentation and follow\-up work \(41%\) 

  -  For additional conversations \(16%\) 

  -  For clerical / back office work \(31%\) 

 Further, 65% of surveyed caseworkers exploiting the discretion introduced after the policy change said that postponing or discarding IAs had led to a more trusting relationship with the client, primarily because it creates transparency and certainty on both sides \(5.5\). 

###  Effects on German policymaking processes 

 Van den Berg’s study on IAs for UI recipients has changed German policymakers’ approach to using research to inform strategy. It has led to an ongoing research partnership between the government and van den Berg which provides a framework for investigating related policy issues using randomised controlled trials. 

 IAB’s Director explains: “ *After our excellent experience with the ""Integration Agreement"" experiment, our Institute is strongly supporting the usage of Randomized Controlled Trials for evidence\-based policymaking. We are currently conducting a range of successor experiments*.” \(5.2\). These studies include a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of IAs for the long\-term unemployed in receipt of welfare \(unaffected by the UI policy change in 2015\), conducted by van den Berg’s research team and commissioned by the Federal Employment Agency. The Director of the IAB notes of this study: “ *The outcomes of this ongoing project will be of utmost political interest, as several kinds of sanctions are tied to Integration Agreements in the welfare system*.” \(5.2\). 

 Further, the German National Audit Office have called for urgent policy change for the long\-term unemployed in their 2018 report \(5.3\) which cites the effects of van den Berg’s UI study \(3.2\) to help make their case that IA policy usage should account for variations in the labour market. The use of IA policy for long\-term unemployed welfare recipients has been under increased scrutiny and highly debated of late following the publication of this National Audit Office report – and its accidental leak to the media. The report highlights concerns surrounding the implementation of IAs for the long\-term unemployed.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at Aston University into seawater greenhouse technology was initiated by Davies who joined Aston in 2005 after completing a Royal Society Industry Fellowship at University of Warwick \(2003\-2005\) with sponsorship by Seawater Greenhouse Ltd \( [https://seawatergreenhouse.com/](https://seawatergreenhouse.com/)\). A programme of applied research was established at Aston, in continued collaboration with the company. Investigating the psychrometric properties of concentrated seawater was the starting point to develop a better understanding of seawater cooling and humidity control for agricultural greenhouses. As part of Davies’ start\-up package, Aston supported a PhD student to work on seawater cooling technology through thermodynamic modelling and experimental work. Facilities were set up for measuring the key properties of seawater and seawater brines, enabling several useful semi\-empirical correlations to be obtained for engineering design work **\[R1\]**. This was strengthened by collaboration with the Sfax solar salt works in Tunisia that supplied samples of seawater brines for analysis and testing **\[R2\]**. The PhD project included the construction of bench models and validation of models for the design of cooling systems **\[R3\]**. 

 In 2007, in parallel to the above PhD project, EPSRC awarded £712k under the programme ‘Energy and International Development’ with Davies as PI **\[G1\]**. The project investigated enhanced biomass production and energy conversion in rural, water\-scarce communities in India. A key outcome was a new highly efficient desalination concept that was well suited to treatment of brackish groundwater where energy is available as heat \(e.g. from solar or waste heat sources\). The concept results in minimal waste product, a concentrated brine, that can be used to cool greenhouses, enabling water efficient crop cultivation, and producing salt as a by\-product. The research developed prototype solar\-driven desalination and fan ventilation systems, that were tested over several months at Aston University **\[R4\]**. A pilot greenhouse later installed at GB Pant University of Agricultural Technology in India demonstrated for the first the use of desalination reject brine to cool a greenhouse **\[R5\]**. 

 An Innovate UK\-DFID project was awarded in 2015 to Davies and Generalis under the Agri\-Tech Catalyst programme **\[G2\]**, in collaboration with Seawater Greenhouse Ltd and Pastoral and Environmental Network in the Horn of Africa \(PENHA\). The aim of this project was to simplify and improve the technology for use in developing countries for which the level of investment required by the earlier systems would not be feasible. The simplified design made use of wind\-driven ventilation and low\-cost net cladding, in place of polythene or glass greenhouse cladding. Due to the bimodal climate in Somaliland, the prevailing winds blow mainly from two opposing dimensions and the design had to accommodate this. The complex wind pattern and permeable cladding gave rise to a challenging modelling and design problem that was a addressed using numerical techniques developed by Generalis and Akinaga, who created bespoke code for fast execution of year\-round modelling using weather data as inputs, making use of expertise from Generalis and Akinaga in solving Navier\-Stokes equations representing turbulent flows **\[R6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Seawater greenhouses are enabling sustainable crop cultivation in arid world regions. They use seawater for both cooling and irrigation making them independent of freshwater resources. They are powered by renewable energy so are not dependant on fossil fuels. Seawater greenhouse technology is helping address food security, climate change resilience, resource scarcity and population expansion. The following impacts arising from Aston research are claimed. 

 **Impacts on Commerce and the Economy – supporting improved capacity/capability to deliver design services \(Seawater Greenhouse Ltd** \-  [https://seawatergreenhouse.com/](https://seawatergreenhouse.com/)\) 

 Seawater Greenhouse Ltd has benefitted from many years of research collaboration **\[S1,S5,R1\-R6\]** with Dr Philip Davies and, in more recent years, Dr Sotos Generalis that have supported the company “to offer consultancy, design, construction and project management services in their construction” **\[S1\]**. During the current REF period, this culminated the development of design tools embedding Aston\-developed modelling algorithms which eliminates the “long process of trial and error *”* from the design of greenhouses **\[S1\]**. This was first deployed in the design options for the seawater greenhouse in Somaliland \(see below\). The tool enables the design of facilities to take account of local conditions by using as modelling inputs location specific data such as wind direction and velocities. The “design of seawater greenhouses for each locale is accelerated from months to minutes *”* and “enabled deployment of Seawater Greenhouse technology in less economically prosperous countries *”* **\[S1\]**. 

####  Impacts on Production \- demonstrating economically viable food production facilities in arid countries \(Sundrop Farms, Pastoral and Environmental Network in the Horn of Africa \(PENHA\), Red Sea Farms\) 

 *Sundrop Farms \(* [https://www.sundropfarms.com/](https://www.sundropfarms.com/)\): The experience gained in the EPSRC project with photovoltaic powered\-fans combined with evaporative cooling was applied to the design of a project for Seawater Greenhouse Ltd, in a joint venture with Seawater Greenhouse Australia, through a consultancy arrangement **\[S1\]**. This project was to construct an initial pilot seawater greenhouse covering 2000m<sup>2</sup> at Port Augusta, Australia \[ **S2**\], which was taken forward by Sundrop Farms which established itself in 2012 as an independent company at which time the joint venture with Seawater Greenhouse Ltd was discontinued **\[S1, S2\].** In 2014, Sundrop Farms scaled up its operations in attracting investment of $US100 million enabling the construction of a 20\-hectare commercial greenhouse that incorporates seawater cooling. In their total $AUS200 million **\[S3\]** facility, Sundrop farms now produce 10\-15% \(350 tonnes/week; 17,000 tonnes/year\) of Australia’s truss tomatoes and employing 150 workers **\[S3, S4, S5\]**. 

 *PENHA \(* [https://www.penhanetwork.org/](https://www.penhanetwork.org/)\): The Horn of Africa is the most food\-insecure region of the world \- some 40% of world food aid goes to the region costing the EU alone more than 1 billion euro p.a. By 2050, the population is predicted to increase by 150%. The Seawater Greenhouse process uses solar energy and seawater to provide a new source of fresh water and a cooler and more humid climate, enabling high crop yield with optimised water use efficiency as evaporative cooling typically reduces crop water demand by 60\-80%, compared to open\-field cultivation. 

 As a result of the findings from the Innovate UK\-sponsored research, construction costs have been lowered from $US100 to $US20 per square metre of cultivated area **\[S1\]**, demonstrated by the seawater greenhouse commissioned in Somaliland in 2017. In 2018 the facility reported its first harvest **\[S6\];** see also  [https://mailchi.mp/d56cf06c0ac8/penha\-newsletter\-june\-2018](https://mailchi.mp/d56cf06c0ac8/penha-newsletter-june-2018). This project also involved the development by Aston of a Decision Support Tool that incorporated turbulent fluid flow modelling and simulation algorithms. Local data on wind speeds and directions are used as an input to the tool with the outputs being data that enables key design parameters for the greenhouse to be identified. The Somaliland system makes use of integrated desalination and salt production as proposed in earlier research at Aston **\[R6\].** 

 *Red Sea Farms \(* [*https://redseafarms.com/*](https://redseafarms.com/) *\)*: Researchers at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology \(KAUST\) spun out a company to develop saltwater greenhouse technologies to encompass new build and retrofit applications as well as provide consultancy services on saltwater and desert agriculture. Davies was invited to KAUST in 2012, and three times subsequently, to advise on desalination strategies for a design study on commercial saltwater greenhouse facilities for food production. In 2018 Red Sea Farms was spun out of KAUST and attracted $US1.9 million funding to build a 2,000m<sup>2</sup> greenhouse to scale up production aiming to produce 50 tonnes/year of tomatoes annually by 2021 **\[S7\]**. Red Sea Farms also operates several production facilities producing fresh tomatoes to seven markets in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia \( [https://redseafarms.com/produce/](https://redseafarms.com/produce/)\). 

 Recognition for this and preceding projects was given by the national Shell Springboard prize for low\-carbon businesses \(£150k\) which was awarded to Seawater Greenhouse Ltd in May 2018 **\[S8\]**.

 **‘The literary scholar Will Kaufman has made a remarkable discovery.’** 

 — Jeet Heer, *The New Republic*, 21 January 2016 

 Kaufman began researching the US balladeer Woody Guthrie in 2008, when he won the first of his two BMI\-Woody Guthrie Fellowships to conduct research into Guthrie’s unpublished writings—notebooks, letters, song lyrics, prose manuscripts—housed in the Woody Guthrie Archives in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Three books have emerged from this research: *Woody Guthrie, American Radical* \(Illinois UP, 2011\), *Woody Guthrie’s Modern World Blues* \(Oklahoma UP, 2017\) and *Mapping Woody Guthrie* \(Oklahoma UP, 2019\). In 2014, while on his second trip to the archives, Kaufman discovered a tranche of writings, letters and song lyrics by Guthrie excoriating the racist housing policies of his Brooklyn landlord, Fred C. Trump in the 1950s. At the time, it appeared to Kaufman as nothing more than an historical curiosity; but in 2015, when Trump’s son Donald announced his candidacy for the US presidency, Kaufman realised that, from beyond the grave, Woody Guthrie had something to say about the racist legacy of the Trump empire. After Kaufman published his findings in January 2016, they were frequently referenced in public commentaries during the US presidential election cycles of 2016 and 2020, as well as the mid\-term elections of 2018. High\-profile musicians put the unearthed lyrics to music in recording and performance \[C\], and the material informed television documentaries \[D\] and biographies \[G\] of both Guthrie and the Trump family, as well as Kaufman’s own TEDx presentation \(18.8k views on YouTube as of 8/1/21\) and his song\-and\-spoken\-word ‘live documentary’, *Woody Guthrie and ‘Old Man Trump’* \[D\]. 
","
 **Underpinning research:** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Kaufman has always focused on the political and social dimensions of Guthrie’s writing. His research process has involved poring over the archival materials, extracting relevant evidence and drawing verifiable conclusions—about \(for instance\) Guthrie’s activism \[1\] \( *Woody Guthrie, American Radical*\), his relation to modernity \[2\] \( *Woody Guthrie’s Modern World Blues*\) or the impact of time and space on his consciousness \[3\] \( *Mapping Woody Guthrie*\). The primary sources uncovered in Tulsa in 2014 indicated to Kaufman that, in Guthrie’s estimation, the Trump legacy was one of corruption and race\-hatred. As he wrote in one of the discovered notebook entries concerning his landlord: **“I suppose Old Man Trump knows / Just how much / Racial Hate / he stirred up / in the bloodpot of human hearts / When he drawed that color line…”** Kaufman unearthed two unpublished prose\-poem essays \(‘Beach Haven Race Hate’ and ‘Racial Hate at Beach Haven’\), two song manuscripts \(‘Beach Haven Ain’t My Home’ and ‘Trump Made a Tramp Out of Me’\), and letters in which Guthrie discussed Fred Trump’s racist policies. Kaufman examined these discoveries in the contexts of the balladeer’s voluminous writings on fascism and Jim Crow racism in the 1950s, his travels and performances, his biography, friendships and political agitation. In addition to Kaufman’s two articles in *The Conversation* \[K\], a TEDx presentation and his ‘live documentary’ performances \[G\], his underpinning research fed into chapters in his two most recent monographs, *Woody Guthrie’s Modern World Blues* and *Mapping Woody Guthrie* \[2,3\].

 **4. Details of the impact:** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Kaufman’s archival discovery of the previously unseen Woody Guthrie lyrics led to two major *Conversation* pieces: in January 2016, ‘Woody Guthrie, “Old Man Trump”, and a Real Estate Empire’s Racist Foundations’ \[B\] \(923,943 views\) and in September 2016, ‘In Another Newly Discovered Song, Woody Guthrie Continues His Assault on “Old Man Trump”’ \[B\] \(61,597 views\). These pieces highlighted Guthrie’s experiences of a racially segregated Beach Haven community in New York and the opinions of his landlord Fred Trump. The unearthed lyrics left **“no doubt over Trump’s personal culpability in perpetuating black Americans’ status as internal refugees – strangers in their own strange land.”** \[B\] The publication of these pieces coincided with the 2016 presidential election and contributed to the creation of new cultural artefacts linking Donald Trump to the racist policies of the Trump real estate empire. In turn this shaped and informed public and political debates during the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. 

 <ins> **The co\-production of new cultural artefacts**</ins> 

 The song popularly known as ‘Old Man Trump’ \[C\] was crafted by Ryan Harvey out of quoted extracts from Kaufman’s first *Conversation* article \[B\]. A fellowship of high\-profile American musicians subsequently performed and/or recorded these lyrics. First, Harvey, Tom Morello \(of Rage Against the Machine and Prophets of Rage\) and Ani DiFranco released their collaborative version of ‘Old Man Trump’ just in advance of the 2016 election. Johnny Irion and US Elevator contributed a separate version of ‘Old Man Trump’ \[C\] to the online resistance project *, 30 Days, 30 Songs* \(latterly retitled *1000 Days, 1000 Songs*\), **“written and recorded by musicians for a Trump\-free America”** and described by the *Washington Post* as **“a playlist of songs that Donald Trump will hate.”** \[F\]  Other noted singers who have performed live and recorded versions of the lyrics include Lucinda Williams, Glen Hansard, Jared Tyler, The Prophets of Rage \(with Chuck D and Tom Morello\), Tim Grimm, the Last Internationale and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy \[C\]. 

 The versions by Ryan Harvey and Tom Morello, Johnny Irion, Tim Grimm and The Last Internationale \[C\] show a combined 152,656 YouTube views \(as of 6/1/21\) \[C\]. YouTube indicates that a number of these pioneering versions have inspired subsequent versions—covers of covers—by lesser known musicians and singers who have posted their performances, such as Middle Class Joe, Pete Sinjin, the Missin’ Cousins, 101, and the New Ashgrove Players, whose combined YouTube viewing numbers are 440,500 \[C\].  In April 2020, during the run\-up to Trump’s re\-election campaign, two\-time Grammy\-nominated singer\-songwriter Eliza Gilkyson released her album *2020*, which includes her song, ‘Beach Haven’ \(2,040 views on YouTube as of 6/1/21\),  **“based on a letter in the Woody Guthrie archives that Woody had sent to Fred Trump about his segregated apartments.”** \[C\]  As she explained on her website, **“This record was born out of a visceral desire to promote unity, commitment and action during this epic showdown of people versus power and truth versus lies.”** \[D\] 

 Beyond strictly musical performance, the popular *Daily Dollop* podcast by US comedians Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds broadcast an episode \(300A\) on Donald Trump \[D\], including a discussion of Kaufman’s Guthrie findings, which earned 20,049 views on YouTube and 24,741 listening’s on Soundcloud \(as of 6/1/21\) \[D\]. 

 Kaufman’s archival research fed into his song\-and\-spoken\-word TEDx presentation, *Woody Guthrie and the Art of Making Good* \[D\], presented in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in April 2017, with a live audience of over 200 \(including Guthrie’s daughter Nora and the eminent US composer David Amram\). YouTube viewings of this presentation have numbered 18,823 \(as of 6/1/21\) since its posting on 19 May 2017.  Finally, there is Kaufman’s own public performance, a ‘live documentary’, Woody Guthrie and ‘Old Man Trump’\[D\], presented at over 35 public venues in the US, UK, and the European continent between April 2018 and March 2020 \(when COVID curtailed further performances\)—at arts festivals, civic theatres, music clubs, bookshops and art galleries—with average audience numbers ranging between 10 and 100 per performance. 

 <ins> **Shaping and informing public and political debate**</ins> 

 Kaufman’s first *Conversation* article on Guthrie/Trump \[B\] has to date earned 922,393 readings, with full reprintings in *Gawker* \(367,999 hits\), *The Raw Story* \(174,663\), *Quartz* \(74,623\), *The Guardian* \(38,193\), *New Statesman* \(17,221\), *Scroll.in* \(15,547\), *History Buff* \(5,472\), *Sun Times National* \(4,066\) and *Newsweek* \(1,792\) \[E\]. It garnered 69,602 Facebook shares and 3578 Tweets. Kaufman’s second *Conversation* article on Guthrie/Trump \[B\] has earned 60,978 readers and reprintings in *The Raw Story* \(21,593\), *Scroll.in* \(18,634\) \[E\], and other combined sources totalling 20,746. It had 1,655 Facebook shares and 230 Tweets. 

 Kaufman’s findings went global and helped to shape political discourse that was critical of Trump during the time of his presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020. Using Woody Guthrie’s lyrics, uncovered by Kaufman, popular news pieces were assimilating Donald Trump with his father Fred, thereby informing public debate during the periods of increased political mobilisation:  *The New York Times*, ‘Woody Guthrie Wrote of His Contempt for His Landlord, Donald Trump’s Father’ \(25 January 2016\); *Time*, ‘Woody Guthrie Wrote Songs About Donald Trump’s Dad’ \(21 January 2016\); *Washington Post*, ‘The Unbelievable Story of Why Woody Guthrie Hated Donald Trump’s Racist Dad’ \(20 June 2020\) and *The New Republic*, ‘Woody Guthrie Wrote Some Moving Lyrics about Donald Trump’s Racist Dad’ \(21 January 2016\) \[F\]. The uncovered lyrics were also helping to shape and inform international discussions on the presidential campaign and included *The Australian*: ‘Trump’s Father Discriminated Against Blacks, Woody Guthrie Lyrics Claim’; *Toronto Star*: ‘Song Lyrics Reveal Why Woody Guthrie Hated Donald Trump’s Dad’; *Journal de Montreal*: ‘Woody Guthrie avait denonce le racism du pere de Trump’; *Rolling Stone* \(German edition\): ‘Woody Guthrie nannte Trump schon vor 65 jahren einen rassisten’; *Monitor* \(Hungary\): ‘Folk pjevac Woody Guthrie prezirao je svog stanodavca Trump’; *Deccan Chronicle* and *Asian Age* \(India\): ‘The Making of a Radical in America’; *Blitz* \(Portugal\): ‘A estranha ligacao entre Woody Guthrie e Donald Trump’; *Quotidiano* \(Italy\): ‘Woody Guthrie cantava contro Trump fomenta lodio razziale ma era il padre’; *La Vanguardia* \(Spain\): ‘Apartamentos racistas de los Trump – Woody Guthrie’ \[F\]. Such pieces certainly fed into the broader international discussion of Donald Trump’s positions on race during the presidential campaign of 2016. A strong indication of the material’s potency returned in June 2020 with a *Washington Post* article ‘“Racial Hate”: A Famed Folk Singer, Trump’s Dad and Angry Lyrics at a Tulsa Landmark’ \[F\] in advance of Trump’s Tulsa rally. The rally was considered controversial and insensitive due to its location at the site of a race massacre in 1921 and was hosted on the 19<sup>th</sup> June, a date of celebration honouring the emancipation of African Americans. Posted comments on the article include **: “‘As the show tune from **South Pacific** says, ‘You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught.’ And Donald Trump was”** and **“Astounding\! THE folk hero of America knew the truth in 1950\!”** and **“Bruuuuuuuuce\! \(Springsteen\). My brother American, we need you to record this song\!”** 

 Kaufman’s research had an impact beyond the presidential election cycles of 2016 and 2020. During the US midterm elections of 2018, two high\-profile articles appeared in the US press. October 2018 saw John Whitlow’s ‘Trump Is Just Another Crooked New York City Landlord’ open in the *New York Times* \[F\] with Guthrie’s Beach Haven writings. The following month, Amanda Petrusich published ‘A Story about Fred Trump and Woody Guthrie for the Midterm Elections’ in *The New Yorker* \[F\], writing: **“Will Kaufman, a Professor of American literature and culture at the University of Central Lancashire, in Britain, was the first researcher to discover the lyrics in Guthrie’s considerable archive. Earlier this week, I went to see them in person.**”  Petrusich’s conclusion may be taken as a strong and telling impact indicator: **“Gazing at his lyrics, in Tulsa, the morning before Election Day, I felt a brief and welcome punch of faith.”** \[F\] 

 <ins> **Enhanced cultural understanding of issues and phenomena:</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 Kaufman’s work resulted in enhanced cultural understanding on both highly personal and public levels. Woody Guthrie’s daughter, Nora Guthrie, indicates in the online documentary *Even if Your Voice Shakes* \(2019\) \[D\], produced by Ryan Harvey, that Kaufman not only helped to rewrite the history books on Guthrie, but he also helped the Guthrie family themselves understand their own history: **“We were able to move out of our little apartment in Coney Island to this bigger apartment in Beach Haven. Of course, as a little child I didn’t think anything was wrong, and it wasn’t until many years later, when Will Kaufman did the research, that I realised that it was a segregated community.”** \[D\] 

 On the more public level, in 2018, Bohemia Films commissioned Kaufman as chief consultant and contributor to the BBC\-TV 4 documentary, *Woody Guthrie: Three Chords and the Truth* \[D\], first broadcast in March 2019 and subject to a public screening and talkback at the sixth anniversary celebrations of the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, in April 2019. The documentary includes a substantial section on the Guthrie\-Trump connection, with Nora Guthrie declaring forcefully to the camera **: “Woody’s a fighter, and there’s a time to fight. And I don’t want any misunderstandings about what this is about: this is about the Trump family and their racist history.”**  A host of reviews reflect the impact— *The Financial Times* \(5\-stars\): **“Politics, history and Trumps repeating themselves … a new BBC documentary charts the life and times of the singer\-songwriter, which are perhaps not so different to our own”**; *The Sunday Times* \(Critic’s Choice\): “ **\[The film\] takes off when it examines specific songs … and an attack on a racist landlord—Donald Trump’s dad”**; *The Observer* \(Pick of the Day\): **“Handsomely illustrated with archive footage, this fine programme features contributions and intelligent observations …**”\[F\] 

 <ins> **Shaping and informing public attitudes and values**</ins> 

 In addition to the wealth of news coverage and documentary prompted by Kaufman’s research, a significant body of biographies and studies on both the Trump family and Guthrie have been informed by it. David Cay Johnston’s *The Making of Donald Trump* \(2016\) \[G\] and Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher’s *Trump Revealed: The Definitive Biography of the 45th President* \(2017\) \[G\] situated Guthrie’s writings in the context of the broader history of racial discrimination in the Trump real estate empire. One of the essays in Bandy Lee’s edited collection, *The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President* \(2017; updated 2019\) invokes Kaufman’s findings to conclude: “ **Unlike Trump, I was fortunate to watch my father come home daily from saving lives as a physician. I can only imagine how ashamed I would have felt if my father had been accused of being racist by anyone, much less a famous composer.”** \[G\] In similar psychological territory, the publication of Mary Trump’s familial memoir, *Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man* \(2020\) \[G\] sparked a review essay in the *New York Review of Books* \(24 Sept. 2020\) \[D\] drawing on the Guthrie connection to critique the Trump empire’s history of dishonesty and profiteering as well as racism: **“Woody Guthrie, who lived at Beach Haven in the early 1950s, wrote a song, never recorded, about Old Man Trump’s racist rental practices; the feds later investigated Fred and Donald for racial discrimination.”** \[G\]  Martha Brockenbrough’s *Unpresidented: A Biography of Donald Trump* \(2018\) uses Guthrie’s phrase, unearthed by Kaufman, to discuss the father’s socially malign influence upon the son: **“The folk singer Woody Guthrie moved into a Trump apartment in December 1950 and came to write an angry song about Trump stirring up hated ‘in the bloodpot of human hearts’ .… His son Donald, in elementary school when Guthrie wrote his song, would stand accused of racism along with his father.”** \[G\] 

 Two recent sociological/societal studies utilize Kaufman’s research on Guthrie to critique more public and less biographically focused issues. Kevin Young’s *Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post\-Facts and Fake News* \(2017\) \[G\] discusses Guthrie’s anti\- Trump writings as implicit interrogations of mendacious real estate euphemisms. Kenneth S. Schmitz’s *Physical Chemistry: Multidisciplinary Applications in Society* \(2018\) \[J\] uses Guthrie to discuss the relationship between race and physical structures \(buildings\) and legal structures \(the 1968 Fair Housing Act\).  Finally, the latest biography of Guthrie, Gustavus Stadler’s *Woody Guthrie: An Intimate Life* \(2020\) \[G\] draws on Kaufman’s research to expand upon existing conceptions of Guthrie, inviting America and the world at large to re\-vision the iconography of the ‘Dust Bowl Balladeer’ and see him as a social critic ‘attuned to the problem of whiteness’—an analysis never before articulated comprehensively in Guthrie studies. 

 <ins> **Contribution to widening public access to and participation in the political process**</ins> 

 The adoption of Kaufman’s findings by amateur and professional musicians in new versions of ‘Old Man Trump’ and ‘Beach Haven Ain’t My Home’ has transcended beyond merely providing new forms of artistic expression. These publicly available reimaginations of Woody Guthrie’s lyrics have provided an open forum for members of the public to engage with the political process surrounding the US presidential elections of 2016 and 2020, when Fred Trump’s son Donald Trump was running for office. Over 60 years after the lyrics were written by Guthrie, they are continuing to provide new and innovative methods of widening public access to key elements of modern politics. These re\-recordings have been successful in engaging with the public on a large scale and providing a platform via video comments for public discussion. 

 These postings have enabled grassroots musicians to engage with wider audiences, musicians who do not already have largescale platforms such as The Missin’ Cousins \[C\] \(446K views\). Comment from the Missin’ Cousins: “ **We disabled the comments for this song because this Trump shit is just too depressing”**, which at least suggests that a lively discussion *had* been engendered\!\); Delila of Last Internationale \[C\] \(11K views\); “ **Thank you, Delila\! I found your video after an insane week of Donald Trump's foolish and hateful ranting, and your clear and quiet and truthful voice was a drink of cool water\!**”  Comments on the video of the New Ashgrove Players \(30.7K\) indicated lively and at times heated political debate with comments ranging from \[C\]; **“Oh, dear God, why didn’t we do more to stop this monster?\!”** to **This is a fraud. Woody Guthrie did NOT write this song or any song with this title. This was made up by Will Kaufman and maybe \[Guthrie biographer\] Joe Klein**”; Pete Sinjin \[C\] \(9.8K\); “ **I freakin love this. This song needs waaay more attention”** and **“I heard several versions of Old Man Trump on Youtube. I like your version the best. Well done\!**”  Perhaps the best example of this can be seen through the work of high profile musician Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who declares in his YouTube pitch for the Firebrand Records issue of Ryan Harvey’s ‘Old Man Trump’: ‘ **I’m Tom Morello and I’m standing up against Old Man Trump. Because when it comes to race relations, he’s like an old school segregationist. When it comes to foreign policy, he’s like an old school napalmist. When it comes to women’s issues, he’s like a frat\-house rapist. So let’s not elect that guy. And I want YOU to stand up against Old Man Trump, too—not just him, but the history that he represents and the policies that he’s put forward. I’m standing up against Old Man Trump**’ \[C\]. This posting garnered 29.2K views on the Firebrand Records YouTube channel, with the notice: “ **You can stand up against Old Man Trump too by streaming and/or downloading Ryan Harvey's track ""Old Man Trump.”** Spotify cites over 54K listens to the Harvey cover as of this writing. Morello’s video was picked up, recirculated and amplified in articles in *The Guardian* \(‘Old Man Trump: Tom Morello Gives New Life to Woody Guthrie’s Protest Song’\), *New Musical Express* \(‘Tom Morello Compares Donald Trump to Frat House Rapist’\) and *Rolling Stone* \(‘Watch Tom Morello Liken Trump to “Frat House Rapist”’\) among other sources \[F\]. 

 The phrase ‘Old Man Trump’ coined by Woody Guthrie and discovered by Kaufman now brings up 1,150,000,000 results on Google; it has its own substantial Wikipedia entry and the hashtag \#OldManTrump on Twitter assimilates Donald and Fred Trump together. Clearly Kaufman’s research has enabled Guthrie’s lyrics and the Trump empire’s history of racism to become part of a language to express political arguments in the age of Trump.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Seasonal traditions and the gothic are two of the major ways we – as individuals and societies – connect to, imagine and contest the past. Groom’s research has deepened and shaped national debate around these key forms of intangible cultural heritage, and also led to an uptake in participation. In recontextualising seasonal traditions and the gothic by linking them with contemporary concerns, it has achieved the following impacts: 

-  **Enhancing awareness and understanding of intangible cultural heritage** through contributing to the Christmas advertising campaign of a major national supermarket. 

-  **Transformed the teaching of gothic literature** in schools across the UK and North America with new online educational resources. 

-  **Promoted public health initiatives** **through gothic** **literature**, improving awareness of blood disorders and encouraging blood donation. 

-  **Inspired exhibitions and performances** that innovatively reinterpret classic gothic texts for contemporary audiences, and renewed public debate around seasonal traditions and rural life. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Groom’s research on different aspects of intangible cultural heritage, is framed by an overarching aim to excavate its rich lives and contested histories and explore its reinvention in contemporary culture. Thus, his research on the gothic demonstrates the literary, social, and political shaping of its many manifestations, and is distinct in linking 18th and 19th\-century gothic novels to the vast cultural industry of contemporary gothic; similarly, his research on seasonal traditions investigates what they mean to contemporary societies living increasingly atomised and urban and with ever more unpredictable and extreme weather. 

 His extensive programme of research on the gothic emphasises its significance in politics, science, medicine, theology, philosophy, social sciences and debates about national identity – as well as in literature and architecture – and has challenged the popular myths that surround novels such as *Frankenstein* and *Dracula*. This breadth is reflected in Groom’s innovative study *The Gothic: A Very Short Introduction* \(OUP, 2012, **\[3.5\]**\), and in his production of four new editions of key gothic novels for Oxford University Press: Horace Walpole’s *The Castle of Otranto* \(2014\), Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* \(2016\), Ann Radcliffe’s *The Italian* \(2017\), and Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein* \(2018\) \[ **3.6**\]. Groom’s expertise led to a commission from Yale University Press for *The* *Vampire: A New History* \(2018\), published to celebrate with the bicentenary of John Polidori's *The Vampyre* \[ **3.4**\]. This book presents a new understanding of the ways in which the vampire has been used since the Enlightenment as a ‘thought experiment’ to define the human in medicine and science, theology and philosophy, and politics and economics. It redefines the figure of the vampire away from popular perceptions of monstrous Eastern European bloodsuckers and/or undead aristocrats, and has led to collaboration with epidemiologists, patient groups and theatre makers, linking gothic literature to contemporary medical research on blood disorders and using it to promote public health initiatives. In 2019, he was part of the Doctor Dracula project, in collaboration with Dr Luke Pilling \(University of Exeter Medical School\), which received Wellcome Trust Public Engagement funding. 

 Groom has used a similar pioneering approach to seasonal traditions and cultural environmentalism. For millennia, the passing seasons and their rhythms have marked our progress throughout the year, and Groom’s research both celebrates and details the English seasons and their trove of folklore and festive customs. His research is notably distinct from how calendrical customs and festivities are usually researched by folklorists, cultural historians and contemporary almanacking in that he explains in detail the literary, social and political shaping of traditions around periods such as Christmas \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\]. He demonstrates the close historical interrelationships between what are today distinct seasonal customs, such as Hallowe’en and Valentine’s Day. *The Seasons: An Elegy for the Passing of the Year* \(2014\) argues that tradition and our links with nature still have a vital role to play in all our lives. \[ **3.1**\]. Its ground\-breaking significance was recognised in extensive reviews in the national media and in its shortlisting for the Katharine Briggs Folklore Prize 2014. It was runner\-up in the BBC Countryfile Book of the Year 2014 as well as being *Guardian* Book of the Week, *Reader’s Digest* Book of the Month and one of the *Observer’s* Books of the Year.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Enhancing awareness and understanding of intangible cultural heritage** 

 
Groom’s research has enhanced cultural understanding of Christmas traditions through, among other means, commercial consultation with a major supermarket chain. The collaboration with Morrisons – the UK’s fourth\-largest supermarket – enabled significant national reach in explaining and reviving neglected Christmas traditions. Groom was commissioned in 2017 to provide a unique context for their national Christmas marketing campaign, based on the custom of placing an orange in a Christmas stocking. He researched and wrote a 200\-word story for children on this forgotten seasonal tradition, which promotes charitable acts. This was given away – along with a free orange – to 200,000 customers, and the campaign reached 16 million people through print and broadcast media coverage while an accompanying video was viewed over 50,000 times. The PR agency responsible, The Academy, reported that it was one of Morrisons’ ‘big marketing tactics’ of 2017 – prompting them to repeat it in 2019. \[ **5.1**\] Feedback from parents praised the initiative as reconnecting families with seasonal traditions and educating children regarding its origins: ‘ *Christmas can be lost in material things and this story really brings it back to the real meaning and also educates them about some of the history behind* Christmas **.’\[5.1\]** 

 Groom has shaped and informed public attitudes to the gothic through the cumulative effect of new editions, public talks and appearances on broadcast media. This has enabled new understandings of how contemporary gothic is indebted to its long history. For the BBC, his work includes a programme on the history of vampires for Radio 3’s Art and Ideas \(October 2018\) and a commissioned podcast on ‘A brief \(and ghoulish\) history of vampires’ \(16,700 downloads October 2018\-December 2019\), while an interview on vampires was a Radio 4 ‘Best of Today’ and broadcast on the World Service \[ **5.2**\]. Through regular presentations and workshops, including at major literary festivals, participant feedback repeatedly highlighted how Groom had changed the way they understood the Gothic. \[ **5.3**\] The Jane Austen Society of North America chose *The Gothic: A Very Short Introduction* to be read and discussed by Groom with their online reading group \(5,000 members\). Society chairman Margarita Levin, described it as ‘expansive and informative’, adding: ‘Everyone came away with a greater understanding of how the \[Gothic\] has been used.’ \[ **5.4**\] 

 Groom’s new editions of gothic novels – *The Castle of Otranto*, *The Italian*, *The Monk* and *Frankenstein* – have been important in recontextualising and promoting discussion of the gothic. Cumulatively, they have sold 63,500 copies, including 35,500 of international sales **\[5.5**\]. The new edition of *Frankenstein* and Groom’s monograph *The Vampire* were released to celebrate the bicentenary of original publication, and were used as springboards to generate debate, reaching people who would not usually engage with gothic literature. For example, *Frankenstein* led to interviews \( *Observer*, *Times*\) and a feature in *The Sun* with the headline: “‘Flakensteins’: Snowflake students claim Frankenstein’s monster was ‘misunderstood’ – and is in fact a VICTIM\)’” which provoked national debate \(BBC, Guardian, Spectator, Radio 4, and many others\) and a public discourse on social media on its meaning for contemporary readers. \[ **5.6**\] 

 **Improving the teaching of gothic literature with new educational resources** 

 Groom has influenced the design and delivery of gothic literature in colleges and secondary schools through an extensively viewed online lecture series and in\-person masterclasses. The latter, on the continuing relevance of historical and contemporary contexts of politics and science in the gothic, have provided unique learning opportunities. A teacher testimonial from Langley School stated that *‘The idea of Frankenstein as a novel for the 21st century was one that the students had struggled to consider effectively beforehand, but afterwards they came away feeling that the text has much more social, political and personal relevance today.’* \[ **5.7**\] 

 Building on these face\-to\-face sessions, Groom developed online educational resources to stimulate and influence the teaching of gothic literature through partnership with MASSOLIT, an online teaching resource platform for UK and North American schools. He created a series of highly popular lecture series on key novels such as *Dracula*, *Frankenstein*, *Lord of the Flies*, *The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, *The Supernatural: A Complete History* and *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. Groom contributed 37 lectures in total, and these have been utilised by 350 schools, cumulatively receiving 222,622 international viewings and downloads from March 2017 to December 2019. Most of his lecture series are in the 30 most\-watched: 

 *‘\[Groom\] is the second or third most\-watched academic in the collection.’*– Chris Tudor, founder of MASSOLIT **\[5.8\]** 

 One teacher commented that his lectures ‘really improved the depth of my knowledge on the contextual influences and moved my thinking away from simpler stereotypes’. \[ **5.8**\] 

 **Promoting public health initiatives and raising awareness of blood disorders** 

 Groom’s research has raised awareness of blood disorders through an innovative performance which combined contemporary medicine and the early history of the vampire. In 2019, he was part of the Wellcome Trust\-funded ‘Doctor Dracula’, which combined his vampirology with Dr Luke Pilling’s research in haemochromatosis, a genetic condition caused by an overload of iron in the blood, to produce an immersive performance with theatre company Four of Swords. The production ran in Devon in February and March 2020, with 638 attendees \(further planned performances were cancelled due to Covid\-19\). 

 Representatives attended from Haemochromatosis UK and the ‘Exeter 10,000’ research project \(which recruits individuals to help study common diseases\), who engaged with audience members and signed up 30 people to join the Exeter 10,000 project. The performance raised the profile of little\-known yet treatable blood disorders such as haemochromatosis and anaemia and promoted NHS blood donations: 

 *“The play itself was fabulous, linking past myths to our current medical understanding, combining art and entertainment as well as education about blood disorders*.” – Exeter 10,000 testimony \[ **5.9**\] 

 The project evaluation evidenced that over 80% of attendees had a better understanding of myth and medicine, \~70% said that they had an improved knowledge of blood disorders and over 60% said they were more likely to give blood. \[ **5.9**\] The collaboration was also significant for the artistic and commercial development of Four of Swords: 

 *“\[Groom\] pushed us to experiment with increasingly inventive ways of story\-telling; to cross boundaries and merge worlds which wouldn’t normally mix: folklore, historic characters, medical research, real\-world patients' experiences … We have definitely grown as a company through the collaboration, and have expanded our audience base hugely.” –* founder Phil Kingsplan John \[ **5.9**\] 

 **Inspiring the production of new performances and exhibitions** 

  

 In addition to the above, Groom’s work has inspired innovative theatrical productions that have re\-interpreted classic gothic texts, utilising his research to update them for contemporary audiences. In 2018, his reputation as a world\-renowned vampirologist resulted in an invitation to verify 26 books believed by the London Library to be the ones that Bram Stoker used to research Dracula. This internationally reported discovery led to a site\-specific dramatisation of *Dracula* by Creation Theatre in the London Library in February and March of 2019, in a run of 18 performances. The play directly uses lines from Groom’s *The Vampire* **\[5.10\]**. In 2018, he acted as the anchor/performer for ‘Living Literature – Frankenstein’, an immersive performance combining storytelling, workshops, music, science and theatre performed at Bath Literature Festival and the University of London School of Advanced Study. 

 Groom’s work on seasonal traditions similarly generated new creative works and increased public interest and engagement with calendrical traditions. A collaboration with folk band Woodwose created ‘A Hollantide Phantasmagoria’ – a mixed\-media, spoken word and music show. Three sell\-out performances were given in regional venues to coincide with Hollantide, once part of the Celtic New Year but subsequently known as All Saint’s Day and used to commemorate the forgotten dead, on November 1, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The project was subsequently featured as part of Exeter’s 2016 Being Human festival. 

 Groom’s research has also provoked reflection on the artistic, social and political forces that have played an important role in forming successive generations’ perceptions of the countryside. His 2013 essay *Country Supper*, which explored the history and meaning of the phrase after it appeared in text messages between Rebekah Brooks and David Cameron, inspired the 2017 art exhibition ‘Creating the Countryside: Thomas Gainsborough to Today’ at Compton Verney Art Gallery near Stratford\-upon\-Avon. Dr Rosemary Shirley, exhibition curator, stated that ‘ *The essay really acted as an inspiration point for the exhibition, particularly in terms of the assumptions made about contemporary rurality*.’ During its three\-month duration, the exhibition was seen by 15,000 visitors. \[ **5**. **11**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Morrice’s research has shown that the diverse language and educational needs of refugees and migrants require targeted pedagogical approaches in order to optimise effective integration strategies. Her work has underpinned changes to key government policies and guidelines, including measures of progress against integration objectives across governmental departments \(e.g. employment, health and housing\), and improvements to specific provision for education and language acquisition. The policy changes enable transition into improved practice supported by a training package developed and delivered by the International Organisation for Migration \(IOM\), and helps prevent marginalisation, reduce isolation, and increase educational and employment opportunities for migrants and the 15,000 refugees granted asylum in the UK annually. In addition, in Brighton and Hove, Morrice’s work has inspired a new language and support service which has benefitted over 420 refugees and migrants, 350 of whom have been provided with individual support to develop tailored pathways in education, training, language learning and employment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The ‘refugee crisis’ of 2015 saw the largest number of refugees in Europe since World War II. In the UK, the crisis led to a fourfold increase in the annual number of resettled refugees between 2015 and 2020. The focus of the UK government has shifted to refugee integration and to strategies for improving social cohesion; defining and establishing measures and good practice for effective integration within hosting communities has become a social, economic and political priority. Morrice drew on her research to identify indicators for measuring integration, and key facilitators of effective integration via two main strands: **education** and **language acquisition**. 

 **Education** 

 In 2004\-06, Morrice and colleagues used questionnaire, interview and focus group data from 51 refugees and 59 stakeholders to identify areas of major inequality and disadvantage throughout the education, training and employment experiences of refugee and migrant communities in the UK \(R1\). Between 2006 and 2010, she conducted a longitudinal study evaluating the life histories of refugees with highly qualified professional backgrounds and the importance of education, particularly Higher Education \(HE\), in enabling them to re\-establish careers and gain employment in the UK commensurate with their qualifications and aspirations. Her research highlighted the lack of policy support for adults and the need for specialist and tailored support to find employment \(R2\) **.** She identified barriers to access and participation, including the lack of recognition of overseas qualifications, the need for universities to be more flexible in assessing entry requirements for courses, and the importance of strategies to ensure equal participation once in HE \(R3\). 

 In 2013\-18, Morrice took the lead on the educational element \(language proficiency and education\) of a multidisciplinary, ESRC\-funded research programme \(Optimising refugee resettlement in the UK: a comparative analysis\) with other University of Sussex colleagues, Collyer \(Geography\), and Brown \(Psychology\). It was the largest longitudinal study of refugee resettlement in the UK, and the first to combine qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the well\-being and integration of refugees resettled under the Gateway Protection Programme \(in or before 2010\), 4 or more years after their arrival. Through this programme, the education experiences of 86 young refugees \(aged 13–24 years\) who were resettled to the UK between 2006 and 2010 were explored. The research highlighted how lack of English language proficiency and disrupted pre\-migration education meant that refugees were ‘aged out’ of free full\-time education before they could gain key qualifications needed to progress \(R4\). Findings emphasise the need for support to catch up with academic content and earlier entry into school, rather than long periods in separate language provision. 

 **Language** 

 Using data from the ESRC ‘ *Optimising Refugee*….’ Programme \(as above\) collected at 3 different time points in Brighton & Hove, Greater Manchester, Norwich, and Sheffield, Morrice showed that language proficiency was key to effective integration with other British people and society. Uniquely, her research demonstrated a causal relationship between higher levels of language proficiency and a range of integration outcomes: better cultural understanding; better health; greater belief in own abilities \(self\-efficacy\); increased likelihood for employment and access to education; and higher job and educational satisfaction. Importantly, better language skills were shown to lead to more contact with other communities, but contact with other communities alone did not necessarily improve language skills or result in other positive outcomes, including well\-being. Against a backdrop of dramatically reduced Government funding for English for Speakers of Other Languages \(ESOL\) provision, the research clearly underscored the vital importance of high quality language provision to integration and refugee well\-being \(R5\). The data showed that ESOL provision was often insufficient, lacked coordinated strategies at local and national levels, and was not flexible enough to meet the diverse learning needs of resettled refugees. Morrice evidenced that in order for some refugees to become integrated and useful members of society, they needed to engage in informal and social learning opportunities, as well as more formal activities \(R6\). The needs of the most vulnerable migrants – women, those with caring responsibilities, those with disabilities/health issues, those with low or no educational background and the elderly – were not being met by existing provision and pedagogical practices; as a result the disadvantage of language was maintained even 5 years after arrival. At the same time, other refugees required fast track and intensive programmes to facilitate their earlier entry into the labour market.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Morrice’s work has been cited in media articles, parliamentary discussion and support for parliamentary process, including providing evidence for key debates \(impact 1 below\). Results of the ESRC grant were summarised and published in a full\-page article in  [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/16/language-barrier-refugees-english-classes-integration-esol) national newspaper in November 2016 \(average issue readership: 1,027,000\), helping to promote national understanding of the plight of refugees \(particularly women\). It highlighted the impact of disruption to core education due to the turmoil in their home country, and sought to dispel the myth that refugees will learn English language simply through contact with British people. 

 Her expertise in the field was recognised by Government and in 2017 resulted in an invitation to form part of a working group with the Home Office to create an evidence\-based approach to effective integration, identifying indicators and measures of successful integration in language and education, and more broadly across multiple domains. At a national level her research has resulted in change to Government policy and guidelines \(impacts 2a, 2b and 2c below\), and the development of a new good practice document on refugee integration \(2b below\). At a local level her work has already resulted in new funding to support the development of a local ESOL strategy, new pathways and tailored support for ESOL learners \(impact 3 below\). 

 <ins>1.</ins> <ins>Contributing to public and political debate</ins> 

 Morrice’s influence within Parliament has helped inform and change policy discourse in relation to the rights of marginalised groups. Her research on language learning has been referred to and quoted in two Parliamentary debates on ESOL. Dame Caroline Spelman MP referred to Morrice’s research on 24 October 2017 to highlight the groups most likely to struggle to learn English and called for ‘dedicated and targeted action’ to avoid the risk of isolation \(S1a\) **.** Preet Kaur Gill MP referenced the research in a Parliamentary debate on ESOL chaired by Nadine Dorries on Monday 3 July 2019. She referred to the lack of language support highlighted in Morrice’s research as leading to a ‘tragic waste of refugees’ unfulfilled potential’, and called for new ESOL funding \(S1b\). 

 <ins>2.</ins> <ins>Changes to Government policy and guidelines</ins> 

 New government documents and substantial changes to governmental policy documents resulted from Morrice’s research: 

 *a\) Home Office Indicators of Integration Framework* 

 Morrice was engaged as an academic advisor to the Home Office review of its  [Indicators of Integration](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-indicators-of-integration-framework-2019) \(IoI\) framework between 2017 and 2019, and co\-authored the revised IoI framework \(2019\) \(S2\) **.** The framework is ‘… used by the Home Office, MHCLG, other Government departments and local government to shape integration policy, practice and measurement across the UK’ \(S3\). Her research is described as ‘pivotal in its review and redesign’ and as having ‘led directly to the inclusion of new material’ in the domains of Education, and Language and Communication \(S3\). 

 Morrice’s research on language as a key driver of integration led to language and communication being recognised as a distinct domain \(it was previously combined with culture\) in the 14 domains of the expanded IoI framework that enables policy makers to identify the different facets of integration. This has necessitated a suite of new and more comprehensive indicators, highlighting the importance of ESOL provision at a national level. Morrice’s research is described as leading the Home Office ‘to recognise language and communication as a distinct domain with a suite of new indicators. The new indicators we have adopted will ensure that the diverse language needs of the population, including the most vulnerable, are recognised and measured’ \(S3\). 

 Her contributions to the Education domain resulted in substantial changes. This included indicators and measurements for the education of adults and young people \(a group absent in the previous framework\). As a result of Morrice’s research ‘we \[Home Office\] have included indicators for young people and adults achieving access to tertiary and higher education in the new framework which will ensure the participation of this group is now measured and strategies put in place to facilitate progression’ \(S3\). 

 In addition to individual outcome measures, the framework includes guidelines for local and national good practice based on evidence\-based approaches known to underpin effective integration. These good practice indicators are designed to support local and national policy makers to plan, implement and evaluate strategies for effective integration. The new local and good practice indicators for language and communication stress the importance of strategies which meet the diverse needs of ESOL learners, including non\-formal learning opportunities; the new good practice indicators for education identify strategies which facilitate and measure progression of \(previously neglected\) youth and adults \(S3\). The indicators are accompanied by an online ‘tool kit’ which provides policy makers and practitioners with a cohesive approach to monitoring integration services and evaluate progress. 

 It is expected that the indicators ‘will be used across Government departments \(Home Office, DWP, MHLG, Public Health England\) to measure integration and inform policy and practice. The previous indicators were used widely over 15 years and we \[Home Office\] anticipate that the new material will be adopted as extensively’ \(S3\). Referring to the imminent adoption of the new framework, the Rt Hon Caroline Nokes, MP Minister of State for Immigration, described how the framework ‘will be a key resource for integration practitioners at all levels, offering a common language for understanding, planning, monitoring and measuring integration, and supporting better and more tailored integration services’ \(S2\). 

 As a result of the new IoI, the International Organisation for Migration \(IOM\), in partnership with the Home Office, has developed a training package for Local Authorities, non\-governmental organisations and other professionals on how to use the new framework to develop, support and evaluate integration strategies. Training was piloted with 72 stakeholders from 43 Local Authority and Regional Strategic Migration Partnership areas \(London, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast\) between October and November 2019. Evaluations \(S4\) asked participants to assess their understanding in relation to four questions: knowledge of IoI framework, the toolkit, good practice in integration design strategies, and good practice in measurement and evaluation of integration. Progress evaluations indicate that 60% of participants assessed their knowledge to have progressed by 4 to 8 steps \(out of a total of 8 steps\). Qualitative evaluations evidenced how participants’ thinking has changed as a result of the training. Participants will now disseminate and use the revised indicators to improve integration planning and evaluation. When asked if / how they plan to use the IOI Framework as a result of the training, participants’ responses included: ‘very useful for some of the interventions we are planning. E.g. ESOL provision, mental health support and employment’; ‘Yes, plan to discuss with my line manager about how we can incorporate into Vulnerable Persons Resettlement planning and delivery, but also wider integration goals of the council’ \(London\); ‘use it as part of designing a regional strategy’ \(Manchester\); ‘Have started to use this to identify gaps in support’; ‘Review terms of reference of our strategic resettlement group, also contract terms of refugee support services’ \(Cardiff\); ‘I will be using this when looking at the evaluation of the VPRS in Northern Ireland \(last 5 years\)’; ‘will arrange for it to be disseminated through the Department’ \(Belfast\) \(S4\). In addition, webinars were delivered to 25 participants from 17 civil society and community\-based organisations. 

 *b\) Integrating Refugees: What works? What can work? What does not work? A Summary of the evidence.* 

 Professionals and practitioners at the consultation events requested more guidance on the most effective strategies for supporting integration. As a result, the Home Office commissioned Morrice to co\-author a new  [Home Office good practice guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/812891/intergrating-refugees-2019.pdf) which draws from her research \(R1 – R6\) to summarise the most up to date and robust evidence on refugee integration. 

 *c\) Office for Students \(OFS\) 2020\-21 Access and participation plan guidance* 

 Morrice’s research also influenced the Office for Students \( *OFS\) 2020\-21 Access and participation plan guidance* \(S5b\) *,* which includes a new section on effective practice advice for refugee students; their website also includes a direct link to Morrice’s research, in its guidance for effective practice relating to refugees \(S5a\). Her research has *‘*…helped to inform our \[OFS\] understanding of the barriers to successful participation in higher education for this group’ and ‘… contributed to our current A\-Z of Effective practice’ \(S5c\). This guidance and its resources are used by UK universities to inform their widening participation plans. 

 <ins>3.</ins> <ins>Impact on local practice: Language provision and tailored support</ins> 

 The findings of R1 were incorporated into an International Migrant Needs Assessment Report conducted by Brighton and Hove City Council \(BHCC\) \(S6\). A successful application to the Government Controlling Migration Fund for £188k \(S7\) was supported by a policy brief summarising the ESRC grant outcomes, enabling the City to establish an ESOL Hub. The Hub provides an integrated ‘one stop’ advice service for migrants with referrals for ESOL provision and other support services across the city. Crucially, the service recognises the diverse needs of refugees and provides longer term support with individual pathway planning. 17 months into the funding \(September 2020\) the Hub has benefitted over 420 ESOL speakers; 350 beneficiaries were provided with information and signposted to relevant services, and a further 70 received bespoke pathway planning and goal setting. This included support to improve English outside of formal ESOL classes, the development of tailored education and training pathways, employability training, reducing social isolation, and access to other services \(S8\). A letter from the Community Safety Manager and lead on refugees and migration issues at BHCC confirmed that the hub ‘better meets the needs of the almost 2,500 residents who in the 2011 census “could not speak English well or at all”’ and confirmed that Morrice’s research played a role in developing a ‘City\-wide ESOL strategy *’* \(S9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Investment into energy generation has not always led to economic gains for Wales; as part of Wales’ transition to clean energy, the Welsh Government wanted renewable investments of value to Wales. Cardiff University modelling of the local benefits of different electricity generation technologies highlighted how local ownership could be transformative in realising local economic benefits. As a result: 

-  The Welsh Government set ambitious targets for local ownership of energy infrastructure; invested £87M in renewable energy; and used Cardiff research evidence to support a decision against licensing fracking; 

-  Marine Energy Wales and Natural Resources Wales prioritised local ownership, leading to £100M of investment in marine energy projects and two new large\-scale wind energy sites being made available for development prioritising local ownership. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Energy generation is a key driver of the Welsh economy but sustained economic benefits to Wales were not being realised. Cardiff researchers at the Welsh Economy Research Unit, led by Munday and Jones, undertook a wide\-ranging programme of economic modelling and supply chain analysis of established and proposed energy investments for a variety of organisations such as the Welsh Government, Marine Energy Wales, and Natural Resources Wales. The research – published in series of commissioned reports as well as academic papers – was able to demonstrate: 

-  how a transition to a low carbon economy \(a Welsh Government aim\) could be economically transformative for Wales through pursuing **local ownership** and supply chain planning, and 

-  the use of a framework to enable policy actors, including NGOs, to assess the potential for renewables projects to bring local benefits. 

 **2.1 Local ownership of supply chains** 

 The Cardiff research highlighted how financial benefits from electricity generation investments in Wales have typically returned to capital investors outside Wales **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6\]**, bypassing areas of local economic need. The research placed energy development in the context of persistent socio\-economic problems facing Wales, connected to a lack of local capital ownership of energy generation capacity and associated supply chain infrastructure **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. It recommended a transformation in underlying economic and proprietary relationships \(including local ownership\), with a broader focus on potential beneficiaries in local communities and in regional supply chains. 

 **2.2 A new framework to assess the scale and timing of economic impacts** 

 A key contribution of the Cardiff research **\[3.2\]** was the extension of the Welsh Economy Research Unit’s Input\-Output model of the Welsh economy to incorporate power generation. This extended model provided an understanding of how different electricity generation technologies might support regional economic activity directly. It also highlighted the importance of indirect benefits, both in terms of businesses supported in regional supply chains and of local employment creation based on additional household incomes and spending. The modelling approach additionally assessed the scale of the economic benefits at different lifecycle points \(construction and operation phases\), as well as potential implications for carbon footprint reduction. 

 Through application of the model to a range of projects on gas **\[3.4\]**, wind **\[3.2\]**, marine **\[3.3\]**, as well as nuclear and conventional energy generation projects **\[3.2\]**, the research established that: 

-  while all renewable electricity generation technologies reduce carbon emissions, particular technologies \(tidal, wind, solar\) each have different regional economic and employment effects **\[3.2\]**; 

-  there exist trade\-offs between generation scale \(carbon benefits\) and employment intensity \(economic benefits\), and that these need to be considered **\[3.2\]**; 

-  it is increasingly important for policymakers scrutinising competing energy developments to consider the entire employment supported by a project over its lifespan, and to consider any potential benefits offered by regional supply chain opportunities in both development and operational phases **\[3.2\]**. 

 In a series of commissioned research projects, the research approach was applied in more detail to specific energy technologies, namely fracking, marine and wind energy. 

 **a. Fracking** 

 The application of the research to hydraulic fracking for hydrocarbons was commissioned by the Welsh Government to support their policy development following devolution of licensing powers from Westminster. The research highlighted the financial, supply chain and public acceptance difficulties of scaling\-up fracking in Wales and the wider UK, demonstrating that **\[3.4\]**: 

-  fracking offered poor local employment returns for Wales; 

-  the lack of a regional supply chain to serve the industry would limit its economic contribution in Wales; 

-  a moratorium on fracking would have very little adverse impact on regional economic development opportunities. 

 **b. Marine** 

 Commissioned by the Welsh Government, the Cardiff team assessed the potential economic impact of marine energy in Wales. They demonstrated the high potential of supply chain development and the ways in which the marine energy sector could support gross value added in the more peripheral parts of the Welsh economy \(i.e. coastal regions\) **\[3.3\]**. 

 **c. Wind** 

 Supply chain mapping of the different components for wind farm development, undertaken for Renewable UK, the Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales, identified the potential to increase local benefits through shifts in purchasing behaviour. While the highest value components needed to be sourced outside Wales, economic modelling highlighted significant benefits for local suppliers of basic components and services. The research called for policy instruments to specifically encourage local benefit, in particular through adopting a strategy of increased local ownership of energy resources and infrastructure **\[3.2, 3.5, 3.6\]**. 

 Overall, the research provided a holistic analysis of the economic potential of renewable energy investments, as well as detailing how such investments could bring maximum economic benefit to key stakeholders in Wales.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Cardiff team’s research findings fed directly into: 

-  Welsh Government **policy** decisions and **investment** in renewable energy; 

-  NGOs’ and stakeholders’ financing and enabling of **marine** and **wind** energy investments. 

  1.  **Impact on Welsh Government policy and investment in energy projects** 

 The Cardiff research on different energy investments and their benefits for Wales **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]** were published in a range of reports used by the Welsh Government to inform policy decisions around renewable energy investments. The reports a\) underpinned a Programme for Government measure which outlined Welsh Government opposition to fracking, b\) informed national targets for local ownership in energy infrastructure, and c\) led to Welsh Government investment strategies on renewable energy. 

1.  **Fracking** 

 From October 2018, the Welsh Government was given devolved powers over licensing the exploration and development of Wales' onshore petroleum and natural gas resources. Cardiff University’s research on the socio\-economic impact of fracking hydrocarbons in Wales **\[3.4\]** was communicated to the Welsh Government via economic reports and as technical advice notes to officials. 

 Richard Griffiths, Oil and Gas Licensing Manager for the Welsh Government’s Division for Decarbonisation and Energy, confirms that the reports *“formed a core component of Welsh Government’s understanding of the impacts of petroleum \[and gas\] extraction on the economy, jobs and local communities”* **\[5.1\]**. The research provided *“the evidence necessary to both formulate a preferred petroleum extraction policy position and understand its likely impact on the wellbeing and prosperity of Wales and its citizens”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 The research played a key role in shaping debate during the Welsh Government’s public consultation on fracking, influencing both public and political opinions on the matter. In particular, the public and campaign groups frequently used research evidence in strongly voicing their concerns over fracking in Wales. Griffiths states that *“the reports clearly informed public thinking on the issues, as evidenced by **consultation responses** and **social media discussions** referencing specific sections of the socio\-economic report”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 The outcome of the evidence and public debate was that the research “ **contributed significantly and directly to the delivery of a Programme for Government measure”** including *“a policy where we* \[the Welsh Government\] *will not undertake any new petroleum licensing in Wales, or support applications for hydraulic fracturing petroleum licence consents*” **\[5.1\]**. This is now established firmly in Welsh Government policy. 

1.  **Local ownership** 

 The Welsh Government aims to transition to a low carbon economy to meet carbon zero aspirations. Jonathan Oates, Head of Clean Growth in the Welsh Government Decarbonisation and Energy Division explained that there was an evidence gap in understanding where “ *the economic benefits for Wales in a transition to a low carbon economy might emerge*” **\[5.2\]** which had stalled progress **.** The Cardiff team provided economic modelling to fill this evidence gap, and the research findings **\[3.2\]** provided “ *new insights*” and an evidence base for “ *tacitly held knowledge*”, in particular that “ *the greatest benefit from large scale developments will typically leak from Wales unless the capital position can be changed*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 The importance that the research **\[3.1, 3.2\]** placed on encouraging greater **local ownership** of energy projects was subsequently firmly embedded in Welsh Government policy, as confirmed by Welsh Government’s Energy Generation in Wales report: “ *The Welsh Government has **set a target that at least 1 GW of renewable energy capacity** **should be locally owned by 2030**”* **\[5.3**, pp.12\-13 **\]**. Having set this ambitious target, local ownership became a core pillar of economic resilience policy during the post\-Brexit planning for a new regional investment framework in Wales \(on which Munday advised\). Lesley Griffiths, Minister for Energy, Environment and Rural Affairs reported in 2018: “ *We expect all new energy projects to include an element of **local ownership**”* with the aim that this will “ *maximise the value \[of such investments\] to Wales*” **\[5.3**, p.3 **\]**. This expectation is now established firmly in Welsh Government policy for new energy developments. 

 Jonathan Oates also confirmed further benefits of the research: *“Cardiff Business School’s work for Welsh Government on the subject of regional economic effects of energy generation has contributed to not only Welsh Government policy on renewable energy generation, but also on wider decarbonisation policy”* **\[5.2\]** *.* 

1.  **Investment in renewables** 

 Having demonstrated the economic potential of local ownership, the Cardiff “ *insights led to* *the initial question of whether Welsh Government or other Welsh bodies could invest in renewables*” **\[5.2\]** *.* The Welsh Government began to assess the potential opportunities offered by their own infrastructure – including those of other public bodies – and using their weight as a sizeable organisation to begin to make change in the sector. After reviewing options and identifying “ *a pipeline of approximately £500m of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects*”, the Welsh Government was able to shift its focus towards providing financial support for Welsh public sector investment in local renewables schemes. This led to the commitment of **“£60m of zero\-interest loans**”**, with a further **“£27m of energy and efficiency projects, where finance was secured from alternative routes**” **\[5.2\]**. The Welsh Government estimates this will realise “ *savings of £138m*” over the life of these investments, contributing significantly to their wider decarbonisation agenda **\[5.2\]**. 

  1.  **Impact on NGO approaches to facilitating marine and wind developments** 

 The research applying the economic modelling approach to marine and wind energy technology was summarised in reports for a\) the Welsh Government, who supported significant investment in marine energy through **Marine Energy Wales**, and b\) **Natural Resources Wales**, who opened two new sites for wind energy projects. 

1.  **Marine energy** 

 Wales has an abundance of quality marine resources but has not fully capitalised on this natural advantage for energy generation. The specific work on economic modelling of wave and tidal energy in Wales “ *completed the jigsaw”* for Marine Energy Wales, evidencing “ *the economic potential of the sector, and how it could support economic activity in the wider Welsh economy*” **\[5.4\]**. The research was used to promote the development opportunities in the sector, and was *“instrumental in making the economic case, and showing the potential in terms of supply chain development and how the marine energy sector could support gross value added in some of the more peripheral and needy parts of the Welsh economy”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 Specifically, as Marine Energy Wales were seeking to increase the number of wave and tidal energy devices being tested in Welsh waters, the economic potential of the sector as demonstrated by the research was used to *“justify the targeting of European funds on the marine energy sector in Wales”*, an economic case that led to *“£100m \[being\] prioritised for marine energy in Wales”* **\[5.4\]**. By 2019 almost all of this had been committed, and *“a total of **£96m had been invested in Wales** **by 16 marine energy developers…with over 500 person years of employment to date**” **\[5.4\]**. 

1.  **Wind energy** 

 In a context of “ *uncertainty around the future development of onshore wind capacity in Wales*” **\[5.5\]**, Natural Resources Wales commissioned the Cardiff team to review evidence on the energy options for the national forest estate which covers 40% of the Welsh forest resource. A Senior Land Agent for Natural Resources Wales confirmed that the organisation used the research to make the case to open up two new sites to tender for wind development \(with a combined capacity of over 140MW\). 

 In particular the “ *Cardiff research assisted in preparing the tender documents for these projects and for developing the scoring mechanism to consider the socio\-economic factors to sit alongside financial and technical issues*” **\[5.5\]**. The Senior Land Agent further notes that the research set the expectations for the bids; the fact that “ *the issue of **local ownership** \(covered in the Cardiff research\) was tied into the tender process*” **\[5.5\]** resulted in “ *the successful companies…\[making\] **contractual commitments to make available significant share\[d\] ownership** of the projects to local investors at both community and public sector level*” **\[5.5\]**. 

 Overall, the wide\-ranging Cardiff research enabled new nationwide policies on fracking and local ownership, supported investment of £87M in renewable energy projects, helped secure £100M for marine energy projects, and opened up new forest resources for wind farms.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In an increasingly saturated and competitive sector, the need to create effective advertisements is a pressing challenge for charitable organisations and small businesses with limited marketing budgets. In response to this challenge, the Exploring Multimodal Metaphor in Advertising \(EMMA\) team, led by Professor Littlemore, have: 

1.  **Improved the reach and performance of a public health campaign**, leading to an **increased take\-up** of sexual health services; 

1.  **Increased the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns** of community and well\-being organisations in the West Midlands; 

1.  **Changed organisational practices** across the advertising industry, particularly in the West Midlands region. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The EMMA team explored the combination of metaphor and metonymy in advertising and measured their impact on the interpretation, speed of comprehension and general effectiveness of advertisements. This was the first broad\-scale empirical study of multi\-modal figurative language in advertising. It was innovative because it identified different variables influencing the success of advertising and also examined the interplay between these, tested them empirically and explored their emotional impact. To do this and implement their findings, EMMA — and subsequent collaborative workplace\-based projects — used qualitative interviews and biometric technologies \(such as electrodermal activity measurement and eye tracking\) to examine the extent to which people engage with figurative language and linguistic concepts in marketing campaigns. These methods allowed the EMMA team to articulate potential benefit of figurative language for social marketing campaigns, advertising agencies, professionals and businesses. 

 **Key research findings:** 

1.  In comparison with other figurative tropes and literal language, the presence of correlational metaphor, situational irony and visual hyperbole in advertisements increases their appeal \(RO1, RO2, RO4\). 

1.  Contrary to expectation, multi\-layered metaphors — which require viewers to interpret several ideas or relationships within the same message — are particularly effective for conveying complex messages and are understood more quickly than single layered metaphors \(RO1, RO2, RO4\). 

1.  Responses vary significantly according to nationality. This is particularly significant in super\-diverse contexts like Birmingham and the West Midlands. If advertisers, charitable organisations and businesses are sensitive to linguistic and cultural differences in people’s responses to figurative messaging in metaphors, local and international communities are more likely to benefit from specific, appropriate and effective advertising \(RO2\). 

1.  Metaphors that contain an ‘optimal’ \(intermediate\) degree of novelty are more likely to be perceived to be of higher quality and understood more quickly than those that are highly novel. Metaphors that contain negatively\-valenced vehicle words and infrequent vehicle terms \(in comparison with the topic terms\) are more likely to be considered high\-quality metaphors \(RO3\). 

1.  Metaphors that are novel, salient, are presented from a first\-person perspective, and involve motion, and references to the senses are more likely to be experienced on a physical level and thus to be more effective in advertising \(RO5\). 

1.  Advertisements containing figurative messages that require more work on the part of the viewer to get from the literal meaning to the figurative meaning in context are more strongly appreciated and are more likely to lead to take\-up of the product \(RO1, RO2\). 

1.  Bodily\- and environmentally\-based word\-colour associations are more likely than non\-bodily\- or non\-environmentally\-based associations to occur across languages and to be retained by users of a second language. They are therefore more robust and more likely to be effective in advertising \(RO6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(Note: Text removed for publication is indicated by \[REDACTED\]\) 

1.  **Improved the reach and performance of a public health campaign, leading to an increased take\-up of sexual health services** 

 Against a background of worsening sexual health at a regional level \(35,635 new sexually transmitted infection \(STI\) diagnoses in the West Midlands in 2017; Public Health England\) and sexual health service cuts nationwide \(resulting in 50% of UK women having “poor sexual health”; the *Guardian*, 9 January 2020\), EMMA **increased public awareness of the importance of sexual health** across the Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest Trusts in England. This increased awareness led to a **greater uptake in STI screening and services** and, ultimately, **increased diagnoses and treatment**. 

 Umbrella Sexual Health is part of the Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and provides sexual health services across Birmingham and Solihull. EMMA’s research changed the approach of Big Cat, a marketing and advertising agency working with Umbrella, and in doing so directly shaped the tone of Umbrella’s July 2019 campaign in a range of online platforms and physical locations. EMMA’s findings suggested that figurative puns involving more cognitive dissonance \(RF1, RF2\), more movement \(RF5\) and more optimally creative metaphor \(RF4, RF6\) were more likely to lead to take\-up of their important messages. Big Cat incorporated these findings into the 

campaign and their influence is clear in the resulting adverts. 

 Figure 1: The photograph above shows a rotating billboard in Birmingham city centre at the busy Holloway Circus junction. The advert shows the words ""Exploring her botanical gardens?"" in capital letters. 

The Director of Communications at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust testifies to the importance of EMMA in shaping the campaign: “The research undertaken by the \[EMMA\] team and their input regarding the structure of campaign headlines and the effective use of metaphor, was instrumental in enabling the campaign to **raise awareness** of Umbrella Health, **increase requests** for free STI self\-sampling kits, and to **increase traffic** on the Umbrella website” \(S1\). Data from the final campaign that ran in July 2019, demonstrates significantly improved take\-up on previous campaigns via a number of success metrics: 

-  Increase in Facebook posts from \[REDACTED\] in 2018 to \[REDACTED\] in 2019 \(S2\); 

-  Increase in advert impressions from \[REDACTED\] in 2018 to \[REDACTED\] in 2019 \(S2\); 

-  Increase in visits by \~1000 to the ‘Appointments’ page \(which is the first step to ordering a kit or health check; S2\); 

-  Increase in number of STI kits ordered from Umbrella Sexual Health \(39% increase from \[REDACTED\] in 2018\) which represents the highest number of kits ordered in 2019 for one month in July \(S3\); 

-  Increase in kits returned for testing \(27.7% increase from \[REDACTED\] in 2018 to \[REDACTED\] in 2019; S3\); 

-  Umbrella have never had such a high distribution number of STI testing kits in the five years of records \(S3\). 



 Figure 2: The image above is an example tweet from the campaign from Umbrella’s twitter account. It shows a paused video with the words ‘Entering her Queensway Tunnel?’ in capital letters, alongside the caption ‘Steer clear of trouble with a free STI self\-sampling kit from Umbrella’. Posted 12 July 2019. 

In addition to increased take\-up, EMMA’s findings and recommendations resulted in **economic gains** for Umbrella; the substantial increases in STI kits ordered, returned and tested were achieved with a \[REDACTED\] decrease in budget, from \[REDACTED\] in previous campaigns to \[REDACTED\] in the 2019 STI campaign \(S1, S2\). It also marked a **change in practice** going forward, as the Director of Communications goes on to testify: “This research\-led approach has therefore had a **significant and quantifiable impact on the success of the campaign**. The incorporation of linguistic research was a **new a way of working** for Umbrella and we will continue to pay close attention to our use of figurative language” \(S1\). 

 **2\) Increased the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns** **of community and well\-being organisations in the West Midlands** 

 EMMA’s findings led to **significant improvements in marketing campaigns** for Big Cat’s other major social clients in the region, for example, Solihull Community Housing \(SCH\) and RightTrack. 

 
SCH is a not\-for\-profit organisation that manages the housing stock on behalf of Solihull Council and delivers housing services to the tenants of Solihull, West Midlands, which encompasses approximately 10,000 tenanted homes. EMMA’s work led to **major improvements in the SCH logo** — the company’s ‘key branding tool’ — which has been implemented across the website and communications, staff work\-wear, fleet of vans \(70\+\) and company offices. SCH reports that these improvements have led to an **increased number of website page views \(22%\), website visitors \(52%\) and new website users \(54%\), as well as a \[REDACTED\]** **growth in customer activity** \(S5\). 

 Figure 3: The photograph above shows two vans with geometric shapes in shades of orange, purple and green. 

The EMMA team achieved this by recommending that SCH branding should include complex figurative images containing multiple metonymic references to the services \(RF1, RF2, RF6\) provided in appropriate, bodily\- or environmentally\-based colour combinations \(RF7\); this was an approach “which had not been considered with previous SCH branding”, but which allowed SCH to “more effectively convey our organisation’s values” and thus better “engage and communicate with our customers” \(S5\). SCH went on to state that “\[c\]ollaborating with the EMMA team and Big Cat, has enabled us to explore and hone our new identity, make it more appealing, and facilitate discussions about our core values as an organisation” \(S5\). 

 RightTrack Learning is a Birmingham\-based company that provides training for organisations in areas such as equality and diversity, unconscious bias and employee well\-being. Following EMMA’s recommendations, RightTrack changed its online identity which led to **an increase in website views \(9.86%\) compared with the previous year** \(S4\). 

 EMMA research suggested that RightTrack should employ pairings of text and image that involve multiple, innovative metaphorical connections that nonetheless draw on an existing underlying relationships, as such messages are more likely to evoke positive reactions and increase the effectiveness of the website \(RF2, RF4, RF6\). The Lead Director of RightTrack attested that “The EMMA research **improved the website** as the findings gave us a better understanding of how figurative messaging can be utilised to deepen user engagement, and extend user time spent on the website”; he also explained how this “was an approach we hadn’t applied to our website previously” and thus allowed RightTrack to create something “more sophisticated and tailored to our strategic aims” \(S6\). 




 Figure 4: The image above shows a screenshot of RightTrack’s new website with white text that says “Face\-to Face or ‘Live Online’ Training Solutions” on top of a bright red and blue smoky background. 


 Given RightTrack’s market position, this increased website engagement means that more organisations in the region are likely to seek RightTrack’s services around equality, diversity and workplace well\-being. As Big Cat noted “for the business community in Birmingham this means that more companies are receiving the help they need” \(S4\). 

 **3\) Changed organisational practices** **across the advertising industry, particularly in the West Midlands region** 

 Using its ‘Metaphor by Design’ approach to apply the project’s research findings \(RF1– RF7\) to marketing campaigns, EMMA brought about changes to advertising and branding practices more widely. 

 Big Cat is a leading agency in the region, with a focus on fundraising, behavioural change, healthcare and education. EMMA’s collaboration on a number of projects — including the three outlined above — resulted in Big Cat **changing their approach** to clients by incorporating a more integrated focus on figurative messaging. The CEO states that EMMA’s “research and work on these projects has in turn benefited Big Cat itself, with an improved strategic approach to figurative language and its applications within branding identities and marketing campaigns \[…\] Our collaborative work has also led Big Cat to taking on a new member of the team, as a Cognitive Linguistic Researcher. This indicates a new dedication to embedding the EMMA team’s research into our organisational approach.” They now assert that their client relationships are “stronger than ever as a result of this value\-added offering” \(S4\). The success of this collaboration and the changes in practice resulted in EMMA and Big Cat winning the West Midlands ‘Partnership of the Year’ in the Birmingham Post’s Business Awards 2018 \(S7\), which afforded them “a level of recognition on a regional level we had not had before” \(S4\). 

 EMMA also brought about a **change in practice** at the West Midlands branch of the global marketing and communications agency McCann. By collaborating with the EMMA team and drawing on their research, McCann changed the way it conducts brand development, allowing for the optimal incorporation of figurative messaging at every stage from concept development through to testing; this in turn resulted directly in the organisation securing new client work \(S8\). The Head of Research and Development at McCann Central explained how they “are now systematically employing \[EMMA’s\] approach, which involves using corpus\-based analyses to identify figurative ways of thinking that are characteristic to different subgroups of a brand’s customer base.” He explained how the company has adopted this approach to secure a range of new client work, including the next round of research with Holland & Barrett \(worth \[REDACTED\] in Q1 next year\); he was clear that McCann “would not have had the level of impact on them had we not been working with you and your team.” Overall he concluded that “This increased awareness of the importance of figurative language has **shaped the global McCann approach** to understanding the meaningful role that a brand can play in people’s lives” \(S8\). 

 Finally, EMMA **raised awareness across the advertising sector** of the ways in which figurative messaging can be used effectively in everyday practice. This was achieved through the co\-creation \(between EMMA and Big Cat\) of Insight papers about collaborative projects designed to maximise the effective use of figurative messaging. These were published in the *CreativeBrief*, an industry\-wide marketing platform, which provides brands and agencies with ideas and resources for creating more effective work; the Insight papers are designed to showcase best practice and to raise awareness of innovative new approaches to addressing challenges faced across the industry \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension \(PAH\) – severe high blood pressure in the lungs – is a rare disease currently known to affect 6,500 people in the UK and 70,000 in North America, Europe and Japan. This incurable condition usually affects young women, who die within 3\-5 years of diagnosis. Cambridge University research showed that mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor \(BMPR2\) pathway causes >25% of PAH cases characterised by particularly severe disease in the youngest patients. This discovery has led directly to routine genetic testing for BMPR2 pathway mutations in PAH patients across the world and the development of new treatments targeting the BMP pathway, commercialised through a University of Cambridge spin\-out company. Together, these advances are enabling earlier diagnosis and tailored treatment, bringing hope of a cure to those diagnosed with this terminal disease. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 PAH is a rare and incurable disease that affects around 6,500 people in the UK. The condition is usually diagnosed in women \(female:male 2.3:1\) aged 20\-50 years who present with disabling breathlessness. Patients usually die from heart failure within five years of diagnosis. Existing treatments provide symptomatic relief but have little impact on the duration of survival. Until recently, the underlying cause of the great majority of cases of PAH was unknown, severely limiting the development of novel diagnostic and treatment approaches. 

 **Identifying the causes of PAH and their clinical significance:** Although prior research had identified mutations in the BMPR2 pathway as an important cause of PAH \(Lane et al., 2000; Deng et al, 2000\), the extent and clinical significance of these mutations was not known, limiting translation into clinical practice. Therefore, in 2015\-2016, Morrell led an international collaborative study that brought together experts from across the world to analyse 1,550 patients with idiopathic, heritable and anorexigen\-associated PAH from eight cohorts that had been systematically tested for BMPR2 mutations \[1\]. These data showed definitively, that 29% of cases of PAH are caused by mutations in *BMPR2* and that these patients present at a younger age with more severe disease. Further, among 1,164 individuals with available survival data, age and sex\-adjusted death risk was significantly greater in patients with *BMPR2* mutations than those without \(p=0.0011\). 

 Building on these genetic studies, Morrell showed that bone morphogenetic protein type 9 \(BMP9\) in the blood, potently activates the BMPR2 receptor on the endothelial cells lining lung blood vessels \[2\]. And, that therapeutic administration of BMP9 to rodents with genetic and non\-genetic forms of PAH can restore BMPR2 signalling and reverse the disease \[2\]. 

 To discover additional genes that might be mutated in PAH among patients with no known cause, Morrell led a European\-wide collaboration that performed whole genome germline sequencing of over 1,038 PAH patients and 6,385 controls \[3\]. This work identified rare variants of the genes *ATP13A3*, *AQP1* and *SOX17* as important contributors to PAH and provided independent validation of a critical role for Growth Differentiation Factor 2 \(GDF2\) in the disease. This work also demonstrated that GDF2 mutations reduce the circulating levels of BMP9, providing additional key evidence that BMP9 replacement might serve as a novel therapy of the disease \[3, 4\]. 

 Cambridge University research has also identified a key link between disordered BMPR2 signalling and aberrant inflammation; thereby providing additional therapeutic targets. In that regard, work led by Morrell using both human samples and laboratory models demonstrated that BMPR2 deficiency promotes an exaggerated inflammatory response *in vitro* and *in vivo*, which can instigate development of PAH \[5\]. This response includes release of tumour necrosis factor\-α that selectively reduces BMPR2, thereby subverting BMP signalling \[6\]. Together, these data have inspired repurposing of anti\-inflammatory drugs as potential treatments of PAH. Between 2015 and 2019 four patents for therapeutic application of BMP9 were awarded in the United States and one in Europe \[7\]. These potential new treatments represent lead candidate therapies of a cadre of treatments under investigation by the international PAH community led by Morrell \[8\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> **Impact on the health and wellbeing of people**</ins> 

 **Routine genetic testing of patients with PAH:** Prior to the research published by Morrell and his colleagues, only patients with PAH who had a positive family history \(<5% of cases\) had access to routine genetic testing. This meant that around 190 of the 200 people diagnosed with idiopathic or familial PAH in the UK each year had no known underlying cause for their disease; delaying diagnosis and impeding precise and early treatment intervention. Cambridge University\-led research has directly influenced clinical recommendations and implemented genetic screening leading to early diagnosis and more appropriate management for patients worldwide \[A, B, C, D\]. To set this in context, in 2014\-2015 no patients with idiopathic PAH in the UK were referred for genetic testing. Currently, at least 25% and in some centres around 50% of PAH patients presenting with idiopathic PAH and no family history are now referred routinely for genetic testing of PAH \[H\]. A UK PAH centres informal survey in early 2020 showed that all eight National Pulmonary Hypertension Centres discuss the likelihood of a genetic diagnosis with patients and offer referral for genetic counselling and testing. The finding of a mutation in an index case has a major impact on patient prognosis and can help tailor management options. As part of the National Cohort Study of Idiopathic and Heritable PAH, unaffected relatives of PAH patients with a germline mutation are now offered annual screening for PAH. This service has screened over 60 unaffected relatives of BMPR2 index cases, allowing early diagnosis intervention therapy for five newly detected patients\[H\]. It is well established that early intervention improves survival in PAH patients *\(Hachulla & Denton 2010, Burger et al 2019*\). 

 **Rapid access to novel treatment and risk\-stratified treatments for patients:** Widespread genetic testing for the different types of BMPR2 mutation has opened up the possibility of recruiting patients to clinical trials aimed at restoring BMPR2 function. Increasingly, the BMPR2 status of patients is included as part of clinical trial design \(Sitbon O et al, Eur Respir J. 2019\). Indeed, in January 2020 Morrell’s research group received an MRC Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme award to conduct a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine in PAH patients with BMPR2 mutations, as well as a precision medicine approach using 4\-phenylbutyrate in patients with cysteine substitutions in the extracellular domain of BMPR2, based on their preclinical research. These trials are connected to the UK British Heart Foundation \(BHF\)/MRC PAH Cohort, which is being used to identify patients for precision medicine trials. Their research has also provided a definitive test for those patients that have a particularly poor prognosis, justifying more intensive therapy and early referral for lung transplantation. In addition, the company Acceleron have recently published positive Phase 2 trial data using ‘sotatercept’, a drug that targets the BMPR2 pathway, in patients with PAH, providing further support for the use of genetic testing \[E\]. 

 **Patient education and empowerment:** Significant mechanistic discoveries by Cambridge research has given patients with PAH an understanding of their fatal disease and the prospect of development of a cure a reality. Morrell and his team have presented their findings to UK patient groups\) \(most recently at the annual UK Pulmonary Hypertension Association meeting May 2019\) and their families to raise awareness of genetic testing in this disease. In February 2020, the Pulmonary Hypertension Association \(UK\) conducted a survey, in collaboration with Morrell, to identify the need for genetic testing in PAH patients \(n=211 patients\) \[F\]. One of the key findings was that “74% of respondents said they would want to be referred for genetic testing if they knew there was a chance of their PAH being caused by a faulty gene” \[F\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners and the delivery of professional services**</ins> 

 **Refining the patient care pathway in the UK:** Prior to the Cambridge\-led research described in Section 1, the absence of evidence supporting routine genetic testing for *BMPR2* and other mutations in patients with suspected PAH meant that healthcare professionals did not have access to accurate diagnostic tests for most patients. Their research has led directly to a step change in the number of idiopathic and familial PAH patients being tested across the UK \(up to 50%\). They have added PAH genetic testing to the NHS testing directory \[G\]. The finding of a genetic mutation in a patient with PAH immediately establishes the diagnosis of heritable PAH, which means that additional testing to ascertain other causes of PAH become unnecessary, saving resources and time in the NHS \[H\]. The research suggests that patients with mutations have a particularly poor prognosis and justify more intensive therapy and early referral for lung transplantation. These recommendations have been incorporated into the 2018 international global guidance on the clinical management of PAH \[A\], and should improve outcomes for these patients. 

 **Genetic testing of PAH across the world:** Several European countries have now adopted routine genetic testing in PAH, most notably in France \[B\], and Germany. In 2019 Morrell established an International Consortium for the Genetics of PAH, a collaborative network of 34 institutions from 10 countries in Europe and North America \[I, G\], to encourage appropriate genetic testing, to curate causative mutations to inform clinicians, and to provide a platform for further genetic discovery. 

 <ins> **Impact on commerce and the economy**</ins> 

 Although existing drugs are licensed to treat PAH, their impact on the disease is modest. Based on Morrell’s genetic and lab\-based research identifying BMP9 as a potential new therapy, patents have been awarded to protect this discovery in the United States and Europe \[7\]. Working with the University technology transfer office, Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge academics \(Morrell, Upton and Li\) established a spin\-out biotech company to commercialise the BMP9 approach \[J, K\]. The venture capital firm, Medicxi, along with Cambridge Innovation Capital and Cambridge Enterprise have invested GBP19,800,000 in the company, Morphogen\-IX \[K\]. 

 In October 2018 the company announced the nomination of its clinical development candidate, MGX292 \[L\]. The company is now undertaking manufacturing of MGX292 to support planned Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in patients. 

 The existing PAH drug market, despite being a rare disease, is worth in excess of USD5 billion per year. As recent national audit data commented: “ *While there are currently 12 marketed PAH therapies available, they only serve to slow disease progression. There is no marketed drug that addresses the underlying disease mechanism and targets to cure patients*.” The expectation is that the BMP9 approach could be a potential cure, as highlighted in a Guardian article \[K\]. 

 Morphogen\-IX has led to the creation of 10 new jobs. Based on the Babraham Research Campus, the company employs one full time employee, with a subcontract of its drug development activities to a local contract testing research organisation \(RxCelerate\). The RxCelerate team working with Morphogen\-IX comprises 5 senior research scientists, 1 administrator and 3 researchers/technicians. In addition, the company employs consultants in safety, regulatory affairs and manufacturing across the UK.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 September 2015 saw the first\-ever direct detection of gravitational waves, vindicating Einstein’s century\-old Theory of Relativity and opening an entirely new window on the universe. The significance of the discovery could have been inaccessible to most non\-scientists. However, UofG physicists in the Institute for Gravitational Research, who developed the thread\-like mirror suspensions critical to the first detection, have embedded public engagement in their research practice for many years. Prof Hendry’s ongoing leadership role in the global communication of gravitational wave discoveries, on behalf of a thousand\-strong international team, has resulted in an international, sustained and wide\-reaching stimulation of public interest and understanding in the new field of gravitational wave astronomy. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The detection of gravitational waves requires instrumentation of unprecedented sensitivity, capable of detecting changes in the curvature of spacetime, equivalent to displacements less than a million millionth the width of a hair. Between 2010 and 2015, the twin Laser Interferometer Gravitational\-Wave Observatory \(LIGO\) detectors were upgraded to their Advanced configuration and achieved this remarkable sensitivity. In September 2015, LIGO made the first direct detection of gravitational waves from GW150914, the merger of two black holes more than a billion light years distant — a discovery that was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics and which has opened an entirely new observational window on the cosmos. 

 Since the European detector, Virgo, joined LIGO in 2017, over 50 further confirmed or candidate gravitational\-wave detections have followed. These include: GW170817, a binary neutron star collision that was the first event observed in both gravity and light, and GW190521, the first detection of an intermediate\-mass black hole. These discoveries have brought spectacular new insights to many fundamental questions in physics: from the cosmic expansion rate and the speed of gravity to the origin of black holes and the equation of state of ultra\-dense matter. 

 Research undertaken by scientists in UofG’s Institute for Gravitational Research \(IGR\) has been pivotal to LIGO’s remarkable scientific achievements — as a direct result of the key leadership roles played by IGR staff in the development, construction and operation of the Advanced LIGO detectors, and in analysing and interpreting the signals which they have detected. 

-  **Hough**, **Rowan**, **Strain** and **Hammond** have made seminal contributions to the Advanced LIGO upgrades — with **Strain** the overall PI for the Advanced LIGO UK project \[3.1\]. **Hough** and **Rowan** were instrumental in the design and development of the quasi\-monolithic silica suspension concept, firstly in the UK/German GEO600 detector \[3.2\] and then in Advanced LIGO. **Hammond** led significant elements of the installation and characterisation of the final quadruple suspensions at both LIGO detectors \[3.1\]. In his 2017 Nobel lecture, Nobel Laureate Barish identified the monolithic suspensions “led by Glasgow” as essential to the detection of gravitational waves. 

-  **Woan**, **Hendry** and **Heng** have made significant contributions to LIGO Virgo analysis methodology which have underpinned the gravitational\-wave detections. **Woan** was instrumental in bringing Bayesian inference techniques to gravitational\-wave data analysis, and these methods have become the standard approach adopted in our detection pipelines \[refs 3.3, 3.4\]. **Heng** leads methods that search for generic transients, or ‘bursts’, and co\-chaired the LIGO Virgo Burst group at the time of the GW150914 detection \[3.5\]. **Hendry** led the peculiar velocity analysis for the first\-ever standard siren determination of the Hubble constant, which measures the cosmic expansion rate, using GW17817 \[3.6\]. 

 The significance of UofG’s research achievements has been recognised by the award of multiple honours and prizes to IGR staff, including a Knighthood and the Royal Society Bakerian Medal to **Hough**, the Institute of Physics Hoyle Medal to **Rowan** and the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and the Royal Society of Edinburgh President’s Medal to all IGR staff. This strong research background positioned UofG to lead LIGO’s outreach programme.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **UofG research underpins a rich environment for public engagement** 

 UofG’s Institute for Gravitational Research \(IGR\) has embedded public engagement in its practice, with its *‘rich scientific environment*’ \[5.1\] acting as a foundation for a vibrant outreach programme, long before the acceleration of activity following the first gravitational waves detection announcement \(February 2016\). Since August 2013, IGR researchers have supported the delivery of \~3,000 public events \(in 27 countries\) including: multiple TEDx talks and webinars \[5.2\]; exhibits and keynote talks at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, London \(2016 and 2017\) and the USA National Science & Engineering Festival \[5.3 page 5\] \(2014, 2016, 2018\); >70 school visits by Hendry alone \[5.4\]; and 18 Science Festivals \[5.4\] \(including European Astrofest, Cheltenham, Glasgow and Oman Science Festivals, India National Science Day, NewScientist Live, Edinburgh International Science and Book Festivals\). The number of people reached is difficult to determine due to variability in recording methods, but at the very least, this runs to many tens of thousands. Engagement levels at these events have been consistently high, with an improved public understanding of gravitational research arising as a result. For example, at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, post\-exhibition surveys indicated that 70% of respondents said their knowledge of gravitational waves increased \[5.5\]. 

 The LIGO Scientific Collaboration’s \(LSC\) Education and Public Outreach \(EPO\) Group was founded in 2008 \[5.1\]. UofG’s Hendry has been a key member since its inception. When the first detection was observed, *‘Martin was already playing a leading role in coordinating and supporting our global program of informal education activities*’ \[5.1\]. Based on this and the public engagement expertise at UofG, UofG was selected as the informal communications lead in announcing the discovery. Subsequently, Hendry was asked to Chair the EPO Group, and was invited to chair the newly formed “Communications and Education” Division of the LSC, and to join the LSC’s Management Team. 

 **Creating and supporting a base for widespread understanding** 

 Hendry has led the provision of 113 LIGO *Science Summaries* since August 2013 — a key component of LIGO’s public outreach to journalists and non\-specialists \[5.6a\]. Hendry maintains editorial oversight and is a key author. These *Science Summaries* are *‘short, non\-technical articles written to accompany every \[LIGO\] collaboration publication’* \[5.1\]. 



 *Figure from ‘ **Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger**’ Science Summary \(11/02/16\), showing key results detected from a merger in a distant galaxy more than one billion light years from the Earth. Results correspond with the three stages of a black hole merger \- the **inspiral**, as the two black holes approach each other; the **merger** as the black holes join together and the subsequent **ringdown**, as the single black hole that has newly formed briefly oscillates before settling down* \[5.6b\] *.* 

 *Science Summaries* are published in 21 languages and have increased public understanding of gravitational waves, directly assisting journalists in their communications. ‘ *LIGO has done a fabulous job publicising their work and explaining the concepts to the public and to journalists like myself as well. Martin Hendry specifically has helped me ensure that my reporting on LIGO’s discoveries is factually correct*’ — Journalist, Science News \[5.7\]. By explaining research and the significance of results in lay language, Hendry created a base for understanding that has changed how journalists report — “ *Martin’s work meant that I could assume that the general public was working from a higher level of knowledge about black holes and gravitational waves when each new discovery was announced…. given that gravitational waves are an extremely difficult concept for the lay person to grasp, Martin and his colleagues have done sterling work to help the public understand what they are.”* — ex\-BBC Scotland Science correspondent \[5.8\]. 

 With the first detection, Hendry and LIGO sought to emphasise its significance to the world beyond the scientific community. A YouGov poll in February 2016 asked how much, if at all, the discovery mattered \[5.9\]. Overall, 34% of respondents felt it mattered ‘a great deal’ or ‘a fair amount’. However, for those aged 18\-24, this rose to 50%. With Hendry, UofG designed content specific to each social media channel, particularly focused on continuing engagement with younger audiences. This was translated to WeChat for Chinese audiences, resulting in UofG’s best\-ever WeChat engagement, with 46,716 views and 4,086 reposts. 

 Hendry designed the hugely successful strategy to use social media to direct the public to the latest news while allowing direct engagement with LIGO researchers. The video explaining the significance of gravitational waves and UofG’s contribution, posted on UofG’s Facebook, registered the highest\-ever engagement levels \(2.2 million people vs an average reach for UofG posts of 46,900 people\). UofG’s Twitter announcement of the first\-ever detection of black holes appeared in >503,000 Twitter feeds \(vs a UofG average of 20,800\) and was retweeted 1,300 times \(vs a UofG average of 16\). 

 **Creative public engagement: translating physics using the arts** 

 UofG researchers have crossed boundaries to demonstrate science, including: 

-  A collaboration between Professor Hammond and Glasgow School of Art students to produce the Halo Harp, an interactive musical instrument inspired by LIGO technology, which became an open\-source project for schools \[5.10\]. 

-  Performances at Glasgow Science Festivals: *‘Peake into Space: Cosmic Cabaret’* was inspired by conversations between UofG physicists and artists; and *Chasing the Waves* was presented to 576 school pupils in areas of multiple deprivation with low rates of higher education progression. >80% of pupils attending had little/no prior knowledge of gravitational waves and 75% had never attended a science show. UofG researchers fact\-checked the science and participated in audience Q&As. Afterwards, a majority of pupils felt more interested in science and half expressed a new interest in STEM careers. 

 Feedback to such Glasgow Science Festival events included: 

 From pupils — *'It makes me feel more confident that if I were to travel round the world then I could say: we’re from Glasgow and we’ve discovered great things'* \[5.11 page 1\]. 

 From teachers — *'Beneficial for our pupils to see that fellow Scottish students and scientists are part of very important research involving the ""workings"" of our universe. Very inspirational'* \[5.11 page 1\]. 

 From the public — ‘ *You got someone who knew relatively little about science to be interested in what seems to be a truly vital discovery – thanks\!’* \[5.11 page 2\]. 

 *Chasing the Waves* was shortlisted for the Times Higher Award and won the Herald Higher Education Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Local Community \(2017\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton research has defined new standards of care and changed clinical practice for cancers of the gastrointestinal \(GI\) tract worldwide. 

 Through large scale clinical trials and other studies, Southampton research has improved follow up protocols for patients with colorectal cancer; defined new standards of care for biliary tract cancer; reduced chemotherapy treatment time; demonstrated harm from the use of epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies in the neo\-adjuvant treatment of operable colorectal liver metastases and developed an evidence base and standards of training and care for minimally invasive surgery of the liver and pancreas. 

 Through these trials around 1.5 million patients annually now experience better treatment and care resulting in improved survival rates and substantial annual cost savings for global health care systems in the region of GBP2 billion.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The University of Southampton’s medical and surgical oncology research teams have together pursued a strategy of undertaking large\-scale multicentre clinical trials combining clinical end point with exploratory translational analyses. The work has focused on colorectal cancer, a common cancer with high societal impact, and rarer conditions of unmet need such as biliary tract cancer, resulting in clinical trials that have changed clinical practice around the world. 

 The Follow\-up After Colorectal Surgery \( **FACS**\) trial \(2003–2014\) \[ **3.1**\], led by Professor John Primrose, was a 2x2 factorial UK wide trial examining the use of CT and tumour marker examination, serum carcinoembryonic antigen \(CEA\). In the follow up of 1,202 patients with completely resected colorectal cancer, results showed that more intensive monitoring is of no benefit to the patient, so cost and patient inconvenience can be reduced markedly. 

 The MRC Short Course Oncology Therapy \( **SCOT**\) study \(2008 to date\), led by Professor Tim Iveson, is the largest trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer ever conducted \(6,088 patients from 244 centres in six countries\) and has demonstrated that for most patients, three months treatment after surgery is enough compared to the previous treatment duration of six months \[ **3.2**\]. Combining the findings in the SCOT study with five other concurrently conducted randomised controlled trials in a predefined analysis, Iveson went on to define a new worldwide standard of sub\-dividing Stage III colon cancer according to risk of recurrence. The pre\-planned pooled analysis of the adjuvant studies \(the IDEA Collaboration \[ **3.3**\]\) included 13,025 patients and was subject to a linked editorial by Richard L. Schilsky on behalf of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the pre\-eminent oncology association globally. 

 The New EPOC trial \(Primrose/Iveson, 2005 to date\), involving 257 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, demonstrated that adding the epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab to conventional chemotherapy \(as commonly practiced globally until now\) counter\-intuitively resulted in a two\-year detriment in overall survival in patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases \[ **3.4**, **3.5**\]. Analysis shows that this is due to rapidly progressive multisite recurrence.  A biomarker for “harm” \(Mir\-31\-3p\) has been identified, in work led by Southampton researchers and this biomarker has wider application \[ **3.6**\]. 

 The BILCAP trial \(2004–2009, Primrose/Iveson\) examined the use of capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with resected biliary tract cancer. Up to this point patients had not received any post\-operative treatment and were subject to clinical observation only. In total 447 patients were enrolled between 2006 and 2014 from 44 UK centres. In a pre\-planned analysis conducted in March 2017 when median follow\-up had reached 60 months \(five years\), the BILCAP study demonstrated a 16\-month improvement in overall survival with adjuvant chemotherapy but no major toxicity \[ **3.7**\]. 

 Primrose and colleagues have critically examined the development of minimally invasive surgery in liver and pancreas \[ **3.8**\] including within two CRUK\-funded trials \(ORANGE 2 and ORANGE SEGMENTS\). They have established guidelines to enable safer introduction of the technologies through two global consensus conferences.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Gastrointestinal clinical cancer research designed, led and delivered by University of Southampton researchers has, since 2014, directly included over 14,000 people and changed practice in multiple domains, resulting in better patient outcomes and estimated world\-wide cost savings of approximately GBP2,000,000,000 per year. 

 **Colorectal cancer** 

 In colorectal cancer, a disease that affects 1.4 million people a year globally, Southampton researchers have performed the definitive studies in treatment and follow\-up after surgery. The FACS trial has set the standard on the follow up of patients with resected colorectal cancer and has informed all guidance on colorectal cancer follow up globally since the results were published in 2014, including NICE Guidance NG151 \[ **5.1**\]. This recommends the follow\-up protocol tested in the FACS trial: “For people who have had potentially curative surgical treatment for non\-metastatic colorectal cancer, offer follow\-up for detection of local recurrence and distant metastases for the first 3 years. Follow\-up should include serum CEA and CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis”. In a 2018 analysis of 21 national guidelines from countries represented in the European Society of Coloproctology \[ **5.2**\], the guidelines committee recognised the singular importance of the FACS trial findings as underpinning follow up protocols including CEA testing and CT scans. Adherence to these protocols has been subject to published nation\-level audits in countries including the Netherlands, where guidance is based specifically on FACS, and Norway which is proposing reducing intensity of guideline. The lower intensities of follow up have equal efficacy in detecting recurrence and have identical overall survival. A 2017 economic analysis \[ **5.3**\] suggests a saving of around GBP2,000 per patient suitable for reduced surveillance \(20,000 annually\) resulting in around GBP40,000,000 per year saving in the UK alone, mainly by reducing the number of CTs. Globally around a million patients will suffer colorectal cancer requiring follow\-up, and hence very substantial global savings could be expected depending on local practices. 

 Chemotherapy following potentially curative surgery has been shown to improve survival in many cases of colorectal cancer, but at the cost of significant toxicity. The toxicity relates to duration of chemotherapy but until now the duration to achieve efficacy was unknown. In combination the MRC SCOT and the IDEA Collaboration studies included over 13,000 people with stage III colorectal cancer from around the world. Results were immediately incorporated into national and international guidelines 2018\-2019 \[ **5.4**, **5.5**\]. NICE Guidance NG151 \(2020\) \[ **5.1**\], makes recommendations based directly on the SCOT study findings: “Halving the standard care from six months to three months \(for people who can have CAPOX\) will reduce treatment time and costs, meaning people have chemotherapy side effects for a shorter time, and will lower the incidence of long\-term toxicity \(neuropathy\) and its consequences”. Analysis undertaken in 2020 of these findings \[ **5.6**\] concluded that the survival difference between three and six months was minimal, especially if CAPOX is used, but the toxicity markedly reduced with three months treatment. An economic analysis of SCOT \[ **5.7**\] suggests a saving of GBP4,881 which, applied globally to 700,000 stage 3 patients annually \(based on a conservative estimate of 50% of patients receiving post\-operative chemotherapy\) results in a saving of approximately GBP1,700,000,000 per year. 

 There are around 3,200 patients annually in the UK with operable colorectal liver metastases. These patients were commonly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat micro\-metastatic disease, and increasingly with an anti\-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, cetuximab. The New EPOC study demonstrated the harm in the use of cetuximab in patients with operable colorectal liver metastases, resulting in a two\-year reduction in median overall survival and a 15% reduction in survival at five years. As this schedule was commonly used, changing practice has had major impact on the survival of patients in this cohort globally. The 2016 guidelines of the European Society of Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) \[ **5.8**\] makes the change in practice clear, stating: “EGFR\-targeting monoclonal antibodies \(cetuximab and panitumumab\) are not to be used in this setting, based on the data from the New EPOC trial”. This is further supported by a 2020 Lancet editorial \[ **5.9**\]. Based on UK rates of operable colorectal liver metastases, 240 lives are saved every year by not using cetuximab. This increases into the thousands when applied globally. 

 **Biliary Tract cancer** 

 The BILCAP trial showed that adjuvant capecitabine following surgery for biliary tract cancer improved median overall survival by 16% with no measurable reduction in quality of life.  Treatment was well tolerated. The result of the study was published in 2019 \[ **5.10**\] and immediately incorporated into standard of care in EUROPE and the USA; American Society of Clinical Oncology \(ASCO\) guidelines were also produced as a result of the trial outcome \[ **5.11**\]. Based on a conservative estimate of 500,000 annual biliary tract cancer cases globally, implementation of this process around the world could result in a saving more than 4,000 lives every year in a disease with large unmet need and no major Pharma interest. A heath economic assessment suggested treatment was also highly cost effective at GBP2,725 per Quality Adjusted Life Year \(QALY\) \[ **5.10**\]. 

 **Minimally invasive surgery** 

 Minimally invasive surgery \(MIS\) is developing rapidly in surgery of the liver and pancreas but this is technology\-driven with little evidence of patient benefit. Primrose and colleagues have led efforts in the UK to develop an evidence base and standards of training and care in this area. The group have led three randomised trials, one completed \(ORANGE 2\), and two ongoing \(ORANGE SEGMENTS and DIPLOMA\). The University of Southampton \(Primrose, Cook and colleagues\) organised two global consensus conferences in MIS in liver \(Southampton\) and pancreas \(Miami\), which were attended by approximately 100 leading cancer experts. Guidelines have been developed from the events and set global standards for safe practice and training in these areas \[ **5.12**, **5.13**\]. The recommendation for more research in MIS is included in the 2018 NICE guidance NG85 on pancreas cancer, which was chaired by Primrose \[ **5.14**\].

 **Harvey’s** ‘new animism’ research is acknowledged as foundational for the creation and development of new animistic movements such as the UK Bear Tribe and the US Ancestral Medicine organization. It has influenced environmentalist Christians and the Finnish installation artist Elsa Salonen and her audiences. Collaborative partnerships between **Harvey** and the groups and individuals have involved recorded public conversations and talks which have fomented wider public discourses about animism and Indigenous relational ontologies and epistemologies. In turn, these have fed into **Harvey’s** ongoing collaborative research about the impact of Indigenous knowledges \(e.g. through performance events\) on metropolitan and global communities. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The key insight of **Harvey’s** animism research is encapsulated in the phrase “ *Animists are people who recognise that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others*” **\[O1\]**. This is widely cited both by other scholars and by a growing number of self\-identified animists inspired by **Harvey’s** publications and knowledge exchanges. 

 **Harvey’s** animism research was initiated in encounters during a medical anthropology conference organised by Memorial University of Newfoundland in 1996 at which he presented his previous research among Pagans. The hosting of the conference at the Miawpukek First Nation reserve enabled conversations with local people about rituals involving eagles. Reflection on the salience of animism as theorised by the anthropologist Irving Hallowell \(1960\) in contrast to that of Edward Tylor \(1871\) propelled a transition in **Harvey’s** research. 

 Fieldwork since 2000 at Anishinaabe reservations in the USA \(selected because Hallowell’s work was among other Anishinaabeg\), and among Maori and Aboriginal Australians, led to the publication of **Harvey’s** *Animism: Respecting the Living World* \(first edition 2005, second edition 2017\) **\[O1\]**. The initially casual use of the phrase ‘new animism’ was taken up by international colleagues with similar interests in approaches, methods and relations, and generated further research and publications. **Harvey’s** continuing knowledge exchange about Indigenous relational ontologies has provoked considerable interest among UK Pagans and interfaith groups. This has been aided and mediated by **Harvey’s** ‘Animist manifesto’ **\[O2\]**, first published in 2005, republished and translated into multiple languages. It experiments with a somewhat playful presentation form, successfully employed by Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour, to convey **Harvey’s** insights in an accessible manner. 

 Further fieldwork in Nigeria, New Zealand and Hawaii **\[G1\]** contributed to the second edition of *Animism* **\[O1\]** and to *Food, Sex and Strangers* **\[O3\]**. In these, additional analyses of material religion, taboo protocols and processes, and hospitality were brought into dialogue with animistic and other forms of lived religion. From 2011\-18 **Harvey’s** research at an annual Sámi\-organised Indigenous cultural festival in arctic Norway **\[G2, G3\]** focused on performances rooted in “traditional” ritual repertoires and contributing to increasing democracy. Particular attention to animistic responses to climate change in such events has been crucial to **Harvey’s** ongoing contributions to the study of Indigenous religions and performance cultures **\[O4\]**. 

 **Harvey’s** edited *The Handbook of Contemporary Animism* **\[O5\]** spear\-headed further scholarly debates and enabled **Harvey** to disseminate new perspectives on diverse epistemologies, ontologies, ritual performances and relationality to people seeking to enhance and share their animist knowledge and practice. Similarly, *Rethinking Personhood: Animism and Materiality* **\[O6\]** engaged such people with new understandings of the significance of narratives, embodiment and materiality expressive of Indigenous and other animisms. Interest in these and previous publications from artists, festival organisers and key influencers within animist movements has led **Harvey** to research the modes of dissemination of animism among members of groups, visitors to galleries, and wider audiences.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Harvey’s** phrase ‘new animism’ and related ideas have been adopted by some Pagans and practitioners of ‘Green Spirituality’ including members of the Forest Church and related Christian movements. **Harvey’s** work has impacted on the self\-understanding and practices of religious networks \(the Bear Tribe animist group \(UK\), the Forest Church movement \(UK\) and The Ancestral Medicine Alliance \(USA\)\) and the Finnish artist Elsa Salonen. **Harvey’s** animist manifesto **\[O2\]** has been translated into many languages and one group, the Institute for Earthbound People, has adopted it as their mission statement. Through the specific people and groups identified here, **Harvey’s** work has impacted on wider networks, e.g. of Pagans, Indigenous religious practitioners, and international art and culture institutions. 

###  Impact on religious and spiritual movements 

 Bear Tribe is a growing Pagan network founded by a Pagan couple. **Harvey’s** *Animism* **\[O1\]** and a talk he gave at a Druid camp influenced their ecological and religious thinking and the inception and direction of the Bear Tribe. A key theme resonated with them: the value of rituals in which gratitude is offered and requests made to those beings who might become food. Using **Harvey’s** insights, they developed an annual midwinter feast complex to experiment with making animism more than an ideology. This was first held in 2007 but the work continues to inform the annual Bear Feast **\[C1\]**. Each year, over a long weekend, a gathering of around 60 people \(many returning annually, building a community of over 400 people, many of whom have influential roles in the wider Pagan movement\) focus on human relations with the larger\-than\-human community, evocatively led by a bear \(the pinnacle of food chains of some Indigenous hunter\-gatherer communities and a significant character in cosmological myths and rites\). 

 The Bear Feast movement has spread internationally, as founder Corwen Broch explains: “ *We never wanted BF \[Bear Feast\] to belong exclusively to us, so all these materials, song recordings etc as well as a compete manual in how to hold a Bear Feast have been freely available online and have been downloaded many hundreds of times*” and Bear Feasts have also been held in the Pyrenees, Sussex, Dorset, Yorkshire and Orkney. The Bear Feast Facebook group has 150 active members and a Facebook page with 743 followers. There are plans for an online Bear Feast via Zoom during the coronavirus pandemic. “ *Bear Feast came to international attention in 2016 when the 92nd Street Y, a large New York based Jewish cultural organisation ran a competition to design a new religion. There were many entrants and tens of thousands of votes cast. Bear Feast came in 2nd place winning a USD2,000 prize*” **\[C1\]**. 

 A Bear Feast participant says, having read **\[O1\]**, that “ *Finding this spiritual path as good as saved me, as I was very lost in my teens and twenties and having unhealthy relationships with myself, people and drugs*”. This participant started attending Bear Feast in 2014 and found that “ *The whole experience is full of gratitude for all the animals and plants who have given their lives to keep us alive throughout the year. It feels as though we as a community have come together to truly honour those whom we share our lives with on this planet*” **\[C1\]**. 

 The Forest Church movement was established in 2012 to reimagine Christian practice in an ecologically aware context. The founders had been influenced by **Harvey’s** work and invited him to speak at a conference in 2014. Steve Hollinghurst \(Evangelism Enabler, Environmental Focus, Diocese of Lichfield\), one of the founders of the Forest Church movement, says **Harvey’s** contribution was significant in giving credibility to new forms of Christian practice: “ *Thinking of non\-humans as people we share life with is a powerful idea and something that for several of us including myself led to an exploration of whether such an idea could form part of a Christian faith tradition. This was an unusual approach as most Christian engagement with animism viewed \[it\] as part of pagan religions that people gave up when they became Christians in foreign mission contexts, and often therefore viewed animism negatively*” **\[C2\]**. The Forest Church movement, heavily influenced by **Harvey’s** insights, has since grown to an estimated 50\-100 groups in the UK with similar groups in the US, Australia and elsewhere in Europe **\[C2\]**. Hollinghurst continues to use **Harvey’s** insights in his teaching in theological colleges \(and on associated reading lists\), in speaking “ *widely across the church both in the UK and abroad about Contemporary Paganism and concepts like Christian animism which have been informed by Graham’s work*”, and in his own published writing **\[C2\]**. 

 Noel Moules is another exponent of Christian Animism, a loose movement that is gradually maturing thanks to **Harvey’s** insights. In the current context of ecological awareness Moules has come to the conclusion that “ *Christianity had not only been a major conceptual and cultural cause of creating and sustaining the ecological crisis, but that this reality was also incapable of reversing it*” **\[C2\]**. He argues that in order to address the ecological crisis, we need to understand the relationships between all things, a new and transformative way of thinking presented in **Harvey’s** work: “ *That opening statement in Graham’s book ‘Animism’ is re\-quoted everywhere\! It has effectively become the defining definition of animism for so many people \[…\]. Only thanks to Graham’s quote, and everything that is found within it and lies behind it, am I able to set up repeated learning experiences so beautifully and powerfully*” **\[C2\]**. In 2014 Moules realised that there was enough interest in Christian Animism to justify a website as a focal point for his **Harvey**\-informed thinking, “ *However, the website was just the beginning of what I call my ‘Christian Animism Project’*” which now includes a Facebook group \(“ *508 very active members*”\), Zoom gatherings set up in autumn 2020 \(2 meetings so far, approximately 50 attendees per meeting\) and a YouTube channel. In 2020 Moules drew on **Harvey’s** thinking in an interview for the Nomad podcast \(14,000 downloads in the first 6 months\) **\[C2\]**. 

###  Impact on spiritual and religious practice 

 The US Ancestral Medicine Alliance is a network promoting indigenous and particularly Africana understandings and practices focused on relationships with ancestors. Because the themes and language of ‘new animism’ resonated with founder Dr Daniel Foor’s practices, Foor invited **Harvey** to record an interview discussing animism, published as an eight\-part series of videos on its Voices of the Earth YouTube channel \(8.1k subscribers\). These videos were uploaded in 2012 but have continued to attract an audience in the current assessment period having been viewed 18,000 times as of December 2020 **\[C3\]**. 

 Foor’s online course *Practical Animism: Rituals for Earth Reconnection* has run four times since 2018, reaching 2,000 participants in total.  Foor says, “ *In this course upfront I very explicitly credit Dr. **Harvey** with my way of framing ‘animism’ and include a few excerpts from his book in the opening lessons \[…\]. We’ve received a ton of good feedback and will continue to refine it gradually over time*”. **Harvey’s** work is also “ *my go\-to in terms of an intellectual/ontological frame and working language*”, underpinning Foor’s book *Ancestral Medicine: Rituals for Personal and Family Healing* \(2017\) which sold around 10,000 copies in the first two years and has been translated from the original English into Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, and Polish and his development of a network of 67 ancestral healing practitioners all using animism at the centre of their practice **\[C4\]**. 

 One participant in Ancestral Medicine’s training said: “ *Graham **Harvey’s** book, Animism: Respecting the Living World, was the turning point for me \[…\] Currently I’m studying with @danielfoor in his online course “Practical Animism”. If you are looking for an amazing platform to learn about Animism, complete with the most amazing resources, I can’t imagine a better place for it*” **\[C5\]**. 

 Another participant, Wild Ana Crow, says “ *Graham's book offered me closure to all those spiritual questions I had back then \[…\] I enrolled in the online course ‘Practical Animism’ by Daniel Foor, which has references to Graham's work and has allowed me to deepen my knowledge on how to deepen my relationships with others, both human and other\-than\-human, on a more practical level. I also felt compelled to delve deeper into my own traditional culture and dig up all the practises that still exist and have a very animistic core \(e.g. ‘caretos’ in Portugal\). The result of all these small steps is that \[...\] once we relate with the land on a deeper level, we also are more willing to fight for her protection*” **\[C4\]**. Wild Ana Crow has incorporated these insights in her work as a hide tanner, crafter and visual storyteller, hoping to inspire others to delve into a more intimate relationship with their other\-than\-human kin and ancestors. 

###  Impact on artistic practice 

 **Harvey’s** ideas influenced the work of the artist Elsa Salonen, as cited in the catalogues of several exhibitions of her work, including in Columbia and in that of her 2019 Berlin exhibition, ‘Stories Told by Stones’ **\[C6\]**. ‘Stories Told by Stones’ explored the idea that stones ground into pigments and used by artists remain ‘animate persons’. **Harvey** was invited to present on the theme of transformation within animism at the catalogue launch event in Berlin, hosted by the Finnish Institute in Germany on 17<sup>th</sup> March, 2019 **\[C7\]**. The Institute also asked **Harvey** to provide a comment for the cover of the catalogue. 

 The curator Dr Christine Nippe said “ *One of the most important contexts behind her \[Salonen’s\] work is the idea of animism, which is based on the assumption that everything in nature has a soul or that a spiritual consciousness resides inside it. Salonen makes reference to the interpretation of the British religious scholar, Graham **Harvey**, who researches our relationship with our neighbours, such as “animals, plants, rocks and kettles” and demands that we show them respect. All of them are relevant for us because, according to **Harvey**, the notion of “person” encompasses more than the usual understanding of the word, in which humans stand alone at the centre of creation. This concept opens up a new interpretation and presents nature as valuable as people \[…\] Salonen uses her artistic practice to operate within precisely this field of opportunities*” **\[C6\]**. 

 Elsa Salonen says **Harvey’s** work “ *re\-invented the discourse of animism*” **\[C8\]** and “ *has left a mark both on my working processes as well as on a wider audience through exhibitions, public talks, and screenings that I’ve organised or co\-organised during the last years \[…\]. I was invited to give a lecture at the University of Fine Arts in Poznan, Poland. I entitled my talk ‘How to Enlarge Your Bubble?’ to underline the importance of being aware of the limits of your thoughts and trying to enlarge your mind space whenever possible; in order to have more ground for creativity, but especially to understand each other better. One of my examples of ‘mind\-opening’ theories was new animism*” **\[C9\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The creative practice of Black and Asian poets is underrepresented in cultural and educational institutions. University of Stirling research has played a key role in expanding representation of Black and Asian creative practitioners. The impact includes: 

-  Diversifying delivery of school curriculum through teacher and student engagement with new resources for the study of poetry and place by Black and Asian writers, reaching over 5000 students and at least 250 schools across the UK and India. 

-  Diversifying and enriching the British Library sound archives and the curatorial practice of the British Library’s Windrush exhibitions on site and online \(157,000 visitors, 2018\). 

-  The composition and production of a new opera, *The Knife of Dawn* \(Roundhouse 2016\), about Martin Carter \(a Guyanese poet and political activist\) by Hannah Kendall, and a second production of *The Knife of Dawn* at the Royal Opera House \(2020\). 

-  Creating and diversifying audiences for new opera in the UK through four positive\-action performances at the Roundhouse and Royal Opera House \(2016 and 2020; total international radio, online, and live audience of approximately 50,000\) and associated school activities. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The research focuses on poetry by Black and Asian writers and demonstrates how place, race, identity, and belonging are represented and questioned in poetic practice. The core work was funded by the AHRC through three projects: *Devolving Diasporas* \(2007\-10\) \(G1\); *The Out of Bounds Poetry Project* \(2015\-16\) \(G4\); and *Poet of the Americas: Martin Carter and Caribbean Literary Culture* \(2011\) \(G2\). Gemma Robinson was PI on one project; two were collaborative with James Procter \(PI Newcastle\), Robinson \(CI Stirling\), Jackie Kay \(CI Newcastle\), Vahni Capildeo \(RA Stirling\), Kayo Chingonyi \(RA Stirling\). The research encompasses transnational postcolonial literary histories \(R1, R2, R3, R4, R5\); editorial work on contemporary poetics \(R2\), theoretical analysis of poetic belonging \(R1, R4, R5\), and co\-co\-production of educational resources related to poetry, place and belonging \(R6, G3\). In co\-authored work, Procter and Robinson’s empirical and theoretical research on postcolonial audiences \(R3\) informs their co\-created activities, which bring poetry and creative practice to new audiences in schools and non\-metropolitan spaces \(R6\). 

 The research underpinning the impact falls into two principal areas: 

 **Poetry of place in the UK** 

 This research brings together and theorises poetry of place by Black and Asian authors working in Britain, including award\-winning poets, Vahni Capildeo, Kayo Chingonyi, Jackie Kay, and John Agard. The *Out of Bounds* anthology \(R2, sales to Dec 2020: c. 2000 copies\) is not only the ‘most comprehensive collection of poetry to date by black British and Asian writers’ \(Kwame Dawes\), it also presents an argument for mapping this body of poetry across the whole of Britain, by organising poems in North\-South order of the locations with which they are associated, from Shetland to the Isle of Wight. The result is an A\-Z of Britain that challenges readers to think about the meaning of belonging through diverse, decolonising literary geographies. Robinson’s complementary work on postcoloniality \(R3, R5\) stresses the vexed and ambivalent identification and disidentification with Britishness in relation to Caribbean and Black British writing, and the long literary history that this must entail. An innovative practice\-based website of text and performance, as well as a poetry Activity Pack co\-created by Capildeo, Chingonyi, Procter and Robinson for secondary schools accompanies *The Out of Bounds Poetry Project* \(R6, G4\). 

 **Caribbean poetry in a global setting** 

 Robinson is a leading authority on Guyanese poet, Martin Carter. Her work has championed textual and oral history methods to analyse poetry rooted in the anticolonial politics and poetics of Guyanese society. Guyana’s *Stabroek News* commissioned her to write their annual Carter memorial article from 2006\-present. Robinson’s work on Caribbean writing and its place within a global setting \(R1, R3, R5, G2\) is literary historical. It contextualises previously unpublished or unavailable work for a wider audience \(R4\), demonstrating the importance of particular legacies of enslavement and colonialism in Guyanese creative practice \(such as Carter’s poetic interest in genealogy \(R1\)\). Robinson shows how Carter’s politics, literary geographies and relationships operate within transnational networks of writers, readers, and cultural activists \(R1, R4\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The Report, *State of Poetry and Poetry Criticism in the UK and Ireland 2011\-18*, notes that the British poetry world is ‘failing to meet even the most basic measurements of inclusivity’. Since 2014 Stirling’s collaborative research has enabled new ways to engage with poetry by Black and Asian writers, helping create new and diversified audiences for poetry and opera. This has led to increased opportunities for audiences to reassess their understanding of poetry, place, and identity, learn about Guyanese cultural history, and engage directly with the creative practices of Black and Asian poets and musicians. The Artistic Director of the Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation, Commonword, identified the significance of Out of Bounds \(R2, G4\): 

 ‘The Out of Bounds project has played a leading role in the UK in querying binaries of the type: white = country, black = urban. In breaking this false dichotomy, it has played its part in liberating black writers and communities from stereotypes that have bound them, and provided necessary new perspectives on the deep presences of black people in areas outside the urban South. In drawing together and enabling these disruptive energies, Out of Bounds began something whose ripple effects are being seen today in such diverse structures as Black Lives Matter, the National Trust and Green/Environmental movements.’ \(S1\) 

###  Impact 1: Diversifying, decolonising, and enhancing school curriculum delivery through teacher/student engagement with new resources on poetry by Black and Asian writers 

 Over 5000 students/teachers and 250 schools across the UK and India have used Out of Bounds Poetry Project teaching resources, including the Activity Pack. The *Teaching Migration, Belonging and Empire in Secondary Schools* report \(2019\) notes that 78% of UK teachers surveyed wanted training on migration teaching. Out of Bounds resources answer this need through mobilising the power of poetry to imagine place and identity, specifically by decolonising regional geographies. 

 Dedicated Out of Bounds workshops and the project’s ‘In my country…’ Young Poets Competition directly benefited over 1000 students and teachers. Of 128 participants surveyed at two 2016 workshops – six schools at Pathfoot Gallery \(Stirling\) and Great North Museum \(Newcastle\) – 91% of students and 100% of teachers said that the events made them ‘think differently about poetry, place and identity’: ‘Previously, I had never particularly considered my heritage. This helped me be more proud of my identity’ \(Student, Newcastle workshop, S2a\). ‘We have made films, tweeted images, translated poems into Scots \[and\] will continue to do more\!’ \(Teacher, Stirling workshop, S2a\). 44 schools across Britain entered the young poets competition \(2020, partnered with Commonword and Scottish Poetry Library\). Students and staff reported improved understanding of and approaches to creativity, regionality, national identity and racism. A Walthamstow teacher noted: ‘in diverse schools like ours, \[the competition enabled us\] to explore students’ personal perspectives and to give them the chance to voice their unique perspectives’ \(S2a\). 

 Representing Out of Bounds, Chingonyi worked with the Great Exhibition in the North \(June 2018\) to produce ‘new poetic word maps of the region’, reaching 400 students. The Director of Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums confirmed: 

 ‘Out of Bounds’ innovative work with place\-based poetry has been of particular value to GNM \[Great North Museum\] and TWAM \[Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums\] in helping us to articulate a more inclusive, diverse and outward\-looking vision of the North East to local, national and international audiences.’ \(S3\) 

 The New Writing North writing agency \(NWN\) commissioned Out of Bounds workshops for 50 young people led by poet, Malika Booker, the success of which led to a further NWN commission for an 8\-week teaching block of weekly onsite schools workshops on the theme of ‘From Here…’ \(Feb\-April 2020; ran until March; stopped due to Covid\-19 restrictions\). 

 Two former University of Stirling Charles Wallace Creative Writing Fellows, Mihir Vatsa and Snehal Vadher, ran Out of Bounds schools workshops in India \(Hazaribagh and Dharamshala, 2018, Bangalore 2019\) using the Out of Bounds Activity Pack. This is part of Stirling’s strategy to create collaborative educational legacy work through the Charles Wallace Fellowship. 90 people participated. The Hazaribagh workshop was featured in local Hindi press, and 100% surveyed said the event made them ‘think differently about poetry, place and identity’ \(S2b\). 

 167 teachers from 144 schools across England, Scotland, and Wales requested the Out of Bounds Activity Pack for training and to transform curriculum delivery. For example, one school in Whitley Bay used the pack with 370 students, commenting that it enabled them to ‘see the effects of this project in both the students’ appreciation of poetry, and in their development of a broader and more inclusive understanding of their regional and national literary heritage. Based on the enthusiastic response of our students, we are planning to use these materials again with future Year 9 cohorts’ \(Head Librarian, S4\). Another school in Islington reached 500 students, commenting that the Activity Pack ‘has delivered tangible benefits to our students who are not only demonstrating a new confidence with poetry itself but with the range of vocabularies and dialects available for expressing their own sense of place in British society’ \(English Teacher, S4\). 

 The British Library programmed Out of Bounds in one of its three annual flagship continuing professional development \(CPD\) events for secondary\-level teachers \(2019, 45 attendees\). Commenting on Chingonyi and Robinson’s contribution, the Head of Learning Programmes said: 

 ‘100% of the attendees rated the event as excellent or good overall. \[The British Library Schools Programme\] particularly benefits from working with partners, such as Out of Bounds, who can have an immediate impact on the classroom. We are delighted by the success of the Out of Bounds CPD activities in raising teacher confidence about including Black British Literature in their school curricula, and giving teachers practical tools for developing their curricula in new and creative ways.’ \(S5\) 

 The University of Worcester used the Out of Bounds Activity Pack \(R6\) in its Education programmes as best practice for ‘creative, rich, safe techniques to explore identity and sense of place in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century’ \(74 Geography trainees 2018\-20\) \(S2a\). Continuing impact is secured through the AQA Exam Board’s ongoing work to decolonise its curriculum: following stakeholder consultation in 2019\-20, the Out of Bounds anthology and Activity Pack will be recommended in its free online GCSE course for teachers, ‘Building skills and confidence for unseen poetry’. 

###  Impact 2: Diversifying and enriching the sound archives and curatorial practice of the British Library 

 The 2016 poetry 'tours' of Britain curated by Out of Bounds research associates, Capildeo and Chingonyi \(S6\), directly enabled the British Library to increase its engagement with Black and Asian artists in a UK setting: the British Library partnered with Out of Bounds to receive its 58 poetry events/films in a permanent archive, securing them for future audiences. 

 The Out of Bounds Poetry Collection is the British Library’s first sound collection with a regional British focus on Black and Asian Poets. The Lead Curator of Literary & Creative Recordings said: 

 ‘Without leading research and practice collaborators, such as the Out of Bounds Poetry Project, we would not have a sound archive. \[The collection\] fills an important gap in our archive and supports the British Library’s core values. The collection is significant in helping us fulfil our aim to represent the regionality of Britain and to avoid a London\-centric approach to curation.’ \(S5\) 

 The Out of Bounds team were also commissioned to produce 7 film\-poems for the *Windrush: Songs in a Strange Land* exhibition \(July\-Oct 2018, 154,813 visitors and 2444 school visitors \(S5\)\). The film\-poems helped achieve the Library’s curatorial goal to create multi\-media, multi\-disciplinary explorations of Caribbean migration to Britain and its legacies. The film\-poems were subsequently chosen by the British Library Learning Team for its open access ‘legacy online exhibition’, *Windrush Stories* and also included in its Primary Level teaching materials \(accessed by 6630 ‘unique users’\). The Content Manager of Digital Learning described the films as: 

 ‘a brilliant addition to our *Windrush Stories* website, providing students, teachers and the public with unique access to readings by poets of Caribbean heritage in the landscapes that inspired their poems. Our statistics indicate that the poetry films have seen an increase in visits over 2020, when students and teachers have increasingly turned to digital resources to support and enrich remote learning during the Covid\-19 pandemic.’ \(S5\) 

###  Impact 3: Production of a new opera, *The Knife of Dawn* by Hannah Kendall \(Roundhouse 2016\) and a second production of *The Knife of Dawn* \(Royal Opera House 2020\) 

 Robinson was the Academic Consultant for *The Knife of Dawn* \(2016\), a chamber opera based on the imprisonment of Martin Carter during the anticolonial period in Guyana. Hannah Kendall \(composer\), Tessa McWatt \(librettist\), John Walton \(director\) and Eric Greene \(baritone\) drew on Robinson’s research on the life and career of Guyana’s leading poet to create a new opera based on his work and activism; the team met Robinson regularly through 2014\-16. Kendall reflected on her relationship with Robinson: ‘Speaking with Robinson more \[. . .\] helped me realise it would be possible to think about writing a piece of music theatre and that became *The Knife of Dawn*’ \(S7a\). 

 In 2020, as part of Black History Month, a second production was commissioned by the Royal Opera House with Robinson as Academic Consultant. The production was part of the Royal Opera House’s Covid\-19 reprogramming \(825 people attended the socially\-distanced live performance; with international iplayer access for 30 days\). Commenting on the new production at the Royal Opera House, Kendall said: ‘Robinson’s scholarship and involvement in the project was intrinsic not only to the development of the project, but my own compositional practice’ \(S7b\). The CEO of the Royal Opera House stated in summer 2020: ‘We must redouble our efforts, building on current initiatives that are addressing barriers to inclusion and progression within ballet and opera’ \(S8\). In October 2020 Kendall became the first person of colour to have an opera performed on the Main Stage and the third woman in the opera house’s history \(S9a\). The Production and Direction team commented that Robinson’s research was ‘essential to the Royal Opera House production and it informed the whole creative process, directly guiding the introductory documentary, the performance of Peter Brathwaite, and the decisions that were made in the staging’ \(S8\). *The* *Spectator* wrote: ‘the whole thing came across as something born of the moment \- a single cast member, minimal staging, a small orchestra \- that could hardly have been done better pre\-Covid’ 

 and the *Wall Street Journal* described Brathwaite’s performance as ‘forceful, passionate’ \(S9c\). 

###  Impact 4: Creating and diversifying audiences for new opera through positive action\-led performances and school activities 

 The Audience Agency shows only 7% of classical music audiences are under 31 and less than 1% Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) \(Audience Agency Report 2017\). In 2016 *The Knife of Dawn* opera was watched live by 200 people in a sell\-out performance and free schools performance at The Roundhouse, London. It attracted a 45% BAME audience through employing positive action, promoting inclusion with content and casting \(S9b\). The Arts Marketing Association \(UK\) used the 2016 production as a case study for how ‘positive action attracts a diverse audience’ for classical music \(S9b\). The opera was recorded and broadcast on BBC Radio 3’s *Hear and Now* \(Saturday evening listenership of 49,000\) as part of the station’s focus on composers from the UK's Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities. A preview performance, introduced by Robinson, attended by 50 sponsors and music professionals, was hosted by the Chair of the Royal Opera House. For the 2020 production, the Royal Opera House appointed a team of Black creative practitioners \- Peter Brathwaite \(baritone\), Ola Ince \(director\) and Jonathon Heywood \(conductor\) \- as part of its commitment to addressing barriers to inclusion. The 2016 and 2020 productions were reviewed positively by *The Times*, *The Financial Times*, *The Guardian*, *The Spectator*, *The Stage*, and *The Wall Street Journal*, with *The Guardian* featuring it in the five best Classical events of the week in 2016 \(S10\). In 2016 and 2020 the opera was recognised as widening diversity in terms of both creative practice and audiences in UK cultural life \(S9a, S9b\). 

 The student Q&A at the Roundhouse \(100 students, age 14\-16\) led by Kendall and Robinson answered student questions about marginalisation, race and, diversity in classical music and poetry. BAME students were the majority at the schools performance and Q&A, and in the 6 follow\-on composition workshops \(by Trinity Laban Conservatoire with 120 students\) on Carter’s poetry and *The Knife of Dawn*. The free performance and workshops enabled music teachers in Lambeth, Lewisham, and Southwark schools to engage in diverse curriculum design and delivery \(S9b\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bournemouth University \(BU\) researchers have developed economic modelling techniques that more accurately predict the outcome of events, policies or other major economic decisions. This type of modelling allows governments and organisations to effectively plan for the positive and negative impacts arising from decisions. The technique has been used to inform crucial national government policy decisions relating to tourism in the UK, including plans for tourism post\-Brexit, and was instrumental in the 2016 decision by the Airports Commission to recommend the expansion of Heathrow ahead of other UK airports, and in cutting tourism VAT. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research undertaken by Blake and Seetaram is represented by a number of publications and research awards. These have pioneered application of new approaches for estimating the economic impacts of tourism activities. 

 Economic impact research has evolved since the 1970s with the use of input\-output models. These typically estimated static economic impacts that are limited in their applicability. Building on these earlier models, Blake was one of the first to introduce computable general equilibrium models to tourism economics. More recent research, in which Blake has been instrumental, has extended and enhanced economic impact modelling in the following ways: 

-  The inclusion of forward\-looking dynamics in economic impact modelling of tourism, which takes techniques for applied dynamic economic models used in other contexts and has adapted them for tourism impact modelling. The dynamic nature of these models allows the estimation of the economic impact that tourism has over time, the forward\-looking nature of them allows for the estimation of investment and other effects that will come about because of future demand \[R5\]. 

-  The inclusion of uncertainty \[R2\] and stochastic random effects \[R1\] in dynamic economic models of tourism allows the impacts of investment to be assessed based on uncertain anticipation about future tourism demand by allowing different growth paths to be modelled, giving the ability to estimate the effects of this uncertainty as well as of changes in the potential future growth paths. 

-  Demonstrating the importance of segmentation in econometric modelling of tourism demand, both in terms of tourists’ purpose of visit and country of origin, and that models that do not include these effects are systematically biased \[R3; R4\]. 

 These developments provide much more rigorous modelling methodologies to examine the impact of airport expansion; and the incorporation of forward\-looking dynamics and segmented tourism demand modelling were both explicitly included in the model used in the Airports Commission report.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The model has been used to inform various key policy decisions, including: 

####  Airports Commission 

 The results from Blake and Seetaram’s research \[G2\] and based on previous developments \[R2, R5, G3\], was part of an evidence base that led to the Airports Commission deciding to support a new runway at Heathrow in preference to expansion of Gatwick or extension of the current Heathrow Northern runway \[E1\]. In June 2018, based on this recommendation, the government formally approved plans for the new runway at Heathrow. In the final announcement of this approval, the Secretary of State for Transport gave the wider economic benefits as one of the key benefits of the Heathrow expansion: 

 “Expansion at Heathrow will bring real benefits across the country, including a boost of up to GBP74,000,000,000 to passengers and the wider economy, providing better connections to growing world markets, and increasing flights to more long\-haul destinations.” \[E2a\] 

 This followed from a statement in 2016 when the Under\-Secretary for Transport announced that the Government accepted the findings of the Airports Commission report, using the wider economic impact of expansion as a key reason to expand Heathrow \[E2b\]. 

 A spatial dynamic computable general equilibrium of the UK economy was then constructed and tested by Blake and Seetaram. The spatial element contained different regions of the UK, with the South East and the local areas around both Heathrow and Gatwick airports included as separate regions. The dynamic element followed the model methodology developed by Blake \[R5\]. The model was then used by external consultants Price Waterhouse Coopers \(PwC\) to provide estimates of the wider economic impact of airport expansion options, with the results presented in Chapter 7 of the Airports Commission report \[E1, E3\]. Figure 7.1 of that report gives a schematic overview of the model, with the ‘wider economy and productivity’ section being the model constructed by Blake and Seetaram. Figures 7.2 to 7.4 and Table 7.1 present the main results from this economic model. 

 This research, through the development of a novel and robust economic modelling technique, provided the Airports Commission and the UK Government, a more accurate and detailed analysis of the airport expansion options than could otherwise have been obtained. This led to a much greater evidence base for the decision over airport expansion and to more confidence within government on the option to be chosen, which was instrumental in the final decision that has been made, on a major infrastructure project that will have enormous benefits to the United Kingdom for decades. The modelling approach that was developed has expanded the capability of economic impact modelling to analyse the impact of proposed major investment projects in the future. 

####  Brexit and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport \(DCMS\) 

 Results from a model developed by Professor Blake \[G1\] and based on previous innovations \[R3, R5\] are used by government \(DCMS\) to guide responses to Brexit and the implications that this has for DCMS sectors. In 2018, working with PwC, Blake constructed a model of the UK economy that PwC and Blake used to demonstrate the effects of Brexit on DCMS sectors \[G1, E4\]. This involved a greater degree of detail in digital, media, culture and sport sectors than is normally included in this type of model and included forward\-looking dynamics in a model developed by Blake to demonstrate which of these sectors will be more impacted by different Brexit scenarios. The results of this work allow DCMS to target support to sectors that will be more adversely affected by Brexit, bringing greater ability to implement the most appropriate measures. 

####  Cutting Tourism VAT 

 Blake’s work on tourism and VAT \[G4\] using a type of model developed earlier \[R5\] led to appearances at two House of Commons Select Committees in 2015 \[E5, E9\]. The results have been referred to in Parliamentary debates and quoted widely in the media \[E5, E6, E6a, E7, E8\] and were presented to Treasury Minister, David Gauke. In July 2020 the UK government reduced tourism VAT as a temporary reduction from July 2020 to March 2021, but this could be extended or made permanent. The tourism sectors that this applies to \(accommodation, visitor attractions and food and non\-alcoholic beverages in restaurants\) are the same sectors for which Blake’s work predicted that the net fall in tax paid by these sectors in 2020 would be GBP4,100,000,000. 

 When announcing this decision, Chancellor Rishi Sunak declared that “This is a GBP4,100,000,000 catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors” \[E10a\], and in supporting documentation HM Treasury \[E10b\] \[Table 1\] clarified that this VAT cut is expected to give a fiscal boost to tourism sectors of GBP4,100,000,000. Blake’s work, as the first academic research \[G4\] on the effects of cutting VAT on tourism in the UK, and the results of his work, have been instrumental in the UK government viewing this type of tax reduction as a serious policy option that has now been implemented.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Lincoln has led the adoption and development of robotics and autonomous systems to underpin the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Research has influenced the data driven transformation of farming and food production, with UoL’s agricultural robotics  underpinning: **\(1\) changes to policy** \(i\) within the UK, with changes to investment in farming, \(ii\) informing EU policy on agricultural workforces, and \(iii\) informing strategic responses to labour shortfalls arising from COVID and Brexit; and **\(2\) benefits to agricultural business productivity, sustainability, growth and external investment** \(including £9.5M of private sector investment in Saga Robotics, now a world leading agri\-robotic company\) **.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The global agri\-food sector is under unprecedented pressure to sustainably intensify and increase productivity whilst reducing its impact on the environment. In addition, the sector’s reliance on seasonal migrant workers for crop harvesting \(69,000 in the UK alone\) is challenged by the combined effects of the COVID\-19 pandemic, changes to UK immigration policy post Brexit and global demographic trends of age and urbanisation. Whilst there is no single panacea to these issues, agricultural robotics and autonomous systems provide vital and emerging opportunities to drive food system resilience. 

 Since 2016, Lincoln has led significant agri\-robotics research that is highly interdisciplinary and co\-created between agriculture and computer science practitioners. Scale of the research is significant, evidenced by UoL winning £18.9M in agri\-robotics research funding since 2016,  including; £6.9M EPSRC AgriForwards CDT \(50 PhD cohort\), £6.3M Research England Expanding Excellence Lincoln Agri Robotics centre \(30 posts including 7 new ECR Lecturers and capital facilities\), 15 IUK collaborative agri\-robotics research awards \(£2.5M value to UoL, plus £5.5M private match funding\), spanning 10 funding calls and working with 29 companies. Research addressed key challenges across a broad body of activity including the integration of robotic technologies into complex agricultural systems, understanding impacts on agricultural workforces, deployment of novel platforms to harvest crops, measure and react to biological diversity. Key research advances to address sector challenges include: 

-  **Crop harvesting robotics**. The £1.6BN UK fresh produce sector is reliant on 69,000  seasonal migrant workers each year to harvest crops. The businesses engaged, who  act as economic anchors across rural UK, employ c.20,000 permanent positions  whilst providing highly nutritious, low carbon fruit and vegetables at accessible prices  to UK society. However, the combined effects of Brexit and COVID\-19 pandemic are  jeopardising the future of this sector of the agricultural economy \(EFRA Select  Committee Report, Dec 2020\). Robotic and autonomous systems that selectively  harvest labour dependent crops, such as broccoli and strawberries, offer an  emerging opportunity to drive labour productivity, but these systems rely on novel  technologies that can detect \(in 3D\), measure and manipulate key crop components  within highly diverse biological systems. Research at Lincoln has pioneered the  development of such vision systems to underpin robotic harvesting, with foundational  research **\[3.1\]** demonstrating how low\-cost 3D cameras can be used for high speed  and robust image recognition in commercial crops. Results showed that purely  technical/robotic solutions \(image recognition for harvesting\) are unlikely to be  successful without a full appreciation of the biology / variability of a crop and within  an agricultural system. This foundational publication led to a larger body of research  at Lincoln on crop vision technologies, including the underpinning detection system  **\[3.2\]** subsequently deployed as a prototype robotic strawberry platform and  harvester. 

-  **Environmental monitoring of soils**. Existing agricultural soil management practices  are widely accepted as unsustainable, with reliance on high mass agricultural  machines compacting soils, energy intensive cultivation leading to unacceptable soil  carbon emissions and inefficient use of critical resources such as water. Effective  farmer decision support for soil management is only possible through improved soil  monitoring, measurement and mapping, yet existing technologies were highly labour  dependent, expensive and subject to sampling errors. UoL has led foundational  research on the application of robotics for soil mapping, including new algorithms for  efficient soil mapping and sensors to detect soil moisture \(first agricultural  demonstration of a cosmic neutron rover\) and compaction **\[3.2, 3.3\]** 

-  **Barriers to adoption**. UoL has conducted theoretical assessments of how robotic  systems might be scaled across agriculture **\[3.4\]** and change the nature of work  **\[3.5, 3.6\].** These studies demonstrated socio\-economic barriers to the deployment of  robotics in agriculture, including impacts on the existing workforce and economic  challenges to transition conventional systems, reliant on few high mass machines  \(diesel powered tractors\), towards a new operational paradigm underpinned by fleets  of smaller electric robotic platforms.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 UoL’s innovative agri\-food research has underpinned a series of impacts for the agricultural sector, with activity including a series of strategic engagements with government, industry and the production of a pivotal white paper **\[5.1\].** UoL’s research materially contributed to the development of a cohesive national strategy for agri\-robotics resulting in **\(1\) changes to policy** \(i\) within the UK, enhancing investment in farming, \(ii\) within the EU, informing policy on agricultural workforces, and \(iii\) informing UK strategic responses to labour shortfalls arising from COVID and Brexit; and *\(2\)* **benefits to agricultural business** productivity, sustainability, growth and external investment. 

1.  **Impacts on policy** 

 i. **Changes to UK Government policy and investment in farming** 

 As a consequence of the scale and significance of UoL’s research, Pearson was  invited by Sir Peter Kendal to chair the Robotics and AI Task and Finish Group  \(TFG\) reporting to the Agricultural Productivity Working Group \(APWG\) of the  DEFRA/BEIS Food Sector Council.  The TFG report **\[5.2\]**, which included evidence  from the UoL body of research on selective harvesting articulated the challenges,  timelines and government support for accelerated adoption of robotics by UK  farmers and formed part of the APWG’s report to the Sector Council in 2019 **\[5.3\]** .   Recommendations directly reflected critical lessons from UoL research \[particularly  3.2\] that adoption of agri\-robotics technologies requires scaled interdisciplinary  research at a full systems level;  this included the recommendation that the UK  government should invest in infrastructure to support the roll\-out of robotics  \( *Recommendation 5*, focused on 5G and data infrastructure\) and that UK research  policy should increase focus on collaborative, mission\-led approaches  \( *Recommendation 3,* which includes robotics\). This APWG report informed  government policy, seen in the DEFRA Future for Framing Report, 2020 **\[5.4\]**,  particularly with the new Farming Transformation Fund **\[5.4\],** that provides grants to  farms for large scale investments in research and infrastructure, specifically allowing  payment for “ *increasing the use of automation and robotics”*. 

 ii. **Informed EU policy on the future of agricultural workforces** 

 UoL research informed EU policy, where a commissioned report for the AGRI  committee of the EU Parliament **\[5.5\]** cited Lampridi *et al* \[reference 3.4\] and  Marinoudi *et al* \[3.5\] to substantiate hypotheses that robotics will change the nature  of work within EU agriculture. Reflecting key learning from UoL research, one of the  reports key conclusions was that *“the challenge for farmers to take up such*  *innovation should not be under\-estimated, hence the importance of vocational*  *training, advisory services and knowledge exchange within and outside the*  *framework of the CAP”* **\[5.5,** page 103\] *.*  EU Parliament AGRI committee  recommendations are pivotal for strategic reviews of the new Green Deal and CAP  transition policy. 

 iii. **Informing policy responses to the protection of farming businesses incurring**   **staff shortfalls arising from COVID and Brexit.** 

 In 2020, as part of an urgent COVID\-19 response, UoL with the National Farmers  Union and the Innovate UK Agri\-EPI centre created and led the national “Accelerated  Automation” initiative. UoL’s leadership role was a direct consequence of its body of  research on agri\-robotics and initiated after discussions \(minuted with EPSRC\) with  the industrial steering board of AgriForwards CDT.  The objective was to complete  and scale emerging robotic technologies to mitigate serious shortfalls in farm labour  as an immediate consequence of COVID\-19 pandemic, as well as medium term  impacts of changes to migration policy post Brexit. This national consultation  engaged over 100 different companies and organisations across the fresh produce  and robotics sectors. It focussed on establishing whether fast track robotic  development and scaling could resolve critical shortfalls in labour supply. Pearson  reported this in written evidence to the EFRA Select Committees on “COVID\-19 and  food supply” and “Labour in the food supply chains” **\[5.6\].** Throughout the  Accelerated Automation process, UoL and Agri\-EPI have actively engaged with  government \(up to Ministerial level\). This activity directly led to the allocation of new  national open\-competition funding for agri\-robotics by Innovate UK \(agri\-robotics  became in scope for funding from the ISCF Robotics for a Safer World Challenge\).  businesses. 

 2\) **Benefits to agricultural business productivity, sustainability, growth and external investment.** 

 Saga Robotics Ltd \( [https://sagarobotics.com/](https://sagarobotics.com/)\) is a world leading agri\-robotic start\-up manufacturing agricultural robots and providing roboticised services to the farming industry to address key challenges including labour shortages and the sustainability of food production. Their flagship product is Thorvald, a universal, modular mobile platform which can be deployed in many different agricultural scenarios such as crop care, selective harvesting or in\-field transportation. In addition to direct sales, the company operates a Farming\-as\-a\-Service \(FaaS\) business model, offering prototype robotic fruit picking \(using UoL’s image analysis system\) and commercial autonomous UVC light treatments to reduce powdery mildew on fruit crops in the UK, USA and Norway. Since developing their first robotic system hardware in 2016 in Norway, Saga have actively collaborated with UoL on research\-led developments for their software systems and agricultural domain applications for fruit picking, pest control, logistics support, robotic weeding, crop forecasting \[reference 3.2\]. The enhanced software system directly includes critical applications developed with Lincoln, including 3D image recognition systems for fruit picking \[reference 3.1\] and robotic mapping technologies \[references 3.3. and 3.4, stored in extensive shared GiThuB libraries hosted on UoL servers\]. Collaboration with SAGA was directly facilitated by Professor Pal From \(Saga CEO\) who was an embedded and 25% FTE Chair of Agri\-Robotics at UoL from 2017 to 2021. 

 The collaboration with UoL has resulted in changes to Saga’s business model, leading to growth in both capacity and external investment. Saga made a strategic decision to open its UK office on the University Campus in 2016, where the company currently now employs 21 full\-time highly skilled staff, with 3 senior software engineers originating from the UoL team. Saga cite UoL’s research as a key contributing factor to securing £9.5M of Series A venture capital funding to accelerate and scale up the company **\[5.7\]**. 

 Beyond Saga, UoL’s agri\-robotics research has enabled a range of novel and step\-changing solutions for major food producers.  Berry Garden Growers, the UK’s leading berry and stone fruit production with a market share over 30% and annual sales of over £300 million, report that using the UoL\-enhanced Thorvald system has yielded both economic and environmental benefits: 

 *“The deployment of this robotic fleet at Clockhouse Farm in 2020 successfully demonstrated full robotic autonomy, 7km per robot per night deployed, for UVC robots over a whole season. This is a global first, robotic technologies from UoL have transformed our research investment, estimated at £1.2M, over the last 3 years”.* **\[5.8\].** 

 **Similar findings are reported by one of the largest farms in Norway, Myhrene AS, who in 2020 switched completely to spraying\-free production on strawberries across their 5ha polytunnel production, using the UoL\-enhanced Thorvald system. Simen A. Myhrene, Chairman of Myhrene states that **""With the  robot we get less energy consumption, a better overview over the production, we can use less pesticides, we can save more labour, we take better care of the soil which again give bigger crops. There are so many effects we can gain when we learn how to use this \- it’s here to stay\!""** \[5.7\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Evidence from LSHTM research has influenced many high\-profile decisions about new vaccines, and how and when people in England are immunised against a range of diseases. Health and economic modelling specialists regularly presented analysis of the impact of potential changes to the UK vaccination schedule to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\). This directly informed recommendations to introduce new vaccines or change the way existing vaccines were used to improve coverage and efficiency throughout 2013 to 2020. LSHTM research underpinned key changes, such as introducing meningitis B vaccination, influenza vaccination in children, and HPV schedule changes, saving lives, reducing morbidity, and saving millions of pounds of NHS resources. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Vaccines prevent disease and save lives. But vaccinations introduced to a population also have wider benefits, including preventing healthcare costs and loss of productivity for those vaccinated who would otherwise have suffered from a disease. 

 Research teams at LSHTM led by Jit and Edmunds used mathematical modelling to predict the impact of different potential UK vaccine strategies. The results were then used in economic models that projected the implications of different strategies for NHS resources and UK population health, to determine if a strategy was cost\-effective. These models translated the special characteristics of infectious diseases into outcomes satisfying the gold standard methods set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) for evaluating all health interventions. 

 The models drew on data and expert knowledge from electronic health database experts at LSHTM as well as from long\-standing collaboration with scientists at Public Health England \(PHE\). LSHTM’s methodological excellence and the strength of its collaborative ties with PHE were recognised in 2014 when LSHTM was awarded an NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Immunisation, to continue this work on evidence for vaccine decisions. The teams at LSHTM applied mathematical models of transmission to virological, clinical, epidemiological and behavioural data to make predictions on the health and economic implications of vaccines against influenza \(seasonal and pandemic\), human papillomavirus \(HPV\), meningococcus, pneumococcus, and many other diseases that can be prevented by a vaccine. 

 **Influenza vaccination** 

 In 2013, the team estimated the reduction in infections and deaths achieved by England and Wales’ flu vaccination programme, compared with no vaccination, and found that children were key spreaders \(3.1\). Targeting the people who transmitted flu by extending the vaccination programme to 5\- to 16\-year\-old children was found to increase the efficiency of the whole programme, resulting in an overall reduction of 0.7 infections per dose and 1.95 deaths per 1,000 doses. Extending the programme was also found to be highly cost\-effective \(3.2\). 

 **Meningococcus B vaccination** 

 Similarly, in 2014, the researchers found that routine infant immunisation for group B meningococcal disease was the most effective vaccination strategy, preventing 27% of meningococcal disease cases over the lifetime of an English birth cohort by vaccinating infants at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age. They also estimated that 71% of meningococcal B cases could be prevented after 10 years by routine vaccination of infants in combination with a large\-scale catch\-up campaign \(3.3\). Routine infant immunisation was also found to be cost\-effective at GBP3 a vaccine dose, and could result in long\-term reductions in cases \(3.4\). 

 **HPV vaccination** 

 The HPV vaccine protects against cancers caused by HPV, including cervical cancer, and some mouth, throat, anal and genital cancers, and against genital warts. In the UK, HPV vaccination was offered to girls aged 12 to 13 through a 3\-dose schedule. Following clinical trials suggesting that 2 doses may offer sufficient protection against HPV, Jit and colleagues investigated whether offering the vaccination as a 2\-dose schedule would be a cost\-effective approach. 

 They compared 2\-dose and 3\-dose HPV vaccine schedules in the UK among males and females aged 12 to 74 years. This cost\-effectiveness study was based on a dynamic model of HPV vaccination. The 2\-dose schedule was found to be the most cost\-effective option if 2 doses provided more than 20 years’ protection against HPV\-related cancers \(3.5\). 

 **Conjugate pneumococcal vaccination** 

 The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine \(PCV\) protects against serious pneumonia caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and is given on the NHS to those at a higher risk of illness, including babies, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions. Van Hoek assessed the cost\-effectiveness of this programme in older adults aged 65 years and over, in a static cohort cost\-effectiveness model of adults with normal immune responses, who were due to be vaccinated in the autumn of 2016 with a PCV \(3.6\). The analysis demonstrated that whilst the programme was effective in preventing pneumococcus diseases, the wider benefits of the vaccination programme in children significantly reducing incidence of the disease in adults meant that the programme targeting the elderly was not cost\-effective given the cost of vaccine administration.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\) advises UK health departments about vaccines that should be introduced. Under the Health Protection \(Vaccination\) Regulations 2009, the Health Secretary is obliged to adopt these recommendations if certain conditions are met, the most important of which is that they are based on an assessment that demonstrates cost\-effectiveness. LSHTM has been the main provider of the first opinion for the health and economic modelling evidence required to assess this, in collaboration with PHE. LSHTM researchers regularly attended JCVI meetings to present evidence before publication, and advised JCVI members prior to their final recommendation. Economic evaluations from LSHTM were also used in the tendering process by the Department of Health and Social Care when selecting manufacturers to supply vaccines to the UK. 

 As a result of JCVI recommendations underpinned by LSHTM research, changes to vaccine schedules have directly benefited thousands of vaccine recipients since 2013. They have also provided indirect protection to the UK public by reducing the spread of infection and averting cases in other individuals, reduced the burden of several diseases, and saved on NHS resources. There are also the wider benefits of averting costs to society and the individual, and of the quality of life improved by disease prevention. 

 **Evidence of impact on specific vaccines:** 

 **Influenza** 

 In 2012, Edmunds and Baguelin presented work to the JCVI on the cost\-effectiveness of changes to flu vaccination; the JCVI recommended extending the flu campaign to include school\-aged children \(age 5 to 17\) and children aged 2 to 5 \(5.1\). This supported the gradual roll\-out of seasonal influenza vaccination to children, beginning with a pilot in 2013 where all 2\- to 3\-year\-olds were offered vaccination through GPs in England, and a pilot in English schools. This pilot was extended every year to include all children up to school year 6 \(age 10 to 11\) in 2019 and 2020 \(5.2\). It eventually became the largest change ever made to the UK’s vaccination programmes in terms of numbers of people vaccinated. Projections suggested that around 5 million extra people would be vaccinated every year, and around 2.5 million fewer would get influenza, when the programme covered all primary school children, compared to before the programme was implemented. The flu vaccine is now offered to all children aged 2 to 10 years old, meaning all primary school age children are now eligible for vaccination and direct protection from flu, and those aged up to 18 years old in clinical risk groups. Data from the 2019/2020 winter season provided by all local authorities showed that over 2.8 million children from reception to school year 6 were vaccinated, representing 60.4% of the eligible pool of primary school age children \(5.3\). 

 With the risk of COVID\-19 and flu both circulating at the same time over the winter of 2020, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) \(of which Edmunds was a member\) advised the UK government that seasonal flu vaccination should be more widely deployed to protect vulnerable individuals \(5.4\). In autumn 2020, flu vaccination was additionally offered to household contacts of those on the NHS Shielded Patient List, children in year 7 \(age 11 to 12\) in secondary schools, and health and social care workers employed through Direct Payment and/or Personal Health Budgets \(5.4\). 

 **HPV** 

 Since 2013, Jit has presented several pieces of work to the JCVI which underpinned successive changes to the HPV vaccination programme, offering direct protection to the public and reducing the burden of HPV\-related cancers. These included: 

1.  Changing the schedule from 3 to 2 doses in 2014 \(5.5\), saving up to 800,000 doses annually \(reflecting the size of the 12\-13 age cohort\) of a quadrivalent vaccine that costs the NHS up to GBP86.50 per dose to procure and distribute \(3.1, 3.2\), with the added benefit of reduced logistical complexity. This work also informed international stakeholders, for example, the World Health Organization’s recommendation of a 2\-dose HPV vaccination in 2014 \(5.6\). 

1.  Rolling out, in 2017, the world’s first programme to vaccinate men who have sex with men \(MSM\), who are at exceptionally high risk of acquiring HPV\-related cancers \(5.7\). 

1.  Vaccinating all boys in England aged 12 to 13 from 2019 onwards \(5.8\). 

 **Meningococcal B** 

 In 2013 and 2014, Edmunds presented impact and cost\-effectiveness analyses to the JCVI which led to babies being given the infant meningococcal B vaccination, making the UK the first country in the world to do so \(5.9\). This was a complex decision, involving a vaccine with an innovative but relatively untried mechanism of action, a rare but devastating disease, and interest from a large number of civil society groups \(such as meningitis charities\). The vaccine was introduced in 2015 to children at 2, 4 and 12 months, preventing hundreds of meningitis cases per year. Public Health England data in 2020 showed that since the vaccine’s introduction, cases of meningitis B disease in England fell by 62% in children who received at least two doses \(5.10\). 

 **Conjugate pneumococcal** 

 In 2015, van Hoek presented work to the JCVI showing that vaccinating older adults with a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine would have little impact and not be cost\-effective \(5.11\). Based on this research, the JCVI did not introduce this vaccination. An independent report by RAND Europe stated that this decision saved the NHS up to GBP25 million pounds per year, and the NIHR recognised this work as 1 of 100 examples of positive change arising from its support of research in its first 10 years \(5.12\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Six interrelated and interdisciplinary public\-history projects up to, through and since the FWW centenary years achieved impact in the domain of ‘ **creativity, culture and society**’ through **collaboration with heritage sector professionals**, including production of exhibitions and staging events, inspiring and supporting new forms of artistic expression, collaboration with the public arts sector, and engagement with marginalised and underparticipating audiences. Impact was also achieved in ‘ **understanding, learning and participation**’ by enhancing understanding of contemporary issues, shaping attitudes and values, stimulating public interest and engagement in research, contributing to memorialisation, commemoration and reconciliation, and increasing understanding of gender roles and promoting equality. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** – References in section 3 are indicated by number \(e.g., **R1**\) 

 Underpinning research cohered around, and interacted between: 

-  **Chronology**: the ‘long’ FWW 1910\-20, especially 1914\-18 

-  **Geography:** England, especially Lincolnshire 

-  **Theme**: public history 

-  **Method**: provincial newspapers 

-  **Projects**: Co\-operative Movement, council houses, Bernard Gilbert, women’s suffrage, women’s football, ‘Spanish’ Flu. 

  

 Long\-standing research since 2005 has explored theory and practice in local, community and regional history, and adult education and lifelong learning more broadly. Through 2014\-21, this explored the concept of **public history** \( **PH – R1, R2, R3, R7\)**, in the contexts of: REF, TEF, KEF; public and community engagement; civic\-university partnership; and place\-related funding. 

 Research on the methodological potential of digitised **provincial newspapers \(PN – R1, R2, R3, R6, R7\)** emerged in the 2008\-14 cycle. Through 2014\-21, enquiry has further extended, deepended and promoted their use, and in forming the principal primary historical source across six engagement  projects. 

  

 Two of the projects emerged in the 2008\-14 cycle, on the rise of both the Lincolnshire **Cooperative Movement \(CM – R4\)** and early Lincoln **council houses \(CH – R7\)**. Research through 2014\-20 has added further to understanding of these topics in the context of the small provincial city, rural county, and FWW. 

  

 Four other inter\-related projects arose during 2014\-20. The discovery of the work of the little\-known Lincolnshire author, **Bernard Gilbert** \(1882\-1927\) **\(BG – R4, R5\)**, has given powerful and radical insight, especially into the FWW, through his atypical, dialect\-rich, home\-front\-based and working\-class\-centric poetry. Fresh research was also stimulated and commissioned as part of national Vote100 initiatives, and saw exploration of Lincolnshire’s role in **women’s suffrage \(WS\)**. Alternative perspectives on the FWW were also opened up through investigation of the rise of munitionette **women’s football** \( **WF – R1\)**, and the impact of the Football Association’s ban of the female game. The women’s suffrage and football research examined historical discourse in newspapers and elsewhere, and their resonance in relation to the experiences and perceptions of gender inequality today. The research for the women’s suffrage/football impact projects was co\-directed with Dr Claudia **Capancioni** \(English\). Research on the **Spanish Influenza \(SI – R2\)** epidemic 1918\-19 examined provincial media content to reveal parallels with Covid\-19 in terms of local and regional impact, and community/public response.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 NTU has had radical impact on the modernisation of gambling taxation, with tax structure and rates directly informed by NTU research. The resulting Gross Profits Taxation replaced turnover taxation for betting and for gambling machines, leading to near doubling in UK tax revenue in 5 years to c. £3 billion a year, with total machine tax revenue of £3.87 billion collected \(95.8% in the current REF period\). 

 Other countries, including the USA and Australia, adopted the UK’s approach within the same period and uniquely delivered benefits simultaneously to operators, consumers, and exchequer. This resolved key policy tensions between industry and government, enhancing both public and private revenue. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 HM Customs & Excise \(HMCE\) commissioned Vaughan Williams in 2000 to undertake a research project called ‘An economic analysis of the options for taxing betting.’ The findings demonstrated that a gross profits system of taxation \(GPT\), in effect taxation based on the stakes placed with betting operators minus winnings paid out, would result in lower prices for consumers and higher turnover for UK betting operators than would the existing tax structure which was levied on bettors’ stakes. 

 The new system was shown to be optimal in terms of efficiency, equity, and the long\-term protection of tax revenues as the new GPT tax system benefited all key stakeholders – the exchequer, the industry, and consumers \( **R1, R2**\). 

 Vaughan Williams was subsequently commissioned by HMRC and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\) to lead a research project ‘Modelling the UK gambling market.’ As part of this he derived estimates of elasticity for different gambling activities, examining the responsiveness of the demand by consumers to changes in price. These estimates have explicitly driven the setting of gambling tax rates before and during the current REF period. 

 His research on the theoretical framework underpinning the switch to the GPT system and gambling machines \(i.e. on the responsiveness of tax revenue to tax rates\), was a development of work he conducted between 2006 and 2009 for HMRC and was published in 2013 \( **R3**\). The work was later extended and expanded, with the switch to gross profits tax on gambling machines, initially in 2013, but followed by tax rate adjustments based on his research in subsequent years \( **R4, R5**\). 

 Collectively these research projects evaluated the competition between conventional gaming machines and the relatively new fixed odds betting terminals \(FOBTs\) and provided empirical estimates of the impact of FOBTs on other gambling machines in the UK. There was no significant evidence that FOBTs displaced conventional gaming machines except in licensed betting offices \( **R6**\). 

 In 2016, Vaughan Williams produced a further unpublished report commissioned by HMRC, titled ‘A Consideration of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and Part III Machines’, which compared structural and functional characteristics of different types of gambling machines, and considered the implications arising from this for tax equivalence and fiscal neutrality for use in the HMRC policy costing model. 

 Vaughan Williams, Garrett and Paton \(2020\) and Garrett, Paton and Vaughan Williams \(2020\) finalise and formalise the theory relating to the responsiveness of tax revenues to tax rates as well as well as updating the evidence base to cover the period since the end of 2013 \( **R4, R5\).**

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  *The HMRC tax model and Machine Games Duty* 

 The introduction of the gross profits tax system for gambling machines in 2013, based on Vaughan Williams’ research, has generated significant increases in government tax revenue as well as a marked improvement in industry profitability and viability, the vast majority of which has occurred since August 2013. Sources \( **S1, S2**, **S3\)** confirm that elasticity estimates for gambling provided by Vaughan Williams were used in tax modelling by HM Revenue and Customs. 

 *“The methodology employed by Professor Leighton Vaughan Williams in his research for HM Revenue & Customs was used explicitly through the HMRC policy costing model in the setting of gambling tax rates during the current REF period”* \( **S3**\). 

 *“In a number of sectors such as terrestrial bingo and pools, the only evidence comes from the study underlying the current HMRC model” \(Paton and Vaughan Williams, 2005\)* \( **S1** p13\). 

 These changes led directly to an increase in the number of machines in operation, and a total tax yield from Machine Games Duty between 2013\-14 and 2018\-19 of £3.87 billion \( **S4**\). 95.8% of this was collected in the current REF period, including £720 million in 2018\-19. For comparison, Amusement Machine Licence Duty in 2012\-13 raised £150.8 million. 

 In this way, the shift to a gross profits system of taxation of gambling machines resolves a key policy tension between industry and government over the sustainability and growth of tax revenues versus industry profitability \- namely, the enhancement of both public and private revenue. Notably, and most unusually, the tax changes delivered benefits of major scale simultaneously to operators, consumers, and the exchequer. The HMRC model, and updates of the model on which the tax changes were based, were uniquely informed by Vaughan Williams’ work for HMRC and DCMS – **\(S1,** **S2**, **S3**, **S5**, **S6**\) 

 The setting of the level of Machine Games Duty was also based on this model, and related tax policy developments \( **S2**, **S7**\), impacting other sectors, were based on the model. It was also used to estimate for policy purposes the likely consequence of subsequent duty changes. 

 *“The sole paper we identified is research carried out by Paton and Vaughan Williams \(2005\) which implies that the demand for FOBTs is price inelastic \(around \-0.4\) whereas the demand for other gaming machines has an elasticity of around \-0.9 in the long run with respect to the tax rate on machines.”* **\(S2\)** 

 The HMRC Principal Research Officer, Megan Gray, states that she can 

 *“… confirm that the research \(which utilised your work\) was used to update the HMRC’s UK gambling model to ensure it reflected the UK gambling market at that time \(2014\) and was further used to estimate the impact of future duty changes more accurately*” \( **S5**\). 

###  *Extension of the gross profits tax system* 

 *“Professor Vaughan Williams’ research was instrumental in the introduction of the gross profits system of betting taxation in the UK, and the development and expansion of that system of taxation…..In summary, the research undertaken by Professor Vaughan Williams for HMRC and more widely has had a distinct, material and sizeable impact on government tax revenues and industry capacity and viability over the course of the current REF period”.* \( **S3**\) 

 Between the tax year prior to the implementation of this extension in 2014, and 2018\-19, general and remote betting duty receipts increased from a total of c. £365 million a year to c. £1.15 billion a year, a total increase of c. £2.4 billion \( **S1**\). In aggregate, there was a near doubling in tax revenue to c. £3 billion a year. 

 A gross profits\-based system of gambling taxation levied at point of consumption was implemented in South Australia in 2017. They used the research findings of Vaughan Williams, notably on demand elasticities for gambling, in setting rates of betting taxation. \( **S8**\). The report commissioned by the Department of Treasury and Finance, South Australia states: 

 *“A unit elasticity is a natural prior assumption … and is also broadly consistent with the estimate of \-1.18 in the \[Paton and Vaughan Williams\] 2005 study … we believe an elasticity of \-1.0 is a reasonable assumption for the elasticity for wagering services in South Australia. We use this as the ‘central case’ in our modelling.”* 

 In 2019, the two most populous Australian states, Victoria and New South Wales, followed South Australia in implementing this system of taxation. 

 In May 2018, the US Supreme Court declared a national ban on sports betting unconstitutional and a matter for individual states. As of November 2020, legal sports betting became available in 19 states, plus Washington DC \(with six more in process\) all based on the methodology employed by Vaughan Williams in his research for HMRC. New entrants have implemented a gross profits system of betting taxation, mirroring the UK, at rates broadly parallel to the rate on sports wagering introduced into the UK. This was noted in a report commissioned in anticipation of the legalisation of sports betting across the USA. 

 “*the UK represents a particularly relevant comparable, with both retail and online gaming, and a tax rate of 15% on GGR*” \( **S9**\). ‘GGR’ is Gross Gaming Revenue, i.e. Gross Profits. 

 As an illustration of impact, New Jersey earned c. $70m and Pennsylvania c. $52m in new state tax revenue from sports betting from June 2018 to July 2020, from baselines of zero.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Professor Harry Hemingway at UCL has used large\-scale patient data to shape national and international clinical guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a range of cardiovascular diseases. This has benefited care and improved outcomes for millions of patients worldwide. Evidence from the research has informed new blood pressure thresholds for more accurate diagnosis of hypertension, enabling 13% more US adults to be diagnosed and treated. It has provided the evidence for more accurate early diagnosis of stable coronary disease, preventing 1,100 heart attacks and strokes per year. Hemingway’s research has additionally led to safer, more targeted use of oral anti\-coagulants to prevent stroke in 340,000 female atrial fibrillation patients across Europe and provided real\-world evidence for the effectiveness of a new secondary prevention treatment in heart attack with the blood\-thinning drug ticagrelor. Finally, UK efforts to improve the care of heart attack patients have been informed by Hemingway’s study of the ‘mortality gap’ between UK and Swedish patients, which revealed there could have been 10,000 fewer UK deaths if the outcomes had mirrored those of heart attack patients in Sweden. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

  

 **Earlier diagnosis of coronary artery disease:** Hemingway co\-led \(with Timmis, Queen Mary University of London, QMUL\) research **\[R1\]** informing a major change in the earlier diagnosis of suspected coronary disease, from exercise electrocardiography \(ECG\) to CT angiography. The research, published in 2008, helped to establish an important principle that clinically recorded data \(i.e. data not collected under research conditions\) could generate robust research findings. At the time this was considered ‘big data’ in terms of ‘volume, variety and veracity’: the cohort included 8,176 patients from six centres and was substantially the largest clinical cohort of patients with chest pain and suspected stable coronary disease followed up with electronic health records for clinical outcomes. Hemingway’s research provided key new evidence demonstrating that the exercise ECG \(‘treadmill’\), which had been the mainstay of diagnosis up until the 2010s, added little diagnostic or prognostic information beyond a structured history of the chest pain, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors and resting ECG findings. 

 **Largest ever cohort study changes threshold for hypertension diagnosis:** UCL\-led research published in 2014 **\[R2\]** informed major changes in the blood pressure threshold at which hypertension is diagnosed. The research involved the largest ever cohort study, involving 1.25 million patients, of blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. By using electronic health records linked to hospitalisation data \(Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CALIBER platform\) the UCL research team were able to show for the first time previously undetected disease associations. These associations extended across a wider range of observed blood pressure levels and were in relation to a wider range of cardiovascular diseases \(12 in total\) than had previously been studied. These findings were relevant to deciding threshold blood pressure levels at which hypertension is diagnosed. Previous studies had largely focused on cardiovascular death only, or were limited to heart attack and stroke; and these earlier studies had been too small to reliably estimate risks among people with systolic blood pressure of 130mmHg at different ages. 

 **Change to policy on treating atrial fibrillation in women:** A major change in policy for the treatment with anticoagulants of women with atrial fibrillation was based directly on research published by the UCL team in 2016 **\[R3\]**. The research involved 70,000 patients with atrial fibrillation in the linked primary\-secondary care electronic health record platform, CALIBER.  The UCL team demonstrated how the net clinical benefit of warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation \(AF\) varies across a measure of risk widely used in clinical practice: the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>\-VASC score. Warfarin has a major side effect of bleeding, so haemorrhagic strokes are a particular concern in this group. The UCL team found that women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>\-VASC score of 1 or 0 had net clinical benefit; this means that the benefits of warfarin in preventing ischaemic strokes is nullified by the harms of haemorrhagic stroke. This is one of the first examples of a major clinical guideline development group \(the European Society of Cardiology, the AF guidelines have >8,000 citations\) working synchronously with an academic group \(UCL\) to generate new evidence which in turn directly informed a change in clinical recommendation. 

 **Informing regulatory approval of ticagrelor for heart attack survivors:** Continuing Hemingway’s ground\-breaking use of big data, a study of heart attack survivors in England, US, Sweden and France using real\-world data from electronic health records was published by UCL in 2016 **\[R4\]** which informed regulatory approval of ticagrelor in heart attack survivors. Two aspects of this research were novel: first, nearly all previous research on heart attack starts follow\-up on the day of the heart attack; by contrast Hemingway and colleagues studied only those people who had already survived for 365 days. Second, this research was, and remains, one of a small number of studies comparing care and outcomes across several countries using clinically collected data on care and outcomes. The research demonstrated the surprisingly high risk of these heart attack survivors \(between 25 and 36% of patients had died or had a heart attack or stroke after a further three years\) and thus showed the international unmet need for additional secondary prevention in these countries and the real\-world effectiveness of ticagrelor as prolonged dual anti\-platelet therapy. 

 **Improving UK heart attack care and outcomes:** Further research to inform UK efforts to improve heart attack care and outcomes was published by the UCL team in 2014 **\[R5\]**. Hemingway and colleagues identified a ‘mortality gap’ between UK and Sweden, based on research on more than 500,000 heart attack patients from nationwide registries. This was the first time that nationwide data \(ie. from all hospitals in the country\) in two countries had been used to study both the care and outcome of any disease – in this sense, it was pioneering. Hemingway and colleagues compared the quality of healthcare \(i.e. the level of adherence to guideline\-recommended medications and procedures\), and the number of patients who had died within 30 days of having a heart attack. They found that 10,000 fewer deaths would have occurred in the UK if the outcomes had mirrored those of Swedish patients. 

 The research team, led by Hemingway, comprised UCL Professors Aroon Hingorani \(Clinical Pharmacology\), Bryan Williams \(Medicine\); with Professors Spiros Denaxas \(Biomedical Informatics\) and John Deanfield \(Cardiology\). The UCL Team collaborated with QMUL \(Professor Adam Timmis, Cardiology, and Professor Mark Caulfield Clinical Pharmacology\) and LSHTM \(Liam Smeeth, General Practice\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide, responsible for an estimated 31% of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization. UCL research between 2014 and 2020, led by Professor Hemingway, has made novel use of large\-scale health records data to gain several important insights into the diagnosis and treatment of the most common cardiovascular diseases: high blood pressure, coronary disease, heart attack and atrial fibrillation.  His insights have challenged the status quo, shaped policy, and informed improvements in care for millions of patients worldwide. 

 The impacts started with a radical change in the standard method for diagnosis of coronary disease, in people with stable \(non\-emergency\) chest pain **.** Research **\[R1\]** led by Hemingway and colleagues at QMUL was cited 16 times in the NICE Guidelines Committee on Chest pain \(CG95\) **\[S1\]**, which recommended that exercise ECG should no longer be the standard diagnostic procedure. Hemingway was a member of this NICE guideline committee. Each year since 2014, approximately 100,000 new patients are seen in the NHS with suspected stable coronary disease. Subsequent near\-complete abandonment of exercise ECG has allowed an estimated 15,000 more people per year to be diagnosed with coronary disease \- earlier and with greater accuracy \- by CT angiography. This, in turn, enables sooner treatment with secondary preventative medication \(such as aspirin, statins or beta blockers\), which is estimated to have averted 1,100 fatal and non\-fatal cardiovascular events per year. 

 Hemingway’s UCL hypertension research was cited as observational evidence informing the decision to make one of the most significant changes in the international clinical guidelines **\[S2, S3\]**, for blood pressure management in recent years: lowering the blood pressure thresholds at which hypertension is diagnosed from ≥140 systolic or ≥90mmHg diastolic to ≥130 systolic or ≥80mmHg diastolic **\[R2\]**. As a result, a larger proportion of the general population are now eligible for drug and other interventions to reduce risks of heart attack and stroke which are caused by high blood pressure. Health care professionals have benefitted from new, clear guidance on how to manage such patients. This major change in clinical guidelines has been estimated to increase by 4,200,000 the number of US adults now diagnosed and recommended for blood pressure\-lowering medication, compared with the previous guidelines in 2003 **\[S4\]**. 

 Further research from UCL in 2016 has challenged the status quo of ‘gender blind’ treatment of the most common heart rhythm disorder, atrial fibrillation. This evidence on safe targeting of oral anticoagulants in women with atrial fibrillation **\[R3\]** was solely responsible for changing major international clinical guidelines **\[S5, S6\]**. The 2012 guidelines did not offer sex\-specific thresholds of risk in the prescribing of anti\-coagulants for preventing stroke; but it was known that men are at greater risk of stroke than women. Based on new UCL evidence, the 2016 European guidelines were then changed to explicitly recommend anti\-coagulation to women with a score of ≥2. There are an estimated 5 million women with atrial fibrillation in Europe, about 7.4% \(370,000\) of whom have a CHA2DS2\-VASC score of 2, and in whom anti\-coagulation confers net clinical benefit. Hemingway and colleagues estimate that \- even assuming only 50% of women in this group are anticoagulated \- this prevents up to 1,900 fatal and non\-fatal strokes each year. Such prevention is particularly important given the high levels of disability and health care use associated with stroke. 

 Research on unmet need and real\-world effectiveness of the blood\-thinning drug ticagrelor **\[R4\]**, published by the UCL team in 2016, was cited in the NICE regulatory approval \(TA420\) **\[S7\]** for ticagrelor use for preventing atherothrombotic events after myocardial infarction. This changed clinical practice to address the very high risk of major cardiovascular events in heart attacks survivors, demonstrated by the UCL research. NICE approved the use of prolonged \(effectively lifelong\) medication with dual anti\-platelet therapy \(i.e. aspirin and ticagrelor\). Previously, only certain sub\-groups of patients were prescribed ticagrelor and ticagrelor was stopped within one year after heart attack. This research helps to show how the risk of further heart attacks in such patients can be further reduced. The British Heart Foundation estimates that there are 1,300,000 survivors of acute myocardial infarction, most of whom now are recommended for prolonged dual anti\-platelet therapy with ticagrelor. Hemingway and colleagues’ research **\[R4\]** is based on unselected clinical populations, which provides a more real\-world estimate of risks of cardiovascular events \(compared to the lower risks estimated in healthier populations selected into trials\). Using the real\-world risks, and assuming only half of eligible patients receive dual anti\-platelet treatment, an estimated 6,500 cardiovascular deaths, non\-fatal myocardial infarction or strokes are prevented every year in the UK. 

 The UCL research demonstrating the ‘international mortality gap’ between the UK and Sweden **\[R5\]** among heart attack patients has had impacts beyond stimulating cardiologists to provide better care and close the mortality gap; it informed amendments to the Health and Social Care Act. The research was published on 23 January 2014 amidst public concerns that the government may sell NHS data to insurance companies in the ‘care.data’ programme. The widespread TV and print media coverage of the research \(with headlines such as ‘Second rate care’ \- Sky\) ensured that the research was used in discussions with the Secretary of State for Health **\[S8\]** about the value of health data. On 12 February 2014, Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, called a meeting with Chair of the UK Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, among others. An email from the Chair about the meeting describes how the UCL findings had shaped the Health and Social Care Act: *“I used your \[UCL\] examples of linking datasets to improve quality of care now and the Swedish comparison. The latter seemed to make a big impact. The immediate result is Jeremy Hunt made an amendment to the \[Heath and Social\] Care Act the same day to ensure the public that care.data will not be available to insurance companies, mortgage lenders etc.”* **\[S8\]** 

 The research rapidly became an influential example of public good arising from public sector access to health record data, with appropriate information governance. The amendments were passed in the Care Act 2014, to allow data release only: *“for the purposes of—the provision of health care or adult social care, or the promotion of health.”* This stimulated professional societies to understand care and outcomes from NHS care **\[S9\]** *.*

##  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In recent years, Defined Contributions \(DC\) pension funds have grown in importance. However, the risks associated with them can have dramatic consequences for individuals’ financial security in retirement. This is especially with regard to ‘sequence risks’, i.e. risk that the timing of withdrawals from a retirement account can damage the investor's overall return. Research by Smith, with colleagues at City’s Business School, developed an investment strategy that significantly reduces investors’ exposure to sequence risk. This strategy has been implemented in four retail investment funds and a web\-based tool has been developed to make the research results open to all. Analysis demonstrates that this strategy can enhance fund performance, benefiting investors, and savers close to retirement.

##  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The dramatic falls in bond yields since 2007 have pushed many pension funds into deficit, creating serious problems for the sustainability of pension systems throughout the Western world. In the UK, Baroness Altmann, a former Minister of State for Pensions and Child Maintenance, has expressed serious concerns about the consequences of \`pension pain’ on the wider economy and this has become a salient and emotive political issue across Europe and other developed nations. 

 Novel research conducted by Peter N Smith at York, with Andrew Clare, James Seaton and Stephen Thomas at City’s Business School, explored how sequence risk can be significantly reduced by applying trend\-following or smoothing investment strategies **\[A\-E\]**. Sequence risk is the risk that the timing of withdrawals from a retirement account can damage the investor's overall return. The risk of poor investment outcomes arising from withdrawal patterns is a poorly understood and under\-researched but a crucial aspect of the risk many small pension fund investors face. However, the importance of understanding this risk is especially timely given the significant movement, in recent years, from Defined Benefit \(DB\) to Defined Contribution \(DC\) based pension schemes. 

 While DB schemes provide a pension where the benefit is known \(determined by a formula involving salary and duration of employment\), the value of a pension under the DC alternative is, by contrast, based on the investment returns on contributions made by the individual and their employer. Assets in occupational and personal DC plans now exceed assets in DB plans in most countries. Individuals have to manage their own long\-term savings and, very importantly, the rate at which they use up their savings in retirement. This means that both investment and longevity risk rest increasingly with the individual investor rather than with their employer. Those individuals in DC schemes towards the end of their working life or early in retirement are exposed to particular forms of investment risk in addition to those usually faced by investors. Sequence risk arises from large investment losses at times where accumulated investment savings are highest. These losses can have negative effects on the income of individuals in retirement on a scale from which it will not be possible to recover. Examples of these large systemic losses are September 2008 during the Financial Crisis and March 2020 during the COVID\-19 crisis. The damage to the standard of living of these individuals may subsequently also impinge on their health and longevity. 

 ‘Trend following’ is an investment or trading strategy which attempts to take advantage of long, medium or short\-term moves observed in various markets. Traders who employ a trend following strategy ‘jump on’ the trend \(when they perceive that it has established within their reasons or rules\) and ‘ride it’. If the trend turns, the trader exits, moving their funds into risk\-free short\-term government debt and waiting until a further trend develops. The underlying economic justification for trend following lies in behavioural finance tenets including herding, disposition, confirmation effects and representativeness biases. 

  

 Work by Smith and colleagues **\[A\]\[B\]** examined the superiority of ‘trend following’ or ‘smoothing’ investment strategies in terms of both higher average returns and superior performance in reducing the exposure to extreme downside risk that bedevils many alternative strategies. Subsequent research highlighted the effectiveness of smoothing strategies in mitigating the effects of large asset market downturns on the value of the accumulated pension savings of individuals, allowing them to withdraw more in their retirement **\[C\]\[D\]\[E\]**. In the context of the investment of DC funds, this smoothing approach was found to reduce downside risks without sacrificing overall levels of return. Although involved in all aspects of the joint research, Smith specifically contributed expertise in the area of financial risk management. 

 In **\[C\]** the authors highlight sequence risk in investment in equities and the evaluation of pension savings, focusing on the rate at which funds from the savings pot can be taken as income over the retirement period. They also show that this withdrawal rate can be improved by extracting information from market data such as the cyclically\-adjusted price\-to\-earnings \(CAPE\) ratio. They show that, in some circumstances, individuals can expect to withdraw about 50% more per annum where the proposed investment strategy is used. 

 Many suppliers of DC investment schemes follow the maxims of lifecycle models, which promote investment in high return, high risk equities in the first part of an individual’s working life and savings journey. This exposure is then unwound into apparently lower risk government bonds along a ‘glidepath’ from middle age into retirement. A growing body of opinion points out the lower expected returns and income in retirement that follow from the strategy without a commensurate reduction in risk. In **\[D\]** Smith and colleagues show, for the UK, that investment in ‘trend following’ equities post\-retirement can raise expected returns significantly with no increase in risk overall and with a reduced exposure to the specific risk of a large drawdown in wealth. They show that adopting this strategy is more effective than the typical advice, which is to ‘spread one's eggs over many baskets’ and diversify one's investment into a wider range of assets. In **\[E\]** they go on to show that glidepath investing is clearly dominated by sustained investment in trend following equity strategies.

##  4. Details of the Impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by Smith and colleagues, quantifying the benefits of trend following and smoothing investment techniques, has had significant impact across the REF period. Initially, the authors focussed on the use and implementation of a variety of investment strategies to construct a number of financial products available to investment professionals. Later work built on this experience to focus more specifically on the investments of defined contributions pension funds. The overall message of the underpinning research has been translated into practical advice for investment funds, that they should offer products that have lower fees, low volatility and protection against downside and therefore sequence risk. Wide dissemination within relevant practitioner networks has resulted in growing awareness and changing the practices of a number of investment funds. 

 <ins> **Uptake and performance**</ins> 

 There has been significant direct application of the research by a number of organisations to the management of investment funds, including the following three funds that were early adopters. 

 **1. WM Capital Management company* uses Smith et al.’s research to design their retirement products: With significant funds under management, WM Capital Management offers retirement investment solutions specifically based on this research to Independent Financial Advisors \(IFAs\) and investment funds **\[1\]**. An example of the latter is the WAY Global Momentum Fund \(ISIN GB00B57W7682\) which has GBP29.5 million assets under management \(Jan 2019\). On its website, WM Capital Management writes: *“The academic model behind the WM Retirement Investment Solutions has been created by Professors Stephen Thomas and Andrew Clare from Cass Business School and Professor Peter Smith of University of York. These three specialists are regarded as international leaders in investment strategy, with a large global following of their research papers. The investment process they have created has been back\-tested over many years and has been successfully used to drive live portfolios over the past seven years. It is a totally unique approach and is based on years of high\-quality independent research.”* **\[1\]**. 

 **2. Plain English Finance**:* The VT PEF Global Multi\-Asset Fund \(ISIN: GB00BDZZSM84\) offered by Plain English Finance adopted the findings and principles in Smith et al.’s research. This fund has circa GBP10 million in assets under management and takes the fundamental insights of the research and applies them in a live investment setting **\[2\]\[3\]**. Plain English Finance highlights the importance of sequence risk for those about to enter retirement and the solution offered by trend following. Of only four references Plain English Finance use in their prospectus, two refer to Smith et al **\[2\]**. 

 **3. Whole Money* offers products based on the research: Whole Money, a trading company of the ITI Group, used the research **\[A\-E\]** to inform development of their Whole Money Lifetime Fund and Pension Pathway. On its website, Whole Money refers to new investment ‘ *technologies*’ that are *‘wrought in academia’* and *‘revolutionise retirement planning, not just in the UK but worldwide’  \[4\]**.  It also notes how: *‘The UK pensions industry – worth £6.1 trillion – has been searching for this kind of innovation, as well as being driven by upcoming changes in regulation. Now, it’s here.’*  Smith is one of only three professors engaged to provide academic support to Whole Money’s commercial advisory board **\[4\]**. 

 **App development for individual investors**:* Through 2020, Solent Investment has been developing an app based on the research, which will be available from Solent Investment Strategy Builder to individuals through their Independent Financial Advisors. The app will help consumers improve their financial literacy and plan their retirement journeys, by enabling them to assess their chosen income withdrawal path and pension investment portfolio and update them on a regular basis. Launch of the app was delayed from summer 2020 due to Covid\-19 and it is now forecast for Spring 2021. 

 **Improving financial well\-being of pension holders**:* There is growing evidence that the trend following model developed by Smith and colleagues enhances the performance of investment funds. A prime example is Plain English Finance, mentioned above. Their prospectus **\[2\]** shows, when the model was ‘back tested’ on the fund’s performance going back to 2001, *“how effective trend following can be for loss minimisation \- something which is absolutely key for investors”.* It goes on to note: “ *that both* \(a standard, diversified and trend following\) *approaches achieve roughly the same returns and would have turned £100,000 invested in January 2001 into around £320,000 by the end of June 2017 with no further investment. Crucially, however, the trend following version had a maximum peak to trough loss of around 10%, whereas the version with diversification but no trend following suffered a fall of over 25% \(both in the year 2008/2009\)”*. The prospectus also states: “ *The net result \[of trend following\] is to achieve meaningful long run returns on your money, with significantly reduced risk of loss. The fund is the investment equivalent of the tortoise – grinding out steady returns over time. As a result, the long run performance numbers are exceptional”* **\[2\]**. 

 These assessments of improved performance have led others to comment on the wider contribution of the research in helping to improve the financial wellbeing of pension holders more generally. In a review of the issues **\[5\]**, the Head of Pensions and Investment Education, Columbia Threadneedle Investments notes that planning a pension is currently one of the *“most difficult of life’s financial decisions”* with *“many DC savers at risk of sleepwalking into retirement penury”.*  In this regard: *“It is...no exaggeration to say that the ground\-breaking research conducted by Professors Clare, Smith and Thomas and the implementation of their findings into an easily accessible investment solution, that significantly reduces these risks is, for many, the difference between enjoying and enduring one’s retirement.”* **\[6\]**. The Founder of Plain English Finance is also positive about the wider contribution, stating: “... *the work being done by Professors Andrew Clare, Stephen Thomas and Peter N Smith is undoubtedly of paramount importance for savers & investors, the financial services industry, governments and by extension, entire populations everywhere.  I would argue that their work very likely provides us with one of the few common sense solutions to one of the most fundamental and destabilising challenges of our time, and should be viewed in that context.  Their work is of crucial importance for society as a whole, not just for those of us in financial services*.” **\[7\]**. 

 <ins> **Changing industry practice**</ins> 

 The findings of the research have been widely disseminated within industry circles and have gained significant traction. According to a Non\-Executive Director, HSBC Retirement Services Ltd, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd and GAM Sterling Management Ltd, the research has helped to fill a significant gap in industry knowledge globally. He notes how: ‘ *The established pensions and asset management industries have to date focused on how to improve retirement outcomes through the accumulation of larger “pension pots”, rather than the effectiveness of how those pots are utilised at and in retirement. This is an international phenomenon, and as retirement systems in markets such as the US, Australia and the UK begin to mature, the shortfall in thinking and proposition design is creating an immediate crisis. Academic and industry strategies to date are under\-developed, and have continued to focus on the 'wrong risks' i.e. how to optimise accumulation rather than how to evolve into decumulation, the phase where members are drawing down their pension pots’*. In this regard, he states that the work of Smith and colleagues represents a major step forward. Specifically: *“The two publications **\[C\]** and **\[F\]** revolutionise the quality of understanding of the risks involved and the potential solutions to those, as well as providing a welcome practical solution for retirees, scheme members, trustees and industry providers. I believe these are landmark studies the conclusions of which could, and indeed should, become the benchmark for future member engagement and product design in this vital area of financial provision.”* **\[8\]**. 

 In addition, the publication of some of the research in *Financial Analysts Journal* **\[C\]** helped to communicate the findings to a wide practitioner audience. This journal has a significant professional readership through its parent organisation, the CFA Institute, which sets the world’s professional standards for investment management professionals. Messages from the research were highlighted by the CFA in a blog and discussed by Peter Smith in conversation with industry professionals in the US in a webinar **\[9\]** in June 2019. The research has also been presented at a number of industry conferences including Certified Financial Planner \(CFP\) conference, October 2016, DB to DC Transfers, Westminster and City 6<sup>th</sup> Conference, April 2018, the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment \(CISI\) financial planning conference, October 2018, and Portfolio Risk Summit, ETF Strategy, May 2019. Finally, the ideas have traction in the worldwide retirement investment community as indicated by the reference in **\[10\]** by Newfound Research, a US\-based investment.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Historians of science and medicine at the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with computer game developers, have demonstrated the value of historical research to the creation of ground\-breaking game narratives, and have established new models for how academics can collaborate with the gaming industry. Lauren Kassell's research on the casebooks of sixteenth\-century astrologer Simon Forman formed the basis of the genre\-pushing *Astrologaster*, which has been purchased by over 800,000 people. Helen Anne Curry's research on amateur plant breeding provided content for *Seed*, an award\-winning virtual reality experience. In both cases, historical scholarship led to innovative and academically informed game content. In turn, the games have generated sales revenue and prize funding for the partner companies. *Astrologaster* has been part of a games bundle that has generated over USD8 million for racial justice charities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Simon Forman’s casebooks document the hopes and worries, many of them health related, of thousands of Elizabethan Londoners. Kassell is the world expert on these documents. Her monograph \[R1\] demonstrates the extent to which Forman used his astrological expertise to secure his patients’ trust. In a survey of practices of recording and preserving casebooks before 1700 \[R2\], she historicised medical writing practices, established the extent to which casebooks shaped medical encounters, and demonstrated that while Forman’s casebooks, and those of his protégé Richard Napier, were typical of the time, they are exceptional in the numbers of consultations they record and the fact that they survive. She used casebooks to understand how practitioners and their patients negotiated shared and competing understandings of fertility \[R3\]. From 2008 to 2019, she headed the Casebooks Project, a team of scholars who transformed Forman’s and Napier’s paper archive into a digital archive. This work produced a digital edition with a critical introduction, an image archive, a dataset, a selection of five hundred fully transcribed cases, and a body of public engagement \[R4\]. This work inspired and informed the development of *Astrologaster*. 

 From her arrival in Cambridge in 2012 until 2016, Curry led a programme of research on the history of plant breeding, giving particular attention to early techniques of genetic manipulation such as radiation and chemicals. Among other findings, this research revealed a heretofore unexamined community of amateur experimentalists who conducted their own investigations in plant breeding with an unusual array of genetic tools, including x\-rays, chemicals, and nuclear radiation \[R5, R6\]. Whereas historians and others have seen genetic technologies as sophisticated tools deployed in laboratories by trained experts, at least until the advent of twenty\-first century DIY biology, Curry's publications document a rich tradition of amateur engagement with genetic technologies in homes and gardens. Accounts of rose breeders scraping radium from clock dials to treat developing buds, marigold lovers attempting to hybridise incompatible varieties with the aid of a chemical bath, and gardeners purchasing ‘atomic\-irradiated seed’ all testify to the existence and extent of this engagement. These accounts served as inspiration and provided essential historical context for *Seed*.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Overview: Kassell’s collaboration with the developer Nyamyam, and Curry’s collaboration with the developer All Seeing Eye \- both facilitated by The Wellcome Trust \- have together established an influential template for the role of historical scholarship in developing new game content, and for broader links between academia and the gaming industry. These collaborations derive jointly from the HPS Department’s culture of engagement, from its research priorities focused on medical and environmental topics, and from its policy of encouraging exploratory conversations with individuals and institutions outside of academia. 

 **Astrologaster** 

 Nyamyam \(http://nyamyam.com/\) released the game *Astrologaster, a comedy written in the stars* in May 2019. It takes inspiration from Simon Forman’s casebooks. The Casebooks Project team \- led by Professor Lauren Kassell and funded by The Wellcome Trust \- acted as historical consultants for the game. Jennifer Schneidereit, developer at Nyamyam, summarises Kassell’s contribution: 

 ‘Astrologaster was inspired by Professor Lauren Kassell's research and would not exist without her. Her work enabled us to understand Elizabethan medical encounters and made it possible for us to design a game that captured historical social dynamics. … Astrologaster is the first game to be developed in dialogue with a historical research project. It establishes a new model for making games. The industry is concerned about a tendency towards homogeneity. Interactions like this one foster the production of innovative work.’ \[E8\] 

 **Forging new computer game genres.** An article in *Prospect* notes Kassell’s role not merely in developing this specific game, but in laying out a new and more sophisticated genre for computer games in general. It profiled Schneidereit, noting that: 

 ‘\[Schneidereit’s\] latest game, currently in development, is *Astrologaster*, a period comedy developed with the writer Katharine Neil that draws on the work of the Cambridge academic Lauren Kassell. … It’s a fascinating mixture of historical enthusiasm and subversive modern comedy, which its creator intends to offer “an interesting and unusual look at history; at the little people, not the kings and queens.” It’s also about as far away in spirit from the Hollywood\-Grecian bluster of *Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey* as you can imagine.’ \[E1\] 

 A later article in *THE* focuses on *Astrologaster* as an example of a game that is having impact by transforming how academics think about what it means to make their work accessible \[E2\]. That article quotes Iain Dodgeon, director of OKRE \(Opening Knowledge across Research and Entertainment, a new UK\-based organisation bringing the research and entertainment sectors closer together\) making the case that ‘Games can help you relate to research through direct experience’: *Astrologaster* is one of Dodgeon’s primary examples. 

 **Grounding game play in history.** Since meeting the team from Nyamyam at a Wellcome\-organised workshop in September 2014, Kassell’s Casebooks team has provided selections of material from Forman’s casebooks and information about his methods and suggested further readings. They commented on Nyamyam’s drafts of successful funding applications from the European Union’s Creative Europe Media and The Wellcome Trust. They read drafts of the character summaries, storylines and scripts and provided feedback about their historical accuracy, encouraging the uses of humour and deliberate anachronism, rather than romanticised nostalgia, to challenge players to think about meanings of health and illness. From the perspective of Casebooks, working on *Astrologaster* contributed to their thinking about the performative nature of the casebooks; about how to \(re\)present the casebooks in the project’s search interface; and about innovative ways to communicate the history of medicine to both academic and non\-academic audiences. 

 **Delivering historical research to new audiences.** The game was on *Shack News*’s list of the twenty most anticipated indie games of 2019 \[E3\]. It received four\-star reviews from the *LA Times* and the *Guardian*, and has been praised in the gaming press and in playthroughs. It was later one of just five games to feature in the *Guardian*’s roundup of culture in 2019 that might ‘make you feel less terrible about the UK election’ \[E4, E5\]. Playthroughs of *Astrologaster* have been watched by over 1 million people. Games players have made hundreds of positive comments about the game at Nyamyam’s twitter feed: for example one Tweeter writes: ‘How am I only just discovering Astrologaster? It combines my two loves – gaming and medical history\! This is perfect\!\!” or @Blackcom666 who tweeted, ‘I’ve finally played \#astrologaster and oh, wow\! The audio quality, the art direction, the researches and style behind the writing. It’s an amazing game which manages to surprise me … Great job to the team @nyamyamgame’ \[E6\]. 

 **Generating charitable funding.** As of July 2020, \[Text Redacted for Publication\] people have purchased the game and generated revenue directly for Nyamyam. However, this number is dwarfed by the 800,000 people who have purchased *Astrologaster* as part of a large bundle of games made available \(for a minimum donation of USD5\) at itch.io in aid of racial justice and equality. The bundle as a whole has now raised in excess of USD8 million for the chosen charities. \[E7\] 

 **Seed** 

 *Seed* took shape with support from the Epic Games and The Wellcome Trust, the two sponsors of the 'Developing Beyond' competition. In February 2017 All\-Seeing Eye was chosen as a semi\-finalist and awarded USD15,000. In July 2017 they were selected as one of three finalists and awarded a further USD60,000. In February 2018, the game \(which remains in prototype as of July 2020\) took the top prize and USD150,000 at the final judging \[E9\]. 

 The Associate Creative Director of All Seeing Eye gives Curry decisive credit for the game’s success: 

 ‘Helen acted as a scientific/historical advisor directly informing several of the key mechanics in the experience. It is no exaggeration to say that our winning of the competition was as a direct result of our collaboration, her work and research input.’ \[E10; see also E11\] 

 The impact of Curry's work with All Seeing Eye's *Seed*, achieved through hands\-on collaboration, game play and media coverage, has been to create a research\-based game experience, to engage wider audiences in the history and science of plant breeding, to encourage games developers in science\-based gaming and novel forms of collaboration, and to demonstrate to scientists the potential of games for communicating ideas. 

 **Bringing reality to virtual reality.** All Seeing Eye submitted a proposal for a game involving experimental plant breeding to the first round of the competition in early 2017. At this point Curry, an established expert in the history of plant breeding was engaged as a collaborator in the project at the recommendation of The Wellcome Trust. Curry shared her knowledge of the history of amateur plant breeding with All Seeing Eye, offering a more relevant starting point for developing the background narrative of *Seed* than that of contemporary laboratory\-based genetic engineering, as had initially been planned. Curry also devised basic plant breeding scenarios based on real\-life examples that the designers incorporated into the game. 

 **Transforming game development.** Curry’s collaboration offered a new model for how a developer could generate revenue in collaboration with academics. As described in a *THE* article, 'Although Mr Kay had initially envisaged a high\-tech virtual reality environment for his game, he soon realised that Dr Curry’s research provided him with a much more unusual aesthetic along with many intriguing details… “We have taken that historic period and such stories to create beautiful visual vignettes,” Mr Kay explained' \[E11\]. 

 As a result of this, Curry’s work has had impact on further revenue\-generating ventures, such as All Seeing Eye’s virtual reality recreation of the ‘Dambusters’ mission \(now installed at the RAF museum in Hendon\). Olie Kay explains: 

 ‘In working on *Seed* with Helen it was evident how historical and scientific consultation/collaboration could be enormously beneficial to our working practices and have a real impact on not only how a project developed, but also the end result. As such we were emboldened to collaborate with several researchers for our Dambusters who again were instrumental to the success of the project.’ \[E10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study details a research project undertaken by Associate Professor Shelley Piasecka, which examined the potential for Theatre\-in\-Education \(TIE\) to offer non\-discriminatory and holistic ways of delivering UK counter\-terrorism strategies. The European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\) adopted Piasecka’s research findings to inform the work of the EU in combatting terrorism and youth radicalisation and her research was instrumental in the convening of an expert conference at the European Parliament to coincide with International Refugee Day \(2018\). Piasecka’s research findings have also provided opportunities for practitioners to critically reflect upon and evaluate their work with young people on the subject of terrorism and violent extremism. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research was undertaken between 2016\-2018 and was a new interdisciplinary study in the intersection between the Performing Arts and the Social and Political Sciences. The research was undertaken by Shelley Piasecka, Associate Professor of Theatre and Applied Drama in the Department of Music, Media and Performance at the University of Chester. The underpinning research stage was funded with competitive Quality Research grants. 

 <ins>2.1 Research Context</ins> 

 The research context was informed with critical readings on PREVENT \(Heath\-Kelly 2012; Qureshi 2015; Busher et al 2017\), and the cultural impact of the war on terror for young British Muslims \(Lynch 2013; Qurashi 2018\). Research in the Performing Arts, specifically in the field of educational theatre, has tended to focus on the transformational, social, and aesthetic qualities of the art form; see, for example, Bartlett, *Not in my Name* \(2011\) and Winston and Strand, *Tapestry and the aesthetics of theatre in education as dialogic encounter and civil exchange* \(2013\). While TIE is well established in UK schools, anti\-extremist work is a fairly new development. There is very little research that examines TIE against a critical reading of UK PREVENT, and the impact of the global war on terror on young British Muslims. 

 <ins>2.2 Methodology</ins> 

 In 2016, Piasecka observed two Prevent\-funded anti\-extremist TIE projects: *Game On* \(Reveal Theatre\) and *Tapestry* \(The Play House\), carried out in situ at secondary schools in the cities of Stoke\-on\-Trent and Birmingham. In Stoke\-on\-Trent, the majority of the learners were white British, 

 and in Birmingham, the majority were from BAME and minority backgrounds. All schools were co\-educational and the learners were aged 11\-14 years. The observational findings were supported by in\-depth qualitative interviews with drama facilitators, actors, and artistic directors. Piasecka also interviewed artistic directors from 2engage Performing Arts on their Anti\-Racist TIE project, *Love & Hate,* which was funded by Lancashire Police and Blackpool Council *.* 

 <ins>2.3 Findings</ins> 

 A review of the literature suggests that a disproportionate focus on Islamist forms of terrorism in the Prevent Duty Strategy was a contributory factor in the construction of Islamophobia and anti\-Muslim sentiment, while Far Right extremism and other forms of terrorism were largely overlooked. Plus, the targeted allocation of Prevent funding reinforced discriminatory beliefs that some communities were more vulnerable to extremism than others. Notwithstanding these concerns, the research found that anti\-extremist TIE has the potential to make a positive contribution to the development of critical thinking on the causes of terrorism and violent extremism with young people. Moreover, anti\-extremist TIE resists a polarised reading of terrorism as a Muslim concern because it brings into the frame the interdependency of Far Right and Islamist forms of terrorism. 

 <ins>2.4 Research Outputs</ins> 

 The findings were published in a peer\-reviewed article for *Critical Studies on Terrorism*, Taylor & Francis, 2019 \[3:1\]. As an indicator of the journal’s esteem, the Editor\-in\-Chief is Richard Jackson – a pre\-eminent scholar in the field of Critical Terrorism Studies. The Editorial Board includes Noam Chomsky \( *MIT*, USA\); Charlotte Heath\-Kelly \( *University of Warrick*, UK\); Louise Richardson \( *University of St Andrews*, UK\); and Michael Stohl *\(University of California, Santa Barbara,* USA *\).* 

 The research findings were disseminated at conferences and symposiums in England \(2017; 2018\), Vic, Catalonia \(2017\), and Brussels, Belgium \(2018\). In 2018, Piasecka presented a TEDx talk on the theme \[3:2\] *.*

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Piasecka’s research is evidenced in three areas. First, the European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\) adopted her findings to inform the work of the EU in combatting terrorism and youth radicalisation. Piasecka’s research was instrumental in the convening of an expert conference at the European Parliament to coincide with International Refugee Day \(2018\). Second, Piasecka’s observations of anti\-extremist TIE has helped UK MEPs and staff to identify new and innovative ways of preventing young people from being drawn into terrorism. Third, albeit ancillary to the first two, the research findings have provided opportunities for practitioners to critically reflect upon and evaluate their work with young people. 

 <ins>4.1 Beneficiaries</ins> 

-  Alfiaz Vaiya: Coordinator of the European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(2015\-2019\). 

-  Julie Ward: MEP North West Region \(2014\-2020\). 

-  Sajjad Karim: MEP North West Region \(2014\-2019\). 

-  Anita Tusar: Political Advisor on Extremism, European Parliament. 

-  Figen Murray: Peace Campaigner. 

-  Ed Morris and Phil Goss: Artistic Directors of *2engage Performing Arts.* 

-  Associate Professor Robert Marsden: Head of Media and Performance at Staffordshire University and freelance theatre director. 

 <ins>4.2 Pathways to Impact</ins> 

 Between 2016\-2018, Piasecka attended the European Parliament \(Brussels\), to meet with parliamentary members and staff responsible for shaping EU responses to the threats of domestic and global terrorism: Trevor MacFarlane, Cultural Affairs Manager, Office of Julie Ward MEP; Anita Tusar, Advisor to Extremist Working Group; Julie Ward MEP and Alfiaz Vaiya, former coordinator of the European Parliament Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\). 

 The dates for the meetings were as follows: 

-  Trevor MacFarlane: 18/03/16 \(Manchester office\). 

-  Anita Tusar: 26/04/2016 \(Brussels Parliament\) 

-  Julie Ward MEP: 26/04/2016 \(Brussels Parliament\) 

-  Alfiaz Vaiya: 27/04/2016 \(Brussels Parliament\) 

 From these initial meetings, Piasecka formed an impact pathway with Alfiaz Vaiya and the European Anti\-Racism and Diversity Intergroup \(ARDI\). The remit of ARDI is to promote racial equality and to challenge discrimination in the work of the European Parliament. This pathway enabled Piasecka to raise her research findings with key Parliamentary beneficiaries. In 2017, on Vaiya’s invite, Piasecka attended a conference at the Parliament: *Race, Racism, and Xenophobia in a Global Context Conference*, hosted by MEP Cecile and New York University \(09/11/2017\). 

 In 2018, Vaiya shared Piasecka’s TEDx talk: *Using Theatre to Counter Youth Radicalisation* with Sajjad Karim MEP \[3:2\]. The talk focused on the need to find better and more inclusive ways of delivering the Prevent Duty. In the talk, Piasecka argued that “it is time to change the conversation” when talking about terrorism with young people. 

 <ins>4.3 Impact: European Parliament</ins> 

 Piasecka’s research on Islamophobia and youth radicalisation was instrumental in the convening of an expert conference at the European Parliament to coincide with International Refugee Day. Hosted by Sajiad Karim MEP, the conference was titled: *Promoting Peace, Fighting Youth Radicalization, Fostering a Welcoming Europe* \(21/08/2018\) \[5:1\]. In a concept note to European Parliamentarians to promote the event, Sajjad Karim MEP reiterated Piasecka’s TEDx Talk to ‘change the conversation’ about terrorism: 

 *“Trapped between horrific circumstances and rising intolerance, many who would seek to radicalise find their task simplified. Europe has suffered a series of horrific terror attacks in recent years, which has, in turn, boosted the very rhetoric contributing to that radicalisation. Our previous approaches towards tackling radicalisation have failed, and the results of this failure are becoming more and more apparent. **The time has come to change the conversation**”* \(01/06/18\). \[5:2\] 

-  The expert conference bought together speakers on terrorism and youth radicalisation and included a keynote address from Sir Julian King, British European Commissioner, and expert contributions from Piasecka, Figen Murray \(peace campaigner\), Professor Simon Piasecki \(Liverpool Hope University\) Dr. Ajmal Hussain \(Manchester University\), Estelle Cincinatis \(European Jewish Congress\) and Julie Ward MEP. The importance of the event was underpinned by Sajjad Karim: 

-  *""This conference was about bringing together all sections of society to promote positive engagement against radicalisation and to help foster a welcoming Europe. In this respect, we succeeded… In 15 years of being a Member of Parliament though, I have never been so worried. Xenophobia has been on the rise for many years now and has only been exacerbated by the Brexit vote and a rise in populism across Europe... It means our Member States must remain totally engaged in fighting this rise of extremism and collectively, under the banner of the European Union, our commitments must be strengthened”* \(The Southport Reporter, 2018\). \[5:3\] 

-  The conference was attended by parliamentarians and political journalists, who reported, *“Europe has to stand up and fight for its values if a major crisis is to be averted”* \(22/06/18\). \[5:4\] 

-  Of the immediate significance of the conference and Piasecka’s expert contribution, Kaoutar Abousmir, Head of Parliamentary Office to Sajjad Karim, said: 

 “*I would like to thank you for your valuable contribution to the success of this week's event… Our exchange touched on subjects of great relevance in the current political climate we find ourselves in, and we must use events such as Wednesday’s to continue any momentum gained to help push the issue towards the mainstream of politics, rather than such issues remaining on the periphery. I am confident that we can do so by building on the success of last week’s event*” \(22/06/18\). \[5:5\] 

 The long\-term impact of the case study cannot be easily quantified, given the unstable and shifting political contexts for terrorism, and the subsequent UK exit from the European Union. The aim of the impact case study was not to ‘prevent’ youth radicalisation per se, but rather to highlight issues of concern, in this case surrounding the discriminatory aspects of Prevent and in doing so to help European politicians to identify inclusive and holistic ways of tackling radicalisation and extremism. The significance of the research can be further evidenced in Vaiya’s reflections on Piasecka’s contribution to ARDI: 

 *“Dr Piasecka’s research aligns to our aims and we have adopted her research to inform our work in the EU on combatting terrorism… Dr Piasecka’s pioneering research of anti\-extremist theatre\-in\-education has strengthened our view that polarized thinking about the causes of radicalization leads to marginalized and disaffected communities. In a broader context, her research has enabled policy\-makers to see that there are alternative counter\-terrorism strategies, which are holistic, inclusive and community\-based. We are confident that her contribution will impact on ARDIs priorities for the future”* \(28/11/2019\). \[5:6\] 

 <ins>4.4 Impact: Practitioners</ins> 

 While the main focus has been Piasecka’s work with the European Parliament, her findings have benefited practitioners working in peace activism and anti\-extremist theatre. Robert Marsden, a freelance theatre director and former artistic director of Reveal Theatre, responded to the research, saying: “ *Piasecka’s work ensures that I have a currency in relation to the contemporary debates surrounding Prevent and how theatre and drama is used to explore contentious issues”* \(19/10/20\) \[5:7\]. 

 This view is echoed by Ed Morris, *2engage Performing Arts*. In an interview to discuss the impact of the study, Morris cited the political and social significance of the case study concerning the “ *reductive nature of Prevent\-thinking.”* For Morris, and Goss, *“the case study will impact on the development of future anti\-extremist work for 2engage Performing Arts* \[post school closures due to COVID 19\]” \(19/10/20\). \[5:8\] 

 The most meaningful outcome is evidenced in a testimonial written by the peace\-campaigner Figen Murray. Figen was introduced to Piasecka’s research on Prevent at the European Parliament.  Figen’s son, Martyn Hett, was murdered in the Manchester Arena Bombing. In the years following the attack, Figen has devoted her life to the promotion of peace. She has worked with the EU\-led Radicalisation Network \(RAN\), the Jo Cox Foundation, and is responsible for *Martyn’s Law,* proposed legislation to provide better protection against terrorism for the British public. Figen is a truly inspirational figure and the loss of Martyn illustrates why non\-discriminatory anti\-extremist work matters. Regarding the impact of Piasecka’s research on her work, Figen writes: 

  

 *“I give talks to young people at secondary schools, colleges and universities about the impact of the \[Manchester\] attack on our family. I target young people as I believe they are going to the future educators, policymakers, law makers and parents of the next generation… As a result of \[Piasecka’s research\] I have reflected on my own work with young people. \[It made\] me realise that I need to put more faith and trust in my audiences, and I will include a space for deeper discussion. I usually give a talk and then invite questions about the talk. I realise now that I also could ask the audience certain questions to generate more insight in students”* \(04/11/2019\). \[5:9\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The development of two non\-animal multi\-cellular 3D models and the application of Mass Spectrometry Imaging \(MSI\) has provided a commercial alternative to pre\-clinical testing using animal models. Research with Innovenn UK Ltd led to a modified version of the Human Skin Equivalent \(Labskin\) product, expanding market reach into the wound care and cosmetics sector. Development with Precision for Medicine \(UK Labs\) Ltd resulted in the commercial launch of a cancer model \(PhaseZero® 3D Oncology OrganDot<sup>TM</sup>\). Uptake of MSI with 3D models by AstraZeneca and CRODA has changed their practice, produced cost savings and increased customer demand. This new model enables the 3Rs Agenda to be put into practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The principles of the 3Rs \(replacement, reduction and refinement\) provide a framework for performing more humane animal research; these are embedded in national and international legislation and regulations on the use of animals in scientific procedures. Opinion polls of public attitudes show that support for animal research is conditional on the 3Rs being put into practice. As well as ethical considerations, animals are expensive. Reduction and replacement of animals will reduce cost and increase competitiveness for companies that adopt these procedures fulfilling industry commitment to more sustainable innovation, meeting public expectations and customer demands. There is widespread interest by pharmaceutical industries in the use of 3D cell culture models, which mimic the biological microenvironment of tissues, as a commercial alternative to research using animal models in pre\-clinical drug development. 

 Research was undertaken at SHU in collaboration with industry using the application of mass spectrometry imaging \(MSI\) to 3D in vitro human tissue models as a valid approach for investigating both pre\-clinical drug absorption in skin \(pharmacokinetic \(PK\) studies\) and complex interactions between the drug and the human body \(pharmacodynamics \(PD\) studies\). MSI can visualize the distribution of multiple compounds within tissues simultaneously and in a label‐free manner, making MSI fast and relatively inexpensive. Two non\-animal models were used; a novel tumour spheroid model developed at SHU and a commercial 3D human skin construct or Living skin Equivalent \(LSE\). 

 Clench was the first to apply MSI to PK and PD studies of drugs, metabolites, and changes to lipid profiles in a commercial LSE model. Working with CRODA, Clench demonstrated quantitative MSI as a method to determine the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient in skin and associated responses \( **R1**\). Research was developed further \(Cole, Smith, Cross, Clench\) with Labskin \( **G1**\) and reported the MSI of an LSE model modified to represent a diseased state \(skin condition psoriasis\) \( **R2**\) and through a KTP with Clench and Innovenn \( **G2**\), examined its value as a platform for wound\-healing studies \( **R3**\). These projects revealed that absolute quantification of drugs in the LSE model by MSI was possible \( **R1**\) and that pathways of wound healing in the LSE could be studied by changes on the metabolome of the LSE \( **R3**\) demonstrating this methodology as an alternative to testing using animal models to represent human tumours and skin. 

 Cross developed 3D tumour spheroid models in Alginate gel scaffolds for Multiple Myeloma and Osteosarcoma cancers and demonstrated efficacy for biopharmaceutical drugs in 3D cell cultures \( **R4**\). In collaboration with Precision for Medicine \( **G3**\) Cross developed the company’s existing OrganDot 3D cell culture system from a non\-tumour pancreatic Islet model, into a PhaseZero® 3D Oncology OrganDot<sup>TM</sup> model and validated this against SHU's Alginate\-based 3D cell culture system. The 3D Oncology OrganDot<sup>TM</sup> was comparable in most chemotherapy regimens using cell lines, and superior to 3D cell culture models using fresh tumour material. Clench and Cross further developed the Alginate\-based model to quantify drug distribution and response to therapy in Osteosarcoma. This proof‐of‐principle study \( **R5**\) \(Smith, Cole, Le Maitre, Clench, Cross\) showed that chemotherapy‐induced changes in metabolite abundance and distribution can be determined in 3D cell culture by MSI, highlighting this method as a tool in the elucidation of chemotherapy responses as an alternative to in vivo testing. In collaboration with AstraZeneca, Clench, Cross and Cole applied advanced imaging techniques to undertake in\-depth phenotyping of a novel aggregated tumour model improving understanding of the molecular activity within a 3D cell culture tumour microenvironment, highlighting this as a potential methodology for in vitro applications of biomedical research and pharmaceutical development \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

#  1. New product development for commercial application and contribution to the 3R agenda 

##  Skin model 

 The increase in the incidence of chronic wounds across the globe, and the lack of innovation in wound care research and development, has created a demand for an in vitro testing platform to improve wound care testing. There was a clear market gap for testing the effectiveness of products designed to promote healing in a pre\-clinical setting. Innovenn UK Ltd \(operating through Labskin UK\) makes a Human Skin Equivalent product known as Labskin, which is used to offer testing services on topical products, particularly those affecting skin microflora. Services are provided for skincare, healthcare, pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cosmetic industry to test and validate their product claims on full thickness human skin in a real\-world environment. 

 Research conducted by SHU in collaboration with Innovenn \( **R3**; **G2**\) has led to the further development of their 3D skin models, in particular, the development of a new modified version of the Labskin product ‘Woundskin’ \( **E1**\). Woundskin provides a platform for the testing of wound healing products and other medical devices without having to use animals, fulfilling company commitment to the 3Rs being put into practice. The Managing Director of Innovenn confirms the success of this partnership, ‘ *We worked together on a particularly successful project on wound healing that led to a prize winning paper that generated lots of good publicity for the company \(as well as sales\). The success of these projects was a factor in the investment in the company made by Integumen in 2019 \[…\].Prof Clench’s work has helped to generate business for us particularly in the wound care and cosmetics sectors*’ \( **E2**\). Integumen PLC is a group of life sciences companies with specific domain expertise to lever product and business development; the Chairman’s statement \(2019\) confirms the Labskin models as one of the highlights of 2019. Revenues for the group were up 371% with contracts for Labskin clinical services \( **E3**\). Through the work of Clench Labskin are engaging with new academic customers. Prof Cooper from the University of Birmingham confirms that as a result of introductions through the SHU\-Innovenn KTP project “we were invited \(by Labskin\) to take part in the trial of the company’s Wound skin product and subsequently adopted their 3D skin model” \( **E4**\). 

##  Cancer Model 

 The demonstration of the biopharmaceutical drug efficacy in 3D cancer cell cultures using alginate scaffold by Cross led to a collaboration with Asterand Bioscience \( **G3**\) to develop a non\-animal replacement for 'patient\-derived Xenograft’ \(PDX\) models used in personalised treatment.  Asterand Bioscience was subsequently acquired by BioIVT, a leading global provider of biological products to the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies. Through this collaboration Asterand/BioIVT’s existing OrganDotTM platform was successfully developed into a commercially available PhaseZero® 3D Oncology OrganDotTM model, which was launched by BioIVT in 2019 \( **E5**\). This Oncology model was the only model tested that could reliably grow primary lung cancer cells direct from patients to achieve this aim; BioIVT expanded their OrganDotTM range to include a normal lung model based on the findings from the collaborative project with SHU. 

 In May 2020 Asterand/BioIVT was acquired by Precision for Medicine \(UK Labs\) Ltd; the Senior Vice President of the company confirms that “our Innovate UK funded project led to the commercial release of the organ Dot model in 2019…our work with Dr Cross has helped raise our profile as an organisation that is able to support oncology R&D with human in\-vitro based pharmacological relevant models supporting NC3R principles” \( **E6**\). Public support for animal research is conditional on the 3Rs being put into practice. The use of human\-based solutions to accelerate the identification/validation of drug targets and enhance the selection of drug candidates with increased likelihood of clinical success contributes to the 3R agenda. For example, if a single dose of chemotherapy is tested in vivo using a mouse PDX system, 8\-12 tumour\-bearing mice per dose are required. Because up to four in vivo transfers of tumour material are needed to produce enough tumour\-bearing mice, up to 50 mice in total are needed to test the chemotherapy for a single patient.  No mice are needed if the Oncology OrganDotTM system is used. 

#  2. Knowledge transfer and change in industrial practice 

 In the pharmaceutical industry cost is a key driver and, in many respects, shapes the capital, revenue and resource decisions made during the drug discovery process. Combining the use of a 3D solid tumour model with mass spectrometry imaging \(MSI\), developed by Clench, is providing a label\-free methodology for drug discovery studies and is a viable non\-animal alternative to animal testing. Collaboration with industry partners has enabled efficient knowledge transfer of this methodology, with direct benefits to these businesses through raised awareness, changes to their practice, and produced cost savings. 

 Cross and Clench developed the Alginate\-based 'aggregoid' macro\-3D cell culture model to quantify drug distribution and response to therapy in Osteosarcoma when used in conjunction with mass spectrometry imaging \( **R5**\). This model has been employed by AstraZeneca \(a global pharmaceutical company\) in combination with MSI through a collaborative PhD studentship with SHU on the use of aggregoids for the study of biotherapeutics in non\-small cell lung cancer \(NSCLC\) \( **R6**\). The group’s Director confirms that this work ‘has raised awareness of the potential MSI has when used in combination with 3D models, which is an area of increasing interest and demand for us’ \( **E7**\). As a science\-led organisation AstraZeneca places particular value on collaborations \( **E7**\) and the transfer of knowledge from academic to industry has been facilitated by members of AstraZeneca completing part\-time doctorates at SHU. 

 CRODA, an international speciality chemical company, has supported 3 PhD students at SHU who have spent time at both UK and US sites to transfer methodologies to the company. The collaboration has developed the MSI methodology with their 3D models of skin, gastrointestinal tract, seeds and plants. Outcomes from the research have been published in joint papers and the projects been featured in CRODA publications, seminars and for staff training purposes. This has led to raised awareness within CRODA of MSI’s potential as a methodology and there is an increasing interest/demand for its use within the company with resulting business efficiencies and a competitive advantage. CRODA’s Research & Technology Director confirms that ‘using MSI saves the company time and money in studying compound distribution in both plant and animal tissue’ \( **E8**\).

 **Support for remote voice therapy:** 

-  Our findings about which acoustic voice parameters are captured reliably with mobile phones inform international guidelines for clinical voice assessment and therapy during Covid19, with benefits for clinicians and patients. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The multi\-stranded research underpinning this impact is focussed on improving our understanding of the nature, causes and effects of voice variation \(within and between speakers\) and developing and identifying reliable indicators of voice quality characteristics. Our research is interdisciplinary and differs from much previous voice research by employing a theoretically informed perceptual model \(Vocal Profile Analysis, developed initially by Laver and Beck and refined over several decades\) as a link between the acoustic signal and qualitative interpretation in voice health and other contexts. Linguistics and phonetics provide theoretical frameworks for understanding the linguistic, paralinguistic and extralinguistic functions of voice, speech science informs acoustic analysis, and speech and language therapy provides theoretical bases for understanding the links between voice quality and vocal health. 

 Research that is aimed at development, evaluation and application of specialist perceptual and acoustic techniques for voice analysis spans several decades. The work of Beck \(aka Mackenzie Beck\) has continued to be crucial for the development of the Vocal Profile Analysis \(VPA\) scheme, a phonetic tool for perceptual analysis of voice quality, from its inception. VPA involves expert auditory\-perceptual judgment of the various parameters \(“settings”\) that contribute to overall voice quality. Each setting has defined physiological and acoustic correlates, so the completed analysis provides a comprehensive indication of a speaker’s habitual voice production tendencies. An innovative aspect was the inclusion of both laryngeal factors \(e.g. whisperiness, creakiness\) and vocal tract adjustments \(e.g. tongue or jaw settings\), reflecting the complex interrelationships within the voice production system. Since 2000, research has involved refinement and evaluation of VPA \(e.g. \[1\]\) and establishment of sociophonetic voice norms needed for clinical and other applications \(e.g. \[2\] elucidates geographical and gender\-related voice variation in adolescents\). Our VPA research has been a reference point for researchers in the UK, Brazil, Spain, China, Ireland and Sweden, working in sociophonetics, speech pathology, articulatory phonetics \(e.g. MRI investigation of physiological correlates of settings\) and forensic science. 

 One recurring research interest is the extraordinary range of meaningful variability in the human voice and the associated immense semantic space of voice descriptors in everyday as well as literary language \(e.g. describing the sound, character attributions or interlocutor effects of voices\). In \[3\] we argue for an intermediate phonetic level of description when mapping acoustic voice signals to voice descriptors in order to provide better descriptive structure and transparency. 

 VPA is the only phonetic description system that is detailed enough to serve as this intermediate level of description. Our model requires a detailed understanding of the relation between acoustic and VPA parameters. In \[3\] we lay the foundations of a systematic mapping of acoustics to VPA by presenting significant correlations between a subset of VPA settings and acoustic parameters. These findings and the associated ideas about levels of description have informed the foundational concept of a new commercial enterprise, as outlined below. 

 Acoustic analysis is an important component of clinical voice analysis, and much of our recent research  focusses on the challenges associated with this, by elucidating the acoustic correlates of perceptual judgments \(as in \[3\] above\) and assessing the reliability of acoustic parameters across different environments. The potential of smartphones for health\-related data collection is widely recognized, but their use in voice health depends on reliability of acoustic data. Our interdisciplinary research confirmed the reliability of smartphone recordings for certain acoustic parameters \(mean F0 and cepstral peak prominence showed acceptable random error size\) but not others \(jitter and shimmer\). It also highlighted some important methodological issues that inform clinical assessment; these have proved to be of particular relevance in the context of remote working associated with Covid\-19 \[4,5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **1. International impact on professional services and professional education: voice analysis in Forensic Phonetics** 

 In evaluating the probability that two or more voice samples are from the same speaker, forensic phoneticians use a multistranded suite of acoustic and perceptual analysis tools. Where acoustic quality of audio recordings used as evidence in court is inadequate for reliable acoustic analysis, perceptual tools \(e.g. VPA\) become especially important. VPA training based on our research \[1\] delivered to three key groups of forensic phoneticians as a pathway to impact \(JP French Associates \(JPFA\) \+ University of York \(UoY\); Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo \(PUC\-SP\) \+ Brazilian Federal Police; and the Netherlands Forensics Institute\) generated impact in several ways. 

 JP French Associates, one of the world’s leading forensic speech laboratories, first adopted our VPA framework in 2010 and continued to do so through the census period, creating a streamlined version specifically for forensic purposes \[s1\]; this version is now \(2020\) used by at least two other UK forensic experts/firms. Peter French \(founder of JPFA\) writes \[s2\]: 

 “…. *in 2009 we decided that the VPA was the most phonetically\-grounded and detailed tool available for voice quality analysis and description…….  On the basis of her* \(Beck’s\) *training, it became clear that our adopting the VPA would enhance the reliability, replicability and transparency of the tests that we apply when comparing recorded voice samples*…… *I would estimate the number of cases in which we have used it to be in excess of 1,500. It now* \[i.e. during the census period\] *forms a significant element of the forensic speaker comparison procedure and has been critical in some cases in arriving at a positive or negative conclusion. The use of the modified VPA is mentioned in all official JPFA forensic speaker comparison reports, and it has been frequently mentioned in oral evidence delivered from the witness box in trials also.”* 

 A recent report on rigorous testing of VPA included the statement “ *We further conclude that the perceptual assessment of voice quality using the VPA scheme is an essential tool in fields such as forensic phonetics*” \[s3\]. 

 VPA is now a core part of the curriculum for UoY’s undergraduate and postgraduate forensic phonetics programmes. VPA is also included in UoY’s CPD course in Forensic Speech and Audio Analysis. Professional groups from six continents, including police, detectives, government employees, acousticians, forensic scientists in other disciplines and software engineers, have participated in the six iterations of this course, influencing forensic casework in the UK and internationally. 

 In Brazil a Portuguese translation of VPA \(“BP\-VPAS”\) is routinely used by Federal Police in forensic reports \(\~150 reports per year\). Federal Police training in forensic science includes a module on VPA facilitated by PUC\-SP and police from regional states confirm its value as an investigative tool \[s4\]. In December 2020 Brazilian government recognition of the importance of this work was demonstrated by the announcement of CAPES funding \(amount currently confidential\) for a strategic partnership to develop undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in forensic science which will include VPA as a core module \(partner institutions = Federal Police, PUC\-SP, University of Campinas\). 

 The utilization of VPA in forensic phonetics in the UK, Europe and Brazil, drawing on our underpinning research, is supporting evidence\-based decisions in criminal cases, thus contributing to the delivery of justice. 

 **2. Commercial impact of VPA and VPA\-based acoustic analysis in creative industries** 

 As part of a planned approach to generating impact our research on acoustic classification of voices based on VPA criteria \[3\] has led to public and private sector investment, which has enabled the creation of a new commercial enterprise in the voice\-over industry \(worth $4.4bn in 2015\). Nowadays, voice\-over jobs are frequently negotiated through online market places where voice\-over job adverts are posted and voice\-over artists audition by submitting voice samples. This creates a bottleneck for the task of shortlisting samples \(often several hundred\), which is a time\-consuming, tedious and potentially ineffective method of voice selection.  To develop a solution for this problem based on our research and associated models, we co\-founded the limited company ‘The Voice Distillery Ltd’ in March 2020 \(company number 656265\). This is led by a multidisciplinary team of directors including a speech scientist \(Schaeffler\), a speech and language therapist \(Beck\) and two external directors. One is a software engineer and one an experienced voice\-over artist and voice coach.  The company raised private investment of £35,000 in May 2020 \[s4\] and has received a ‘SMART Scotland award’ of £67,000 in February 2020 \[s5\]. SMART is a Scottish business grant scheme aimed at SME’s for their early stage R&D. The ongoing feasibility study develops an AI based system to automatically evaluate and rank voice auditions with respect to client brief and target population preferences, testing the reliability of such a system in reference to a VPA\-based representation level.  Voice Distillery \(currently, in late 2020\) has four employees and six freelancers associated with the company \[s4\]. Despite the Covid19 pandemic, the company has reached all milestones of the SMART feasibility study so far and had recorded, annotated and processed over 3000 voice samples, submitted as auditions by voiceover artists, by the end of 2020, signalling how it has begun, building on our research, to meet the needs of this sector for objective and efficient voice classification. A business development consultant reporting on the company has made specific reference to our innovative application of technology, supported by our phonetic research, to solve industry problems \[s6\]. 

 **3. International impact on clinical guidelines and health policy** 

 Much of our research is designed to generate clinical impact, and our findings have directly informed international clinical guidelines for voice assessment and therapy during Covid19. Our original research \[4\] gave specific recommendations about which clinical acoustic voice parameters can be reliably derived from smartphone recordings. Our findings for fundamental frequency \(f0\), shimmer and jitter were then integrated in published clinical guidelines, written by a consortium of 11 voice and swallowing disorder experts from five countries. These guidelines \[s7\], published in several languages, constitute consensus recommendations from the consortium, and are meant as an international clinical guide for speech\-language therapists during the Covid19 pandemic. One of the recommendations provided in the text addresses the use of mobile phones and states that “ *Clinicians can use voice samples recorded through a cell phone to obtain F0*”, explicitly quoting our work.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Practitioners in record production have benefited from a conceptual framework for planning and implementing recording, processing and mixing decisions, based on clear musical goals. The notion of *sonic cartoons*, developed by Zagorski\-Thomas out of his work on phonographic staging, provided an enhanced theoretical model for considering the schematic nature of recorded music. The model has been widely adopted in recording arts pedagogy, as well as having a significant impact on sound engineers, musicians and record producers. Public understanding has also been advanced through a BBC World Service eight programme series written and presented by Zagorski\-Thomas that used sonic cartoons to show how recorded performances and the associated technologies reflected wider social and cultural trends. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Zagorski\-Thomas first published about the notion of *sonic cartoons* in 2014 in a monograph \[R1\] and book chapter \[R2\].  These built on research Zagorski\-Thomas had conducted since 2005 and his previous twenty years of professional recording practice. 

 The *sonic cartoon* concept differs from previous work on *phonographic staging* \(Moylan\) and the *sound box* \(Moore\) in that it discusses recorded music as a schematic representation of musical activity. It draws on Lakoff and Johnson’s cognitive theory of metaphor and categorical thought, Smalley’s notion of *spectromorphology* in electroacoustic composition and Gibson’s ecological approach to cognition to synthesize a theoretical framework about the cognitive mechanisms that inform both creative intention and the listener’s interpretation. 

 There are two main components. First, is the idea that perception is based on the broad sense of the brain trying to establish what is happening by creating a kind of ‘best guess’ based on all modes of perception \(i.e. ‘what is happening?’ rather than ‘what am I seeing? What am I hearing?\) and that we therefore hear music, both in a literal and metaphorical sense, in terms of the sound of someone doing something somewhere. 

 Second, is the notion that these ‘best guess’ mechanisms are the basis of our ability to create and understand schematic representations as being representations <ins>of</ins> something. The sound of an orchestral recording coming out of two speakers in a small room is not the same experience as listening in a concert hall. And more commonly, with virtually all recorded popular music, the sound is a deliberate simplification or distortion of ‘reality’: the notion of *sonic cartoons* addresses how these simplified and distorted representations can be made to suggest a more complex ‘whole’ – even an abstract or ‘impossible’ one. This provides a theoretical basis for planning, executing, mixing and listening to recorded music. 

 The theoretical work bridges the gap between the historical / ethnographic work which describes professional practice in the sector and the technical literature which focuses on how the technology works. Zagorski\-Thomas’ research provides this musicological bridge, explaining how and why the techniques and technology work using these approaches to embodied cognition, metaphor and interpretation, and thus enables critical reflection about strategic decisions and creative choices. 

 In R3, Zagorski\-Thomas explored how this theoretical, musicological \(as opposed to technical\) toolbox can be used to enhance music technology pedagogy and, along with a series of conference presentations, a book tour and subsequent guest lectures, provided a framework for educators to embed the specific notion of *sonic cartoons* and the more general idea of using musicological theory into the curriculum of vocational courses. 

 Subsequently, Zagorski\-Thomas produced a series of detailed analytical examples to help students and practitioners think about additional aspects of *sonic cartoons.* In R4, using in\-depth analyses of popular music examples, the notion of timbre – and the ways in which it can be manipulated in the production process – was explored through techniques which enhance, alter or inhibit the perception of energy expenditure, materiality, agency and the environment. For example, the attack transients of a sound can be enhanced using equalization or dynamic compression to give a perception of higher energy expenditure. 

 In R5 he provided additional analyses of examples to show how the notion of intertextuality can be explored through *sonic cartoons* dealing with explicit textual references, cultural references to genre and historical period, and more specific categorical references to gendered bodies, ambiguous materiality and metaphors of space in instrumental resonance. 

 Finally, in R6 \(a practice\-as\-research output\), Zagorski\-Thomas provided a detailed analysis of how metaphors drawn from the text and context of the Haydn Piano Sonata were translated into sound – for example, using digital sampling, distortion and audio FX to provide contemporary parallels to Haydn’s exploration of ‘new’ \(18<sup>th</sup> century\) piano technology. Exposing the process of creating a *sonic cartoon* of this type provides students and practitioners with a ‘way in’ to both the musical metaphors and the ways in which they have been realized through the technologies and techniques of record production.  R6 was one of the outputs from the AHRC\-funded *Classical Music 'Hyper\-Production' and Practice\-As\-Research* project.

 Through his leadership role in the Art of Record Production conference, journal and international association as well his publishing, editing and public speaking on the topic, Zagorski\-Thomas’ research has influenced vocational pedagogy in sound recording and record production and on the creative practice of emerging and experienced professionals in this multi\-billion\-dollar industry. In addition, he has increased public understanding of recorded music through his broadcasts and presentations. 

 **International impact on pedagogy of record production** 

 Since the publication of his work on sonic cartoons in 2014, Zagorski\-Thomas’ works in this area have become key texts in recording pedagogy. Although all the references \[R1 – R6\] have been important, the *Musicology of Record Production* has had the greatest influence.  The significance for pedagogy was identified by the reviewer for the International Association of Popular Music \(IASPM\) Journal who concluded that: “Overall then, Zagorski\-Thomas carves out a space for a discussion that, while taking record production as its focus, opens out into a whole wealth of important areas. In doing so it poses a challenge to how we think about recordings, and how we think about teaching the skills associated with record production.” \[S1\] 

 The texts are used on the programmes for some of the most prestigious sound engineering courses globally, including in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and the UK, with corroboration available from leading academics in a range of universities. \[S2\] 

 The monograph is widely held in university libraries across the world.   The WorldCat website showed that, by 2020, 692 university libraries, from the UK to New Zealand, held a copy. In addition, the publishers, Cambridge University Press, reported that as of November 2019, 37 university libraries in 17 countries held eBook copies: these included libraries in the Scandinavia, Switzerland, South Africa, India, Thailand, Australia, China, USA, Canada, Mexico, as well as in the UK. \[S3\] 

 The research has been of particular value in developing programmes in providers with close industry connections. In one example, it contributed significantly to the design of a new MA by the BIMM \[the British and Irish Modern Music Institute\], which runs diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the UK, Ireland and Germany.  The Course Leader for the programme has written: 

 We launched the MA Popular Music Practice at BIMM Institute London in Summer 2019 and at BIMM Institute Brighton and Bristol in the summer of 2020.  The research output of Simon Zagorski\-Thomas has been invaluable to this programme – particularly here at BIMM Brighton \-\- principally because it applies Practice as Research disciplines to the field of popular music, whereas much of the existing scholarship and established schools concentrate more on experimental music and classical music. 

 Professor Zagorski\-Thomas’s output is particularly relevant because our course has four strands \(production, composition, performance, entrepreneurship\) and his work is extremely relevant to the first three of these subject areas – while those candidates on the entrepreneurship strand find his method sufficiently engaging to be able to apply it to their own work. We use several pieces extensively in the modules MPM701 Popular Music Practice and Research an MPM705 Major Project.” \[S4\] 

 In another example, a testimonial from a professor at the Popakademie Baden\-Württemberg said: 

 Pioneering the research stream Art of Record Production within Popular Music Studies Mr. Zagorski\-Thomas offers our students a relevant and otherwise new perspective to record production both within the history of popular music as well as within the history of recording. By combining theory with his thorough knowledge of recording practice his approach opens for new valuable insights within popular music which other, more conventional approaches, fail to do. This approach, binding theory with practice is a central tenet in the work of the Popakademie and its degree programs”. \[S5\] 

 The MA in Record Production at UWL, originally devised by Zagorski\-Thomas in parallel with the book, was fundamentally shaped by this research.  Between 2013/14 and 2019/20, around 90 students from North America, South America, south\-east Asia, China, Europe and the UK have taken the course and can be expected to be using these ideas in their professional practice and in the education of new generations. \[S6\] 

 **Influence on creative practice** 

 Zagorski\-Thomas’ research has also influenced the working practices of well\-established music engineers and producers by encouraging theory\-inflected reflection on both the use of existing skills and techniques and the development of new approaches. The annual Art of Record Production \(ARP\) conference has been an important vehicle for this influence.  Established by Zagorski\-Thomas in 2005, the ARP conference was designed to bridge the gap between research and industry and has been a primary driver in bringing research to the attention of practitioners.  It has an international audience, with recent conferences held in Canada, Norway, Denmark, the USA \(twice\), Sweden and in the UK. ARP’s close connections with organisations such as the US Producers & Engineers Wing of the GRAMMY organisation and the UK Music Producers Guild has meant that producers and engineers from around the world have been influenced by research discussed at these events. 

 In an example of this influence, a professional producer and engineer with experience on over 30 albums and EPs by artists such as Xx Xx Xxxxxxx, Xxxxx Xxxxxx xxx Xxxxxxx, said: 

 I became aware of Simon's work through the Art of Record Production conference, where I presented some of my practice in 2016. Simon presented on the Classical Music Hyperproduction project and this research has had a notable effect on my own work over the last few years. In seeking to explore unconventional techniques in this most conservative field of recording practice I feel that Simon and the co\-authors have given voice to the artistic ambitions of many practitioners, encouraging debate and experimentation…'Recreation' on the Icelandic label Bedroom Community has received a lot of attention \(cross\-station international airplay\) for its unorthodox approach to repertoire and sonic presentation, my work on this record is indebted to the enquiry stimulated by Simon's academic practice. 

 Another experienced mix engineer and producer based in Queensland, Australia whose credits include XXXX, Xxxxxxxx Xxx, Xxxx Xxxxxx xxx Xxxxxx, has written to say that: 

 I think the greatest influence your research has had on my creative practice, is how I cognitively experience my practice whilst it is happening… since I have been reading your work I have been engaging with ‘doing as thinking’ and as a result, it seems like I am cognitively engaged and aware with what is going on during the process. I am no longer a bystander, I am in the music production experience ‘doing as thinking’. This has led to a revitalized understanding of my mixing and production process after 29 year’s practice and also results in creditable ‘real world’ practice\-based investigations. For example, my mixing on Xxxxxx Xxxxxxx “Crimson Criminal’’ and the subsequent publication in the IASPM practice\-based call. 

 A third, with nearly 30 years of professional experience working with Xxxx Xxxxxx, Xxxxx and Xxxxxxxx Xxxxxx, said: 

 As a music producer and mixing engineer Simon’s written work and conversations have encouraged critical analysis of processes and techniques adopted in my professional practice. As my music production learning curve took place on projects, the focus was always on delivering results. It wasn’t until I met Simon that I began to reflect on mix processor choices or recording techniques that lead \[me\] to understand a wider aspect of the choices I was employing. \[S7\] 

 **Enhancing audience understanding of recorded music ** 

 Zagorski\-Thomas devised, wrote and presented an eight\-programme series on *How the World Changed Music,* commissioned by the BBC World Service and broadcast in 2019.  The programmes used examples of recorded music from around the world to discuss how recorded performances and the technologies which produce them reflect wider social and cultural trends. For example, the program explored how the recorded female voice in both 1920s Chinese popular music and 1980s Indian film music reflected and exaggerated features that defined cultural gendered stereotypes. These links between sound and culture are central to the notion of *sonic cartoons*. 

 The BBC’s Development Officer said the approach which used examples from different countries was popular with World Service audiences.  He noted that although scheduling across multiple platforms made it difficult to establish audience numbers \- taking into account the scheduling on BBC radio platforms across the world, broadcasting on local FM affiliates and partners, on satellite radio in the US, and online – ”…the reach of the series is considerable… in the many millions”.  He also said the \[Zagorski\-Thomas\] series was “much lauded” by the World Service Senior Commissioner. \[S8\] 

 Zagorski\-Thomas was a principal contributing expert on *The History of Music and Technology* series on the World Service, hosted by former Pink Floyd drummer Xxxx Xxxxx. His research discussing the way changes in audio technology had affected how producers and musicians thought about recorded music featured in two of these 53\-minute programs \( *Acoustic to Electric and The Beatles And Beyond*\), first broadcast in June 2019. 

 The AHRC\-funded project *Classical Music 'Hyper\-Production' and Practice\-As\-Research* enabled further impact through working with public venues to produce *In Modern Dress* concerts at Kings Place, London \(Oct 2015\), UWL \(Jan 2016\), and at the RMA Conference at the University of Birmingham \(Sept 2015\) and through a series of video and audio excerpts of hyper\-production mixes from Bach, Beaudoin, Haydn and other composers which were shared online. Collaborators included colleagues from the Royal Academy of Music and postgraduate students from the London College of Music, UWL, the **Akademia Muzyczna im. Karola Lipińskiego \(Wrocław\)** and the Konvalia Quartet. The project provided examples of these innovative and exaggerated approaches to the sound of classical music to both non\-academic audiences and professional musicians. \[S9\] 

 The immersive audio\-visual implementation of *sonic cartoon* techniques was also demonstrated to the public in the *Afro\-Cuban Music Room* project at UWL. The eight\-speaker audio installation used re\-amping production techniques to create spatial audio effects that allow the audience to control the immersive audio experience by walking around.  This was later presented at the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford \(May 2018\) in an event at which 1600 people registered to attend, and at the *La Linea Latin Music Festival* at EartH in London \(May 2019\). \[S10\] 

 Zagorski\-Thomas has also used the idea of *sonic cartoons* to explain the schematic nature of recorded music to public audiences.  Talking about and demonstrating how production techniques can be used to influence a listener’s interpretation, Zagorski\-Thomas presented at several music festivals. These included the *Culture Capital Exchange*, London \(March 2017\), the *No.6 Festival*, Portmeirion \(August 2017\), the *Also Festival*, Warwickshire \(June 2018\) and the *Harrogate International Festival* in Yorkshire \(July 2018\) with the audiences for these estimated to be over 500 people.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Awan’s research has directly influenced how practitioners, social media companies and policy\-makers tackle Islamophobia in Britain. Awan’s reputation and expertise has led to him being a frequent and essential member of numerous high\-profile Government\-led bodies tasked with challenging misinformation about Muslims. His research led to the first ever working definition for Islamophobia in the UK, which has resulted in tangible changes in guidance and critical public policy, as well as supporting victims and stakeholders in tackling hate crime. 

 Awan’s work around Islamophobia on social media has benefitted voluntary organisations and third\-party reporting centres, who utilised his training for their practitioners, resulting in increased knowledge and reporting about online/offline Islamophobia, and providing intervention mechanisms to support victims of anti\-Muslim hatred. 
","
 **2. Underpinning Research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There has been growing evidence that anti\-Muslim hostility online has become more prevalent \(R01\); the organisation Tell MAMA \(Measuring Anti\-Muslim Attacks\) found 548 verified incidents \(from 729 reports\) of anti\-Muslim abuse between March 2014 to February 2015. Despite the fact that the majority of incidents took place online \(402 of 548\), there was little academic evidence concerning the nature and effects of online anti\-Muslim hatred. 

 Awan and Dr Irene Zempi \(Nottingham Trent University\) became the first two researchers to combine their expertise and knowledge on Islamophobia to conduct the foremost UK study to research anti\-Muslim hate crime. They used two independent research projects in order to consider the affinity between online \(Awan\) and offline \(Zempi\) anti\-Muslim hate crime and found that Muslim women are more vulnerable to intimidation, violence and harassment, both online and offline. Moreover, they found that victims often live in fear because of the possibility of online threats materialising in the ‘real world’ \(R02\). Awan developed a unique typology of offender behaviour characteristics \(R03\) and, with Zempi, was able to demonstrate the collective effects associated with online/offline anti\-Muslim hostility through notions of a transnational Muslim community, the ‘‘ummah’’. 

 From a theoretical perspective, the research helped establish that anti\-Muslim hate crime is not a static problem, but instead a key feature of Islamophobic hate crime. It showed that single incidents of hate crime tend to be part of a long\-term pattern of victimisation, a recurring and, in some cases, constant feature of one’s everyday life \(R04\).  Further research looked into the consequences of physical and cyber anti\-Muslim hate for victims by interviewing Muslims that had reported anti\-Muslim hate experiences to Tell MAMA.  This was the first ever study in the UK to shed light on their experiences, both in the virtual and physical world, rather than examining these experiences in isolation. The research found it was difficult for victims to isolate and separate online/offline abuse \(R01\), and led to the development of e\-toolkits and bite\-sized information guides for Tell MAMA, used to support victims of abuse. 

 Supported by Awan’s research, Tell MAMA concluded that there is a continuity and link between anti\-Muslim hostility in both the virtual and the physical world across the globe \(R01, R03, R04\). 

 This led to an autoethnographic piece of research, which reflected upon Awan’s own experiences of Islamophobic victimisation as a result of being ‘visibly’ Muslim in public spaces in the UK. This was an extremely novel approach in criminological ethnography, given that it was the first study of its kind in the UK to use autoethnography and the role of insider/outsider status in adopting the role of the Muslim ‘other’ in public spaces. This enabled new insights to be drawn into the nature, extent and impact of Islamophobic hostility and showed that visible Muslims’ experiences of victimisation can lead to underreporting \(R05\). 

 More recently, Awan’s research has addressed a further gap in the literature on the effects and determinants of Islamophobia upon people who are perceived to be Muslims \(R06\).  Non\-Muslims who experience Islamophobia remain ‘invisible’ in both official statistics and empirical research.  Awan’s findings showed that participants differentiated between ‘external’ and ‘personal’ factors that contributed to their experiences of hate crime. They also found that people’s vulnerability depended upon the geographical area in which they were located. For example, some participants felt safer in diverse cities in the UK, such as Birmingham. In contrast, the sense of vulnerability, as well as the risk of attack, was perceived to be significantly higher in less diverse areas. 

 Crucially, Islamophobia as a phenomena has evolved, as has the need to have a contemporary working definition.  Awan and Zempi proposed that structural and cultural racism, which targets the symbols and markers of a being a Muslim, should be included in a new definition. The significance of this definition emphasised the link between institutional forms of Islamophobia and how it is triggered by the visibility of the victim’s \(perceived\) Muslim identity \(R06\). 

 Awan’s research has reached both professional and public levels, shaping and informing popular discourse around Islamophobia and its effect on an individual and societal level. For example, the Advertising Value Equivalent of media/research coverage received with his name up to May 2020 totalled £1,262,752.39.  The reach of coverage \(Oct 2018 – Oct 2020\) was £3,914,511.

 **4. Details of Impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Influencing policy direction and training for anti\-Muslim hatred organisations ** 

 Awan’s work with Tell MAMA was directly used by the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Islamophobia \(now the APPG on British Muslims\) at a policy level to help direct specific inquiries about the global threat of online Islamophobia. Awan was invited to present evidence to the APPG on six different occasions between 2013 and 2017, and prepare briefing papers and conduct workshops and seminars for over 27 key Parliamentarians, government officials and lay members of the public about his findings \(R01, R04, R05, R06\) \[S01\]. Awan was able to ensure that his research underpinned the governmental policy process because hate crime, in his view, was not a static problem \(R06\). 

 In his first invitation to the APPG in September 2013, Awan explained the need to understand the impacts of online Islamophobia \(R03\).  Awan was invited by the APPG in December 2014 to present one of the first ever studies about Islamophobia on social media. It was attended by the Minister for Faith and Communities, who subsequently asked Awan to join the Anti\-Muslim Hatred Working Group \(AMHWG\) to use his evidence\-based research to identify gaps on anti\-Muslim hatred policy that the Government could address. 

 In 2015, Awan was invited on two further occasions to the APPG.  First, in June, to present evidence about the impacts of Islamophobia \(R02\) and then in October to present findings from his Tell MAMA report about social media victimisation \(R01\).  The following October, the APPG once again requested Awan to present findings about gendered Islamophobia.  This study was based on his experiences of doing autoethnographic research \(R05\).  He was invited again in October 2017, during Hate Crime Awareness Week, to present new research about the experiences of non\-Muslim men who suffer Islamophobia \(R06\). 

 As a direct result of his recommendations to the APPG about revising social media guidelines \(R01, R04\), the Director of Public Prosecutions at the Crown Prosecution Service \(CPS\) invited Awan to sit as an expert member of their National Hate Crime Security Panel \(NHSP\) to provide evidenced\-based recommendations on how social media guidelines and current policy and legal guidance could be improved in relation to racial and religiously aggravated hate crime. Awan used his research and expertise to highlight to the CPS that victims of online Islamophobia felt the current guidelines did not allow them to share harmful content to the appropriate authorities.  This led to the CPS adopting Awan’s recommendation to change their guidelines to better enable victims to report hate crimes. 

 *“Dr Awan made a significant contribution to the NHSP…Awan recommended that we consider the impact of online abuse and the sharing of harmful content should be part of the new revised guidelines,”* stated the Head of the CPS Hate Crime NHSP. *“The guidance was subsequently amended to include sharing harmful content as a distinct category.”* \[S02\] 

 Awan provided evidence\-based training for practitioners in helping them implement effective case management and recording systems, serving as the first point of contact in dealing with anti\-Muslim hatred. This directly benefitted Tell MAMA in identifying key triggers for Islamophobic abuse online and applying the appropriate sensitive interventions.  The training was pivotal in helping Tell MAMA find hard\-to\-reach groups, and supporting those groups using Awan’s bite\-sized\-toolkits by explaining how communities can report online Islamophobia. These toolkits have been accessed by over 100 mosques across the UK, empowering local communities to break down the barriers of reporting Islamophobia \(R01, R03\). *“Awan’s work has directly fed into our guidance and training for our staff…his toolkits and online PDFs have helped victims who have reported to us when they have suffered hate crimes. These resources have been useful and provide practical solutions for those victims…”* \[S03\]. 

 Awan’s research \(R01, R04, R05\) led to further training for Faith Associates, which resulted in changes in policies and strategies. 

 These include how mosques record anti\-Muslim hatred, safety measures they can use and creating positive case studies to inform mosques how to encourage worshippers to report online hate speech.  This enabled over 200 mosques and Imams across the UK to have a greater understanding of how Muslims should report Islamophobia \[S04\].  Working with Faith Associates, Awan provided key training at Twitter Headquarters, which was attended by over 50 Muslim leaders and Imams from across the UK. As a direct result, mosque leaders reported that they were better equipped to use digital space to identify and report Islamophobic abuse, something they previously did not have guidance and training for.  The CEO of Faith Associates stated that Awan’s research “ *helped to directly lead to mosques having a better awareness of how they can tackle Islamophobia in the digital world…our professional standards, guidance and training methods have been influenced by his research…we have used Professor Awan’s research…to help change policy strategies within mosques in Britain…his work has directly helped change how people perceive Muslims in the UK and help confront the negative perceptions of Muslims*.” \[S05\] 

 Awan directly worked with the Head of Twitter UK, utilising his research to develop solutions in tackling anti\-Muslim hatred through roundtables and workshops where his research, interviews and data \(R01, R02, R03\) were used by Twitter to help empower Muslim communities. 

 In a joint blog by Twitter and Awan, published on their website, they said, *“Twitter has come together with the independent members of the Cross Government Working Group on Anti\-Muslim Hatred \(AMHWG\) as part of a shared commitment to counter hateful conduct online…much of the content identified by this critical research…was removed for breaking the Twitter rules…Critically, we can only develop scalable solutions by working in partnership with experts.” \[S06\]* 

 **Working with Parliamentarians to define Islamophobia** 

 In 2014, Awan was appointed by the Deputy Prime Minister to sit as an independent member of the AMHWG.  Awan used his research at a policy level to help the Government identify trends and gaps on Islamophobic hate crime. 

 The \(then\) Deputy Director of Integration and Faith commented that Awan, *“has played an important role in helping Government better understand the causes and drivers of anti\-Muslim hatred…his work around social media has paved the way for a better awareness of what social media companies could do when confronting online hate crime.”* \[S07\] 

 Currently, not all monitored hate crimes are treated the same; this can result in Muslims being reluctant to report hate crime, due to a belief that it will not be taken seriously. Awan identified the need therefore for a new legal definition of Islamophobia, which would help support victims of anti\-Muslim hatred. Awan met with the \(then\) Government Minister for Faith and Communities, who commissioned him to deliver a new independent report, entitled *A Working Definition of Islamophobia for the UK Government*. This report led to the first ever formal process of defining Islamophobia by a British Government. 

 The Government used his findings to establish a new process in creating a working definition of Islamophobia, a process in which Awan played a key role.  The Minister for Faith and Communities stated: *“His research into Islamophobic hate crimes has informed the evidence base for our policy development…Awan’s contribution has been instrumental and…has helped to develop and improve both Government policy and Parliamentary understanding…”* \[S07\] 

 His work has directly contributed to the Government’s National Hate Crime Action through his role with the AMHWG, where he was able to use his research on the offline impacts of attacks against mosques \(R03\) to argue that more funding was required to secure buildings from attacks. The Home Office agreed to allocate £1.6 million over three years for the protection of faith institutions. This was increased after the attack on Finsbury Park mosque. In March 2020, 49 places of worship received funding from the Home Office, including 27 mosques \[S08\]. 

 Following Awan being commissioned by the government to establish a new working definition for Islamophobia, he partnered with the UK’s leading independent race and equality think tank, the Runnymede Trust, and helped create a new working definition for Islamophobia in a landmark report for the Runnymede Trust, alongside his report for the Minister for Faith and Communities. Prior to this new definition the Runnymede Trust, two decades ago, were first credited with coining the term ‘Islamophobia’, as ‘the shorthand way of referring to dread or hatred of Islam…’ \(Runnymede Trust, 1997: 1\). In 2017, the Runnymede Trust invited Awan to write a chapter that would formulate a separate new community\-based definition for Islamophobia.  It formed part of the report: *Islamophobia: Still A Challenge for Us All*. As a result of this research, Awan was invited by the Co\-Chairs of the APPG on British Muslims to present oral and written evidence on a new working definition of Islamophobia. The APPG on British Muslims adopted Awan’s recommendation about using perceived Muslim identity in their public inquiry in 2018 \[S09\]. 

 Since then, this definition of Islamophobia, despite being in its infancy, has been officially adopted by over 800 organisations, including the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalist Party Westminster, the Mayor of London, Plaid Cymru, the National Union of Students and seventeen borough, city and town councils \[S10\].

Professor Salous’ research has contributed to the internationally agreed Recommendations for the fifth generation \(5G\) wireless communications in the built environment, and in the generation of new Recommendations around signal strength attenuation from outside to inside buildings. 

 These Recommendations have helped to determine the frequency allocation for 5G telecommunications systems which was decided at the World Radiocommunications Conference in 2019. This policy change has significant global impact on the telecommunications industry and its users.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Salous joined Durham in 2003 \(as the first female professor in engineering at the University\). Her major achievements include \(a\) **the development of a **unique architecture for frequency agile multiband** channel sounding equipment that has extended its range to the millimetre wave band**, and \(b\) t **he use of this equipment to obtain the characteristics of radio propagation in indoor and outdoor environments**. Her research is hugely relevant to current state of the art communication systems, following the unveiling and spread of commercial 5G wireless networks for mobile devices from 2019, which operate at these wavelengths. 

 Professor Salous’ first contribution was pioneering the channel sounding technology necessary to fully explore **wide bandwidths** in the millimetre\-wave spectrum. The requirements for high bandwidth and the ability to operate at different frequencies, means that wideband measurements using commercially available equipment have to be performed at quiet times. This impacts upon the quality of the data that can be obtained using this equipment, for the purpose of developing 5G. Most of the reported measurements tended to be undertaken in the evenings or at weekends when the environment is relatively stationary, rather than spanning the full temporal variation of the environment to include mush busier periods. 

 Following her arrival in Durham, Professor Salous further developed her frequency agile channel sounder technology from earlier work, into a Multiple Input \(i.e. transmit\), Multiple Output \(i.e. receive\) \(MIMO\) measuring device \[R1\]. Finally, a channel sounder MIMO architecture for the millimetre\-wave band was developed and presented in \[R2\]. This latter work was funded by EPSRC \[F1, F2\], Ofcom \[F3\] and an EU grant \[F4\]. These advances paved the way for the design and development of a new type of radio channel measurement equipment using state\-of\-the\-art digital and radio frequency \(RF\) techniques. The technology was developed to cover the range of frequencies to be allocated for 5G mobile radio networks, i.e. from below 6GHz up to 90GHz. The higher frequency range was agreed at the World Radiocommunications Conference in 2015. The new equipment developed at Durham University was used to perform propagation measurements which have directly led to the impact described below, i.e. the new propagation models used by industry and regulators, in \[R3\] and \[R4\]. Further details are given in the next section. Wideband measurements in typical indoor and outdoor environments were performed in suburban and residential environments. The Durham team used a unique waveform and the highest bandwidth compared with work by other groups. These studies provided key information to estimate channel parameters such as received signal attenuation \(path loss\) and wideband characteristics.

####  Background 

 The announcement in November 2019 \[E1\] of additional frequency bands for 5G wireless networks by the international body responsible for regulating radio communications worldwide, is a significant impact of nearly two decades of research to which Professor Salous has made major contributions. The increasing demand anticipated in the 2000’s for higher data traffic in wireless communication networks and the lack of available wide bandwidths in the sub\-6GHz spectrum band, incentivised the research community, industry and regulators to consider alternative bands. 

 The millimetre\-wave \(mm\-wave\) band, up to 100GHz, has large, contiguous unallocated sections of the spectrum. These were seen as a home for future wireless communications capacity, which is now opening up wireless communication to advanced new applications in industrial automation, remote manipulation and support for the Internet of Things \(IoT\). A recent \(October 2019\) industry report \[E2\], estimates that the mm\-wave band alone is likely to be responsible for 25% of the total economic value from the 5G network \(equating to a USD565 billion increase in global GDP by 2034\). Although, mm\-wave communication offers the potential of high data rate, there are also challenges that need to be addressed. Some of these are primarily related to the undesired characteristics of the propagation channel in these bands. Millimetre waves suffer predominantly from high transmission loss and are susceptible to shadowing \(e.g. blockage by humans or obstacles\). It is the research findings of Professor Salous described above that have been used to determine propagation models for this part of the spectrum. 

####  Impact on International Policy 

 Radio communications are regulated by the International Telecommunications Union \(ITU\), a United Nations agency based in Geneva, Switzerland. It is an intergovernmental public–private partnership organisation with 193 Member States, \~700 public \(e.g. regulators such as OFCOM\) and private sector companies \(e.g. Samsung, Intel, Ericsson\) and international and regional telecommunication entities. It coordinates global use of the radio spectrum and assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards. 

 Standardisation work under the remit of the ITU is carried out by the technical Study Groups \(SGs\) in which representatives of the ITU’s Telecommunication Standardisation Sector \(ITU\-T\) develop Recommendations for the various fields of international telecommunications. These Recommendations are then adopted at the World Radiocommunications Conference \(WRC\). 

 Professor Salous’ work on the development of the new channel sounding technology and the data generated using it, has fed directly into a number of ITU Recommendations: 

 ITU\-R P.1411\-10 provides guidance on outdoor short\-range propagation over the frequency range 300MHz to 100GHz \[E3\-6\] 

-  The data collected by Salous and co\-workers provided **the entire data set for the residential model \(0.8\-73GHz\) and the only data set for bands up to 73GHz** in the model leading to the parameters in Tables 4 \(page 8\) and 8 \(page 14\). \[E3\(i\)\] 

-  Other contributions by Professor Salous’ team are incorporated into Tables 11 \(page 30\), 13 \(page 33\), 20 \(page 37\) and 21 \(page 38\) in ITU\-R P.1411\-10 and added text in Section 9 \[E3\(i\)\]. 

 ITU\-R P.1238\-10 provides guidance on indoor propagation over the frequency range from 300MHz to 450GHz \[E3\(ii\)\] 

-  Contains several contributions derived from Durham data, e.g. tables 2, 4, 5 and an added Section \(9.3\). 

 E5 reports how the propagation data and models were derived and obtained for both Recommendations 1411 and 1238. Durham is directly cited in a number of places: Table 3 page 7, section 6.3.3.1 page 60 and 6.7.3 page 72. 

 ITU\-R P.1407 describes the nature of multipath propagation and defines the appropriate parameters for the statistical description of multipath effects. 

-  Durham research forms the basis for Section 2 and the associated figures and the new Sections 4 & 5 and Annex 3. \[E3\(iii\)\] 

 ITU\-R P.2109\-0 provides a method for estimating building entry loss at frequencies between about 80MHz and 100GHz. \[E3\(iv\)\] 

 ITU\-R P.2040 provides guidance on the effects of building materials and structures on radio\-wave propagation. \[E3\(v\)\] Both these Recommendations are discussed in E7. 

-  Measurements carried out by Professor Salous’ team at Durham in collaboration with Ofcom’s propagation team were submitted to the data pool used to generate the Recommendations. In ITU\-R P.2109\-0 Section \(23\) e.g. 23.1 and 23.3 directly credit Durham University. \[R3\] is cited in section 23.6. \[E7\] 

 In addition, Durham’s research has contributed to all sharing studies contained in Recommendations: P1144 P.\[BEL\], P.\[Clutter\_Loss\], P.619, P.2041, P.1409, P.452, P.2001 \[E4\] 

 Professor Salous has acted as a Contributor to Correspondence Group CG 3K\-6 \(led by Samsung and then the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute ETRI Korea\) responsible for the 5G model approved by SG3 in March 2017 and updated in 2019. Study Group 3 is responsible, inter alia, for studying international telecommunication/ICT policy and economic issues and tariff and accounting matters \(including costing principles and methodologies\), with a view to informing the development of enabling regulatory models and frameworks. The main providers of data were NTT Docomo \(the largest mobile operator in Japan\), ETRI Korea \(Government funded Research Centre\), Intel USA and Durham University. \[E8\] 

 At the most recent World Radiocommunications Conference in 2019, the ITU agreed the new bands for 5G based on these Recommendations \[E1\]. Already, auctions have been held in a number of countries for commercial use of the new bands. For instance, in the US Verizon is using 28GHz and AT&T is using 39GHz. 

####  Contribution to SEAMCAT 

 It is essential for the optimal use of the radio spectrum that radio compatibility is ensured between different frequency ranges.  SEAMCAT \(Spectrum Engineering Advanced Monte Carlo Analysis Tool\) is a statistical simulation model which was developed within the framework of CEPT \(European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations\). SEAMCAT is an open source software tool which is free of cost and allows users to effectively simulate interference scenarios between different radio communication systems 

 The models underpinned by Durham research as described above in ITU\-R P.1411 \( [<ins>https://ecocfl.cept.org/display/SH/A.17.14.2\+ITU\-R\+P.1411\-10</ins>](https://ecocfl.cept.org/display/SH/A.17.14.2+ITU-R+P.1411-10) and ITU\-R P.2109  [https://ecocfl.cept.org/display/SH/A17.18\+ITU\-R\+P.2109\-0](https://ecocfl.cept.org/display/SH/A17.18+ITU-R+P.2109-0) are implemented in SEAMCAT as reported in several ECC reports and outlined in an email from the Swiss Federal Office of Communications \[E9, E10\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: Edinburgh Neuroscience researchers identified thrombotic microangiopathy \(TMA\), a potentially fatal disease of the small blood vessels, as a new side effect of interferon beta therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis. They demonstrated a causal association with interferon, and showed that this was linked to an evolved version of the drug resulting from incremental changes in the manufacturing process – a phenomenon known as ‘biologic evolution’. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: In 2014, the UK Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) issued a drug safety update regarding TMA from interferon beta and European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) ordered a warning to be included in the drug’s safety data sheet. As a result, all patients taking high\-dose interferon beta \(50,000–100,000 patients worldwide in 2014\) are now monitored for TMA as standard of care, based on “early warning signs” identified in Edinburgh Neuroscience research, enabling early preventative action to be taken. This has already prevented 2 cases of fulminant TMA in Scotland. 

 Edinburgh Neuroscience findings received widespread academic and mainstream media attention, raising awareness among industry regulators such as MHRA and EMA, as well as healthcare professionals, that biologic evolution may mean that a long\-established safety profile does not always guarantee an absence of serious adverse side effects. This has implications for drug manufacturers worldwide.

 2. Underpinning research 

##  The Challenge: How do we know biological medicines are safe? 

 Biological medicines such as recombinant protein therapies are complex molecules produced in living cells, requiring multistep manufacturing processes. When doctors prescribe biologic agents, they often assume this is the same medicine that has been tested in extensive clinical trials. However, sequential manufacturing changes may accumulate to mean that none of the original components are the same. Edinburgh Neuroscience researchers have shown that that in the case of interferon beta therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis \(MS\), sequential manufacturing changes can affect the safety profile of the drug. 

##  Discovery of a new side effect in multiple sclerosis patients taking interferon beta 

 Through clinical observation and subsequent systematic investigations, Edinburgh Neuroscience researchers have identified TMA as a new serious complication of interferon beta therapy in patients with MS. TMA is a disease of small blood vessels and can lead to fulminant multi\-organ failure and ultimately death. 

 The Edinburgh Neuroscience researchers were the first to define the clinical syndrome of interferon\-associated TMA and identify new\-onset severe hypertension and impaired renal function as early warning signs. The incidence of TMA in patients treated with high\-dose interferon beta was estimated to be approximately 1 per 1,000 patient\-years — a major, and previously unidentified, risk \[3.1\]. 

 The researchers next sought to demonstrate clinically the direct causal relationship between interferon beta and TMA: they undertook a detailed analysis of all 8 patients in the UK in whom TMA had been identified at that time, and found that no patient had any genetic, pharmacological or disease\-related predisposing factors that could have explained why they developed TMA, nor were they taking any other medication associated with TMA \[3.2\]. 

##  Experimental evidence establishes direct causality between interferon beta and TMA 

 To provide explicit and unequivocal experimental evidence for the causal association between interferon beta and TMA, the researchers asked whether the recombinant protein itself could cause the small vessel abnormalities observed in the patients. Using transgenic mouse models of mild and severe interferon overexpression, they revealed a clear dose\-dependent effect of interferon on the microvasculature, which mirrored phenotypes seen on patient biopsies, thus demonstrating direct causality between high\-dose interferon therapies and TMA \[3.2\]. 

##  Increase in interferon\-associated TMA is a result of incremental manufacturing changes \(‘biologic evolution’\) 

 The discovery of TMA as a side effect of interferon beta was unexpected since the drug had been approved for almost 20 years and was considered very safe; not only had the initial formulation been tested over many thousands of patient\-years, but there had been only reports of negligible side effects for the first 10 years of use. 

 Together with colleagues from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Edinburgh Neuroscience team analysed pharmacy records and reports from national and global drug safety databases and identified a single common manufacturing source of all the interferon implicated in TMA cases. Moreover, they showed that the TMA cases were associated with the introduction of an evolved version of recombinant interferon by this manufacturer, indicating that incremental manufacturing changes, designed to improve efficiency of the process, had led to the drug having a different safety profile from that of the originally approved biologic agent \[3.1; 3.3\]. 

 The Edinburgh Neuroscience researchers went on to demonstrate how current drug monitoring systems may be too limited in sample size and duration of follow\-up to capture important new side effects from evolved biologics in a timely manner \[3.3\]. This phenomenon, whereby a complex biological drug can become less safe over time, is known as ‘biologic evolution’.

 4. Details of the impact 

 The Edinburgh Neuroscience research described above has led to impacts on both the routine monitoring of patients with MS taking high\-dose interferon beta and on the wider pharmaceutical industry and its regulatory bodies. 

##  Impact on awareness among patients and clinicians 

 Given the potentially fatal nature of the side effect of TMA seen with the new interferon beta preparations, identified through Edinburgh Neuroscience research, it was of paramount importance to raise awareness among healthcare professionals that a long\-established safety profile does not necessarily mean a drug will not have adverse side effects. This awareness has been boosted by highly supportive editorials accompanying publications \[3.1\] and \[3.2\] from high\-profile figures in the field of pharmacoepidemiology: for example, the editorial of paper \[3.2\] noted: "" *This report is remarkable for the multiple methods of their investigation, their definitive documentation of a causal association, and the importance of their findings for improved patient care*."" \[5.1\]. In addition, in April 2017, Hunt featured in a *British Medical Journal* podcast on biologic evolution, which had been played 8,800 times by November 2020 \[5.2\]. 

##  Impact on UK drug safety regulators 

 In December 2014, MHRA issued a drug safety update on interferon beta on its website \[5.3\]. Citing the paper \[3.1\], this announcement lists the clinical warning signs of TMA, urges healthcare professionals to be vigilant for these, advises on the next steps if a case of TMA is suspected and stresses that interferon beta treatment must be discontinued immediately if TMA is diagnosed. The same warning was included in an MHRA newsletter in October 2014 \[5.3\]. 

 **Impact on international drug safety regulators** 

 The Edinburgh Neuroscience reports of interferon\-associated TMA triggered a European investigation into the risk. In February 2014, Hunt was invited to present evidence from his research to the EMA Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee \(PRAC\). Consequently, PRAC categorised TMA as an important identified risk that should be included in the risk management plan across all formulations of interferon beta. 

 Furthermore, PRAC recommended that the safety data sheet accompanying packages of the new formulation of interferon beta be updated to contain the following information: “ *Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy \[…\] have been reported including fatal cases with interferon beta products* \[…\] *Therefore, if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing \[…\] is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment with plasma exchange is required and immediate discontinuation of \[product name\] is recommended*.” \[5.4\]. 

 Crucially, PRAC also recommended the following addition to the “What you need to know before you use” section: “ *Cases of formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment, from several weeks of treatment up to several years after starting \[product name\]. Your doctor may want to monitor your blood pressure, blood \(platelet count\) and the function of your kidney.”* \[5.4\]. 

 In addition, in August 2014, the Medicines Authority, in agreement with EMA and the manufacturers of interferon beta \(Bayer, Biogen Idec, Merck Serono and Novartis\), issued a “Dear Healthcare Professional” letter to all practising doctors in Europe \[5.5\], notifying them of the side effect. 

 **Impact on clinical practice and patient safety** 

 Following these explicit recommendations by EMA and MHRA, active monitoring for the early warning signs identified through Edinburgh Neuroscience research is now standard of care in MS patients taking high doses \(more than 50mcg per week\) of interferon beta. This has already helped to prevent the development of fulminant TMA in 2 Scottish patients. 

 Targeted monitoring was formally introduced in all major Scottish centres in January 2014. This involves a 3\-monthly monitoring with full blood count, renal function and blood pressure checks. A clinical audit between January 2014 and January 2016 tracked 249 patients and found that since the introduction of the targeted monitoring, interferon beta was discontinued early in 2 patients who developed new severe hypertension with renal dysfunction. These abnormalities resolved fully once interferon beta was stopped, and no organ damage was observed. During the audit period, no cases presented with fulminant organ failure due to interferon\-associated TMA \[5.6\]. 

 In addition to preventing dangerous TMA in 2 patients in Scotland, the formal warnings by MHRA and EMA and the safety data sheet have also reduced the risk of TMA for MS patients worldwide who are taking high\-dose interferon beta \(50,000–100,000 patients at the time of the EMA announcement\). Before the announcement, a worldwide total of 91 cases of interferon\-associated TMA \(7 of which were fatal\) from 16 countries was documented. In the 4 months following circulation of the Dear Healthcare Professional letter in August 2014, 5 further cases were reported, with appropriate action taken in each case and no fatalities \[5.7\]. 

##  Impact on drug regulatory practice 

 Edinburgh Neuroscience’s discovery of the novel side effect of interferon\-associated TMA, and linking it to the evolved formulation of interferon beta, have alerted drug regulators to the risk of biologic evolution more generally. The Chief Executive of MHRA states that Edinburgh Neuroscience research has been “ *influential in the drug safety field, through the description of “biologic evolution” – a process whereby biologic drugs can alter their safety profiles over time. This concept has been important in framing ongoing academic, regulatory and industry discussions about optimising biologic safety*.” \[5.8\]. This awareness of the MHRA of the risk of biologic evolution ensures that it is now considered when new drugs or manufacturing processes are evaluated for approval. 

 In recognition of his contribution to drug safety, in September 2015, Hunt was awarded the Sir Derrick Dunlop Prize by the MHRA \[5.9\], reflecting the fundamental importance of the discovery for patient safety.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Methyl methacrylate \(MMA\) is the monomer used to produce polymers such as Perspex or plexiglass, and acrylic resins that are used widely across construction, medical and optical applications. The annual market value of MMA is ca. $8 billion p.a. 

 Research at the University of Liverpool enabled the commercialization of a new process for MMA production, called ALPHA. ALPHA plants now provide 10% of world MMA production capacity. This has led to economic and environmental impacts including: 

-  The production of 1.6 Mtonne of MMA at ALPHA plants during the REF period with an estimated value of >$3 billion to Lucite International. 

-  The construction of a 2nd ALPHA plant \($360 M investment\) with a capacity of 250,000 tonne p.a. in 2018 

-  Reduced energy consumption and lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions leading to 40% lower operating costs for ALPHA produced MMA \(vs. conventional MMA plants\) 

-  Elimination of toxic \(HCN\) and corrosive \(c.H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>\) feedstocks and solid wastes associated with the conventional process that Alpha technology is displacing. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The ALPHA process for MMA production uses a homogeneous Pd catalyst that was filed for patent by Lucite International \(then ICI/Ineos Acrylics\) in 1999. The catalyst enables the selective carbonylation of ethene in methanol to yield methyl propanoate, which can then undergo a condensation reaction with formaldehyde to yield MMA, scheme 1. Prior to the work of Iggo, Heaton and Whyman this precious metal catalyst was too unstable for commercial exploitation, rapidly decomposing under the operating conditions used \[5.1\]. Turnover numbers \(TONs\) of only a few thousand occurred before irreversible decomposition \[3.1, 5.1, 5.2\]. A high value precious metal catalyst only becomes viable if it has sufficient lifetime and productivity. 

 The Liverpool team delivered two programmes of underpinning research that overcame this critical limitation resulting in turnover numbers increasing to >10<sup>7</sup> and enabling the ALPHA process to be commercially viable and to be employed at scale. 

 **\(i\) Identification of operating conditions that delivered orders of magnitude increase in TON \(> 10<sup>7</sup>\) through mechanistic research:** To achieve the improvement in catalyst stability required to make the process commercially viable, the Liverpool team and Lucite International studied the mechanism of the Pd ALPHA catalyst. This collaboration continues to this day \[5.1\], but the underpinning research that enabled commercialisation of the process was reported in a series of joint Liverpool\-Lucite publications between 2000\-2004 \[3.2\-3.5\]. 

 Using the unique high pressure NMR bubble column developed by Iggo at the University of Liverpool \[3.5\] it was possible to carry out *in\-situ* studies of the ALPHA mechanism. The ability to monitor the working catalyst under realistic conditions led to the identification of the  reaction intermediates responsible for activity and the conditions under which these could be stabilized. In a 2002 study the Liverpool team used NMR spectroscopy to identify the main catalyst decomposition pathway, poisoning of the palladium hydride intermediate by carbon monoxide \[3.2, 3.4\]. The unstable Pd species formed, rapidly aggregated forming irrecoverable metal particles giving rise to the commercially un\-viable TON \[5.2\]. This led the collaborative team to develop CO\-lean operating conditions that resulted in several orders of magnitude increase in catalyst TON, to a value >10<sup>7</sup>. <ins>As</ins> <ins>carbon monoxide</ins> <ins>is a substrate for the</ins> <ins>desired reaction these operating conditions</ins> <ins>are</ins> <ins>counter\-intuitive without</ins> <ins>knowledge of</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>reaction</ins> <ins>and catalyst</ins> <ins>decomposition mechanisms</ins> \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 **\(ii\) Enabling scale\-up by experimental verification of thermodynamic models:** Following the identification of optimised operating conditions it was possible to deploy the ALPHA technology. However, the first ALPHA plant required a 30,000 fold scale\-up of the reactor size. To enable the safe commissioning of the plant and the correct specification of equipment it was vital that experimental data was provided to validate the thermodynamic models used in the plant design. In follow\-on studies that focused on enabling process scale–up, Iggo and Satherley used the Liverpool high\-pressure NMR bubble column \[3.5\] to study the four\-component mixture CO\-ethene\-MeOH\-methyl propanoate, a system that was previously un\-reported, to provide the essential vapour\-liquid\-equilibrium data to the Lucite design team.\[5.1, 5.2\] This underpinning research was carried out in 2004 following the award of funding to Iggo and Satherley from Lucite \(project title: In situ measurement of gas concentrations in working mini\-reactors, £69,030\). 

 **Continued development of the ALPHA process:** In total Lucite has co\-sponsored 2 PDRA’s, 5 PhD students and provided equipment and funding of >£500k to Iggo demonstrating the importance placed by the company on this mechanistic research. Alongside the two key programmes of work outlined above Iggo has worked with Lucite on multiple further projects to further improve the ALPHA process. Projects include work between 2010\-2017 to improve the second stage of the ALPHA process, the condensation of methyl propanoate with formaldehyde. This has led to the discovery of a new catalyst for the 2<sup>nd</sup> step of the ALPHA process \(condensation reaction\) and the filing of two patent families by Lucite with Iggo named as an inventor \[3.6\]. Most recently in 2019 Iggo established a work programme with Lucite’s Wilton R&D team using *in situ* NMR to identify the role of different feedstock impurities on catalyst stability and TON and so define the feedstock quality and grade requirements \[5.1\]. 

 The vital roles of the Liverpool team in bringing the ALPHA process to market is detailed by Lucite in a letter to Iggo, and summarised by the statement from the Business Research Director “ *I am pleased to be able to <ins>confirm the critical role played by the collaborative studies between Heaton,</ins> <ins>Whyman</ins> <ins>and yourself at Liverpool University and Lucite in enabling the successful commercialization of the ALPHA process*</ins>.” \[5.1\]

#  4. Details of the impact 

 ALPHA plants produce high purity MMA using a process that has a lower energy intensity and avoids the use of toxic and highly corrosive reagents. This has allowed it to rapidly displace incumbent processes; ALPHA plants currently provide 10% of the world MMA supply and this is expected to rise to 17% by 2023 \[5.1\]. The global MMA market is *ca.* $7\-8 billion p.a. \[5.1, 5.3\]. This has given rise to substantial economic and environmental benefits. 

 The ALPHA process only became commercially viable following research at the University of Liverpool, which led to a step\-change in the turnover number of the carbonylation catalyst. A letter of support from the Business Research Director \(Strategic Projects Group\) of Lucite confirms that prior to the work of Iggo and colleagues the catalyst was not economically viable and confirms the crucial role played by the research at the University of Liverpool in developing the counter\-intuitive operating conditions that enabled commercial deployment of, and remain critical to the success of, the ALPHA process. “ *Prior to the initiation of our collaboration, we had uneconomically low catalyst turnover numbers. <ins>Between 2000 and 2008 the work at Liverpool gave essential insight into the mechanism of the reaction and catalyst decomposition, which provided crucial direction to Lucite’s internal lab, pilot plant and technical development activities and led directly to the adoption of unexpected, counter\-intuitive operating conditions that gave the step change in catalyst turnover number that is an essential element of the</ins> <ins>commercial success of the ALPHA process</ins>. The counter\-intuitive operating conditions developed are used in, and remain critical to, the operation of all ALPHA plants*” \[5.1, 5.2\]. The UoL research was thus decisive in the launch of and remains critical to the commercial success of the Lucite process. 

 The team at the University of Liverpool also provided important experimental data for the scale up of the reaction to the plant level: “ *the Liverpool team \(2002\-2009\) provided key physical property data that was used during plant design and scale up. The experimental solubility data from the work of yourself and Dr Satherley was used to verify the thermodynamic models employed in the design of the first ALPHA plant.”* \[5.1\] 

 The support letter from Lucite International clearly demonstrates that without the underpinning research at Liverpool the ALPHA process would not have been a commercial success. 

 

 **Fig. 1** ALPHA 2, the world's largest MMA plant, came on stream in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia in 2018. 

**Economic Impact of ALPHA:** The first ALPHA plant opened in 2008 in Singapore with a capacity of 130,000 tonne p.a. of MMA and was the basis of the REF 2014 impact case. This plant has remained operational also generating economic impact through this REF period through product sales. In <ins>a major expansion of the impact during this REF period, in</ins> <ins>2018 the</ins> <ins>second</ins> <ins>ALPHA plant came on stream in Saudi Arabia</ins> following an investment of $360M, in the form of a joint venture between Mitsubishi Chemical \(current owners of Lucite\) and the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation \(SABIC\) \[5.4, 5.5\]. <ins>The</ins> <ins>second</ins> <ins>ALPHA plant</ins> <ins>\(250,000 tonne p.a.\) is the world’s largest MMA plant</ins> and is the global cost leader \(cheapest to run as of 2018\), \[5.4, 5.5\]. The Lucite letter confirms that “ *ALPHA 2 represents a $360m investment, and it also uses the operating conditions developed as a result of the* *Liverpool teams’ research”.* \[5.1\] Furthermore, Lucite confirm in their support letter and in public statements that a third 350,000 tonne p.a ALPHA plant using the operating conditions discovered by Iggo and colleagues is planned for the USA \[5.1, 5.5\]. In total, Lucite state in writing that, ALPHA plants have produced 1.6 Mtonne of MMA during the REF period \[5.1\], the value of which is estimated to be >$3 billion based on an average cost and freight price of $2000 pmt \(over the assessment period \[5.3\]\). 

 The ALPHA process offers significant economic advantages when compared to conventional acetone cyanohydrin \(ACH\) plants through the generation of a particularly high purity MMA which is suitable for high value applications such as those where transmission of visible light is critical \(LED/LCD displays, surface coatings\) and medical applications \(dental and implant cements\). \[5.6\] 

 Iggo continues to work with the Lucite team in Wilton which remains the research and support site for ALPHA, anchoring high value jobs and activities in the UK \[5.1\]. 

 **Environmental Impact:**  By making the ALPHA process commercially viable, and through research assisting the plant design process, the University of Liverpool team has enabled significant environmental benefits. 

 ALPHA MMA production is rapidly displacing the established ACH process and is key to Lucite achieving its target of a 20% reduction in environmental emissions and to achieve zero waste to landfill \[5.1, 5.7, 5.8\]. As well as using available, relatively low\-cost feedstocks/solvents \(ethylene, carbon monoxide, methanol and formaldehyde\), ALPHA chemistry eliminates the use of hydrogen cyanide, a highly toxic chemical. Conventional ACH plants require \~30 ktonne p.a. of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide \(for an ACH plant of 150 ktonne pa.\) leading to strict controls which dictate plant and reactor design, waste treatment and operating procedures \[5.9, 5.10\]. 

 Furthermore, during conventional ACH MMA synthesis sulphuric acid is used in very large quantities; a 150 ktonne p.a. ACH plant produces at least 360 ktonne p.a. of spent sulphuric acid waste that needs to be recovered/recycled \[5.7\]. ALPHA plants do not use sulphuric acid thus avoiding the need for the energy intensive acid recovery processes. This combined with the very high selectivity of the ALPHA stage 1 process \(>99.9%\), which minimises purification steps, lowers energy inputs, lowers emissions and leads to a 40% reduction in running costs \[5.1, 5.5, 5.9\]. 

 The ALPHA process also has excellent atom efficiency, it generates virtually no waste/by products other than water \[5.1\] *.* In contrast, the ACH process produces 1.2 tonnes of ammonium bisulfate co\-product per tonne of MMA \[5.10\] which must be pyrolysed to SO<sub>2</sub> for conversion to sulfuric acid, a highly energy intensive process, or sold as \(low value\) fertilizer. 

 Finally, ALPHA provides a pathway to generate sustainable polymers. ALPHA's feedstocks such as ethylene, carbon monoxide and methanol are ideal candidates to derive from biomass. Unusually for a plastic, pMMA can also be returned in high yield to its monomer and MMA to develop a circular MMA economy and Lucite is actively pursuing this strategy. 

 **The impact of the Alpha process has been recognised by many awards** \[5.6\] 

 The Lucite ALPHA™ Process is one of very few, successful, large scale, industrial process using a homogeneous palladium catalyst to be developed and come on stream in the last 30 years and is protected by 50 patent families totalling over 650 patents and has been recognized as follows:

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 By the early twenty\-first century, the African American freedom fighter Frederick Douglass \(1818\-1895\) had become a heavily mythologised figure. Research led by Professor Celeste\-Marie Bernier, in collaboration with Dr Andrew Taylor, has changed perceptions of Douglass, making him what a leading collector describes as “ *a humanized and accessible figure… in whom we can more easily relate to our contemporary struggles and see our contemporary selves*”. In one of the first studies of the Black presence in nineteenth\-century Scotland, the research has situated Douglass as part of an intergenerational Black resistance movement on both sides of the Atlantic. It has underpinned exhibitions visited by over 34,000 people, an award\-winning book, free digital assets, a widely\-screened documentary and around 100 talks, tours and interviews – helping curators, archivists, charities and educators to expand and diversify their audiences and to present slavery and abolitionist material in vastly more sensitive and nuanced ways. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 As the most famous author and activist of African descent in United States history, Frederick Douglass is often presented as an exceptional individual working in isolation. Funded by an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) Leadership Fellowship \(AH/R007195/1; GBP202,125\), Our Bondage and Our Freedom is the first project to reinterpret Douglass’s activism and authorship in relation to that of his wife Anna Murray, daughters Rosetta and Annie and sons Lewis Henry, Frederick Jr. and Charles Remond, as well as hundreds of other nineteenth\-century Black campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic. The project is part of a body of research across disciplinary and geographical boundaries undertaken by Bernier, who joined the University of Edinburgh as Personal Chair in United States and Atlantic Studies in 2016. Much of its early phase was spent recovering, digitising and contextualising over 1,000 documents and artefacts, drawing in particular on the collection of the US\-based collector and conservator, Walter O. Evans. 

 Marking the 200\-year anniversary of Douglass’s birth in Maryland, Our Bondage and Our Freedom brings to maturity the alternative critical language with which Bernier does justice to the full gamut of realities – physical, psychological, emotional and imaginative – experienced by Black women, children and men, enslaved and free. Using Black acts and arts of authorship and agency as her organising intellectual principles, she has contextualised Evans’s extensive collection of previously unexamined narratives, poems, speeches, songs, oral testimonies, correspondence, essays, photographs, drawings, paintings and sculptures relating to the Murray Douglass family and their networks, as well as objects in the collections of the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\) and other museums and archives. In contrast with earlier dominant portrayals of Douglass as a flawless icon, this research has recast him as a fallible individual working as part of an intergenerational Black resistance movement that operated far beyond the USA, including in Scotland, where Bernier has uncovered the role played by hundreds of nineteenth\-century Black antislavery campaigners. In this way, the project marks a significant departure from prevailing exclusionary approaches to the study of Black lives and transatlantic and chattel slavery, wherein the iconic and exceptional few are theorised over the invisibilised many. 

 The project’s most extensive and publicly\-accessible printed output is the 2018 book *If I Survive: Frederick Douglass and Family in the Walter O. Evans Collection* \(3.1\), co\-authored by Bernier and Taylor, and winner of the 2019 International African American History and Genealogical Society Maryland Book Award for Non\-Fiction/Social Change. Other publications arising from the research include two new scholarly editions of Douglass’s autobiographies, recontextualised by Bernier to reflect the intergenerational freedom struggle and Black literary tradition \(3.2; 3.3\), *The Anna Murray and Frederick Douglass Family Papers 1813\-1960* \(forthcoming in 2022\), and the first ever literary biography of Douglass \(also forthcoming\). Of particular importance to the project’s programme of site\-specific UK and US exhibitions, which launched in October 2018 at the National Library of Scotland, is Bernier’s examination of Douglass’s complex relationship with his mass\-reproduced image \(3.4\), in which he sees literary and visual forms as weapons of self\-empowerment through which to wage war against the racist depictions that dominate white mainstream culture. From these public exhibitions, a range of online material \(3.5\), and further scholarly publications \(including 3.6\), the Murray Douglass family emerges as a case study for subsequent generations of African American and African diasporic resistance, using every means necessary in the fight to have an imaginative inner life away from dominant forms of textual expression and iconographic representation. 

 The Our Bondage and Our Freedom team 

 The project’s Principal Investigator and AHRC Leadership Fellow is Professor Celeste\-Marie Bernier, University of Edinburgh \(UoE\). Together with Dr Andrew Taylor \(UoE\) and Walter O. Evans, the team comprises academics, archivists, artists and activists from the National Library of Scotland; the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site; Maryland State Archives; the Black Studies Research Center and the Multicultural Center at the University of California Santa Barbara; the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; and the SCAD Museum of Art, Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Scotland profited from the historic trafficking of enslaved people, but also played a key role in the abolition movement. Research led by Bernier, in collaboration with Taylor, has helped the National Library of Scotland raise public awareness of this significant effort, focusing for the first time on the work of Black social justice campaigners, as opposed to more well\-known, white men. While establishing the importance of nineteenth\-century Black abolitionists in Scotland, the research has also transformed understanding of Frederick Douglass in the United States, where the author and activist had become heavily mythologised. In the words of Walter O. Evans, whose previously unseen collections have been widely used in Our Bondage and Our Freedom, “ *Bernier’s scholarship… has added a new dimension to the narrative of Douglass*”, translating him from “ *the historic, monolithic character the world has come to know*” into “ *a humanized and accessible figure… in whom we can more easily relate to our contemporary struggles and see our contemporary selves*” \(5.1\). 

 The first exhibition based on the research was the *Strike for Freedom: Slavery, Civil War and the Frederick Douglass Family* “Treasures” display at the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\). It was the Library’s first ever exhibition on Black transatlantic histories. It attracted more media coverage \(including in *Scotland on Sunday* \[print circulation approximately 11,000\], *Edinburgh Evening News* \[approximately 14,000\], *The National* \[approximately 9,000\], and the BBC \[5.2a\]\), and higher visitor numbers \(17,820 people over 18 weeks in 2018\-19 \[5.2b, p.31\]\), than any other NLS Treasures display. As well as “ *conceiv\[ing\] and shap\[ing\]* Strike for Freedom” and being “ *involved in every aspect of the curation*”, Bernier delivered most of its “ *substantial events programme developed from, and featuring, her world\-leading research*” \(5.2b, p.30\). Events for 450\+ people included three guided tours, five Black History city tours and two public lectures, all booked to capacity, an Education Pack, and bespoke tours for schools, adult learners and community groups, including homeless people and people living with dementia. Extensive visitors’ comments \(5.3\) included: “ *Shocked to find how ignorant I am regarding the history of anti\-slavery from the black viewpoint… I stand corrected and chastened*” \(pp.1 & 19\); “ *I spent an hour transfixed. Delighted to have seen this rare chunk of history in Edinburgh*” \(pp.1 & 20\); “ *I had no idea about the connection with Scotland. This is a really excellent and informative display that fills in so many gaps*” \(pp.1 & 20\); “ *It’s exciting and moving to learn of the connections between the abolitionist movement in America \[I’m originally from Boston MA\] and in my adopted home*” \(pp.5 & 28\); “ *important and moving… a lesson for us all*” \(pp.4 & 25\); *“Never more necessary than now”* \(pp.6 & 29\). 

 Reflecting on the NLS’s use of the research, the Lead Curator of US and Commonwealth Collections remarks on an “ *exceptionally positive impact*” of “ *permanent benefit to the Library*” \(5.2b, p.30\). With particular reference to changes in curatorial practice and understanding, the Curator reports that the research helped the NLS to reappraise its existing physical and online content on slavery and anti\-slavery and, in the exhibition, to “ *present a complex, vitally important subject in a sensitive, accurate, powerful way. Prof Bernier greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the Library’s work and the sophistication of our story\-telling*” \(5.2b, p.30\). Linking into her work on the *Strike for Freedom* Black History city tours and Education Pack, Bernier successfully nominated Douglass as the first person of colour to be recognised by Historic Environment Scotland with a commemorative plaque on his former Edinburgh residence, which was unveiled during the exhibition’s run in November 2018. This event became the focus of a documentary by social justice filmmaker Parisa Urquhart, which has since been publicly screened and discussed with several hundred viewers in Scotland and the USA, including as part of Black History Month \(UK, October 2019 and 2020 and USA, February 2020\) by hosts such as the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights \(at Glasgow City Chambers\) and the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University, Rhode Island. Most recently, it has screened at festivals, including the New York African Diaspora International Film Festival \(its official US premiere\) \(5.4\). 

 As testified to by the Frederick Douglass Honor Society \(Maryland\), the research has widened understanding of Douglass and his family in the United States to incorporate “ *the connection from Scotland to America and the relationship and work Frederick Douglass did to speak out against injustice everywhere*” \(5.5\). To date, the research has underpinned three US exhibitions: a permanent display in the Maryland State House, and temporary shows at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. \(April to June 2019\) and the SCAD Museum of Art at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia \(October 2019 to January 2020\). The National Gallery of Art \(NGA\) has written that “ *Professor Bernier has inspired and made possible more Gallery programming than any other outside scholar*” \(5.6a\), noting that her research enabled the venue to arrange the first ever library loan exhibition in its 80\-year history, attracting 789 visitors to the “special\-focus” display during its short run \(5.6b\). Additionally, by the end of December 2020, the NGA’s recordings of two of Bernier’s talks on the research \(now permanent digital resources\) had been played over 11,000 times \(5.6c\). 

 Curators and art historians at SCAD Museum of Art have referred to the “ *exceptional*” and “ *assiduous*” research as “ *an invaluable resource*” in what has been a “ *rare opportunity to extend our educational initiative… beyond the present era. With Professor Bernier’s knowledge, we were able to enhance our display of great artwork with a historical foundation that served to give context to contemporary concerns of race and the legacy of slavery*” \(5.7a\). Writing in October 2019, just after the exhibition launched to over 1,300 people \(of 14,232 visitors overall \[5.7b\]\), the Museum’s Assistant Curator noted that, as well as having an “ *overwhelmingly positive response*” from Savannah College of Art and Design students and faculty, the show had “ *engaged citizens of the city… in a way we have not before seen*”, helping audiences “ *move beyond the understanding of Douglass as an isolated public figure*” \(5.7a\). Likewise, the Maryland State Archives, which installed the public, permanent display in the Maryland State House as part of its Legacy of Slavery in Maryland programme \(1,829 visitors until the building closed due to COVID\-19 \[5.8a; 5.8b\]\) has noted that “ *Bernier’s continued Douglass research, often of a personal nature, expands the \[programme’s\] ability to instill humanity to a man whose iconic status sometimes obscured it*” \(5.8a\). 

 
Beyond the partner venues that have collaborated in Our Bondage and Our Freedom, the research has been used by numerous other stakeholders, from teachers and community groups to libraries and charities. Bernier has personally delivered around 100 public talks and radio and television interviews on both sides of the Atlantic, and the posters she produced using digitised materials from Evans’s collection have been – as Rochester Public Library noted in an email to her – “ *such a great teaching tool; they allowed us to tell a story about the Douglass family that \[we\] never could have done without them – and without your work*” \(5.9\). Politically, Maryland State Archives has reported that activities based on the research have “ *increased awareness among the members of the Maryland General Assembly, who… will be unveiling statues of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman… the first African American figures installed in the State House, which dates back to 1772*” \(5.8a\). On the basis of her “ *extensive achievements as an internationally respected scholar*”, together with her “ *contribution to the celebration of Black History Month and the bicentennial of the birth of Frederick Douglass*”, Bernier has been awarded a State of Maryland Governor's Citation presented to her during one of her many public talks by Lieutenant Governor Boyd Rutherford \(5.10; pictured page 4\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 New thinking is regularly sought to tackle longstanding issues of poor health and address health inequity. Through the CommonHealth project, GCU research has directly influenced shifts in thinking about how the impact of community\-led ‘social enterprises’ generates health and well\-being impacts, which were not previously considered before. Such thinking has resulted in \(1\) a policy shift, with increased prominence given to the role of social enterprises in policy terms both nationally \(the Scottish Government\) and internationally \(Victorian state Government\); and \(2\) supporting practitioners operating within the social enterprise sector to make their role in public health more explicit, thus supporting increased investment into the sector. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Early theoretical and policy analysis \[R1; R2\] argued that public health practitioners and policymakers had neglected the potential of community\-level actors such as social enterprises to address the ‘social determinants of health’: the factors in the social environment that favour or harm health. Despite Scotland having a world class health service by any measure, health inequalities have been widening and deepening for decades, with Scotland frequently labelled the ‘sick man’ of Europe, thus new thinking was required to address this deep\-seated problem. A systematic review was undertaken, the very first on this topic, on the extant literature at the social enterprise/health interface \[R3\]. A hypothetical conceptual model on the ‘pathways to impact’ between engaging with a social enterprise, the impacts they have on individual and community ‘assets’ and their subsequent impact in health and well\-being terms, was set out. This provided the underpinning rationale for a successful application to the MRC/ESRC for a programme grant entitled Developing Methods to Evidence Social Enterprise as a Public Health Intervention \(or  [‘CommonHealth’](http://www.commonhealth.uk/)\) \[G1\] \(2014\-2018\). 

 Building on the early model, new models were developed and enhanced with empirical data, focusing on the pathways to impact between engagement with a social enterprise and, ultimately, health and well\-being impacts \[R4; R5\] including addressing social isolation and loneliness in rural communities \[R6\]. 

 <ins>The findings</ins> <ins>from</ins> <ins>each piece of</ins> <ins>research were:</ins> 

 \[R1\] There are several potential roles for social business in relation to health and well\-being, but that it is important to generate evidence of success, or otherwise, on outcomes achieved and resource impacts. 

 \[R2\] Social enterprise is an innovative and sustainable form of public health ‘intervention’. 

 \[R3\] Positive evidence is presented upon a range of psycho\-social outcomes and determinants. \(No empirical research found examining social enterprise as a mode of healthcare delivery\). 

 \[R4\] The development of an ‘empirically\-informed’ conceptual model of the health and well\-being impacts of social enterprise\-led activity, and thus presents a significant advance on previous hypothetical, theoretically based conceptualizations. 

 \[R5\] The identification of a range of explanatory mechanisms and potential pathways of causation between engagement in social enterprise\-led activity and various physical, mental, and social outcomes. 

 \[R6\] Social enterprises are successfully providing activities that counteract factors contributing to social isolation and feelings of loneliness, leading to wider health and well\-being benefits for individuals. 

 Knowledge Exchange between researchers, and policymakers and practitioners was fully integrated from the start and we held regular \(six monthly\) Knowledge Exchange Forums \(KEFs\) around Scotland. In total, seven KEFs attracted over 230 participants, and culminated in the development of a series of practitioner and policymaker\-focused briefing papers \( [ten in total](http://www.commonhealth.uk/briefing-papers)\). Our website had 6,301 visits; 4,525 unique visitors from 58 countries. We had 2,621 people access resources on the website, and these briefing papers have supported several social enterprises in subsequent cases for funding \[C8; C9\]. Profs Teasdale and Roy gave evidence at the Scottish Parliamentary Inquiry on Social Enterprise and Family Businesses, and to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Enterprise at the Scottish Parliament.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact 1 – Impact on public policy</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>nationally and internationally</ins> 

 In their Social Enterprise Strategy 2016\-2026 the Scottish Government specifically links the work of social enterprises to the generation of health and well\-being impacts: “\[Social enterprises\] will become widely known for delivering high quality and sustainable services that reduce inequality, lift people out of poverty, foster more empowered and resilient communities, and improve health, well\-being and quality of life” \[C1\]. The former Deputy Director \(Third Sector and Equalities\) at the Scottish Government \[C2\] confirmed that not only was this policy rhetoric a shift in position to better recognise the role of social enterprises in generating health and well\-being impacts \(which no\-one had thought about prior to this point\) but this shift was directly attributable to the research undertaken \[R1\-R6\]. 

 It was also corroborated \[C2\] that the “world\-leading reputation for research in this field” referenced in the Social Enterprise Action Plan \(2017\-2020\) was the research undertaken in this programme \[R1\-R3\], directly leading to their policy position on establishing an academic forum: “We will establish a social enterprise academic forum, independently chaired and led by the university sector. This will build upon Scotland’s world\-leading reputation for research in this field and enhance postgraduate scholarship opportunities” \[C3\]. 

 The Chief Social Policy Advisor at the Scottish Government referred to the research as “ground\-breaking and influential”, filling a perceived “ingenuity gap” in addressing key public health challenges that we are facing now and in the future. At a public event in November 2018, she referenced that social enterprises play an important role in addressing social isolation and loneliness \[R6\] and corroborated that there has been a definite shift in tone towards the third sector, and a wider appreciation of the work of social enterprises in generating health and well\-being impacts within Government, due to the research \[C4\]. 

 This shift in tone and the widening of social enterprise appreciation was echoed by the Associate Director of the Glasgow Centre for Population Health \(GCPH\) \[C9\]. During work with Glasgow City Council, GCPH were concerned that the council was “initially quite conservative in terms of what economic growth was looking like” but that “having the back\-up of CommonHealth is really useful for just giving people confidence that there can be a different economic model”. The work of CommonHealth provided “a certain degree of confidence when talking about promoting social enterprise community\-based organisations” to Glasgow City Council. 

 There are also policy impacts outside the UK. VicHealth \(the Public Health department for the state of Victoria, Australia\) significantly drew on the research \[citing both R2 and R3\] in constructing a new policy for promoting health equity \[C5\]. 

 <ins>Impact 2 – Impact on practitioners and professional services</ins> 

 The research has resulted in a collection of evidence that can be used by practitioners in support of their research and funding bids, particularly during the COVID\-19 pandemic, which has created an opportunity for organisations to make the case for community\-based organisational responses to recovery \[C2, C9, C10\]. 

 The social enterprise sector has drawn upon the research to lobby government for policy changes, including wider recognition of the role of social enterprise in addressing health inequalities in Scotland \[C6, C7\]. The Chief Executive of Social Enterprise Networks Scotland \(SENScot\) remarked upon how “we didn’t have a robust evidence base of the real impact of social enterprise activity and its cumulative impact as a force for good … we needed a better evidence base, which the CommonHealth programme gave us…it was then about bringing evidence from there to support my message \[at Government Committee Meetings\]”. With the support of the research, the sector was able to argue for better recognition of the health and well\-being impacts of social enterprises within Government, thus bolstering arguments for the ten\-year strategy \[C1, C10\] and subsequent Action Plan \[C3\]. 

 A board member of Scottish Communities for Health and Well\-being, an alliance of 75 community\-led organisations dedicated to promoting and delivering health improvements and reducing health inequalities in many of Scotland’s poorest communities, have been running a national campaign and lobbying for greater government recognition for the third sector in generating health and well\-being impacts. The research findings from the CommonHealth project supported their arguments in securing investment from the National Lottery, and as a direct result of using these arguments to bolster their own, they were able to secure investment worth £1.5m to widen the scope of their work and expand their reach to 5,400 people and anticipate securing a further £1m to reach an additional 3,500 people \[C8\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Cambridge’s Energy Policy Research Group \(EPRG\) has played an important role in energy market reform in the UK and China. The Group’s study, led by Professor Michael Pollitt, underpinned the announcement by National Grid in 2017 to create an independent system operator legally unbundled from their transmission asset business. The research also proposed and supported adjustments to National Grid’s \(NG\) transmission arrangements, in particular the rationalisation of their procurement of electricity security of supply products. These developments bring benefits to consumers through improved energy market function, allow for greater accountability, and provide savings of up to GBP8,000,000,000 per year. The group has extended these insights to China, informing its power sector reform, both at regional and national levels. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This research began with a historical analysis of independent system operators in the energy sector, written for the GB water regulator, Ofwat, in the context of their desire to separate retail and network operations.  A key focus of the work examined the boundary between transmission level system operation of the electricity sector and the transmission asset ownership. In \[ **R1**\] Pollitt discussed U.S. experience with multiple transmission asset ownership combined with wide area transmission system operation in electricity. It proposed that this arrangement includes an independent system operator \(ISO\) responsible for coordination and market facilitation, separate from generation, transmission, distribution and retail entities. Further, the paper argued that this experience of separation of the true monopoly of system coordination from the contestable market in building and operating transmission lines \(or non\-line alternatives\), should be taken seriously in other jurisdictions, including the UK. 

 A related research paper \[ **R2**\], written for the GB energy regulator, Ofgem, subsequently discussed how the electricity transmission arrangements in GB needed to change in the light of increasing conflicts between competing and un\-coordinated arrangements for the facilitation of transmission capacity for a high renewables electricity system. Making a point close to that in the paper written for Ofwat, it argued that an ISO was likely to provide the best long run solution to resolving the current conflicts of interest inherent in the role of NG as system operator for GB, onshore transmission asset owner monopolist in England and a competitor in UK offshore transmission auctions. 

 The need for an ISO and the related update to existing transmission arrangements were not the only challenges faced by the electricity market structure in GB. With the increased need for electricity storage as part of a broader transformation of electricity supply in GB, it appeared that the system operator’s \(NG\) provision of electricity quality products was no longer adequate or efficient. Research paper \[ **R3**\], written as part of an EPSRC project on future business models for electricity storage, focused precisely on that issue. It discussed how frequency response \(FR\) markets could be rationalised into a single auction, rather than involving the multiple FR products that National Grid currently procures. 

 These insights and developments from the UK and other international markets were suitably adapted and extended to inform China’s power sector reform in the context of the recent round of electricity reform, which began following publication of the March 2015 No.9 document by the State Council. Research paper \[ **R4**\], written as part of an ESRC Global Challenges Research Fund Award, discussed the applicability of international experience of power market liberalisation – summarised in 14 different lessons – in the Chinese context. Research paper \[ **R5**\] written as part of an ESRC Impact Acceleration Award, summarises much of Lewis Dale \(Regulation and Strategy Manager from NG\) and Pollitt’s advice to Chinese stakeholders on the mechanics of industrial electricity price formation in the UK. The paper breaks down each of the price elements – wholesale, retail, network and levies and taxes are determined \(and by whom\) in a ‘competitive’ power market. 

 *“Reforming the Chinese Electricity Supply Sector: Lessons from Global Experience”* \[ **R6**\], draws on the outputs of a three\-year research programme based on the interactions of Chinese and British power market professionals, facilitated by the British Embassy in Beijing. The book seeks to provide lessons for China’s reforms from international experience, combining a detailed review of reform lessons from around the world, a specific application to China and a particular focus on how exactly the industrial price of electricity is determined in a liberalized power system. Pollitt has engaged with Chinese academics at a range of institutions during frequent visits to China and is currently organising a special issue of a journal written by Chinese scholars about power market reform in China.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The EPRG at the University of Cambridge actively engages in the dissemination of its research and uptake by relevant stakeholders through its Energy Policy Forum, which runs events such as seminars and conferences and stakeholder visits and dinners. The group has been ranked number eight among Global Top Energy and Resource Policy Think Tanks in 2018 and 2019 in a report by the University of Pennsylvania. 

 <ins>The Creation of an Independent System Operator in the UK Energy Market</ins> 

 In the UK energy market, the role of National Grid \(NG\) is highly significant. NG was a founder member of the EPRG’s Energy Policy Forum in 2005. Since that time Pollitt and his team at the University of Cambridge have been a ‘critical friend’ to the organisation and have examined their monopoly role in the GB electricity system \[ **R2**\]. NG value the close relationship that EPRG has with the GB electricity regulator, Ofgem, which has also led to Pollitt writing policy documents for them \(drawing on \[ **R1**\] and published as \[ **R2**\]\). According to NG’s Regulation and Strategy manager, the relationship with EPRG has proved valuable in broadening its perspectives including Pollitt’s research highlighting the benefits of an independent system operator when NG had long seen the advantages of maintaining integration. \[ **S1**\]. 

 The publication \[ **R2**\] prompted a review of system operation by the regulator. In August 2015, Pollitt, was invited to meet with the then new Secretary of State, Amber Rudd, at Department of Energy and Climate Change \(DECC\) \(now Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\)\), the department responsible for energy. As noted by her then special advisor, at this meeting, Pollitt’s articulation of the ISO proved convincing to the department prompting NG to announce the creation of a legally unbundled electricity system operator, wholly separate from their transmission asset business: *‘Michael pitched his number one recommendation: the establishment of an independent system operator. After the meeting, the Secretary of State said “yes, we should do this”*.’ \[ **S2**\]. The announcement was made in a joint statement from UK BEIS and Ofgem in 2018 \[ **S3**\]. 

 On 1 April 2019 NG created a legally separate system operation business \[ **S4**\]. The benefits of creating a more flexible electricity system have been estimated at up to GBP8,000,000,000 per year \(this analysis is based on the scenarios done for the Committee on Climate Change\) \[ **S5**\]. They include greater accountability through a more decentralised system focused on customers \[ **S4**\]. It is anticipated that from this process the ISO could separate ownership from NG in the future \[ **S6**\]. 

 <ins>Impact on Procurement Rationalisation by National Grid</ins> 

 Pollitt’s continued collaboration with National Grid has supported their efforts to rationalise procurement of electricity security of supply products. Pollitt highlighted some of the trade\-offs inherent to the procurement of such services \(confirmed by \[ **S1**\]\). At a meeting in April 2016 he first presented his work on the re\-design of frequency response markets \[ **R3**\], whereby ancillary services markets \(worth around GBP1,000,000,000 p.a. as estimated in the Monthly Balancing Services Summary 2019\-20 March 2020, published by National Grid ESO\) could be simplified into a smaller number of auctions \(for example, 1 instead of 3 for frequency response\). These results and recommendations were taken up and in June 2017 NG published their ‘System Needs and Product Strategy’ document \[ **S7**\] which explicitly acknowledged the need to simplify the number of ancillary services products and set a timetable for trialling new auction designs. More competitive auctions have a track record of substantial cost reduction, relative to business as usual, and could reduce ancillary service costs by the order of 50%. Pollitt and colleagues at the EPRG have been working with NG since then to better facilitate the rapid increase in renewable electricity generation \[ **S1**\]. 

 <ins>Impact on the Chinese Power Sector: wholesale power markets and support for renewables</ins> 

 Since 2015, the EPRG has been working with the British Embassy in Beijing to support their efforts to assist the Chinese government in reforming the Chinese power sector. As the largest power sector in the world it produces around 8% of global greenhouse gases.  It is now trying to introduce competitive wholesale power markets and efficient renewable support mechanisms, drawing on UK and other international experience. A common issue for both systems is how to reduce emissions at least cost. In a quote collated by the British Embassy in Beijing, the Director of the Strategy Department, Guangdong Power Exchange remarked: *“The reports done by Prof. Pollitt after his visit…provided to us valuable information and guidance to the design of Guangdong’s power market model.""* \[ **S8**\] 

 As part of this collaboration, the EPRG approached NG to become involved. Over a sustained period, members of EPRG and NG have visited China in order to advise: the NEA \(Chinese regulator\), State Grid Company of China, China Southern Grid, leading generators and new retail companies. To facilitate the exchange, EPRG subsequently published \[ **R4**\] and \[ **R5**\] in Chinese, with the support of the British Embassy in Beijing. 

 China’s National Reform and Development Commission \(NDRC\) cited Cambridge University support for power market reform specifically around transmission and distribution system regulation in a press release in 2017 \[ **S9**\], published during the 19<sup>th</sup> Communist Party Congress. The NDRC is responsible for setting prices in energy, transport, medicine and a range of other sectors across China. The report acknowledges engagement with UK authorities at several points and outlines the adoption of specific UK regulatory practices for transmission and distribution pricing. Cambridge University experts are acknowledged alongside energy regulator Ofgem, National Grid and the UK BEIS. It is significant that the acknowledgement is made in a report during a period of heightened political sensitivity as part of the party congress. 

 Pollitt has been on eight Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) supported trips to China since 2016 and met a large number of policy makers and stakeholders in six provinces. The EPRG has supported several FCO visits to the UK by Chinese delegations on power market reform. This has been appreciated by many key stakeholders. As evidenced earlier, by those heading up market design \(see earlier remarks from the Director of the Strategy Department, Guangdong Power Exchange\) \[ **S8**\]. But also by influential media, as evidenced by the three times Pollitt was interviewed by Energy Observer \(in 2017, 2018 and 2019\) \[ **S10**\], an influential energy media and think tank associated with China Southern Grid which has a wide readership across government, industry and academics.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Poor safety culture is a causal factor in serious aviation accidents. LSE research has informed the development of a methodology for systematically measuring safety culture in the European Air Traffic Management \(ATM\) industry. The methodology has been used by EUROCONTROL \(the European ATM network manager\) to monitor and improve safety management across the European ATM industry, being applied to measure and develop safety culture in more than 30 European Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSPs\). Combined, these ANSPs operate in most European countries, employ over 50,000 staff, and coordinate up to 30,000 flights daily. The methodology has subsequently been used to measure safety culture and generate institutional change at UK airports \(e.g. Luton\) and major airlines \(e.g. EasyJet\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Safety culture refers to the norms and practices for how risk is managed within an organisation. In a strong safety culture, employees and managers agree on the importance of safety and this is instantiated into everyday practices such as incident reporting, teamwork, training, and resourcing. Where such practices are absent, the ability of management and employees to identify, discuss, and ameliorate threats to safety is degraded. Impacts described here are associated with the development of a methodology for measuring and improving safety culture in European Air Traffic Management \(ATM\). ATM relates to the safe navigation of aircraft through airspaces. In Europe there are approximately 40 Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSPs\) employing over 50,000 staff and coordinating up to 30,000 flights a day \(15,000 post\-COVID\). Although effective safety management is key to ATM, mid\-air collisions in 2001 \(Milan Linate\) and 2002 \(Überlingen\) revealed serious problems in the safety culture of European ANSPs. In 2003, EUROCONTROL responded to this by launching a major programme for measuring, establishing, and improving safety culture in European ATM. 

 Safety culture research had traditionally focused on measuring culture qualitatively or through generic surveys, and within single companies, industries, or countries. Conversely \- and uniquely \- the EUROCONTROL project specified a highly international and practice\-focused approach, capturing the complexity and highly technical nature of work in ATM. It was initially established in 2006 as a collaboration between EUROCONTROL and the University of Aberdeen, where Reader was employed and worked on the project. When he moved to LSE in 2010, the project and collaboration with EUROCONTROL came with him. EUROCONTROL were co\-creators and full partners in developing the methodology during work at Aberdeen and LSE. The project aimed to develop the first safety culture model and measurement tool for: 

1.  identifying the core components of a “safe culture” within the unique domain of ATM; 

1.  facilitating in\-depth and meaningful analysis of the strengths and critical areas for development within an ANSP safety management system \(SMS\); and 

1.  reliably measuring safety culture across different national contexts. This is essential to ensuring the validity and comparability of safety culture data between ANSPs and creating a common set of values and practices for managing safety in European ATM. This consistency is important for the safe navigation of aircraft across Europe. 

 The resulting safety culture methodology was developed through a systematic literature review, and interviews and focus groups with safety managers and front\-line ATM staff in different countries. It was initially designed and piloted at the University of Aberdeen in work led by Dr Kathryn Mearns and supported by Reader. Then, and led by Reader, research subsequently conducted at LSE has included further development of the methodology \(e.g. the addition of new survey questions, refined theoretical underpinnings, reporting, and benchmarking analyses\) and testing of aspects such as its questionnaire structure and psychometric properties. Reader also established the methodology in different cultural settings to facilitate the critical element of comparison and monitoring of culture data between ANSPs. As the ATM network manager, EUROCONTROL led the application of the methodology in ANSPs across Europe. 

 The project’s first output was published in 2013 using data collected from 2006\-2008 and reported on the initial development of the safety culture methodology **\[1\]**. This involved the design and application of a bespoke \(rather than generic\) questionnaire capturing practices essential for safety management in air traffic control across ANSPs in four countries. It further developed a six\-dimension conceptual model of safety culture, used for parsing and exploring these practices in focus groups, interviews, and discussions with executives to interpret the culture and generate recommendations for improvement. The conceptual model was underpinned by both top\-down analysis \(using safety culture theory to design and interpret survey items\), and bottom\-up assessment of survey responses \(involving exploratory and then confirmatory statistical factor analysis\). It is outlined below. 

| **Dimension** | **Definition** | **Relevance for safety management** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Management commitment to safety | Extent to which management prioritise safety | Influences employee beliefs on the prioritisation of safety within an ANSP |
| Collaborating for safety | Group attitudes and activities for safety management | Extent to which there is a norm for coordinating amongst ANSP staff on safety |
| Incident reporting | Extent to which ANSP staff believe it is safe to report safety incidents | Essential for identifying system weaknesses and learning |
| Communication | Extent to which staff are informed about safety\-related issues in the ATM system | Important for ensuring staff are aware of system or institutional changes that impact operations |
| Safety support | Availability of resources and information for safety management | Indicates active support within the institution for maintaining safety |
| Colleague commitment to safety | Beliefs about the reliability of colleagues’ safety\-related behaviour | Highlights reliability of ANSP staff for engaging in safety critical activities |

 The second output, published in 2015 **\[2\]**, reports on the widespread application and testing of this six\-dimension model in ANSPs in different cultural contexts. It used data collected from 2011\-2013 from air traffic controllers \(n = 5,176\) and managers \(n = 1,230\) in 17 countries. This was essential for ensuring that the model outlined above could be used reliably to interpret survey responses in different countries. Work published in **\[2\]** supported its use as a single conceptual model to explain, interpret, and benchmark safety culture in ANSPs across Europe in ways that allow the identification of both best practices and emerging problems. Additional research with 13,000 employees in 21 ATM centres found that safety culture is determined, in part, by national norms for uncertainty avoidance \(the extent to which people in a society are comfortable with uncertainty\) **\[3\]** and power distance \(tendencies for challenging authority\) **\[4\]**. These findings are significant because they show that safety culture can be shaped by factors outside of managerial control; as such, work to improve safety needs to be tailored to different national environments. 

 Together, this research has delivered a novel system for benchmarking and ensuring organisational learning on safety culture, which controls for the structural influence of national culture on safety culture perceptions and practices. By developing and applying theoretical and methodological principles on safety culture and psychometric measurement, a methodology has been developed that is customised for ensuring safety within the critical global ATM industry. That methodology has both supported new relationships between academia and industry \(notably with EUROCONTROL\) and been used to pioneer new areas of academic research \(particularly on the role of safety culture in international and highly technical industries\). It now represents the standard for measuring safety culture in ATM and has subsequently been adapted to the wider airline industry **\[5\] \[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The safety culture methodology described above is standardised, fully tested, and free for ANSPs to use. Its application has supported one of the largest ever international and industry\-wide programmes of safety culture assessment and development, as recognised in the project’s receipt of the 2014 Chartered Institute of Ergonomics & Human Factors Presidents’ Award **\[A\]**. The methodology has been used in over 30 European ANSPs, with more than 30,000 survey respondents and 1,000\+ focus group participants **\[3\]**. Since it was first established in the literature, the methodology **\[1\]** has been applied in over 20 ANSPs. LSE has helped ANSPs to run the survey and analyse data, while EUROCONTROL has used the findings of this in work with ANSPs to develop their safety culture. Through these processes, the methodology has had impacts on individual ANSPs, the ATM industry as a whole, and the wider aviation sector. It is also beginning to deliver impacts in other industries \(e.g. financial services\). 

 **ANSP\-level impacts:** the safety culture methodology helps organisations to identify both strengths and areas for development in safety management. Since 2013, its application has had wide\-ranging impacts on participating ANSPs, supporting improvements against the six thematic dimensions set out in the conceptual model published in **\[1\]**. Illustrative examples of such impacts are outlined here. These impacts, occurring from 2013 to 2020, have been collected from a sample of seven of the 30 ANSPs using the methodology. Those seven ANSPs run between 150,000 and two million flights annually in countries across Europe \(XXX\). All impacts summarised here are described further in a draft EUROCONTROL White Paper **\[B**, pp. 12\-18 **\]**. Changes were realised across all of the ANSPs in the six thematic areas of the conceptual model; e.g. improving incident reporting and management commitment to safety. However, the methodology allows specific changes in pursuit of these broader thematic improvements to vary according to the needs of different ANSPs. Examples of the sorts of specific changes used to achieve thematic improvements are outlined below. Some of these were widely applied \(e.g. improved communication on safety, improving incident reporting\), whilst others \(e.g. relating to executive activities, investments in safety\) were limited to specific ANSPs **\[B**, pp. 12\-18 **\]**. 

 *Management commitment to safety.* Changes to support the instantiation and emphasis of management priorities on safety include: increasing the focus on safety in organisational decision\-making; executive board meetings with explicit focus on safety; employing more safety specialists; and strategies for emphasising management commitment to safety \(e.g. safety\-focused CEO videos, walkarounds, town hall meetings, etc.\). 

 *Collaborating for safety*. To improve team\-working on safety, ANSPs reported changes including: ensuring technical staff are represented in safety decision\-making groups; increasing staff participation in safety activities; safety training for non\-operational staff; and regular workshops for safety managers and controllers to share perspectives. 

 *Incident reporting.* ANSPs report: developing new voluntary and proactive reporting tools for capturing safety information; introducing annual training for incident investigators; changing organisational departments leading incident investigations; and developing policies for ensuring incidents are investigated fairly \(e.g. using independent investigators\). One large ANSP with 500,000\+ flights annually reported increases of up to 80% in incident reporting, alongside significant improvements in the quality of information gathered on errors and safety problems. 

 *Communication.* Changes include: publishing a clear overview of safety roles and responsibilities in their organisation; constant and clear communication on changes in the safety management system; and promotion of work and changes by the safety team. 

 *Safety support.* ANSPs report: increasing resources and staffing for managing safety; a focus on reducing fatigue amongst controllers \(e.g. through improving rota systems\); and ensuring safety is explicitly considered in change management, procurement, and project management. 

 *Colleague commitment to safety* was not identified as a concern in the sample. 

 **ATM industry\-level impact:** the application of the methodology throughout European ATM has helped prioritise and support the development of a coordinated approach to safety culture across Europe. The majority of European ANSPs have used the methodology. Many also participate in an annual safety culture workshop hosted by EUROCONTROL and attended by LSE researchers, at which they share approaches both to developing organisational safety culture and to addressing industry\-wide challenges such as fatigue management **\[C\]**. For EUROCONTROL, the methodology provides a mechanism to engage ANSPs on the topic of safety culture, to benchmark and monitor that culture, and to make recommendations for improving safety at both ANSP and industry levels **\[B\]**. 

 CEOs of ANSPs using the methodology \(including four of the seven contributors to **\[B\]**\) state that the assessment process has helped them to recognise safety culture as “ *the bedrock*” of operations within ANSPs, as a “ *business imperative*”, and “ *the compass which shows your current position so that you can reach your desired destination*” **\[D\]**. They argue that safety culture enables them to drive change from the top of the organisation and report that information sharing on safety has improved drastically. Many ANSPs now conduct their own safety culture surveys and workshops, with some \(such as XXX and XXX\) using the methodology described here. Others, such as XXX, draw upon the methodology to develop their own approaches **\[B**, pp. 26 **\]**. The scientific, coordinated, and collaborative approach of using the methodology in European ATM has contributed to safety culture featuring prominently on ANSP websites and communications, including reporting on the safety culture surveys in high\-level corporate strategy documents or annual reports **\[E\]**. 

 **Aviation\-industry impact:** the methodology developed for ATM has been adapted and extended to the wider aviation system. In cooperation with the European Cockpit Association \(ECA; the Union for European Pilots\), the safety culture survey has been customised to measure safety culture across the airline industry. In 2016, a sample of 7,000 pilots from more than 30 airlines completed the survey, run by LSE and ECA. This was the largest ever engagement of pilots on safety culture. The results, reported in **\[5\]**, provided crucial new insight on issues such as zero\-hour contracts and ineffective fatigue management. Those insights catalysed and informed MEPs’ questions on Europe’s “Ultra\-safe aviation industry” **\[F\]**; further investigation by the European Commission into the working conditions of airline crews **\[G\]**; and European Aviation Safety Agency recommendations on fatigue management **\[H\]**. 

 Major airlines have also used the insights generated through their use of the safety culture survey to improve their own safety management. EasyJet, for example, made changes in its schedules and rosters, delivered new training, and created a pilot\-peer support programme following its first use of the safety culture survey **\[I\]**. 

 The survey is also being used to measure safety culture across the entire aviation system at specific sites such as Luton Airport **\[6\]** and Bristol Airport; in 2021, discussions are ongoing to extend this to other airports \(e.g. XXX\). Luton Airport, for example, was surveyed by EUROCONTROL and LSE in 2016 **\[6\]**. Here, the methodology has helped to develop a more harmonised approach to managing safety by bringing together 15 different organisations within the aviation system. The “Luton Safety Stack” pulls together airport, ATM, airline, and ground handling staff to help manage safety across interfaces. Improvement has been supported by regular workshops between these various organisations on topics such as improving communication and learning from incidents, and through the use of self\-managed surveys \(based on that developed at LSE\) to improve coordination between them **\[J\]**. This approach led to a revision of procedures for improving the safety of ground handling at Luton airport. Improvements associated with this were recognised by a 2018 award from the International Air Transport Association **\[K\]**. 

 **Impacts in other industries:** impacts of the safety culture methodology are now also being felt in industries outside ATM. It has been used by the Financial Conduct Authority to shape thinking \(for both the regulator and firms\) on how to effectively conceptualise, measure, and manage culture in the financial industry **\[L\]**. The OECD has also used the methodology as a framework for investigating the extent to which workers in regulated entities think behavioural insights principles would be effective in promoting safety behaviours. It has been applied in this context to develop a toolkit for improving safety culture at: the National Energy Board in Canada; Agency for Safety, Energy and Environment in Mexico; Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Ireland; and Authority of Electricity Regulation, Oman **\[M\]** **\[N\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The expansion and secure transmission of large\-scale offshore wind energy is likely to require direct current \(DC\) high\-voltage electrical grids. Research undertaken at the University of Aberdeen High Voltage Direct Current \(HVDC\) research centre, led by Professor Jovcic, has demonstrated the advantages of building DC offshore grids using DC/DC converters designed in his research projects. Building on this research, Jovcic has contributed to the development of influential documents via the establishment of working group B4.76 in the International Council on Large Electric Systems \(CIGRE \- a leading organisation, which informs decision\-makers and regulators\). The team’s research has underpinned the implementation of a hardware prototype DC/DC converter for Réseau de Transport d'Électricité \(RTE\) in Europe and shaped the development of a CIGRE DC grid benchmark system, used around the world including in Norway and China. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The International Energy Agency predicts that wind will become Europe’s number one source for power generation by 2027, and European Green Deal estimates that European offshore renewable energy capacity needed by 2050 is 240\-450GW, mostly located 100\-200km from the shore. Existing onshore power networks are based on AC, which can only be used offshore over relatively short distances \(tens of kilometres\).  High voltage Direct Current \(HVDC\) is considered suitable for the transmission of power over long distances, but needs to be substantially further developed to facilitate high\-reliability, meshed, offshore DC grids. The technologies for DC circuit interruption and DC/DC voltage transformation at high powers do not exist, and their perceived costs present a major barrier to uptake by industry. 

 The Aberdeen HVDC research centre has attracted significant external funding to develop high gain, GW\-scale DC/DC converters, which will be one of the building blocks in the development of a multi\-terminal HVDC network in the North Sea. Jovcic has developed new DC/DC converter topologies, which offer benefits in terms of efficiency, reliability, and cost compared to the alternatives. In collaboration with colleagues at McGill University, he evaluated the potential benefits of DC/DC conversion over traditional methods of offshore wind energy integration and found that a DC collection grid using DC/DC converters would allow a substantial reduction in the weight of the cables and magnetic components \[1\]. 

 This research led to a new project, sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\), to investigate the feasibility of developing the DC/DC converter technology \[P1\]. The designed converter achieves current regulation even under extreme external DC faults and, therefore, can operate through DC faults \[2\]. In the subsequent EPSRC research project \[P2\], together with 3 Chinese institutions and the University of Strathclyde, Jovcic’s research team evaluated applications in DC grids and developed 30kW prototypes in Aberdeen \[3\] and at the Chinese grid operator site, thereby increasing confidence in the technology. The hardware results have confirmed the technology’s techno\-economic advantages over other DC/DC systems studied worldwide, and removed perceived barriers related to losses and feasibility of DC/DC at high power levels. 

 In parallel to \[P2\], Jovcic was also awarded a starting grant under the FP7 Ideas programme by the European Research Council \[P3\] to develop modelling tools for designing high\-power, multi\-terminal DC grids. Additionally, through this project, the DC/DC concept is expanded towards advanced multi\-port converters \(hub or electronic substation\), resulting in a converter with the ability to operate normally through DC faults on any single port \[4\]. The findings attracted the attention of French company RTE, Europe’s largest grid operator. RTE have an interest in utilising DC grids as the means to connect numerous offshore wind farms in the Mediterranean and the North Sea with the French electricity transmission system. Based on the findings, RTE provided funding for a new project \[P4\], which compared a range of DC transmission options, concluding that the use of DC/DC converters may enhance operating flexibility and power security while keeping costs and power losses competitive \[5\]. 

 With increasing interest from industry, the HVDC Research Centre began an initiative in 2013 to explore the use of modern modular multilevel converter \(MMC\) technologies for building DC hubs. With this aim, a new project was subsequently funded by Scottish grid operator, SSE \(Scottish and Southern Energy\) \[P5\]. Through the SSE\-proposed MMC DC hub test case, the team has shown an acceptable frequency range for onshore and offshore applications, considering detailed loss, weight, and harmonic analysis \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Wind energy is expected to be the primary source of electrical energy by 2027, necessitating an increase in the pace of the renewable energy buildout. Considering the expected cost, in excess of GBP100,000,000 per gigawatt \(GW\) DC/DC converter, development of these technologies relies on scaled\-down hardware prototypes, and simulation on full\-power test cases and Benchmark models agreed with all stakeholders. Upscaling of these prototypes requires a long lead time and considerable investment. Research carried out at the University of Aberdeen has yielded important new evidence demonstrating the potential role for DC/DC converters in future offshore DC transmission grids. 

 The acceptance of new technologies is conditional on studies and consensus in international working groups, largely in the CIGRE community. CIGRE is the most influential international professional organisation in the power transmission industry, bringing together global expertise \(manufacturers, grid operators, and developers\) and is the authoritative source of power system technical reference documents. CIGRE activities \(WG meetings, brochures, articles, conferences, green books\) have substantial weight in the professional community in defining best practice, professional methods, in system planning and policy making, while brochures serve as de\-facto standards. 

 **Informing best practice and building confidence in the technology** 

 Within the current REF period, Jovcic was an invited member of and representative of the UK in CIGRE WG \(Working Group\) B4.58, “Control Methodologies for Direct Voltage and Power Flow in a Meshed HVDC Grid” from 2013\-2017. The findings, resulting from Aberdeen research on DC/DC converters were used as technical background for Chapter 5 of brochure 699 \(B4.58\) \[S1\] and were also employed as test cases based on research projects \[P1, P2, P3\] and results in \[1\-5\]. This technical brochure represents an important attempt to provide international consensus on the requirements, classification and description of methodologies for direct voltage control and power flow control in a meshed HVDC grid. The working group affirmed that DC grids are feasible, enabling planning to move to the next stage, including more detailed component and system studies. 

 Jovcic, as WG B4.58 representative, participated in the development of a CIGRE DC grid benchmark test system, supported by two CIGRE working groups \(B4.57 and B4.58\), which is based on topology and parameters agreed by wider industry in CIGRE. In this regard, a DC grid benchmark model can provide a common reference and study platform for researchers to compare the performance and characteristics of different DC control functions and protection strategies \[S2\]. This model has become the primary DC grid test system, providing a common reference platform employed in most EU Horizon2020 research/demonstration projects on DC power transmission grids, allowing researchers to compare the performance and characteristics of a DC grid with different DC control functions and protection strategies. Major operators have used the model including SINTEF, the Norwegian grid operator \[S8i\] and the State Grid Corporation of China, which is the largest utility company in the world \[S8ii\]. EU projects that have used the model to address research challenges include Best Paths \(2014\-2018\), which used the model to analyse the impact of various conditions on the degree of coupling of different subsystems in an interconnected AC/MT\-HVDC system  \( [http://www.bestpaths\-project.eu/](http://www.bestpaths-project.eu/)\) and MEDOW \(Multi\-terminal DC grid for offshore wind; 2013\-2017\) to demonstrate a scaling method, which has potential for further development in order to achieve uniform dynamic responses between experimental test rig and HVDC system. \( [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/317221](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/317221),  [http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/medow/](http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/medow/)\) \[S9\]. 

 **Establishing and chairing B4.76 CIGRE working group** 

 Jovcic recognised early on that there would be a necessity for DC\-DC converters, which do not currently exist at transmission level, in order to build the safe, flexible and economical offshore DC transmission systems necessary for integration of 100s of GW of offshore energy in projects \[P1\-P5\]. By 2017, the research and development of GW\-scale DC/DC converters had advanced to a point where it was considered technically feasible but coordinated work across the professional community was needed for the acceptance of this new technology. To meet this need, in 2017 Jovcic submitted a proposal to establish a new Working Group on DC/DC converters in the CIGRE B4 study committee, which was approved under the title: B4.76, “DC\-DC converters in HVDC Grids and for connections to HVDC systems” and Prof Jovcic was appointed WG chairman \[S3\]. 

 CIGRE working group B4.76, consisting of 15 members and 5 corresponding members from 7 countries, provided the initial recommendation for high power test DC\-DC converter based on non\-isolated approach. While worldwide manufacturers have their own preferred topology for non\-isolated DC\-DC, commonly IP protected and only some reported in public, the developed test case is vendor\-neutral but represents functionalities and performance acceptable for all vendors \(manufacturers members of B4.76 included ABB, Siemens and Mitsubishi\). In June 2019, Jovcic and members of the B4.76 working group \(including representatives from ABB and Supergrid Institute\) presented a CIGRE paper \[S10\] outlining the topology, test system parameters, performance and models  for the CIGRE DC\-DC test converter. The DC\-DC test case enables DC grid developers to perform studies on a single DC\-DC model, with the understanding that conclusions will be largely valid for DC\-DC supplied by various vendors. The design study in \[S10\] further illustrates CIGRE expert consensus that the non\-isolated DC/DC converter will have an overall semiconductor count comparable to an AC/DC converter of similar rating, which provides the first credible estimates for the system costs, size and weight and therefore reduces concerns relating to cost\-effectiveness. 

 This case study forms a basis of technical work in B4.76, which includes a further isolated DC\-DC test case developed on similar principles. The working group completed work in 2020 and a technical brochure 827 \[S4\] was released in March, 2021. This technical brochure includes a comprehensive survey of all worldwide DC\-DC manufacturers, conducted in 2019 \(5 responses were received\). The responses present manufacturers views on the expected application areas, deployment, functionalities, technologies and readiness level, and these responses are provided in full in the Appendix of the brochure. They give first\-hand information to DC grid developers and planners on the technologies under development. 

 **Influencing decision making and strategic objectives of EU grid operator** 

 As part of their 2017\-2020 R&D programme, RTE indicated that their Research and Development \(R&D\) activities had oriented towards ‘improving performance and securing its technical choices, including increasing the transmission capacity of cables, qualifying new technologies to master their impacts before deploying them on an industrial scale’. Towards meeting these objectives, RTE initiated a project that incorporated the Aberdeen DC/DC converter \[P4\] into a European laboratory DC grid prototype project at École Centrale de Lille, financed and operated by RTE \[S7\]. In 2017, in collaboration with Jovcic and Hajian, Spanish university UPC \(Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, BarcelonaTech\) was contracted by RTE to build the 10\-kW Aberdeen converter under a license agreement. The confirmation of performance and benefits of this demonstrator have been shared in a 2017 publication \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In South Africa, both middle\-class and welfare\-dependent people borrow heavily to meet their own and their dependents’ expectations. Many have no cash reserves and no investments. The net result of this borrowing has been unsustainable levels of debt. A core objective of the South African Government’s National Development Plan is to reduce inequality and eradicate poverty by creating better employment opportunities underpinned by stronger education, while also ensuring financial stability. Research by Deborah James at LSE has contributed to this agenda, particularly by demonstrating the unforeseen consequences of indebtedness and helping to expose and tackle the unregulated plundering of salary earners’ accounts by unsecured lenders and loan sharks. The research has enhanced employers’ awareness of debt problems \(including illicit garnishee orders\) and informed debates about how best to address these. It has further informed policy discussions about credit and financial regulations that affect welfare beneficiaries, as well as enhancing public understanding of these matters. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the 1990s, South Africans have been borrowing extensively to meet their own and their dependents’ needs and expectations. This is true of salaried employees \- members of the “new middle class” \- as well as of welfare recipients. Among the former, many have no cash reserves and no investments; their houses, cars, and other assets are bought entirely with borrowed cash, often to the detriment of precarious monthly budgets. The result has been unsustainable levels of debt. James explored this sharp rise in consumer indebtedness in South Africa \(SA\) in ESRC\-funded work conducted in 2006\-2007. The analysis was developed in conversation with South African interlocutors, particularly the National Credit Regulator \(a government agency\), Black Sash \(a human rights organisation\), and the University of Pretoria Law Clinic. James published her findings in a 2015 monograph, *Money from Nothing* **\[1\]**, and in a series of related articles **\[2\]**\- **\[6\]**. Subsequent research has been undertaken in discussion with financial services group Alexander Forbes, financial wellbeing firm Summit Financial Partners and, once again, Black Sash. This work has particularly exposed the ways in which lenders and loan sharks have been able to plunder the accounts of salary earners and grant recipients with impunity, through “deductions” **\[5\] \[6\]**. 

 James’ research challenges common assumptions about indebtedness. In **\[1\]**, **\[2\]**, **\[3\]**, and **\[6\]**, she demonstrates how the structures propping up “credit apartheid” in SA disadvantage its victims by enabling creditors to secure repayment with such ease that they have virtually no risk of default. Key mechanisms for this are shown to be the country’s legally\-enshrined “creditor advantage” and the high levels of financial inclusion. Workers’ pay is automatically transferred to their bank accounts at month\-end, and then effortlessly removed from those same accounts by their creditors. This is often achieved by abusing the practice of garnishee or emoluments attachment orders, which legally oblige an employer to enable a creditor to deduct a portion of the debtor’s monthly pay before the employee receives it. Employee “wellness” is then further undermined when indebted employees cash in their pensions to settle their debts **\[1\]**. James underscores the need to tackle these infamous practices by challenging the assumption that lenders have a right to repayment, no matter how reckless their loans, and by pressing for their more effective regulation. 

 She also shows the unexpected ways in which the problem of debt is exacerbated by high levels of unemployment. The few with work are expected to support unemployed relatives and other dependents. Many \- from mine employees to nurses, teachers, and other civil servants \- borrow to meet that expectation **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]**. For them, strategic withdrawal from such obligations is the only way to achieve the more individually viable middle\-class existence to which many aspire, but acting “rationally” in this way requires undercutting the value entailed in social expectation and obligation. Breaking social norms \- even by discussing one’s own debt situation, let alone taking the practical steps required to alleviate it \- can create shame and stigma that many find hugely problematic. Drawing on, and in conversation with, the book *From Debt to Riches* by local self\-help author Phumelele Ndumo, James highlights in **\[1\]** the complex choices facing borrowers. If they recognise the social entanglements in which they are caught and start to take the advice offered by those who understand these contexts, they might jeopardise social relationships and dependencies. Empowering them to reduce their debt therefore cannot be achieved simply through the provision of financial advice or “literacy”. Rather, it requires changes in perceptions of acceptable social norms, the cost of violating such norms, and the benefits of engaging in new behaviours. 

 In **\[1\]** and **\[3\]**, James emphasises the requirement for policymakers to understand the needs and aspirations that lead people into debt. She shows that viewing borrowing as “irrational” \(as financial advisers and economists often do\) misses important aspects of its social underpinnings. Borrowing often has less to do with meeting immediate material needs than with honouring long\-term obligations such as education, housing, and socially valuable connections. As such, it is frequently bound up with complex and deeply\-held ideas of duty, rather than simply representing frivolous consumerism. 

 Finally, James counters the notion that “banking the unbanked” helps people move from “traditional” ways of conducting their financial affairs, such as investing in rotating credit savings clubs, to more “modern” ones like saving money in banks. She shows that, in reality, many people take a more “portfolio” approach, holding savings in and credit from many sources in uneven combinations **\[1\] \[4\] \[5\] \[6\]**. Her research further challenges the idea of the indebted as passive victims of nefarious loan sharks. In **\[1\]** and **\[3\]** she shows that, for those unable to borrow from the banks \- perhaps because they do not have a regular salary or are reliant on welfare payments \- loan sharks represent the best \(and often only\) borrowing option. Informal lending at often high levels of interest is not, moreover, the sole preserve of loan sharks, but practised by a range of actors seeking to supplement their incomes.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Policymakers in South Africa tend to devolve responsibility for reducing debt to borrowers themselves, suggesting that financial advice and “self\-discipline” will solve the problem. The research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[6\]** shows that this approach can work only in combination with other measures, including understanding the needs and aspirations that have led people into debt. The SA Government’s  [National Development Plan](https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/governance/ndp/the-national-development-plan-a-vision-for-2030) \(NDP\) aims to reduce inequality and eradicate poverty by creating better employment opportunities, underpinned by a stronger educational base, and by helping people maintain whatever financial stability they are able to leverage from this growth in employment. While many of these aims have so far proved elusive, James’ research has helped to counter one threat to economic wellbeing; namely,  [consumer indebtedness](https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/governance/services/consumer/debt-270706) and the “reckless lending” that underpins it. Impacts arise from the use of the research by, and in collaborations with, research users and beneficiaries including financial experts, debt activists, lawyers, financial wellness companies, the employer community, and human/consumer rights advocates. 

 **\(a\) Improving awareness of debt problems among employers, pension fund trustees, and financial experts** 

 In 2015, SA financial services company Alexander Forbes sought to support better understanding among their clients of the social context of individuals’ financial decisions. They asked James to contribute to their online *Benefits Barometer* \( *BB*\) tool and an accompanying book, freely available to subscribers to the  [Benefits Barometer blog](http://www.benefitsbarometer.co.za/). The book provides suggestions of workplace solutions for financial wellbeing; it emphasises the need to address individuals’ full financial journey over their lifetime, rather than focussing exclusively on their retirement needs, and to shift toward enhancing financial wellbeing. James’ contribution, summarised key points from **\[1\]** and **\[3\]** in a section dealing with aspiration and indebtedness in South Africa **\[A**, pp. 42\-47 **\]**. 

 To launch *BB,* James accompanied representatives of Alexander Forbes on a tour of four SA cities. In each, she presented findings from **\[1\]** and **\[3\]** on SA employees’ combination of aspiration and indebtedness, emphasising the need for the financial services industry to develop a more nuanced and customised approach to engaging individuals with their own financial wellbeing. Audiences for these presentations came from both local companies and the SA branches of multinationals. Together, they comprised more than 1,000 employers, CEOs, HR professionals, retirement fund trustees, policymakers, and financial consultants. One commented that James had illuminated “ *reasons for debt and where it comes from”*. The same sentiment was echoed by an actuarial analyst, who said he was now better informed about “ *the formal and informal reasons for indebtedness in SA”*; he added that he was newly convinced of the importance of “ *communicating to clients the need to understand the financial situation of their employees”*. An HR analyst from the banking sector said it showed “ *that people’s financial decisions are driven more by non\-financial context than we allow for in the industry”*, and explained that she was now better motivated “ *to highlight these issues in her own work”*. The Chairman of BP Southern Africa, which employs 1,300 people, said he found it “ *interesting that borrowers and lenders are often the same people”*. A finance officer from a manufacturing firm said he had learned that “ *the needs of employees are hugely complex and need to be accepted, not frowned upon”*, while a financial industry consultant said he subsequently had a clearer understanding of the “ *need for responsible banking”* **\[B\]**. These examples of participants’ feedback suggest that James’ presentations improved \- and changed \- their awareness and understanding of the issues addressed in her research and experienced by many of their employees. 

 The effects of the research on smaller\-scale employers may be illustrated by the example of a certified financial planner and CEO of small start\-up, T [hrive Financial Wellness](http://www.thrivefinwell.com/). In 2018, he wrote to James to say that insights from her research had not only prompted him to start his new company, but were now being used by that company in helping him to advise employers addressing employee indebtedness. He further explained the influence of **\[1\]** on his thinking about the consumer debt situation in SA when he was interviewed about employee financial stress on SA Radio 702’s *The Money Show* on 2 March 2018 **\[C\]**. 

 **\(b\) Improving employer understanding of the illicit use of employee garnishee or emoluments attachment orders \(EAOs\)** 

 Findings on SA’s easily\-abused “creditor advantage” legal culture \(presented in **\[1\]**, **\[2\]**, **\[3\]**, and **\[5\]**\) have informed discussion among human rights lawyers and corporations interested in curbing the abuses that lead to or exacerbate employees’ debt problems. In 2016, the Constitutional Court heard a landmark case \( [University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic & others *v* Minister of Justice and Correctional Services & Others](http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2016/32.html)\). This sought confirmation of a 2015 ruling by the High Court \(the highest court in SA\) that several abusive practices relating to the use of EAOs were unconstitutional. Evidence presented in the case included testimony from University of Cape Town economist Nicoli Nattrass about lenders’ illegal use of deductions and their culture of general impunity. Nattrass’ reading of **\[1\]** influenced the testimony she provided **\[D\]**. The Constitutional Court agreed with the High Court and upheld its earlier ruling. Its own ruling emphasised the need for the amount of a garnishee order allowing for automated deductions for debt repayment to be “appropriate”. It further stated that such an order must be issued after everyone is satisfied it is just and equitable. This should then mean that people are not left with less than they need each month to cover their basic reasonable costs **\[E\]**. This ruling, informed by testimony underpinned by James’ research, has potentially far\-reaching implications for the financial wellbeing of employees in SA. 

 **\(c\) Provision of evidence supporting advocacy work** 

 In mid\-2018, James participated in a series of meetings with the CEO and employees of major South African financial services and consumer rights company, Summit Financial Partners \(SFP\), prominent human rights lawyer and advocate, Geoff Budlender, and attorney Odette Geldenhuys, of law firm Webber Wentzel, who had led the evidence in the 2016 Constitutional Court case. The discussions also involved officers of human rights organisation Black Sash, which advocates for a fairer deal for disadvantaged and vulnerable consumers. In these meetings, James drew on her documentation of the legal process relating to garnishee orders, published in **\[1\]** and **\[5\]**. Her publications have thereby underpinned ongoing engagement and further collaboration with researchers, human rights activists, and legal practitioners in SA. These partners have particularly used her research to analyse the ways in which SA’s “advantage to creditor” environment allows lenders to exploit poor communities of welfare beneficiaries. 

 One of the primary offenders in this context was the controversial Net1 company, which in 2012 was awarded a government contract to deliver payments to 17 million welfare recipients. It used its access to banking and biometric technologies to leverage these welfare payments as collateral for the loan and insurance products it sold them. James outlined this situation in a piece co\-authored with David Neves \(University of the Western Cape\) **\[F\]**. Published on *The Conversation* in March 2017, the article exposed the myth that “financial inclusion” is necessarily beneficial, drawing on work published in **\[1\]**\- **\[5\]** to illustrate the high interest rates charged for these loans inaccurately described as “unsecured”. 

 In 2018, Black Sash worked with the SA Government to withdraw the contract from Net1 and award it, instead, to the Post Office. The article **\[F\]** led James into collaborative work with Black Sash on this, exploring whether and to what extent the lending bonanza continued after this switch in provider. In a 2018\-20 project funded by LSE, James and Neves worked with Erin Torkelson \(University of California, Berkley\) and under Black Sash’s guidance to explore the effects of the transfer from Net1. The resulting report **\[G\]** presents case studies of debtor abuse from nine peri\-urban and rural sites identified by Black Sash partner organisations; James covered three of these sites. Even after the handover to the Post Office, many welfare recipients were shown to be unable or unwilling to discontinue their use of the EasyPay cards issued by Net1. They opted to retain the cards and the borrowing they enabled both in the face of social pressures and because they prioritised forms of saving/investment such as rotating credit associations. To make regular payments to these associations, they needed to continue borrowing from EasyPay subsidiary, Moneyline, using electronic transfers. Many combine six\-month loans from formal lenders \- charging an effective interest rate of 30% per month \- with cash loans from informal lenders \(loan sharks\). The latter are taken out mid\-month, often at 50\-80% interest per month.  The report **\[G\]**, which cites both **\[1\]** and **\[4\]**, was debated at an advocacy workshop with Black Sash partner organisations in October 2019. It was published by Black Sash in August 2020 \(after a five\-month delay caused by Covid\-19\) and launched in September 2020 for stakeholders including the National Credit Register \(NCR\), garnering significant media coverage **\[H\]**. 

 Following the launch, James has continued to be involved in meetings with Black Sash as it liaises with the NCR, SA Credit Ombud, and the University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic in pursuing the better regulation \(and reduced cost\) of credit. She is helping to co\-organise workshops with the University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic aimed at redrafting conflicting pieces of credit legislation to provide clarity on the legal parameters; a comparative seminar on the funding of debt advice in other southern countries \(with a view to generating recommendations for a similar scheme in South Africa\); and a consultation with legal experts and others aimed at the redrafting the Black Sash handbook,  [Debt and Credit: a reference guide for paralegals](https://www.blacksash.org.za/images/publications/dcbook.pdf) **\[I\]**. 

 **\(d\) Enhancing public understanding and debate through media** 

 James has shared key research findings widely, especially in SA. The topics she explores were already a matter of concern and featured widely in the SA media. However, her research has contributed to a more nuanced media and public awareness of the complexity and effects of indebtedness. This has been achieved, for example, by her publication of special reports in 2015 for SA weekly newspaper *Mail & Guardian* \(which then had a distribution of \~30,000\), and interviews for  [Cape Talk/Radio 702’s *The Money Show*](http://702.co.za/articles/3098/we-interview-the-author-of-a-book-on-how-access-to-credit-empowers-as-it-enslaves) \(\~400,000 listeners\) and  [Radio 702 by Aubrey Masango](https://soundcloud.com/d-james-443148533/deborah-james-on-radio-702-aubrey-masango) \(\~600,000\-800,000 listeners\) **\[J\]**. **\[F\]** was also republished in SA newspaper, *Business Day*. UK and international coverage in media with large audiences has also helped to extend awareness of these issues beyond SA itself. High\-profile examples include the publication of excerpts from **\[1\]** in *City Press* \(readership \~2.5 million\) and James’ contribution of blog pieces to *The Conversation Africa* \(monthly readership 1.5\-2 million\) **\[J\].** The reach of the research was further extended by James’ provision of expert advice about loan shark practices to the makers of the feature film,  [*For* *Love and Broken Bones*](http://www.dylanlloyd.co.za/for-love-broken-bones), which aired to critical acclaim in SA and won Best Film at the 2015 Portland Film Festival.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The police method of stop and search in Scotland has been subject to dramatic change in its governing legislation, policy and practice which has improved its public accountability and enhanced social justice in policing. Police Scotland has over 17,000 police officers with responsibility for policing across Scotland. In response to research by Drs O’Neill \(Dundee\) and Aston \(Edinburgh Napier University\), Police Scotland has redesigned its database to improve recording and transparency, now publishes its records publicly, has retrained every police officer on their use of stop and search and has ended potentially harmful and unjust practices. From a peak of over 642,000 recorded searches per year in 2013/14, stop and search in Scotland has reduced to just over 41,600 searches in 2019/20 and non\-statutory \(consensual\) searches no longer take place. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In contrast to England and Wales \(where stop and search has been subject to academic, political and public scrutiny for three decades\) there had been very little attention paid to stop and search policy and practice in Scotland. There was also a lack of published data, weak accountability and little oversight of the practice. In 2014, research by Dr Kath Murray \(University of Edinburgh\) highlighted that recorded searches in Scotland increased dramatically from 2005/2006 to 2012/2013 to a rate about four times that of England and Wales. Police Scotland came under intense political and media scrutiny to change its practice. 

 Police Scotland selected ‘P’ Division, the Fife area of Scotland with 828 locally deployed officers, as the site for a stop and search pilot. The pilot was launched in July 2014 and aimed to test new techniques in stop and search, an enhanced database, enhanced crime analysis and more complex community engagement practices. The purpose was to improve the data on which stop and search is based, improve accountability and increase confidence in the police. O’Neill and Aston were commissioned to conduct an independent academic evaluation to review the effectiveness of the pilot, which was co\-funded by The Scottish Institute for Policing Research \(SIPR\) and Police Scotland. O’Neill and Aston were equally responsible for the methodological design – a mixed methods approach – data collection, and analysis. 

  

 Their research found that there was a gap between the perceptions of senior officers in P Division and those of operational officers as to what the pilot was about and what it was meant to achieve. In particular, many officers interviewed had very little detailed knowledge of the pilot or how they were meant to change their stop and search practice **\[R1\]**. This revealed ineffective communication and training in relation to the pilot for both operational officers and their supervisors **\[R2\]**. However, senior officers also discussed the changes in the pilot as being framed as ‘business as usual’, which presented conflicting messages to officers **\[R3\]**. There were also particular practices which research suggested could be ineffective at best and harmful at worst \(see below\) **\[R3\]**. Findings in relation to weak communication, ineffective training, downplaying the significance of the change that was needed and poor practice was to be foundational in the subsequent design of the stop and search reform process in Police Scotland at a national level in 2016\-2017 **\[R4\]**. 

 There were five main findings which led to direct impact: **1.** Data suggested that Police Scotland **end the practice of non\-statutory \(‘consensual’\) searches.** Members of the public found searches embarrassing and detrimental to police\-community relations, and it was ineffective as an investigative tool due to the low success rate in any items being found. **2. Data analytics** could be improved by including contextual information, tracking changes over a longer period \(up to five years rather than year\-on\-year\) as well as tracking multiple searches of individuals. This would better account for the effects of seasonal variation, non\-regular events and indicate where searches are concentrated on a few individuals. **3.** **More robust training** and communication based on face\-to\-face teaching techniques was needed, rather than the online method used in Fife, as there had been little to no impact on the daily practice of officers involved in the pilot. Finally, two initiatives introduced for the pilot were unhelpful and potentially harmful and should be stopped: **4. The** **letter to parents** of children who had been stopped and searched was identified as a potential risk to children in households where interaction with the police is not looked upon favourably. **5. The telephone survey** of people who had been stopped and searched presented methodological and ethical problems, and was a potential risk to the welfare of people discussing searches over the phone, especially during working hours when the calls were conducted. Also, there was a significant amount of staff time spent making calls with no result \(not answered or refused\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The report **\[R1\]** made a total of 19 recommendations for change, all of which have been addressed, and the research on stop and search has led to direct impact in policy and practice for policing in Scotland. This has improved policing in Scotland by making it fairer and more accountable and thus has enhanced social justice in Scotland more generally. 

 In relation to **policy**, O’Neill and Aston have been involved in **a change to legislation governing police powers of stop and search**. Their research **\[R1\]**, as well as that of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary \(HMICS 2015\), recommended an end to non\-statutory searches. The Scottish Government responded by appointing an Independent Advisory Group \(IAG\). The IAG recommended the development of a code of practice and the complete abolishment of non\-statutory stop and search **\[E1\]**. The IAG report cites recommendation 9 \(only statutory searches should be used\) from the research **\[R1\]**. The Scottish Government and Police Scotland accepted the IAG recommendations in full and the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016 was amended accordingly. The amendment places stop and search on a statutory footing, with its use underpinned by a Code of Practice that came into force in May 2017. The research is heavily cited in the IAG report **\[E1\]**, with detailed coverage on pages 66\-67. The QC Solicitor Advocate responsible for leading the IAG confirms the influence of the research on the IAG recommendations: ‘ *Dr Megan O’Neill has been a key contributor to our work. Her research has assisted us from the time of our original review up to the point of finalising the Code of Practice… Dr O’Neill’s work on the Fife Pilot made a significant contribution to our views… While other research and position papers are mentioned in our Report, the Fife Evaluation Report was of particular significance*’ **\[E2\]**. From a peak of over 642,000 recorded searches per year in 2013/14 \(Murray, K; Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research Report No.6/2015\), stop and search in Scotland reduced to just over 41,600 searches in 2019/20 \(Police Scotland stop and search data, online\). Non\-statutory searches no longer take place. 

 **Improving the way data on stop and search is used internally to guide police activity**: Police Scotland has redesigned the stop and search database, and it is now publicly accessible. Although current resources do not allow for tracking multiple searches of any one individual \(as recommended\), manual monitoring of the data reveals where this is happening and the policing area concerned is alerted. In addition, Police Scotland has also developed a data system to assist area commanders when deciding where to deploy officers based on trends in crime and previous searches. O’Neill and Aston have been consulted on the development of this product. These changes to stop and search data have enabled Police Scotland to enhance its transparency and openness with the public. This is confirmed by Police Scotland, Assistant Chief Constable: ‘ *Their work has helped bring about positive changes to the way that we police, which in turn impacts on the communities that we serve as we continue to use stop and search as a valuable tool, but in a way that is lawful, proportionate and accountable, in order to nurture public trust and confidence*.’ **\[E3\]** 

 **Improving stop and search training:** The Fife Pilot used an entirely online training tool that had little impact on officers, many of whom could not remember taking it **\[R1\]**. To facilitate new stop and search practices, all existing officers up to the rank of Inspector, a total of 15,617, have now been retrained on the practice via new face\-to\-face training, and all new recruits receive the same. O’Neill was directly involved in the development of this training and has assessed its delivery. The Fife Pilot evaluation’s findings **\[R1\]** also informed the design of the new stop and search training: ‘ *Police Scotland have developed bespoke training, informed and guided by academic research and learning from the Fife Pilot and its evaluation, which provides specific learning on the impact stop and search can have on children and young people. …Taking the learning from the Fife Pilot Evaluation, the use of language during training and communication is focused on positive engagements and interactions*’ **\[E4\]**. Police Scotland surveys of officers after completion of the training show high rates of satisfaction with it \(98% immediately afterwards and after 6 months 84.5% of officers have high levels of confidence in using stop and search powers\) **\[E4\]**. 

 **Ending unhelpful** **communication with the public**: The research suggested that letters to parents, introduced as part of the Fife pilot, represented potential harm to the children concerned and should not continue. This influenced the position taken by the IAG and the research is cited in the Supplementary Report by the Advisory Group **\[E5\]**. The IAG agreed that the letters were problematic and as such, Police Scotland has ended this practice. 

 The QC refers to this in his letter about the work of the IAG when he says, ‘ *Subsequently, when further consultation took place as recommended in our Report, Dr O’Neill’s work featured again in relation to the issue of searching children for alcohol. This is acknowledged in our Supplementary Report which was issued to accompany the final Code of Practice. It will be seen that we quote directly from the Fife Evaluation Report on the thorny question of intimation to parents*.’ **\[E2\]** 

 The telephone survey of people who have been searched has also been dropped from stop and search governance processes.  The Police Scotland response to the Fife Pilot evaluation \(‘The SIPR Report’\) **\[E6\]** accepted the recommendations: ‘ *Following discussions it was deemed it was not practical for Police Scotland to pursue this any further due to substantial cost implications, inaccurate data through the recording of telephone numbers and lack of qualitative and quantitative responses as observed within the Fife Pilot’*. This has spared members of the public from violations of their privacy and has allowed for redeployment of those resources. 

 By October 2017, all of the report’s 19 recommendations **\[R1\]** had been addressed and this is described in detail in the Police Scotland ‘SIPR report’ response **\[E6\]**. Police Scotland has published three Improvement Plans since June 2015 which track progress against the recommendations of all the stop and search review reports \(HMICS, SPA, IAG, their own review and the Fife evaluation\) **\[E7\]** 

 **Impact beyond the evaluation**: O’Neill and Aston contributed to a number of policing committees including *Police Scotland Research and Evaluation Operational Review Group* \(REORG\) and the *Stop and Search Strategic Group*, to monitor and guide the ongoing reform process **\[E3, E8, E9\]**. Through these, they have been instrumental in building evidence\-based practice in stop and search in Scotland. The Inspector of Constabulary \(HMICS\) explains the impact that their research input has had in improving stop and search policy and practice in Scotland: *‘The research findings, along with Dr O’Neill and Dr Aston’s ongoing engagement with Police Scotland and the SPA… throughout the stop and search improvement journey, and their proposals for further research on the relationship between stop and search with other areas of community policing, local enforcement and prevention has been highly influential. This has led to significant improvements in the use and recording of stop and search activity in Scotland as highlighted in our Audit and Assurance Review of Stop and Search Phase 2 report, published in February 2017*’ **\[E8\]**. 

 **Impact beyond stop and search:** The experience of the stop and search reform process and the related engagement with academic researchers, including O’Neill and Aston, has impacted policing in Scotland more generally. Police Scotland states in the *Improvement Progress Report for the Cabinet Secretary for Justice* \(June 2019\), that, ‘ *The lessons learned throughout the stop and search improvement journey are informing the wider policing approach, with the recent remodelling of Licensing and Violence Reduction Division and National Safer Communities to form a single Safer Communities Business area and provide a collaborative, preventative and evidence based focus across all of the policing priorities*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 The Director of Strategy and Performance at the Scottish Policing Authority \(SPA\) confirms this wider contribution when he writes that: ‘ *During their time as REORG members, Drs O’Neill and Aston have engaged considerably with Police Scotland and the SPA… From the perspective of the SPA, the value of having access to relevant and robust external evidence is being recognised more and more frequently when consideration is being given to organisational change and policy development, and evaluating the effectiveness of change that has been implemented and performance review against outcomes*’ **\[E9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Protecting terrestrial carbon stocks is crucial for reducing the rate of climate change. As one of the most carbon\-dense ecosystems, tropical peatlands are a priority for conservation. Our work led to the discovery and mapping of previously unknown intact peatlands in both Amazonia and Africa. These findings subsequently catalysed the creation of the >35,600 km<sup>2</sup> Yaguas National Park in northern Peru, underpinned the Brazzaville Declaration signed by the Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo governments to protect the 145,500 km<sup>2</sup> of peatlands in the Congo basin, and led to USD 72,800,000 investment in sustainable management across the three countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Reducing the rate of climate change requires the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystem carbon stocks. Tropical peatlands are a priority for protection as they contain some of the highest densities of carbon of any ecosystem. Understanding where tropical peatlands are found, and measuring how much carbon they contain, is therefore essential for designing effective policy to mitigate climate change. To address this need, since 2011 we led research to map and quantify the carbon stocks of tropical peatlands in Amazonia and Africa. 

 Pioneering work to map the extent and distribution of below ground peat was undertaken across the wetlands of the Pastaza Marañon basin, northern Peru. In 2014, we used new and existing field data in combination with novel optical and radar\-based remote sensing products to map and quantify carbon stored in this region **\[1\]**. This work demonstrated that the peatlands cover 35,600 km<sup>2</sup> \- approximately twice the area of peat in Scotland \- and form the largest peatland complex in Amazonia. It stores 3.14 \(0.44–8.15\) billion tonnes of carbon, equivalent to >60 years of fossil fuel emissions of Peru. 

 In 2017, we used a similar combination of new field data and novel remote sensing techniques to produce a map of the central Congo peatlands for the first time **\[2\]**. We showed that this region harbours the most extensive peatland ecosystems anywhere in the tropics, covering 145,500 km<sup>2</sup> – equivalent to the size of England – and contains 30.6 \(6.3\-46.8\) billion tonnes of carbon. This discovery is equivalent to 20 years of current fossil fuel emissions from the USA and increased the known size of the pan\-tropical peatland carbon pool by one\-third. 

 Our research has also shown these peatlands have unique biodiversity. In the Peruvian Amazon, we discovered that peatlands harbour a combination of species which enhances the landscape\-level \(beta\) diversity of the region, including rare tree species that were previously thought to be restricted to well\-drained, white sand soils **\[3\]**. 

 Finally, our work has identified both the threats to these largely intact peatland ecosystems, and pathways to ensure they are conserved and managed sustainably **\[4, 5\]**. For peatlands of the Amazon and Congo basins, major threats lie in the development of transport infrastructure, hydroelectric power reservoirs and agricultural expansion **\[4, 5\]**. However, investments to protect the carbon stocks, and developing markets for products from these peatland landscapes, are routes to support and expand community\-led conservation **\[4, 6\]**. For example, in Peru the palm *Mauritia flexuosa* or ‘aguaje’ naturally forms almost monodominant stands. The fruits are high in vitamin\-A and have a range of uses as food, ice cream flavouring and oil for soaps/shampoo. Developing markets and supporting sustainable management, where trees are climbed rather than cut to harvest fruits, represents a pathway to protect carbon stocks and biodiversity whilst also supporting livelihoods **\[4, 6\]**. Overall, our research demonstrates that these newly mapped peatlands are national and international conservation priorities, and that sustainable management of these ecosystems should be a key component of climate change mitigation strategies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impacts on conservation investment and policy development have occurred as a result of our research on tropical peatland ecosystems. These occurred following focused dissemination of our findings and long\-term follow\-up with national and international stakeholders and policymakers. We presented our map of Peruvian Amazon peatland carbon stocks at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) Twentieth Conference of the Parties \(COP20\) in Lima, Peru, in December 2014, and our map of the Congo peatlands at a technical meeting of the UNFCCC in Bonn, Germany in May 2017 and at COP25 in Madrid, Spain in December 2019. Our research was also disseminated widely via international media \(e.g.  [<ins>BBC</ins>](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-30448519);  [<ins>New York Times</ins>](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/science/peat-swamp-congo-global-warming.html)<ins>;</ins> Altmetric of **\[1\]** and **\[2\]** combined, 815\). As a result, the research in both Peru and the Congo basin was used extensively by the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\) 2017 report ‘ *Smoke on Water: Countering Global Threats from Peatland Loss and Degradation*’, to raise the profile of tropical peatland conservation in French and English **\[A\]**. We were commissioned to co\-write a UNEP policy briefing on the importance of protecting the Congo basin peatlands also in French and English **\[B\]**. This report was delivered to heads of state and the Environment Ministers of the Republic of Congo \(RoC\) and Democratic Republic of Congo \(DRC\), where the central Congo peatlands are located, by the then head of UNEP. 

 Subsequently, the following impacts occurred: 

1.  Our estimates of peatland carbon stocks in the Peruvian Amazon were used to underpin the successful USD6,000,000 proposal by the Peruvian Trust Fund for National Parks and Protected Areas \(PROFONANPE\) to the UN\-backed global Green Climate Fund \(GCF\) **\[C\]**. Our research was crucial for quantifying the impact of the project on carbon storage, and therefore for obtaining approval by the GCF as noted by the Executive Director of GCF\-funded PROFONANPE: 

 *‘Our proposal…used the findings of Draper et al \(2014\) as the technical evidence to…argue for the relevance of the conservation of these wetlands…and for improving the capacities of indigenous communities…in the context of climate change mitigation’* **\[D\]** 

 The PROFONANPE project, which started in 2017, was the first initiative to be funded by the GCF, which is the major international mechanism to fund adaptation and mitigation activities in response to climate change. The project is working with indigenous communities to establish bio\-businesses marketing palm fruits that are harvested sustainably by climbing the trees. This project has improved the management and conservation of 343,000 hectares of peatlands and forest in 120 communities in the Peruvian Amazon. 

1.  Our peatland research in Peru catalysed the creation of the >800,000 ha \(>35,600 km<sup>2</sup>\) Yaguas National Park by the Peruvian Protected Areas Authority \(SERNANP\) **\[E\]**. The recognition that the peatlands of this area were important because of their carbon stocks was an essential component of the justification for this protected area, in addition to its unique and high levels of biodiversity **\[F\]**. The creation of this major new National Park, which is equivalent in size to Yellowstone National Park, USA, subsequently attracted a donation of USD1,000,000 from the Andes Amazon fund. SERNANP also used our research to develop monitoring protocols and indicators of the health of populations of the abundant and valuable *Mauritia flexuosa* palms in peatlands **\[G\]**. These protocols help to ensure that palm fruit harvesting in protected areas is sustainable. 

1.  Our discovery of the world’s largest tropical peatland complex in the central Congo basin, its globally significant carbon stock, and our UN briefings **\[A,B\]** led to the Brazzaville Declaration, an international transboundary agreement signed by the governments of RoC and DRC in May 2018. This agreement is to increase cooperation and collaboration to protect the peatlands from future drainage **\[H\]**. The signing of the Brazzaville Declaration, described by the UN as ‘historic’ **\[H\]**, provides greater protection of the central Congo peatlands from unregulated agriculture, oil and gas mining, and logging concessions **\[I\]**. 

 Our carbon stock estimates and mapping of the Congo peatlands led to investments by two international funding bodies in protecting the peatlands and improving local livelihoods **\[I\]**. First, the German government’s International Klimate Initiative \(IKI\) programme has invested EUR15,000,000 \(c. USD18,000,000\) in a peatland monitoring system to facilitate further protection of the Congo peatlands. Second, the Global Environment Facility invested USD41,770,855 into sustainable landscapes in central Africa centred on the peatlands, including USD6,083,151 dedicated to improving governance and sustainable livelihoods in the Republic of Congo **\[I\]**. Both investments have been made only because we discovered and mapped the central Congo peatlands.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words 

 This case study focuses on impacts on Brazilian police understanding of, training on, and responses to, gender\-based violence. Research by Macaulay and local partners identified and responded to the police need for improvement in these areas. She developed an innovative training methodology, including a 120\-page training manual, for police academy instructors. Some 450 police officers, trainers and multipliers from every state and region in Brazil were trained in this approach in workshops held across the country in 2016\-2020. The methodology has been adopted and integrated into police training and operational practice in at least four states and several municipalities, by civil, military, and municipal police forces and other justice sector and civil society actors. 
","
###  **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Macaulay’s research covers police reform in Latin America, specifically state responses to domestic and gender\-based violence in the region, human rights policies, and pedagogies for teaching about gender. She has researched the security and justice systems in Brazil and Latin America through her ongoing work with Amnesty International, the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety \(FBSP\) and other local partners. 

 The key research insights cover the institutional mechanisms and opportunities by which good practice and effective reforms emerge; the need for more effective, integrated, and cross\-agency police training on gender\-based violence; the role of women’s movements and female police officers in reforming how the police handle gender\-based violence; and how to identify opportunities for institutional reform within police forces and units. Her research on failed and successful police reform processes across the region \[3\], original in its comparative coverage, produced key insights about the importance of local reform processes, policy entrepreneurs, and leadership. 

 Macaulay assisted Amnesty International in evaluating their human rights training programmes for police in Brazil, leading to key insights that effective training should be appreciative of officers’ professional experience, and engage and integrate personal, applied, and cognitive forms of knowledge. This insight led her to develop immersive and enactive training in gender\-sensitivity in professional practice for all students in the Peace Studies and International Development department from 2007. Analysis of over 1,500 written participant reflections \[2\], and extensive experience with peace education in community settings \[4\] confirmed the importance of an integrated pedagogy \[2\]. The latter formed the core of the innovative training methodology developed for the Brazilian police from 2016 onwards. The other strand of Dr Macaulay’s research has focussed on gender issues in Latin America, particularly the evolution of security and justice sector approaches to domestic violence \[5\]. This work is original in its breadth of comparative analysis, and its focus on the institutional and political factors that enabled the women’s movement to influence the practices of police and judicial bodies, especially after the passage of Brazil’s 2006 domestic violence law. This is fully analysed in a monograph \[1\] that details positive security and justice reforms in relation to feminicide – a perspective missing in current research on the topic \- and based on original primary research with police and justice sector innovators. Research on this started in 2016 and proceeded in parallel with the partnership with the FBSP, which provided opportunities for Dr Macaulay to talk informally with police officers during the training sessions she was running from 2016\-20, leading to key insights about the gendered institutional cultures of the police, their demand for more effective training around gender\-based violence, and the policy innovations occurring within the justice and security sector. These findings in turn informed her design of the training workshops and of the manual \[6\]. Her work on gender\-based violence and pedagogies formed the basis of a shorter training manual she wrote for Plan International’s global programme to enhance girls’ safety in cities.

###  **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The impact potential of Dr Macaulay’s work has been enhanced by her long engagement with security sector and justice institutions and reformers in Brazil, including her collaborations with Amnesty International and with the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety \(FBSP\) since its foundation in 2006. The FBSP is a unique thinktank, bringing together academics, policymakers, and law enforcement officials of all ranks to develop and disseminate good practice in policing and violence reduction. A key strand of their work focusses on institutional best practices and deficits in relation to gender\-based violence. 

 In 2016, Dr Macaulay proposed and ran the FBSP’s first ever training workshop for 50 police officers on gender\-based violence, at the FBSP’s annual conference. This, and subsequent training events, which reached an additional 250 law enforcement officials in police academies across Brazil, were co\-designed and delivered with Brazilian colleague Dr Juliana Martins, who is highly experienced in training Brazil’s municipal guards. FBSP staff supported by conducting pre\-sessional needs assessment and impact evaluation. The training manual that resulted from this process of co\-production was developed by Macaulay and Martins through training workshops held in the states of São Paulo, Piauí, Goiás, and Ceará between 2016\-19. Written end\-of\-course evaluations confirmed that participants had improved their understanding of gender\-based violence, had understood the value of approaching training differently, and had identified areas of professional practice in which they would now change their actions and approaches. In 2019 Macaulay finalised the 100\-page manual *Principles and practices for training police in dealing with violence against women,* which was translated into Portuguese and published in 2020. It was distributed to police forces and academies across Brazil, with online training specific to its application provided to 150 police trainers and multipliers through two workshops in October and December 2020. 

 Policing in Brazil is decentralised, with civil and military police force in each of the 27 states, and municipal guards in around 1,000 towns. The 2016\-19 workshops and the Manual have impacted the training philosophy and practices, and operational guidelines on gender\-based violence in these diverse police forces across the country; this reach is reflected in the sample of testimonials. For example, the administration of the Goiás Civil Police Academy was inspired by the two\-day workshop run there by Macaulay to organise a state\-wide seminar with specialist officers. This resulted in the state’s first Operational Guidelines for Dealing with Victims of Domestic and Sexual Violence now in use in all of the state’s women’s police stations. The Academy is using the Manual to overhaul its training curriculum, integrating its principles into both specialist and generalist training. \[A\] In Bahia, the manual is being used to train the military police’s domestic violence patrols in 18 cities, and is being integrated into basic training for all officers, in a process led by the police academy’s Research Institute.\[B\] It is also used to train the domestic violence patrols in Rio Grande do Sul state \[C\] and in the metropolis of São Paulo, which uses its methodology to run case conferences and improve the quality of police assistance to victims \[D\]. In Minas Gerais the Manual has enabled police and researchers to devise tailored approaches, adapted to local cultural norms, to assist women in rural areas \[E\]. In Pernambuco police station chiefs have used it to train their staff on domestic violence issues, as part of continuing professional development. \[F\] In Mato Grosso state, the local Network Association for Tackling Domestic Violence Against Women is using the Manual to train 200 police officers in the city of Barra do Garças \[G\]. These testimonials are only indicative of the uptake and application of the training methodology through the country: at the end of the online training for trainers and multipliers, which reached law enforcement professionals from 26 of Brazil’s 27 states, 70% of them stated that they intended to use the manual in specialist as well as basic training, and 65% would use it in continuing professional development programmes for their police colleagues \[H\]. 

 The impact of this work has also been international. The NGO Plan International commissioned Macaulay to produce a shorter version of the manual for use in their Safer Cities for Girls programme, which is used to train local police and transport officials in preventing sexual harassment of girls \[I\]. It is currently in use in Jaipur and Delhi, India; Hanoi, Vietnam; Alexandria, Assiut and Cairo in Egypt; Kampala, Uganda; Nairobi, Kenya; Lima, Peru; Asunción, Paraguay; Masbate, Philippines; Honiara, Solomon Islands; Brussels, Antwerp, and Charleroi in Belgium; Madrid, Sevilla, and Barcelona in Spain.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The housing market in the UK has been described as “broken”. It is seen as one of the greatest barriers to progress in building a stronger and fairer Britain. Becoming increasingly unaffordable, housing accounts for more than a third of the disposable income of 2,200,000 working households with below\-average income \(Housing White Paper, 2017\). Research at Reading has informed a number of government policies aimed at improving the affordability of and access to housing; these include the government’s annual house construction target \(300,000\), set with a view to increasing supply, and therefore improving affordability. The empirical model developed at Reading is fully embedded in policy cycles across numerous government departments, including the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\). It also underpins the twice\-yearly housing market forecasts conducted by the Office for Budget Responsibility and used in negotiations with HM Treasury over public expenditure planning. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Long\-term research at the University of Reading \(backed by funding of approximately GBP1,000,000 from MHCLG since 2005\) has led to the development of an econometric model of regional housing markets \[ref 2\]. Originally developed in the early 2000s to look at the effects on affordability of increases in housing supply, the model is still in widespread use and has expanded its scope to cover questions related to housing tenure, financial deregulation, the effects of Brexit and Right to Buy sales as recent examples. Simulations are conducted using the model, to determine the predicted impacts of changes in key policy variables on the outcomes of interest, in particular affordability \[ref 5\]. 

 Regularly used to underpin government policy, the model has been refined over time and is an econometric model of housing affordability at the regional level, including specifications of the housing and labour markets, and demographic segments. For example, recent research has examined intergenerational aspects of housing affordability and the factors that affect opportunities for home ownership among different cohorts, in particular first\-time buyers \[ref 6\]. Meen’s research at the international level has also suggested that housing supply in the UK is less responsive to price rises than in other countries, implying that shortages and a lack of affordability can persist for prolonged periods \[refs 1 and 4\]. 

 Modelling the effects of policy changes on housing is complex and had not been attempted on this scale in Britain before. Housing mobility, for example, implies that the effects of increases in housing supply on regional affordability are difficult to capture since households are likely to move into areas where new housing is being constructed, potentially offsetting any improvements in affordability in those areas. The interactions between these different factors affect not only house prices and affordability, but also household formation and the proportion  who are owners, all of which are captured within the model \[ref 3\]. In contrast to official projections of household formation \(which are trend\-based\), the model allows users to consider how worsening affordability reduces the number of new households. In summary, the model demonstrates the strength of economic forces, and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on housing. 

 The premise that housing affordability can be improved through increasing supply is underpinned by the model and reiterated in the 2017 Housing White Paper, ‘Fixing our broken housing market’. However, the key issue was by how much housing supply would need to be increased in order to induce a major improvement in affordability; this was a difficult quantitative issue because of the interdependencies across local markets. Contrary to expectations at the time, the conclusions were that supply increases would have to be very large and sustained over long periods of time to have a significant effect on affordability. This fundamentally challenged the traditional view, according to which planning decisions for housing should be based on expected increases in the number of households, as opposed to the need to modify the housing supply. Meen’s research showed that increases in provision would need to be much larger; and this indicated that there would need to be significant building on greenfield sites, where the cost of building is typically lower and supply responses to price changes are greater \[ref 4\]. While this analysis originally attracted considerable controversy, it is now generally accepted as correct, although political realities prevent the conclusions from being fully adopted. Nonetheless, since 2017, the government has had a house\-building target of 300,000 dwellings per annum, underpinned by the research at Reading, which is much higher than recent outturns.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Research conducted at the University of Reading by Meen, demonstrating how increasing housing supply can improve affordability, has underpinned the key econometric model used for housing policy analysis and forecasting across government. Reflecting Meen’s longstanding expertise in housing, and his close working relationship with MHCLG \(for which he was awarded an OBE\), the model has expanded beyond the focus of affordability and housing supply to embrace related issues of tenure, financial deregulation and Right to Buy Sales, as well as broader cross\-government priorities, including Brexit. Indeed, when analysts “consider policy interventions, the model is used implicitly \(if not explicitly\)” and is “fully embedded in the policy cycle” \[Section 5, source 1\]. Results are shared with the Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\), the official independent forecasting agency, and are used in negotiations with HM Treasury over public expenditure planning. In particular, the model has informed government “understanding of the housing market and how changes in the economy and demography will affect housing outcomes” \[source 1\]. 

 “Our broken housing market is one of the greatest barriers to progress in Britain today. Whether buying or renting, the fact is that housing is increasingly unaffordable – particularly for ordinary working class people who are struggling to get by” \(Theresa May, foreword to Housing White Paper, 2017\). In this context, Meen’s research has changed and informed the government’s policies around housing supply \[sources 1 and 2\]. Outputs from the model were shared with ministers and showed that “at current levels of house building, affordability will get worse” and “provided a compelling case to be more ambitious about creating the conditions for supply to be permanently higher” \[source 1\]. The model’s predictions that even housing supply significantly above current levels would only lead to a slowing of worsening affordability has “compelled \(policy\) ambition to be bolder and more radical” \[source 1\]. Thus, an annual government target of 300,000 additional homes was set out in the November 2017 government budget. If the government delivers 300,000 new homes per year \(including change of use and/or office conversions\), this will constitute a significant increase in the rate of house\-building, since the number built in a year averaged only 177,000 in the period 2005/06 to 2017/18 \(according to the Public Accounts Committee\). The evidence\-informed goal represents a change in local authority target\-setting, as targets were previously set according to anticipated increases in households and are now being informed additionally by affordability indicators on a regional basis. The government trajectory towards the target of 300,000 is regularly updated on the basis of housing government forecasts informed by the model and shared across Whitehall by the Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Cabinet Office \[source 1\]; potential shortfalls are the trigger for further investigation and policy changes. 

 ‘Fixing our broken housing market’ has caused much debate in the UK and is recognised by the government as key to building a stronger, fairer Britain \(White Paper, 2017\). Despite this, the most recent figures for affordability show that, on average, full\-time workers could expect to pay an estimated 7.8 times their annual workplace\-based earnings on purchasing a home in England and Wales in 2018 \(Office for National Statistics, 2019\). Current statistics show that housing in 77 local authorities became less affordable over the last five years \(Office for National Statistics, 2018\), with the gap between the most and least affordable areas continuing to widen. In recognition of the variance in affordability according to geography, the model has been used to inform government policy on the geographical targeting of housing investment in high\-demand areas such as London and the South East \[source 1\]. 

 Meen’s long\-term engagement with parliamentary select committees, the MHCLG and the OBR has continued as successive governments have utilised his expertise to tackle a variety of important economic and social policy issues. For example, the OBR produced the working paper *Forecasting House Prices* \[source 3\], which looked to develop a five\-year forecast using models for house prices, whilst examining insights regarding the drivers of house price rises. This forecasting approach was based heavily on a series of Meen’s papers, most notably his 2013 paper \[ref 6\] and forms part of OBR’s core forecasting activities on house prices today \[sources 1 and 3\]. 

 Meen also contributed to parliamentary debate through his appointment as a Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee Inquiry into the UK housing market in 2015/16 \(House of Lords 2016, ‘Building more homes’, source 4\). The Committee concentrated on ways of increasing housing supply \(the theme of a number of government and independent reports\) but was sceptical of the widespread view that increasing general market housing would benefit those on low incomes. This was consistent with Meen’s work on the effects of increases in housing supply; the Committee then called for the relaxation of controls on local authority borrowing in order to increase the amount of affordable housing. Controls have now been relaxed. Furthermore, the results produced by the model showed that new affordable housing output does not significantly crowd out new private housing supply; this has been used by MHCLG to “convince HM Treasury of the efficacy of affordable housing investment” \[source 1\]. The model has also been used “multiple times” to test “the impact of changes to stamp duty” and was “influential in the eventual HM Treasury decision” to make changes to Stamp Duty in 2017 \[source 1\]. 

 Although work on the model was suspended during the period of the Coalition government, the need was such that it resumed in 2015 with a rebuilding of the model to reflect new policy priorities. Further updating, including the most recent research on tenure, took place in 2018/19. For example, the model’s Right to Buy sales equations are used to forecast the numbers of local authority housing sales to tenants across the UK regions. The MHCLG “uses this to project the total amount of income that it expects local authorities to receive from sales. This provides the basis for estimates of the amount that authorities must spend on replacement housing stock to comply with the requirement to spend receipts within three years. The modelling results are shared with the OBR at Fiscal Events, and feed into the Local Authority Self\-Financed Expenditure forecasts” \[source 1\]. The model has also been used to inform potential policy interventions in the event of a “no\-deal” Brexit \[source 1\]: “The model was used to test multiple Brexit scenarios and how they would affect the housing market. The potential impacts on housing construction, housing transactions, house prices and affordability were looked at. The analysis provided a baseline to design potential policy interventions in case of a no\-deal, including where to focus our attention and what the trigger signs might be in a housing downturn” \[source 1\]. 

 Meen has also provided guidance on housing economics and the use of models since the model’s inception, training successive generations of economists in the Ministry since 2005; in terms of skills capacity, Meen facilitated the setting\-up of a system within MHCLG which will enable the ongoing training of economists in\-house. In addition, he was invited to give a seminar on housing affordability to MHCLG staff, including researchers and policy analysts, in January 2017. Subsequent to this, he provided oral evidence to the House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee on housing for older persons in January 2018, and this is cited in the final report \[source 7\]. There is a view that there is no housing shortage in Britain. Rather, older households are “under\-occupying” housing, particularly once their children have left home. Therefore, if they could be encouraged to downsize, the housing problem would be reduced. One view is that the failure to downsize is due to the lack of suitable alternative accommodation. However, Meen’s evidence concentrated on the absence of incentives to do so. Most older\-person households have paid off their mortgages and so their housing costs are low; the tax system, and expected capital gains in housing assets over time, encourage them to stay. 

 Meen also gave advice on both modelling and policy to the independent Redfern Review into the decline in home ownership \(2016\); this was commissioned by the Shadow Secretary of State for Housing. The technical report accompanying the Review, on forecasting house prices and home ownership and produced by Oxford Economics \[source 5\], cites 11 papers by Meen out of a total of 25 references, alongside providing the basis for house price modelling. More recent work with the UK Collaborative Centre for Housing has been used to inform the Affordable Housing Commission Report *Defining and Measuring Housing Affordability – An Alternative Approach* \[source 8\]. 

 Beyond England, a commissioned review of tax revenue forecasting models for the Scottish housing market concluded: “The models that were most popular for forecasting house prices included error\-correction models. Particularly, the most influential literature for practitioners in the UK was the work of Geoff Meen” \[Scottish Government, source 6\]. 

 In summary, this body of research has underpinned cross\-government policy reform aimed at addressing the challenges in the UK’s “broken” housing markert. Of particular concern has been the rise in housing costs, making housing increasingly unaffordable. In terms of reach, Meen’s long\-term research has been adopted on a national scale and has informed a variety of important economic and societal policies associated with housing. Significantly, in addressing the barriers to a “fairer and stronger Britain”, it has informed “radical” policy decisions \(for example, housing targets\) which have urgent and compelling ramifications for planning policy and housing affordability as a whole.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The work of Professors Behr and Sheppard and their colleagues has transformed clinical management for families following sudden deaths in young people. The group has clearly demonstrated the importance of expert cardiac autopsy and genetic testing. The recommended work up of family members that emerged from their findings was incorporated into National Service Framework guidance, Specialist Commissioning service specifications, and international guidelines for pathological, clinical and genetic evaluation of decedents and families. Implementation has been helped by the group’s close relationship with the charities Cardiac Risk in the Young \(CRY\) and the British Heart Foundation \(BHF\). Under the current protocols, a specific diagnosis and management plan to prevent further deaths can now be made in over 40% of all families investigated.

#  Defining the pathology of Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome \(SADS\) 

 For over 20 years, the academic cardiology unit at St George’s has been an internationally recognised centre of excellence for the clinical, genetic and pathological investigation of sudden death in the young, and was consequently chosen to lead the influential multi\-centre Sudden Death Syndrome \(SDS\) study which investigated all unexpected sudden deaths in the UK. Over a twelve\-month period ending in 2000, coroners and their pathologists were surveyed, and all unexpected sudden deaths underwent additional specialist cardiac autopsy and toxicological analysis at St George’s. Of these cases, 4% remained unexplained and were designated sudden arrhythmic death syndrome \(SADS\), a term that has since been adopted internationally. The results of the SDS study showed that the incidence of SADS was up to 8 times higher than previously estimated \(an increase from 0.16 cases per year per 100,000 people to 1.38 cases per year per 100,000 people\), with more than 500 cases per year in England alone \[1\]. 

#  Translation to genetic and clinical evaluation 

 Follow\-up studies on the families of 32 SADS cases identified by the SDS study led to the diagnosis of an inherited cardiac abnormality in just over 20%, the majority of which showed evidence of long QT syndrome \[2\]. Further studies in ongoing SADS family referrals were subjected to a more comprehensive testing protocol that incorporated genetic testing of both deceased index cases and relatives using Sanger sequencing of a limited gene panel. This strategy increased the number of families diagnosed to 53% in a larger new sample of 57 SADS cases \[3\]. 

#  Optimising investigation of SADS decedents and their families 

 Subsequent research revealed a substantial underdiagnosis of SADS and overdiagnosis of heart muscle disorders by general \(coroners’\) pathologists when compared to the expert cardiac pathologist, demonstrating the importance of expert cardiac pathology to ensure thorough and accurate interpretation of autopsy findings and to guide the optimal evaluation of the families of the deceased. Further investigation demonstrated that equivocal autopsy findings were associated with diagnoses of genetic cardiac disease in a similar proportion of families as SADS. This implied that offering investigation only to SADS families would necessitate giving false reassurance to those that were not further investigated \[4\], and mandated that histopathology and access to an expert pathological opinion be available for all autopsies that follow unexpected sudden deaths to ensure accurate interpretation and follow\-on management of families. 

 Evaluation of the role of systematic provocative testing of relatives after a SADS death in the largest series of families to date \(N=303\) indicated the importance of a specific, genetic disorder of cardiac electrical function \- Brugada syndrome \- as the underlying cause of SADS in 28% of cases \[5\]. An extended post\-mortem genetic testing panel using next generation sequencing technologies was investigated as a diagnostic tool by the group and gave a 13% yield of immediately clinically actionable results in 302 expertly validated SADS cases, highlighting, in particular, the importance of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia \(CPVT\) as a cause of sudden death in children. This could only be fully appreciated due to the high frequency of mutations detected using the ‘molecular autopsy’ approach. Furthermore, there was a synergistic increase from 26% to 39% in diagnostic yield when combined with clinical evaluation in families \[6\]. Thus, a combination of comprehensive clinical and genetic investigation protocols gave the greatest clinical impact.

#  Enabling diagnosis and promoting preventative interventions for patients and families 

 Research at the academic cardiology unit at St George’s into sudden cardiac death has fundamentally transformed the management of families who have been bereaved due to unexplained sudden cardiac death, increasing the availability not only of a definitive diagnosis but also of preventative interventions. 

 Around 500\-600 cases of SADS are diagnosed each year in people under 35 years old. Since 2014, coroners and pathologists from across the United Kingdom have referred 1,578 cases for expert pathology at the academic cardiology unit at St George’s, accounting for approximately 40% of the total number of SADS cases in the United Kingdom. In 2014, most SADS cases did not have tissue retained for post\-mortem genetic testing \(‘molecular autopsy’\). Now, due to the group’s concerted efforts in working with coroners, more than 60% of cases have suitable retained. The unit also receives referrals of over 100 families of sudden death cases per year, and over 500 families of young SADS decedents have been evaluated since 2014. A genetic cause is identified in over 40% of families allowing management of relatives to prevent sudden death. 

 Professor Behr has written 2 patient information booklets about SADS: ‘When a young person dies suddenly’, and ‘Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome’, which were commissioned and are produced and distributed by the charities Cardiac Risk in the Young \(CRY\) and the British Heart Foundation \(BHF\), respectively.  Both are available online and have attracted uptake across the world: the BHF recorded 991 orders and 380 downloads of ‘Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome’ between June 3rd, 2019 and February 3rd, 2020 \[A\]. CRY has ordered 18,500 printed copies of “When a young person dies suddenly” since 2010, and the linked  [www.sads.org.uk](file://shares1/REF/REF2021/REF2021%20Audit/SGUL%20Internal%20Audit/REF%20internal%20audit_impact%20case%20studies/UOA%201_Behr/ICS%20Audit%20Feb%202021/www.sads.org.uk) website has been visited more than 980,000 times \[B\]. 

#  Influencing national and international guidelines and policy 

 The results of the SDS study and subsequent research, backed up by engagement and lobbying by CRY, have strongly influenced NHS policy. The addition of Chapter 8 on Arrhythmias and Sudden Death to the National Service Framework \(NSF\) on Coronary Heart Disease was an early example of change resulting from the increased recognition of genetic cardiac abnormalities as a cause of sudden death that occurred as a result of the group’s work. The recommendations made in the Chapter are still in effect, and have continued to influence clinical practice since the Chapter’s first publication in March 2005. Chapter 8 also stipulates the need for expert post\-mortem and appropriate tissue retention in cases of SADS, and emphasises the importance of evaluation of families who may have Inherited Cardiac Conditions \(ICCs\), which should be conducted in a dedicated clinic with trained staff. The implementation of equitable service improvement necessitated the development of new NHS England Specialist Commissioning Specifications for ICC Services \[C\], which would delineate the requirements for designation of ICC services and refer to the clinical service requirements of SADS families. Concurrently, Behr and Sheppard were elected to the founding council of the Association for Inherited Cardiac Conditions \(AICC\), the first professional subspecialist body for all disciplines involved in the management of families with ICCs. The AICC proposed pathways for the management SADS families, based on SADS research carried out at St George’s. These pathways were adopted by NHS England in the service specifications. 

 Despite these changes, barriers remained to the referral of families and retention of tissue for expert post\-mortem and genetic testing. A BHF sponsored NHS England and Coronial Pilot for Sudden Unexpected Death has therefore been established \[D\] to address communication between coronial and health services and improve provision and access to integrated genomic and clinical testing for SADS cases and families. This initiative is a direct consequence of the clinical, pathological and genetic research carried out at St George’s. The National Steering Group for the Pilot project is led by Behr with Sheppard acting as national pathology lead. 

 International recommendations and guidelines have also been influenced by the research group’s scientific output. The Association for European Cardiovascular Pathology \(AECVP\) has published Guidelines for Autopsy Investigation of Sudden Cardiac Death that draw attention to the implications for genetic testing and family evaluation \[Ea\], which were also included in a recommendations document led by the AECVP, the European Society of Human Genetics, European Council of Legal Medicine and European Society of Cardiology \[Eb\]. 

 Clinical recommendations for the management of SADS families based on St George’s research have been adopted by the Heart Rhythm Society \(HRS\), European Heart Rhythm Association \(EHRA\), and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society \(APHRS\) Expert Consensus Statement \(Behr\) on the Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Inherited Primary Arrhythmia Syndromes \[Ec\]. These were reinforced by ESC Guidelines for Sudden Death in 2015 \[Ed\]. The recommendations are also the subject of new expert consensus statements issued by APHRS and HRS on the investigation of decedents with sudden unexplained death and their families \[Ee\].  Statements written for Professor Behr by international clinical leaders attest to the significance and reach of the changes that have been influenced by the recommendations \[F\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Taylor\-Jones’s, Pendleton’s and Coates’s research has enabled East Asian cultural organisations in the UK to widen their audiences and present programmes to challenge the existing narrative about East Asian cultures. Using their core research themes around gender, colonialism, and visual culture, they have worked in partnership with cinemas, museums, artists and architects to curate events and programmes. By combining in\-depth analyses and outcomes arising from their research, they demonstrate to audiences the complexity of these rich art forms. These programmes have introduced new audiences to a whole range of East Asian art and visual cultures at a moment when this canon is set to rise and expand. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The work of Taylor\-Jones, Pendleton and Coates challenges the view of homogenous East Asian societies and disrupts and debates existing boundaries and spaces. They have worked individually and as a team to develop and explore cultural and artistic representation and engagement. 

 Through the development of methodologies for working with artists and visual materials, Pendleton comes to three conclusions that have informed subsequent approaches to curatorship and public engagement. Firstly that material and visual items operate as thresholds or windows that provide unique insights into the relationships between lived pasts, presents and futures \(R1\). This in turn developed his work on co\-creation between academic and non\-academic partners and the conditions in which to make it flourish. By working with artists and letting them speak through their own work, Pendleton concludes that structured conversations, without emphasis on coproducing output leads to a better understanding of both artistic and academic discipline \(R1\). Thirdly in his specific use of the Yamanote line on the Tokyo subway as a case study, Pendleton demonstrates how visual and material items interact with specific urban spaces allowing the exploration of both the historical and the contemporary in new and innovative ways \(R2\). 

 This approach to diversity and the challenging of traditional historical narratives is a common link between all the researchers. Taylor\-Jones’s work shows how the cinema industries of East Asia were heavily and often controversially intertwined with the Japanese colonial period and how this era has had long term effects, both positive and negative, on the contemporary East Asian film world \(R3\). The study’s key findings articulate colonial era Korean cinema as part of a much wider matrix of early cinematic tradition and circulation than previously supposed. Rather than seeing cinema as imposed onto colonial territories from Japan, the territories themselves developed and maintained unique film cultures during this period and these were heavily influential in the period following Japan's defeat. This dramatically expands the more familiar premise that places Korean cinema into the context of a specifically national debate, rather than seeing it as a ‘cinema of Empire’ with transnationality at its core. The project clearly charted the legacy of colonial cinema and offers tangible and clear case studies on how the colonial past bears direct relevance to the modern day East Asian cinema industry. 

 Both Taylor\-Jones’s and Coates’s work explores female experience during both colonial and contemporary periods and proposes a visualisation of gender that is expansive and fluid, such as Coates’ work presenting the complexities and layering of the star personas of female Japanese actors in the 1960s and Taylor\-Jones’s exploration of women and modernity in 1930s Korean cinema. For Taylor\-Jones the result of this is the idea that colonial spaces, past and present, are where dominant discourses are both confirmed but also undermined, by men and women. Coates’ explorations of gender and creativity in Japanese golden age cinema offers new engagement with this area of cinema research \(R4\). Coates’ recent research on cinema audiences in Japan picks up on themes in both Pendleton’s and Taylor\-Jones’s work exploring the examination of gender as a key factor in the development and dissemination of East Asian visual and material culture, and how digital cultures are circulating and challenging dominant modes of representation. This is illustrated in the ‘digital\-born’ art practice of artists like Rokudenashiko who uses 3D printing, showing how technological advances are shaping arts practices today. \(R6\) 

 In combination, Taylor\-Jones’s, Pendleton’s, and Coates's work brings into sharp relief the cultural, historical, and social elements of East Asian visual and material culture. Their research not only encompasses archival and analytical approaches to the artefacts they explore, but have also worked on developing methodologies, Coates on Digital Personhood, Taylor\-Jones on colonial cinema, and Pendleton on co\-creation, for exploring these works in a modern public context.

 Research\-based curation to widen the reach and appeal, and to challenge perceptions of East Asian visual culture. 

 Taylor\-Jones, Pendleton and Coates have long\-standing relationships with the Korean Cultural Centre, \(KCCUK\), the British Film Institute \(BFI\), the Korean Film Archive and the Japan Foundation. They have worked with these organisations on a number of festivals and initiatives aimed at bringing Japanese and Korean film and visual culture to UK audiences. Bringing research expertise to film, art and other visual cultures has meant a growth in understanding of the varied visual cultures of East Asia. The KCCUK, BFI, Korean Film Archive and Japan Foundation have been able to draw this into their programming and to their audiences. Taylor\-Jones, Pendleton and Coates have been able to challenge the popular perception of what drives these cultures, as well as widen the audience for what was previously a niche area of interest. The recent popular success of Korean cinema means that they have been able to harness the perfect moment to place a critical spotlight on East Asian film and culture. 

 Expanding public understanding of Korean film, history, and culture 

 As a result of previous work with them on the Korean Touring Programme and knowing that she had expertise in early and classical Korean film, the KCCUK invited Taylor\-Jones to propose a programme of 17 films for the BFI Early Korean Cinema series. The series ran in February 2019 in London and then toured the UK including Sheffield, Glasgow, and Belfast. This era of Korean cinema had never been presented, beyond one\-off exceptions, to UK audiences before. As well as brokering the international exchange between the BFI and the Korean Film Archive that made the films available in the UK, Taylor\-Jones’s research and knowledge enabled the KCCUK to make visible and accessible crucial aspects of the history of East Asian cinema, highlight the impacts of Japanese colonialism on early Korean cinema as well as look at its relationship with wider cinematic traditions of the time. As the KCCUK programmer Hyunjin Cho notes, “By working with Kate, we were able to use her research in this area to programme films that are little known in the UK. As well as co\-directing the film programming, Kate’s expertise, particularly regarding the impacts of Japanese colonialism on early Korean cinema and its relationship with wider cinematic traditions at the time, was instrumental in programming accompanying talks, presentations, and Q&A sessions.” **\(S1\)**. For the BFI, the film festival and association with Taylor\-Jones enabled BFI staff to have a better understanding of the films that were shown and so improved visitor services **\(S2\)**. The collaboration also enhanced their screening scope by enabling accompanying talks, presentations, and Q&A opportunities to facilitate public engagement with the visual records of Japanese Imperialism, early Korean culture and history and enhance their offer. As a result, the festival drew higher than expected audiences and “was drawn from a wider demographic than some of our other programmes.” **\(S2\)**. The series received wide coverage in highly influential film publications such as Sight and Sound, All the Anime and Film London **\(S3, S4\)**. The KCCUK notes that “The success of this series in terms of audience engagement with the subject matter, and the active support we have received from Kate and the University of Sheffield, are encouraging as we look to the future at new collaborations and public engagement opportunities” **\(S1\)**. 

 Establishing a credible, educational, and inspirational Japan Now North Festival 

 The Japan Now festival, celebrating art, culture, literature, and film, has been established in London since 2016. It aims to use art and culture to promote mutual understanding and cooperation between Japan and the UK. Until 2017 it was London\-based but as a result of Taylor\-Jones’ previous work with the Japan Foundation, the organisers approached Taylor\-Jones, and together they developed a parallel festival which would take place in the north of England. Its key themes were shaped by Taylor\-Jones and Pendleton’s research \(2017\-19\), joined by Coates’s in 2020. The Programme Director of Japan Now notes that the Sheffield team *“greatly expanded the scope and curatorial ambition of Japan Now...driven by the expertise of the team, and guided by their individual specialisms”* **\(S5\).** 

 Their research highlights that UK audiences often receive only limited and stereotypical examples of Japanese visual and cultural products. By creating a programme based on these findings, they were able to use theories of collaborative working in the arts industry \(Pendleton\) to programme female artists and documentary filmmakers and writers who had engaged with minority experiences outside of Japan, drawing upon both Pendleton’s and Taylor\-Jones’s work on space, gender, and the challenging of normative ideals \(R1\-5\). The Senior Arts Programme Officer at the Japan Foundation notes that working with the Sheffield research team “ *afforded the festival an intellectual credibility and underpinning ethos that was important to establish in the new iteration of the Festival in Sheffield*” **\(S6\)**. The Festival’s three iterations have brought world\-renowned artists to Sheffield for the first time, for example filmmaker and photographer Mika Ninagawa, filmmaker Megumi Sasaki, whose film ‘A Whale of a Tale’ was premiered at the Festival in 2018 and writer Sayaka Murata \(‘Convenience Store Woman’\). 

 In 2020, Coates’s research \(R7\) was used as the basis for a theme on futures, to highlight that although Japan is seen as a leader in technology, it faces challenges common to other nations, including an ageing population and overcrowding. In doing this, it helped audiences to see the UK commonalities with Japan and provide ideas on how we might also tackle social problems. 

 Brendan Griggs, Chief Executive of the Great British Sasakawa Foundation, who part\-fund Japan Now, notes that the researchers’ “ *knowledge of Japanese art and popular culture and in particular their nuanced approach to contemporary issues such as gender and sexuality, enabled them to curate a programme which has proved both educational and inspiring for audiences from a variety of backgrounds*” **\(S7\)**. 

 Through close collaboration with cultural partners, the public understanding of Japan and Japanese culture outside of the mainstream discourses have been significantly extended and the relationship between the audience and Japanese culture has been changed. Almost all \(94%, 2018, 99%, 2019, 90% 2020\) attendees learnt something new, over half said they would seek out more Japanese media and 49% wanted to read more about Japan. Thirteen percent wanted to learn Japanese language as a result. Comments such as “ *\[I\] really love this exposure for women artists, showing...a more authentic insight on Japanese culture*” demonstrate that the aims of the festival were met and audiences appreciated the unique nature of the events they saw **\(S8\)**. Sasakawa Foundation’s Chief Executive also noted that “ *We were delighted with the outcome: a significant improvement in the knowledge and appreciation of contemporary Japan amongst new audiences in the South Yorkshire region*” **\(S7\)**. 

 In addition, the attempt to widen the audience for Japanese cultural events by bringing Japan Now to the North was a success. The positive reception of events for the Festival in the North, driven by their quality, instilled confidence in organisers to expand their geographical reach. As the Programme Director notes, all three researchers’ “ *knowledge, enthusiasm and desire to educate about Japan is inspiring and Japan Now North has gone on to become a festival model which has been adopted in other regions in the UK, particularly in Norwich, where ‘Japan Now East’ took place in February 2020”* **\(S5\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Marjon researchers developed the ‘Transformative Evaluation’ methodology for use in youth work contexts. Application of this tool has enabled a wide range of youth and community work organisations internationally to demonstrate the impact their work has on the lives of young people and across their wider community, thus filling an identified gap. Impact is threefold: enabling youth workers to better evaluate their practice, leading to improved practice through reflection, increased understanding and deepened relationships with young people; enabling organisations to better identify and share the outcomes of their work; and facilitating changes in evaluation processes within both organisational and national policy.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The premise of this research is a belief among academics that existing evaluation regimes are inadequate as they focus on quantitative data and prescribed outcomes \(Ellis and Gregory, 2008; Issitt and Spence 2005\). This results in youth workers being unable to identify qualitative outcomes, as well as being de\-skilled in evaluation \( **3.1, 3.2**\). The initial underpinning research was conducted by Dr Susan Cooper, Associate Professor of Education, developing, testing and reviewing the viability of an innovative evaluation methodology between 2009 and 2017 \( **3.2, 3.3**\). This involved an action research process and produced a rigorous means of generating qualitative data. The fieldwork took place in a medium\-sized voluntary sector youth work organisation in Cornwall, England. A qualitative study of the youth workers’ perceptions and experience of conducting evaluations identified that youth workers felt alienated by the dominant quasi\-experimental quantitative evaluation approaches in use at that time and supported the need for an alternative approach \( **3.1, ch. 3**\). Therefore, the **novel Transformative Evaluation \(TE\) methodology** was developed and piloted in the organisation \( **3.1, ch. 6**\), and a further qualitative study highlighted the benefits of this participatory methodology for practice, practitioners and organisations \( **3.1, ch. 7**\). 

 The methodology synthesises aspects of transformative learning, appreciative inquiry, the most significant change technique and practitioner evaluation. Its participatory nature engages young people, youth workers and external stakeholders in the generation of narratives of change. **The key findings of this initial research indicate that TE improves understanding of the demands of evaluating practice for both youth workers \(3.2\) and their wider organisations \(3.3\), promotes youth workers’ active re\-engagement with evaluation, and enables practitioners to identify and communicate the impact of youth work to a range of stakeholders \(3.1\).** 

 Funded by an Erasmus grant, the second stage of underpinning research, led by Dr Jon Ord, Associate Professor of Education, involved testing the applicability of the TE methodology among larger groups of professionals and more diverse youth work organisations between 2015 and 2017, in five European countries \(England, Finland, Estonia, Italy, France\) \( **3.A**\). The Erasmus research project generated 715 stories from individual young people in three open\-access youth centres in each of the five countries to identify the impact of youth work \( **3.5**\). The data was coded separately in each of the five country contexts and then over\-arching themes were produced through further thematic analysis – the themes were Sense of self, Creating places and spaces for young people, Relating to others, Experiential learning, Social inclusion *.* 

 **The outcomes of this underpinning research were two\-fold – firstly, that youth work organisations were able to better identify the outcomes of their work \(3.1; 3.3; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\), and secondly, that youth workers re\-engaged in the process of evaluation believing that the methodology provided a useful means of assessing and improving their practice \(3.1; 3.2; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6\).**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Background:** 

 The case study is set within the context of the challenges across Europe in evaluating youth work practice \( [EC, 2014](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/youth/library/study/youth-work-report_en.pdf);  [EC, 2015](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/youth/library/reports/quality-youth-work_en.pdf)\), which emphasises the importance and benefits of identifying impact. Similarly, in 2011 the UK government challenged the sector to produce ‘robust but sophisticated outcome measures … on young people's personal and social development’. Despite the production of the government\-funded Outcomes Framework \( [2012](https://youngfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Framework-of-outcomes-for-young-people-July-2012.pdf)\), methodologies identifying impact remain limited. 

 Our **innovative evaluation methodology – Transformative Evaluation** – was developed to respond to these challenges, despite a UK youth policy vacuum. **It is significant because it provides youth work organisations with a tool to demonstrate the impact of their work** and was initially implemented within North Devon Homes, southwest England. 

 Bolstered by favourable results and facilitated by Erasmus\+ funding \( **3.A**\), and later, with the initial research serving as foundation for further rigorous, peer\-reviewed research projects which carried out TE in Scotland \( **5.1**\) and Western Australia \( **5.2**\), the methodology has been implemented successfully across the youth work sector. For example, the Deputy Director of the Estonian Youth Work Centre commented of TE, ‘ **as an assessment tool, it filled a gap across Europe**’ \( **5.3**\). 

 **1\) Individual level** 

 Between 2016 and 2020, **young people, as beneficiaries, in a variety of national and international youth work settings reported ‘feeling heard and listened to’ during the TE process** \( **5.4; also 5.5**\), thus having their voice amplified \( **5.2, p.2; 5.6, p.34**\). **This impact is significant, because it helped increase their trust, leading to improved relationships with youth workers and greater engagement in programmes**. For example, Helsinki charity Youth Guarantee House’s Manager reported that young people in Finland said TE made them feel valued for themselves rather than their accomplishments when youth workers listened to them and changed their practice to focus on relationships instead of tangible outcomes \( **5.5**\). 

 **The methodology also empowers young people.** One example involves a young person at Space\*, a social enterprise in Devon, who verbalised how he gained a greater awareness of himself and his responsibilities through TE discussions, and **he can thus ‘take better life opportunities’** \( **5.7**\). Others, in Scotland, ‘ **spoke about their recognition of the youth worker as a trusted adult…for advice and support**’ \( **5.1, p. 24**\). Evidence from a report published in 2019 by NHS Health Scotland indicates that ‘young people consistently view the trusted adult role as positive and indicate that it can help achieve outcomes such as higher educational attainment, optimism, self\-efficacy and reduced internalising symptoms’ \( **5.8, p.2**\). By enabling youth workers to recognise the importance of their role as a trusted adult and improve their practice \(noted below\), **TE supports better outcomes for young people in adult life**. 

 TE has numerous positive impacts on **youth workers as beneficiaries**. Youth workers corroborated the underpinning research findings of feeling alienated from existing methods of evaluation \(section 2\). In Estonia, **they reported being reinvigorated by TE**, finding it more complementary to their working practices, of greater relevance and producing better evidence of impact \( **5.3**\). Further, the Director of the UK charity Barefoot maintains the methodology **‘engendered a realisation among practitioners of the extent and importance of their work’**, especially of the ‘far\-reaching impacts on \[young people’s\] lives’ \( **5.4\); it also provides them with a tool to more easily demonstrate to others the impact of their work** \( **5.3**\), a task that they often find difficult. 

 In addition, youth workers in Finland, England, Estonia, Australia and Scotland reported that, since 2014, **the cyclical nature of TE has helped them improve their practice**, including through opportunities for reflection. In Australia, one stated, ‘\[It\] helped to more actively identify changes in a young person and provide that feedback for them….I was able to identify the things that I do well and perhaps other aspects of my work that I could improve on’ \( **5.6, p.39**\). Other impacts included: being better able to perceive and respond to young people’s preferences and needs \( **5.2, p.8; 5.4; 5.5**\); increased understanding of the significance of and need to develop trusting relationships \( **5.5; 5.2, pp.1\-2,7\-10; 5.1, p.26**\) and of the importance of providing an inclusive, non\-judgmental, safe space for young people \( **5.1, pp.24,26,28; 5.2, pp.7\-9,12\-13; 5,3; 5.5; 5.6, p.39; 5.7**\), which in turn reinforced these practices. **TE thus resulted in youth workers’ ability to better contextualise young people’s stories to inform future work and development of programmes, activities and policies affecting them \(5.4; 5.9\).** 

 **2\) Organisational level** 

 **At organisational level, TE leads to more robust evidence of impact \(5.3\). This results in better understanding of best practice at managerial level, further leading to improvements in procedures.** The Manager at Youth Guarantee House commented that the information arising from TE led directly to a policy shift in 2019 where developing relationships was prioritised \( **5.5**\). The Director of Barefoot asserted TE revealed the importance and effectiveness of relationship\-building and outdoor activities; thus, specific funding was recently sought and acquired \(from The Health Trust\) for trips out combining these two elements of youth work \( **5.4**\). **Such impact benefits the organisations, practitioners and young people**. 

 Because TE evidence is reliable and accessible, **organisations can better communicate the outcomes and value of youth work to stakeholders**, for example, local councillors, health board officers, politicians, parents and headteachers, **and to the wider community** \( **5.1, pp.5\-6; 5.3; 5.4; 5.6, pp.41\-43**\), all of whom benefit. Organisations in Western Australia report that the methodology made a significant contribution to stakeholders gaining a better understanding of youth work, appreciating the knowledge, skills and complexity of judgement required by youth workers \( **5.6, pp.41\-43**\). Various Scottish organisations stressed that TE ‘\[provided\] much\-needed evidence to support the youth work sector to sustain and further develop their service’ \( **5.1, Executive Summary**\). In England, the Director of Barefoot maintains ‘ **TE served to change people’s perspectives about youth work, affirming the organisation, especially \[outside\] the sector**’, with plans for local residents to become involved in the process \( **5.3**\), **indicating that TE’s positive impact extends into society more generally**. 

 Moreover, **TE strengthens staff learning, facilitates sharing practice, and builds teamwork.** In England, TE has been used as a staff learning tool, because it ‘fostered in youth workers the ability to become better attuned to noticing what young people want, hearing them when they say it, and adjusting their practice accordingly’ \( **5.4**\). In Estonia \( **5.3**\) and Australia, TE ‘created opportunities for reflection and peer discussion around practice’ \( **5.6, p.39**\). 

 **3\) Policy level** 

 **Transformative Evaluation has been adopted at regional and national policy levels**. Most significantly, **the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research implemented the methodology as a key qualitative evaluation tool for the assessment of youth work**. The Estonian Youth Work Centre, under the Ministry’s authority, embedded TE into its current Annual Activity Plan 2020 \( **5.10**\) and provided financial support in 2019 for the Estonian Association of Youth Workers to roll out the methodology in 10 municipalities. In 2019\-20, youth workers were trained in the methodology and it was disseminated throughout Estonia \( **5.3**\). 

 **The methodology has also been integrated into youth work organisations’ policy and extended to other organisations, thus enhancing assessment and practice.** Perth Inner City Youth Service \(PICYS\) in Australia and Space\* in Devon have embedded TE into their service model \( **5.2, p.15; 5.9**\). In 2019, Youth Guarantee House integrated its use into its normal annual procedures and extended it across Finland \( **5.5**\). In Plymouth, Barefoot recently acquired expansion funding, and TE is being built into the new structure of the organisation \( **5.4**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Stirling research has decreased demands on personnel time and delivered economic benefits for three industrial partners. The diverse impacts all share core combinatorial optimisation challenges, solved using our applied research into computational modelling, metaheuristic design, and search techniques \(Figure 1\). 

 **Impact 1:** Enhanced workforce scheduling for all **23,000 field engineers** at British Telecommunications plc via our engineer scheduling system, underpinning savings to December 31 2020 of **GBP1,293,000** for BT. 

 **Impact 2:** Our novel approaches to the automation of software bug fixing saved **GBP1,460,000** in development costs at Janus Rehabilitation Centre \(Iceland\). An additional saving of at least **GBP4,200,000** \(to 2020\) to the Icelandic economy comes from Janus’s use of our predictive modelling. 

 **Impact 3:** At KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, our research on automatically improving computer code increased the reliability of scheduling for **200,000 flights** \(reaching \~60,000,000 passengers\), reducing KLM’s costs and saving a total of 2 years of personnel time. These benefits drove a **fundamental shift in best practice** towards adoption of automated software tuning across KLM and Air France development teams. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Metaheuristics are a well\-established family of techniques including stochastic local search and evolutionary algorithms. The underpinning research for our impact in this area has largely been funded by the EPSRC programme grant Dynamic Adaptive Automated Software Engineering \(DAASE\) EP/J017515/1, of which, University of Stirling led the *Hyperheuristics* research theme. This project explored automated search techniques for optimisation problems in both *employee scheduling* and *software engineering*. Specifically, finding the best algorithm to efficiently solve a given problem to a required quality, and understanding how different approaches to formulating problems affect search efficiency. Our novel approaches included development of new search operators, new encodings for solutions, new approaches to guide the search process and automated approaches known as hyperheuristics to tailor these to a particular application. 

 *Employee scheduling* is the assignment of duties to employees over a period so that certain organisational and personal constraints are satisfied. Our research has developed techniques for this and similar scale problems elsewhere, that were adapted and applied to employee scheduling problems at BT \[see **Impact 1**\]. Stirling’s Li proposed several hybrid methods to solve challenging combinatorial problems at an industrial scale. These have included Evolutionary Ruin & Stochastic Recreate \(ER&SR\) algorithm, combined with the Taguchi design of experiments method for parameter setting \[ **P1**\], Multi\-Objective Simulated Annealing \[ **P2**\], and Variable Neighbourhood Search \(VNS\) combined with simulated annealing \[ **P3**\]. 

 *Search based software engineering* \(SBSE\) applies search\-based techniques like evolutionary algorithms to software engineering problems, such as improving existing source code. This spans from tuning hard\-coded parameters, to moving lines of source around, to modifying individual keywords, variables and operators. Objectives targeted by the search include minimising failed tests \(i.e. fixing bugs\), increasing accuracy of computational models, minimising run time \(i.e. increasing speed\), or minimising energy consumption. We developed new SBSE approaches, including code micromutations \[ **P4**\], and automatically generating test cases \[ **P5**\]. One of the first real\-world deployments for these two approaches was in Janus Rehabilitation management software \[see **Impact 2**\]. We also investigated systematic approaches to hyper\-parameter tuning for improving the accuracy of machine learning software \[ **P6**\] and the fitness landscapes formed by different search operators \[ **P4**\]. This underpinned our work with KLM where we applied search\-based methods to tuning their simulation software, Opium \[see **Impact 3**\]. 

 The value placed on this work by each partner is demonstrated by their commitment to ongoing research collaboration. BT have funded a PhD studentship and supported an EPSRC Fellowship proposal with Brownlee. KLM have supported EPSRC project EP/N029577/2 on which Brownlee is a co\-i. Janus are now partners on the \(external, Lancaster University\) EPSRC project EP/S005730/1 on which Haraldsson was a named researcher before returning to Stirling as a lecturer. The work with Janus has also led to ongoing collaboration between Haraldsson, the Icelandic Government, and two Icelandic rehabilitation associations \[ **E6**\]. 

 An overview of the underpinning research and the impacts it led to is illustrated in Figure 1.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research in novel optimisation approaches using metaheuristics has underpinned several industrial collaborations, and approaches developed by us have been adopted within several companies. The relationship with each company has been fostered over many years of collaboration, with personnel from Stirling and each respective company exchanging visits to explore possible application areas, present results, and seek feedback. Stirling staff were seconded to each partner \(funded by the DAASE project and the companies\) for multiple weeks to fully understand the business needs and identify interesting research problems. BT was a named partner on the DAASE project; Janus Rehabilitation and KLM were introduced to the project team by personal connections. 

 The applications are very different, but the underlying research techniques and ultimate benefits are common. The key impact in each company has been to save employee time: through more efficient allocation of jobs to the workforce and through faster running software. This indirectly leads to saving money as paid staff make better use of their time. These benefits have been demonstrated at three companies, two of which are international in scale: 

##  Impact 1: Engineer Scheduling at BT 

 British Telecommunications plc operates a large\-scale field engineering workforce to service its customers, and build and maintain its core telecommunications network. This is a critical piece of UK infrastructure connecting the majority of UK households and businesses, and resold by most UK Internet Service Providers. In order to meet demand, over 23,000 engineers are employed. Our work with BT has drawn on our group’s expertise to apply metaheuristics to automate and optimise the allocation of employees to jobs. This is underpinned by our research in workforce scheduling \[ **P3**\], and required the development of improved algorithms building on our earlier work \[ **P1, P2**\]. The impact on the logistics staff has been significant: the “iRoster” suite that we have co\-produced, launched on 1/1/2018, has been attributed to savings of over **GBP1,293,000** for BT \(up to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020, extrapolated from the GBP470,000 figure to 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2019 provided by BT\). This is currently in the process of development in other regions of the business, signalling the ongoing and increasing impact of our work. This impact has been noted in a testimonial letter from BT Research: “the generated schedules furthermore provide a higher level of quality than the baseline solution at BT” and “algorithms and problem formulation provided by this project are part of a software suite known as iRoster… found to enable cost savings of £470,000 to date” \[ **E1**\]. It is also discussed in general terms in a magazine article \[ **E2**\]. The impact has had wide reach, scheduling **all 23,000 engineers across the UK**. BT’s confidence in the system is demonstrated by its continued and expanding use: “the work produced in this project has been successfully re\-implemented for use in roster optimisation for desk\-based resources” \[ **E1**\]. 

##  Impact 2: Patient Management at Janus Rehabilitation 

 Janus Rehabilitation is an independent vocational rehabilitation centre located in Iceland. It provides a structured programme of therapy to help people recovering from physical and mental health issues, enabling them back into education or work. Janus treats around 150 patients at any one time \(12% of the total for Iceland\), and their work saved Icelandic society GBP8,000,000 over 2017\-2019. It is one of the three largest such facilities after the Icelandic Government’s own hospital. Our research led to impact on Janus’ operations through applications developed by Haraldsson; with their testimonial noting that “collectively, \[Dr Haraldsson’s\] research and expert consultations have impacted individuals, JR, and Icelandic society as a whole”. Our research enabled an organisation \(Janus\) whose main business is not software development to have access to bespoke software suited to their needs with ongoing support and maintenance at a fraction of the usual cost. This was achieved through an automatic bug\-fixing tool: our automated approaches to test\-case generation \[ **P5**\] enabled this tool to replicate errors that were detected, and our code micro\-mutation approaches \[ **P4**\] were deployed to fixing the errors: 22 bugs were repaired over a six\-month period, noted by us in a reflective paper \[ **E3**\]. “Average post\-delivery maintenance cost was decreased by approximately 50%” \[ **E4**\]. **Limited developer time was thus freed** to be spent on improving functionality. The bug\-fixing tool is still live so this impact is ongoing. Janus estimate that application of our research has a **significant financial savings** **impact of approximately GBP1,460,000**: allowing Janus to have a business\-critical management tool for around GBP40,000, where a competitor spent GBP1,500,000 on a similar system \[ **E4**\]. Furthermore, our software optimisation techniques were applied to enable rapid development of a predictive modelling tool for Janus; this has been used in the decision\-making process for 395 patients since January 2017 \[ **E4**\]. In this time, Dr Haraldsson’s work “contributed towards…, significant increase of JR’s success rate” \[ **E4**\]: **Janus’ success rate \(people returning to education or work\) has increased by 39%**; it is estimated that this equates to an extra **GBP1,400,000 million in savings** to Icelandic society \[ **E4**\]; projected to **GBP4,200,000** by the end of 2020, and Janus intend to continue to use the tool beyond 2020. 

##  Impact 3: Scheduling & Best Practice at KLM 

 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is an international airline carrying over 34 million passengers per year to 162 destinations using 209 aircraft. Our research in hyper\-parameter tuning and optimisation of software was applied to the in\-house software application ‘Opium’ at KLM by Brownlee during 2014\-2015. Opium tested the flight schedules for **all KLM flights** worldwide; “totalling over 25,000 flights each quarter” \[ **E5**\] while it was in use. Opium was tuned using our approach to make more accurate predictions \(meaning **more reliable schedules for 60,000,000 passengers** and less cost for the business\) and running 20% faster for the same accuracy \(meaning **more schedules could be tested, with less human time taken**, again reducing costs for the business\). The improved software was in place for two years, equating to approximately **200,000 flights**, before being replaced under a restructuring with Air France. During that time, system parameters were defined using University of Stirling research, replacing those developed “using around two years of developer time” \[ **E5**\] by KLM staff, thus saving future parameter\-tuning time. The Senior Data Scientist/Innovation Project Manager considers the “most important long\-term impact” of our collaboration to be the **fundamental shift in best practice** at Air France\-KLM toward the setting of software parameters \[ **E6**\], saving them developer time and improving efficiencies.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Diabetes affects over 450 million people worldwide, of whom \~30 million have Type 1 diabetes and are wholly dependent on insulin replacement therapy. Most other diabetes patients have Type 2 diabetes, and about 25% of these will also require insulin treatment for part of their lives. Ground\-breaking University of Surrey research led to a new understanding of a hepato\-selective long\-acting insulin analogue \(detemir\) which informed the development of a further long\-acting insulin analogue degludec \(sold in 86 countries\), and of a complementary rapid\-acting analogue, Fiasp \(sold in 33 countries\). Substantial benefits have resulted for diabetes patients and for healthcare policy, and considerable commercial impact has occurred through sales of the new insulin analogues \(>£1.6 bn\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Effective management of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin therapy is essential to prevent potentially life\-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and minimise associated long\-term complications by maintaining close to normal, healthy levels of blood sugar. Poor glycaemic control can lead to early\-onset and increased severity of long\-term complications affecting eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels of diabetes patients. 

 In 2004, Professor David L. Russell\-Jones led a collaboration between The University of Surrey and King’s College London which established that because Novo Nordisk’s insulin analogue detemir \(trade name Levemir®\) bound albumin, it would have relatively less access across the tight endothelium in peripheral tissues and relatively more access across the open sinusoidal lining in the liver **\[3.1\]**. 

 These features restore the physiological gradient of greater insulin exposure to the liver than to peripheral tissues. The result is better glycaemic control in diabetes patients than by traditional insulin replacement therapies which create a different \(‘unphysiological’\) distribution of insulin throughout the body when compared to the natural situation, in which the majority of insulin produced by the pancreas is delivered to the liver, and relatively less reaches peripheral tissues. 

 This new knowledge on the value of liver\-selective insulin analogues prompted a step\-change in insulin research by Novo Nordisk, the major provider of global diabetes pharmaceuticals. 

 In collaboration with Novo Nordisk, Prof Russell\-Jones joined an international consortium of academics and clinicians which went on to research and optimise insulin analogues. Modifying the structure of insulin and the way in which it is carried within the circulation makes it possible to alter both the distribution and the biological effects of the resulting ‘insulin analogues’. Such insulin analogues can be longer acting and can offer better glycaemic control for diabetes patients: \(i\) by providing a continuous low level of insulin in the circulation throughout the day, rather than a peak activity at administration that can compromise glycaemic control; and in so doing, \(ii\) reducing the risk of night\-time variations in blood glucose levels. This crucial collaborative research resulted in the development of the detemir follow\-on, degludec \(Novo Nordisk, trade name Tresiba®\), a long\-acting insulin analogue for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. 

 Whist long\-acting insulin analogues greatly improve chronic glycaemic control over previous insulin treatments; a number of diabetes patients receiving them may still struggle to achieve control of their blood glucose levels around mealtimes. To further improve glycaemic control in these patients, Prof Russell\-Jones led trials that established an enhanced clinical value for Type 1 patients of the rapid\-acting insulin aspart \(Novo Nordisk, trade name Fiasp®\). Fiasp® more closely matches the healthy body’s physiological response to improve glycaemic control after mealtimes by working more quickly in the bloodstream following injection than existing treatments **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. This Surrey led research identified that the combination of the long\-acting degludec \(Tresiba®\) and fast\-acting insulin aspart \(Fiasp®\) improved night\-time glycaemic control, compared with the combination of Fiasp® and the previous conventional treatment of glargine **\[3.2, 3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research at the University of Surrey led by Professor David L. Russell\-Jones prompted a new vision for the design of insulin analogue therapies for diabetes patients. By exposing the liver\-selective properties of the long\-acting detemir, his work underpinned the development, clinical testing and approval to market of the improved insulin analogue, degludec. To complement this long\-acting treatment for diabetes, a rapid\-acting analogue, Fiasp®, was also developed and approved. These new insulin products have impacted on national and international healthcare policy and significantly benefitted diabetes patients worldwide **\[5.1\]**. The commercial impact has been considerable. 

###  **1.** **Impact on national and international healthcare policy** 

###  Degludec 

 In the UK, degludec was accepted for use in September 2013 when it was featured in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) Type I diabetes Evidence Summary **\[5.2\]**; Prof Russell\-Jones co\-authored all three clinical studies on which this evidence summary was based **\[3.2, 3.6\]**. On the basis of this evidence summary, degludec was recognised by the NICE diabetes guidelines for the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, in children, young people and adults, including those with diabetic co\-morbidities such as eye disease **\[5.3\]**. Following UK approval, degludec was then authorised by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) for the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in the European Union, in adults and children aged 1\-18 years **\[5.4\]**. The basis of this authorisation included evidence published by Prof Russell\-Jones **\[3.3\]**, such as clinical study NCT01079234. Furthermore, degludec was approved in the USA by the Food & Drug Administration \(FDA\) in 2015 **\[5.5\]**, who also cite NCT01079234 by its other study identification number NN1250\-3770. 

 **Fiasp**® 

 Underpinned by the clinical trials led by Prof Russell\-Jones **\[3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**, Fiasp® was approved throughout the European Union in January 2017 by the EMA **\[5.6\]**, citing clinical trial NCT01831765 to which Prof Russell\-Jones’ studies contributed **\[3.4, 3.5\]**, in Canada by Health Canada, also in January 2017 **\[5.7\]**, and in the USA in September 2017 by the FDA **\[5.8\]** who cite clinical trial NCT01831765 by its other study identification number NN1218\-3852. 

###  **2.** **Impact on patient quality of life and cost\-effectiveness of healthcare delivery** 

 The long\-acting liver\-selective nature of degludec enables more consistent day\-to\-day blood glucose profiles. Also, it reduces glucose variability during the day compared with conventional neutral protamine Hagedorn \(NPH\) insulin preparations **\[5.9\]**. This mitigates extreme fluctuations in blood glucose, which in turn defers the onset and reduces the severity of the widely experienced long\-term complications of glycaemic dysregulation which affects the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels of diabetes patients. Furthermore, it helps to prevent blood glucose levels falling too low \(hypoglycaemia\) when patients can feel hungry and eat more, contributing to weight gain with concomitant poorer health outcomes. Despite the advantages of the long\-acting insulin analogues, many diabetes patients receiving them still struggle to achieve control of their blood glucose levels around mealtimes. Prof Russell\-Jones’ research demonstrated that the fast\-acting insulin analogue Fiasp® improves glycaemic control after mealtimes and that combining the long\-acting \(degludec\) and fast\-acting \(Fiasp®\) insulin analogues significantly reduced night\-time episodes of dysregulated glycaemic control **\[3.2, 3.6\]**. This work has significantly benefitted diabetic patients globally and contributed to improved cost\-effectiveness of healthcare delivery for diabetic patients. The cost\-effectiveness of degludec has been analysed using the IMS CORE diabetes model. The model showed that over a lifetime, treatment for Type 1 with degludec is cheaper and more effective than treatment with either glargine or detemir, with a cost per quality\-adjusted life\-year \(QALY\) of £13,220 \(below the commonly used cost\-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY\) **\[5.10\]**. 

###  3. Commercial impact 

 Degludec \(Tresiba®\) and insulin aspart \(Fiasp®\) are truly ground\-breaking products providing not only significant patient benefit but also impressive revenue generation. They are currently marketed globally by Novo Nordisk both as discrete products and in insulin combinations \(Ryzodeg® & Xultophy®\) with a combined sales revenue in 2019 in excess of £1.6bn **\[5.11\]**. 

 \- Tresiba®, insulin degludec \(DKK9259m=£1.1bn\) 

 \- Fiasp®, fast\-acting insulin aspart \(DKK1243m=£151m\) 

 \- Ryzodeg® 70/30, insulin degludec/insulin aspart \(DKK993m=£120m\) 

 \- Xultophy®, insulin degludec/liraglutide \(DKK2210m=£269m\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on public transport system performance, undertaken by the  [Transport Strategy Centre](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/transport-studies/transport-strategy-centre/academic-research/) \(TSC\) within the  [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/), has led to direct improvements in the design, management and operations of mass transit systems in the world’s largest cities. 

 The TSC pioneered the development and application of an analytical platform for the measurement and evaluation of system performance across multiple domains.  Continuous collaboration was established with over 110 major transport operators serving over 500,000,000 citizens. In addition to the obvious societal impact in improving transport in many countries, the financial impact of our research is estimated to be over GBP1,000,000,000 over the current REF period, including: 

-  CAD500,000,000 in capital cost savings to the Montreal Metro. 

-  GBP350,000,000 per annum increase in passenger revenue in Beijing. 

-  A 33% increase in design capacity for new metro lines in Guangzhou.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 An analytical platform to measure and evaluate the relative performance of mass transit systems has been pioneered jointly by Transport Strategy Centre \(TSC\)  \(formerly called RTSC\) co\-Directors  [Professor Daniel Graham](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.j.graham) and  [Richard Anderson](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/richard.anderson) in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Imperial. It is based on continuous cooperative industrial collaboration, organised in the form of operator consortia, to generate the data and information necessary for fundamental statistical analysis, along with the funding required to support underpinning research and its translation into practice. Throughout the current REF period, TSC has managed 9 consortia comprising over 100 major public transport operators around the world \(modal coverage: urban metros, light railways, mainline railways, buses, airports and infrastructure providers\). Since 2000, Graham, Anderson and their colleagues have developed data collection systems, benchmarking methodologies, analytical approaches, statistical models and processes to facilitate the application and impact of research to industry. The TSC is the sole researcher and facilitator of the consortia and, due to its unique ability to procure data across a global network, no other organisation worldwide undertakes similar research for the mass transport sector. 

 The underpinning research comprises three key strands: 

1.  **Development of an analytical framework to measure and evaluate performance \[R4\]** – Continuous development of robust and rigorous data definitions and systems to evaluate public transport performance, with formalised data capture, validation and collection on an annualised basis across consortia. The data generated via industrial collaboration provide a unique longitudinal source that form the basis of our performance analytics platform. 

1.  **Statistical modelling to identify performance drivers \[R1, R2, R3\]** – Statistical modelling tools have been developed to evaluate public transport performance and uniquely identify the determinants of performance across multiple domains of operation. For example, modelling of service provision \[R1\] quantified the role of operational and exogenous characteristics in efficient resource usage, resulting in an improved understanding of optimal capacity provision. The modelling of incidents causing delays to train service \[R3\] identified key factors influencing reliability, and has been used by operators such as the Shanghai Metro to contribute to a 5\-fold improvement in reliability. Empirical analysis of metro ridership \[R2\] quantified the responsiveness of demand to changes in fare levels, income and quality of service, which has been used to directly influence fares policy in a number of global cities including extensive application in Beijing. 

1.  **Systematic analysis of operator\-specific performance and underlying policies, processes and practices** **\[R5, R6\]** – Empirical evidence on capacity utilisation and passenger responsiveness to crowding \[R5\] has been complemented with further quantitative and qualitative investigative research relating to the design and operation of high\-capacity metro systems \[R6\]. This work has been used to make the case for higher levels of investment and capacity in mass transit systems.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The TSC designed and continuously manages an innovative, formal process to organise engagement with and dissemination to industry, providing a clear path from research to impact. A key innovation has been the establishment of industry consortia, steered by member public transport organisations and facilitated by the TSC. This continuous engagement enables the generation of unique longitudinal data and detailed observations that form the basis of the underpinning analytical research. 

 The nine consortia include the  [Community of Metros](http://cometandnova.org/) \(42 metros from major cities such as Paris and Beijing\), the  [International Bus Benchmarking Group](http://busbenchmarking.org/) \(16 organisations including TfL London Buses, Istanbul IETT\) and the  [American Bus Benchmarking Group](https://americanbusbenchmarking.org/) \(21 operators\). Other consortia encompass operators of mainline railway operators and airports. 

 Impact has arisen from significant improvements to the design of public transport systems, financial efficiency, fare and funding mechanisms, and the measurement and management of service quality. The impact cited, are a selection from 10 of the 110 consortia partners where the sum of per annum and one\-off financial benefits cited exceeds GBP1,000,000,000.  Many policy benefits, once established, generally continue for some years beyond the initial impact.  We would expect further social and economic impact to arise from the improvements to service quality and enhanced design, but these are not easily quantifiable. 

 Five key categories of impact generated in the period August 2013 to July 2020 are as follows.  Each category is supported by evidence provided by one or more transport companies in six countries: UK, China, USA, Canada, Portugal and Turkey, who benefitted directly from our research. 

 **I1.**  **Change in the design and planning of new metro lines in mega\-cities \(underpinning research R1, R5, R6\)** 

 The rapid development of metros in China and India has been directly influenced by TSC research that has strengthened the economic \( **R1, R5**\) and operational \( **R6**\) case for higher\-capacity metro lines, enhancing the benefits that metros bring to mega\-cities: 

 **\[Source 1.1**  [**Guangzhou Metro Company**](http://cs.gzmtr.com/ckfwEnglish/) **, 2017\- ongoing\].** 10 new metro lines or extensions have been designed with larger and longer trains representing an increase in train capacity of 33%.   The evidence states that: 

 *“Ongoing expansion projects, including 10 new lines or extensions totalling 258.1 km between 2017 and 2023, are being directly influenced by the research carried out by the TSC at Imperial College London.”* 

 **I2.** **Directly influencing funding policy \(underpinning research R2\)** 

 Statistical research \( **R2**\) into the responsiveness of public transport demand was combined with evidence from the longitudinal datasets and syntheses of policy and practice.  The impact has been significant changes to fares and funding policies in several cities: 

 \[ **Source 2.1:**  [**Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp. Ltd**](https://www.bjsubway.com/) **., 2015\-ongoing\]** Fares structures were changed for the metro in Beijing, contributing to a GBP352,660,000 per annum increase in revenue from 2015. TSC presented its research to the Chinese Government in 2012. 

 \[ **Source 2.2: Lisbon City Bus Operator,**  [**Carris**](https://www.carris.pt/en/) **, 2017\-2020\]** the TSC directly helped to secure up to EUR30,000,000 of government funding, supporting a more sustainable public transport system. 

 **\[Source 2.3: Newcastle Metro,**  [**Nexus**](https://www.nexus.org.uk/) **, 2017\]**: states *“the assistance that Nexus received from the RTSC was instrumental in helping Nexus acquire £337 million of capital grant from the UK Government.”* 

 **I3.** **Improving cost efficiency \(underpinning body of related research\)** 

 Public transport operators have used TSC research to make the case for and achieve significant improvements in cost efficiency: 

 **\[Source 3.1: Montreal Metro,**  [**Société de Transport de Montréal**](http://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/metro) **, 2014\-ongoing\]**: *“The STM has therefore decided to extend the useful life of the MR\-73 cars to 60 years.  The discussions leading to this decision were based on a 2012 report by Imperial College London \(“Rolling Stock Replacement vs Refurbishment”\)…This scenario would generate savings of nearly $500m* \[CAD500million\] *”* 

 **\[Source 3.2, Istanbul City Bus Operator,**  [**IETT**](https://www.iett.istanbul/en) **, 2014\-2017\]**: *“RTSC’s research allowed us to make savings to our operating expenditure which roughly amounts to 59 million TL per year \(equivalent to 50 million USD PPP\) by nearly halving layover hours without impacting the service quality.”* 

 **I4.** **Enhancing service quality and safety \(underpinning research R3, R4, R6\)** 

 Datasets of enhanced granularity, designed by TSC, have bolstered the modelling of public transport service quality. Statistical analysis \( **R3**\), the development of performance measures \( **R4**\) and operational research \( **R6**\) have directly led to quantifiable and strategic improvements to service quality with far\-reaching benefits: 

 **\[Source 4.1 Shanghai Metro, SSMG, 2009\-2017\]** Research application yielded a 12\-fold improvement in reliability between 2009 and 2017 \(a 5 fold increase between 2013 and 2017\) and contributed to a 6% increase train speeds on Line 12. 

 \[ **Source 4.2: Transport for London,**  [**London Buses**](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/) **, 2014\-2018**\]: Strategic application of the TSC’s research \( **R4**\) provided the impetus to TFL to maintain bus speeds, informed TfL’s bus safety program and changed the way service quality is measured. 

 **I5.** **Providing new performance measurement tools \(underpinning research R4\)** 

 Research into improved performance measurement methods by TSC, has been adopted and used at the highest levels of operator organisations, providing new insight on performance from a customer perspective: 

 **\[Source 5.1:**  [**New York City Transit**](https://new.mta.info/about-us/our-agencies/mta-nyc-transit) **, 2017\-ongoing\]**: *“The annual Key Performance Indicator research is regularly used to inform Senior Executives how NYCT compares…..NYCT introduced new customer\-focused indicators…These metrics were inspired by passenger metrics at other CoMET systems, and by TSC research carried out for the IBBG..”* 

 **\[Source 5.2:**  [**Hampton Roads Transit**](https://gohrt.com/) **, 2012\-ongoing\]:** *“HRT decided to adopt ABBG’s definition for On\-Time Performance and data collection methodology as developed by TSC”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Our research has shaped the understanding and implementation of national and international laws and policies protecting asylum\-seeking and trafficked children and adults. It has ensured the development of Guardianship schemes for all trafficked children in England and Wales, and in addition for unaccompanied minors in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It has also helped to reverse government policy, ensuring that unaccompanied asylum seeking\-children would regain access to legal aid. The research has extended public and professional understanding of Modern Slavery and its impact on trafficked people; it has changed narratives about refugees, highlighting their contributions to their new societies across Europe; and has improved practices for those who work with people who are vulnerable through forced migration. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Every year people engage in *forced migration* when they move from their homelands because of war, poverty or natural disaster. While their reasons for moving extend beyond the definitions of the 1951 Refugee Convention and allied protocol, understanding the experiences of those forced to migrate is vital to supporting them in their new countries. In shaping the meanings of support for forced migrants, our empirical enquiries encompass their needs and vulnerabilities as well as their capabilities within countries of sanctuary. In line with this latter focus, our work adds a distinctive new thread to the empirical literature, using arts\-based methodologies. These contributions define and refine the ways refugees are understood as help seekers and as bridge builders within new societies. Together, these engagements exemplify our approach to refugees as talented creators and curators of their lives. 

 Our underpinning research has focussed on unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children. This work laid a foundation for understanding how they sought \(and sometimes found\) safety, belonging and success in new countries. Our work tracked young asylum seekers’ experiences of keeping silence and secrets, and managing time, transitions and waiting, as well as foster care and food pathways. Cody’s work from 2013, as one example, focussed on the meaning of ‘reintegration’ for unaccompanied \(including trafficked\) children \[ **3.1**\].  Since that time our work has broadened to include adults who are trafficked, as well as forced migrants displaced through natural disasters and poverty. On the basis of our range of work, we were commissioned by the Home Office to evaluate the provision of independent Guardianship for unaccompanied minors and other children subject to trafficking in England and Wales. \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Consolidating this focus, our research has examined other issues facing forced migrants. In 2015, Connolly authored the first of two research reports \(an update was published in 2017\) on separated migrant children’s access to legal aid in partnership with the Children’s Society \[ **3.2**\]. Between 2017 and 2019, Hynes led a four country study on human trafficking across Albania, Viet Nam, Nigeria and the UK in partnership with the International Organization for Migration \(IOM\) and funded by the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund \(MSIF\) \[ **3.3**\]. Funded by the British Academy, Hutchinson worked across several research projects in partnership with *Terre des Hommes* \- *Lausanne* \(Tdh\) on child protection in refugee communities \[ **3.4**\]. This work, examining early marriage as a tactic of survival for young women in the context of forced migration, has built a framework within which risk and protective factors can be understood by practitioners and policy makers in nuanced, context specific ways. It demonstrated the efficacy of a tool used to assess hope and resilience \[the Hope tool\] among migrant children, paving the way for better more targeted support. 

 In 2016, Wroe founded the charity ‘ *Social Work without Borders*’. The charity takes a social justice approach to its work. It provides pro\-bono expert social work reports for people enduring asylum and immigration decisions. In 2019 Wroe’s reference book \[ **3.6**\], linked to the charity’s values and commitments, brought together academics, asylum seekers, practitioners and activists to define and promote social justice based approaches to working with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in the UK and internationally. 

 The ESRC funded ‘separated child migrants' care relationships and caring practices’ project \[2019\-2023\], on which Kohli is Co\-I, has begun to describe how children care for one another in contexts of forced migration.  In 2020 Kohli as PI received funding from NordForsk for a 4 year project on *Relational Wellbeing in the lives of young* \[adult\] *refugees in Finland, Norway and the UK*. It was one of seven projects funded by NordForsk out of 220 applications by international research teams.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our work has informed legislative design in all UK countries. It has impacted on social policy to generate supportive and sustainable futures for forced migrants. It has improved professional practices across a range of state and non\-state actors internationally, as shown below. 

 **Impact on UK legislation and social policy** 

 Our work has led to independent Guardianship being established for all trafficked children in England and Wales, and for unaccompanied asylum seeking children in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The role of a Guardian is to provide reliable and trusted long term adult support for a child, and to link and bridge between welfare, immigration and criminal justice services to secure the best interests of that child. A Guardian is, to use a term coined by us in 2013, someone who is *by the child’s side, and on their side*, as they navigate these complex systems. In 2010 we evaluated the first such scheme in Scotland. In 2014 we pioneered the plans for a Guardianship service in Northern Ireland. Our 2015 report \[ **3.5**\] took the next steps in defining Guardianship within the terms of s48 of The Modern Slavery Act 2015. It set the foundations for a new independent service in England and Wales. Via ane Independent Expert Advisory Panel on child trafficking, we advise the Home Office on the rollout of Guardianship in England and Wales. 

 Since 2012, Kohli has acted as an advisor to a number of Select Committees in both Houses of Parliament, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Migration, and the Children’s Commissioner for England. Following our work on Guardianship, in 2018 Kohli was invited to advise and assist parliamentarians in reviewing s48 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and its impact on child trafficking \[ **5.2**\]. This resulted directly, *inter alia*, to the Government dispensing with the title of Independent Child Trafficking *Advocate* \(ICTA\) and replacing it with Independent Child Trafficking *Guardian* \(ICTG\) to reflect the role’s scope beyond advocacy, as indicated by our empirical findings. The parliamentarians that formed the review committee \[Baron Field \(then Frank Field MP\), Baroness Elizabeth Butler\-Sloss, Maria Miller, MP\] noted in February 2019 that:  *We were all hugely impressed by the breadth and quality of the evidence you gathered, as well as the level of personal and professional insight you brought to your commentary and recommendations. We have studied your findings and proposals closely to inform our own recommendations to the Home Office, and I am sure you will be able to recognise your influence clearly reflected in our interim report. Your contribution to the Review on this topic has been invaluable to us.* \[ **5.2**\] Kohli’s underpinning empirical work on silence and secrets in the lives of unaccompanied children was chosen in 2020 by the British Journal of Social Work as among 50 outputs that are *crucial in understanding social work in the past and informing research and practice of the future*. 

 Connolly’s 2015 research \(updated by her in 2017\) on the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 \(LASPO\) on separated migrant children was crucial in enabling their access to legal aid. Before 2012, about 2,500 separated migrant children per year had relied on legal aid to resolve their immigration claims. This stopped as LASPO came into force. Connolly’s research was used to successfully bring separated children back into scope of legal aid in October 2019 \- the only group to be brought back into scope. Through this work, scope now includes children’s citizenships claims in legal aid for the first time, as well as legal aid applications for EU nationals. In a testimonial to Connolly’s work the Children’s Society noted in December 2020 that: *Dr Connolly …ensured our work was of the highest standard but also worked in ways that helped us to maximise impact and retain a tight focus on the needs of unaccompanied children and the needs of our judicial review*… *Dr Connolly’s work with us is one of the best examples of academic impact we have come across* \[ **5.1**\] 

 **International impacts** 

 From 2013 Cody’s research has yielded fresh understandings of the differences between ‘reunification’ \(a line of connection back with family\) to ‘reintegration’ \(a circle of wellness within a community\). This holistic approach led to her output \[ **3.1**\] within her broader work of designing a toolkit for monitoring and evaluating reintegration for separated children. It was subsequently disseminated by the RISE Learning Network \(led by the international NGO Family for Every Child\) across 12 ‘learning partners’ in sub\-Saharan Africa, South Central Asia and Latin America \[ **5.1**\]. The findings from this work were cited extensively by the UN Special Rapporteur in 2015 in her report on care, recovery and reintegration programmes for child victims of sale and sexual exploitation \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Through Hutchinson’s pioneering evaluation of the Hope tool, building on \[ **3.3**\], community\-based child protection programmes have been deployed by Terre des hommes \(Tdh\) to build resilience amongst Palestinian refugees. The training and investment in social workers that the programme pioneered has resulted in the growth of workforce development teams in Tdh across the Middle East and North Africa \(MENA\) region. This can be corroborated through testimonies from Tdh country teams in Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. The results of Hutchinson’s work on child marriage among Syrian Refugees in Jordan and Lebanon was published in 2020 \[ **5.4**\]. Tdh is able to confirm via the sources cited under Hutchinson below, that this research has significantly influenced their programme and policy on child marriage, and informed applications to donors for funding. About 70% of their new framework of action on child marriage in the region is based on our research. 

 Working with the French charity *Apprentis D’Auteuil,* Kohli’s research was used to create innovative social work practices across four European States \(France, Italy, Germany and Greece\) \[ **5.3**\]. These are aimed at protecting and enhancing the everyday wellbeing of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A key output of this project was the production of online training via subscription to a Digital Notebook for those working directly with these children in Germany, Italy, France and Greece. This was launched in Paris in October 2020. The notebook currently has 1000 practitioner subscribers across Europe, with the aim of securing 3000 by the end of 2021, once the German, Italian and Greek versions of the Digital Notebook are launched. In appraising Kohli’s impact on the project, Apprentis D’Auteuil observed in April 2020: *Today, I can say without a doubt that inviting \[Kohli\] to join our project’s team was certainly one of the most crucial decisions we have made for our project’s success. Our fruitful common collaboration will most certainly have a significant impact on the field social work, when it comes to providing better care to unaccompanied minors in our countries in Europe. We are very grateful for the time and passion Professor Kohli brought to our project, and we hope that this only marks the beginning of our collaboration in the years to come...* 

 Opfermann’s and Evans’ research studies in South Africa and Scotland respectively \(submitted as outputs, not listed here\) using theatre and visual arts, precedes Kohli’s work using visual art methodologies in the NordForsk project. Turning the lives of young refugees into theatre based performance art or visual arts exemplifies our approach to refugees as talented curators of their lives. Moving beyond narratives of refugees as needy, these contributions define and refine ways these young people are understood as builders and creators within their new societies. 

  

 Hynes’ study of trafficked people \[ **3.3**\] resulted in expanded and enhanced networking amongst counter\-trafficking professionals across Viet Nam, Albania, Nigeria and the UK \[ **5.5**\]. The research report by Hynes is currently a key reference in the latest Country of Origin reports used by asylum decision makers at the Home Office \[ **5.5** shows the COI for Albania as an example\]. The study directly informed IOM’s approach and practice around social stigma in Indonesia and Ethiopia. IOM have confirmed the impact of this work across Viet Nam, Albania and Nigeria, particularly in relation to understanding prevention, the provision of services for men, boys and atypical ‘victims’ of human trafficking and mental health needs. In a testimony to the University in December 2020, IOM in Viet Nam wrote: *Dr Hynes's knowledge and expertise in the field of migration and human trafficking and lead on the research led to a successful analysis and research report. It helped IOM Viet Nam successfully secured a UK funded trafficking project entitled Tackling Modern Slavery in Viet Nam \(TMSV\). This research resulted in wide recognition of the issue of trafficking and vulnerability of Vietnamese migrants in the UK, and need to improve the evidence\-base, through further research and evidence to support the operational work of IOM and other agency' s work to counter trafficking in Viet Nam.* In October 2020, this study achieved two A\+ grades within the Home Office’s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund \[ **5.5**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The HeadStart Learning Programme led by the Evidence Based Practice Unit at UCL was the first large\-scale, longitudinal investigation of resilience\-based approaches to support the mental health and wellbeing of young people in England. The programme created a detailed, nuanced and evolving national resource that has informed policy documents from Public Health England and the Departments for Education and Health & Social Care. Deighton’s research has changed how six local authorities and 300 schools \(75,000 pupils\) across England identify and support young people experiencing mental health difficulties. It has increased awareness and understanding of these issues among young people, their parents and carers, educational professionals and the general public through extensive media coverage and public engagement. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 This case study presents the impact of research conducted by UCL’s Evidence Based Practice Unit as part of HeadStart \- a GBP67,400,000 National Lottery Community Fund programme to explore and test new ways to improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people aged ten to sixteen and prevent serious mental health issues from developing. 

 In 2014, the Unit \(led by Professor Deighton\) began collecting and analysing information and indicators to evaluate a pilot involving 12 local\-authority\-led partners **\[R1\].** The findings of this evaluation informed The National Lottery Community Fund’s launch \(in June 2016\) of a full\-scale five\-year programme that funded six local\-authority\-led HeadStart partnerships \(Blackpool, Cornwall, Hull, Kent, Newham and Wolverhampton\) to work with local young people, schools, families, charities, community and public services to design and trial a wide range of interventions aimed at building capacity in staff working with young people, improving wellbeing, preventing mental health problems and supporting at\-risk groups. In parallel The National Lottery Community Fund launched the HeadStart Learning Programme, a seven\-year programme of data collection, analysis and evaluation led by UCL to support, inform and assess these interventions. 

 The team worked closely with schools, young people and local authorities to design the Wellbeing Measurement Framework \(WMF\), a set of rigorous, balanced and validated questionnaires designed to elicit complete and accurate information on positive wellbeing, behavioural and emotional difficulties, ability to deal with stress and manage emotions, and the presence and strength of protective factors such as perceived support at school, home and in the community. The questionnaires are used in participating schools across the six partnership areas to collect data through surveys of over 60,000 pupils in more than 210 secondary schools in England, of which 15,000 pupils are followed longitudinally from Year 7 onwards and the rest as an annual snapshot of Year 9. Completion rates are exceptionally high for a survey of this type, at 85%. The surveys have been complemented by a series of ongoing in\-depth interviews with a targeted cohort of some 87 children and young people. 

 The UCL team then carried out extensive longitudinal analysis of the data, mapping how the mental health of young people evolves over the course of the programme to assess the effectiveness of the HeadStart approach. This represents the first ever large\-scale longitudinal and snapshot study of young people’s resilience and mental health directly from young people themselves. This quantitative research, alongside longitudinal qualitative interviews **\[R2\]** has led to a clearer understanding of how young people themselves perceive factors that challenge their mental health and wellbeing and what mechanisms they use to cope; and generated evidence to support four key novel findings: 

  -  Children’s experiences of psychological distress are more widespread than previously expected **\[R3\].** 

  -  There are emerging gender differences in mental health and wellbeing through adolescence. From the period of early to mid\-adolescence, girls’ internalising symptoms escalate while boys remain constant. In the same period, girls’ subjective wellbeing decreases significantly, whereas boys’ does not. Findings suggest early adolescence as an important period for prevention and early intervention for girls **\[R4\].** 

  -  Certain identified groups experience disproportionally high rates of psychological distress **\[R3, R5\].** 

  -  The interplay between mental health problems and positive wellbeing is complex **\[R6\].** 

 The HeadStart Learning Programme also developed and refined feasible feedback systems for schools to review and monitor whole\-school mental health and wellbeing and trialled them in over 300 schools \(210 secondary schools and 90 primary schools\), creating an online platform \(in collaboration with the University of Manchester, who built and run the system\) to present the findings to partnerships and individual schools, including breakdown of results within certain populations \(by gender, Special Educational Needs, free school meals, ethnicity\) and comparison of a school/partnership’s own results against the programme average.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The unprecedented, evidence\-based understanding of the current mental health of young people across England produced by the research has impacted on practice, policy and public awareness within the participating HeadStart areas and beyond. 

 **Impact on schools and pupils** 

 Members of the research team have worked with HeadStart and other schools to help them understand the data and provided workshops and materials to share learning with school leaders, parents and pupils. The WMF enables schools to better understand and manage the mental health and wellbeing of their students, as demonstrated by requests from schools outside the programme to be involved, and from participating schools to extend the exercise to an additional cohort of pupils. In addition to 120 secondary and 90 primary HeadStart schools, a further 90 secondary schools outside the programme \(and an additional 15,000 participating pupils\) have also been able to experience the benefits described below. 

 The schools describe four key advantages to using the WMF **\[S1\]**: 

-  Its scope makes it statistically and scientifically robust. 

-  The standardised questions allow schools to benchmark themselves, giving them a picture of their strengths and weaknesses within the specific context of their student demographic. 

-  The questions designed and validated by independent experts at UCL elicit unbiased, relevant and useful information. 

-  It covers a range of different aspects of pupil wellbeing \(including ‘softer’ measures such as feelings\) in a single, user\-friendly data source. 

 According to users, the WMF reports have pushed pupil mental health and wellbeing higher up the agenda of school senior management **\[S2, S3\]**. Participating schools used the results in several ways **\[S1\],** including as evidence of performance in external assessments \(Ofsted/faith bodies\) and to open meaningful dialogue with their pupils, encouraging key conversations around mental health. These conversations were used to identify subgroups of students most likely to benefit from specific support and interventions, for example, where the data showed Year 9 girls were struggling with anxiety, one school planned to run a 12\-week course on self\-esteem and anxiety with Year 8 girls, in preparation for transition into Year 9. Schools also used the results to raise awareness among staff of issues likely to be experienced within their classrooms and of how young people are feeling generally; and as a starting point for discussions with CAMHS when making student referrals: 

 “*The WMF has helped to create an awareness with staff of our pupil mental health and wellbeing. It has helped to inform and educate them on how our pupils are feeling right now, the struggles they are dealing with, that way they can have a better understanding helping them to support and deal with the pupils better*” **\[S1\].** 

 “*The provided Online Tool allows the schools to contextualise wellbeing scores alongside data such as gender, year group and special needs, and is thus exceptionally useful to schools.”* **\[S2\].** 

 WMF is a major channel for youth voice in schools, which ensures that the interventions chosen correspond more closely to the real needs and preference of young people. The framework plays a major role in supporting the implementation of the Whole\-School approach to mental health endorsed by the Department for Education **\[S2\].** For example, HeadStart Kernow has invested a significant amount of money to support school\-based interventions **\[S4\]**. The local authority produces hard\-copy reports for schools \(as well as a young people’s version\) and provides funding to support student\-led initiatives that have proved highly effective and directly beneficial to students. Examples of these initiatives include a group of Year 9 girls on the edge of exclusion who identified issues of anxiety in the survey and requested and received funding to set up a yoga group, which has helped them to remain in school **\[S2\]**. 

 **Impact on local government strategy and planning** 

 Local data from the pupil mental health and wellbeing surveys have been used by Blackpool, Cornwall, Hull, Kent, Newham and Wolverhampton to inform system and cultural change in emotional and mental health beyond the HeadStart programme itself. 

 In Cornwall, they “ *found the WMF exceptionally useful in driving systems and cultural change across the board, moving towards more integrated services. It provides insight for our One Vision plan \(launched in 2017\) for the closer integration of education, health and social care services for children, young people and their families, and as such we adopted the WMF data right from the first year of the programme as a strategic tool and Key Performance Indicator in our business plan. Public Health use the WMF to inform its Joint Strategic Needs Assessment \(JSNA\), which is a legal requirement and informs strategy. We have used it to help design services, to evidence funding bids \(e.g. NHS England’s Mental Health Trailblazer pilots\), to identify and evidence areas of need and design measures to meet those needs”* **\[S2\].** 

 Newham also used the evidence to support a successful Mental Health Trailblazer pilot bid. Their Public Health and Policy teams have used the data to guide strategic planning for the Borough. “ *The WMF is a valued and useful tool which has contributed to understanding about the prevalence rates of mental health and wellbeing of CYP \[Children and Young People\] in Newham. Working with schools to implement and use the WMF findings has led to meaningful changes at the whole\-school level to improve awareness of CYP mental health and development of effective provision in schools”* **\[S3\]**. 

 **Impact on National Policy** 

 In October 2018, shortly after publication of the first HeadStart findings highlighting the prevalence of mental health and wellbeing issues in England’s children and young people, the then\-Prime Minister Theresa May commissioned an annual State of the Nation research report on Children and Young People’s Mental Health and Wellbeing from the Department for Education \(DofE\). The 2019 report **\[S6\]** cites the HeadStart results **\[R2\]** and associated policy and evidence briefings **\[S5\]** as evidence for the scale and implications of the problem. Prof Deighton acted as external reviewer on the report’s 2020 edition, using experience from the HeadStart Learning Programme to inform her comments and suggestions. Deighton was a member of Public Health England’s special interest group on Universal Interventions to Support Children's Mental Health and Wellbeing \(whose report she co\-authored **\[S7\]** citing her wider body of work **\)** and the Department for Health and Social Care use HeadStart prevalence data **\[R2\]** as part of the evidence base to support implementing changes to young people’s mental health provision **\[S8\].** 

 In February 2019, the Department for Education invited the team to deliver a mental health and wellbeing workshop for over 70 policy makers, and to participate in a roundtable chaired by the Permanent Secretary on how to develop character and resilience in education. This roundtable informed the ‘5 Foundations to Build Character’ subsequently announced by the Education Secretary. One policy colleague at the DfE commented that, "" *the work of the HeadStart team, including the evaluation and evidence reviews, is helping to inform the work of DfE’s mental health policy team, in terms of better understanding prevalence, risk and protective factors, and informing how we can work effectively with schools and communities to help improve the mental resilience and wellbeing of children and young people*"" **\[S9\].** 

 **Impact on public awareness** 

 Programme findings have been translated into nine Evidence Briefings and five Heads Up policy briefings **\[S5\],** on subjects such as: risk and protection factors, gender differences, key questions raised by young people, the types of interventions schools use, and how to support young people at home. The briefings have been circulated to some 60 targeted stakeholders including policy makers from NHS England, local authorities, Public Health England, Department for Education and the Office for National Statistics as well as practitioners from the NHS, schools/education, mental health and the third sector. 

 Findings have received wide media coverage, in particular around prevalence and gender differences **\[R2\].** These findings were highlighted in national \(The Telegraph, Radio 4 Woman's Hour, Radio 5 Live, LBC, The Daily Mail, The Express, Sky News\), online \(Mail, Mirror, Express, Huffington Post – combined estimated reach of over 3,500,000 people\) and local media \(over 237 outlets including Radio London, Radio Cornwall, West Midlands Express, Star, Southern Daily, The Argus\), as well as in trade press \(e.g. Medical Xpress, Children & Young People Now, Mental Health Today\) **\[S10\].** The findings have been disseminated at two conferences \(in 2018 and 2020\) attended by HRH the Duchess of Cambridge and policy makers from the Department for Education, Public Health England and NHS England, researchers, school staff, young people, clinicians and other professionals.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Policy discussions of learning technology and education have taken place independently of each other, creating disconnects between them and flaws in policy, practice and paradigms regarding mobile and digital learning. This is exacerbated in contexts of local disadvantage and international development. Research at the University of Wolverhampton has actively addressed these issues and has resulted in new policies on digital technology that remedy concerns. It does this in two distinct and different ways. First, our research shaped and influenced the debate on learning technology to challenge established norms, modes of thought and practices in the UK. Second, in collaboration with UNESCO and the Palestinian Higher Education providers, we influenced policies and the design and delivery of curricula and syllabi. This led to more context\-relevant and inclusive educational practices, updated policies on digital technology and dedicated training materials. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 When digital technology designers and western policy makers consider the interface between technology and education, they do so with little regard one to another. This gives rise to a dominant viewpoint where technology is seen in isolation, as something in the abstract, and discussed in policy as if seamless and efficient in its functioning. These distinctly Western assumptions about technology privilege its smooth and uninterrupted operation in the West in time of peace, which obscures situations of disadvantage. These assumptions are at odds too with technology used and life lived in places like Palestine, where there is near constant violence, interruptions to service, and dual use of analogue and digital systems. Added to this is cultural bias throughout, which perpetuates the limitation of inclusive practices and perceptions of what is possible in the implementation of digital technologies in education in local UK and global contexts. Furthermore, though these cases are drawn from two very different locations, shared issues are illuminated through crises, including the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 Building on work funded by UNESCO and other development agencies such as IDRC \(International Development Research Centre\), USAID \(US Agency for International Development\), ITU \(International Telecommunication Union\), ILO \(International Labour Organisation\), the British Council, UNRWA \(United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \) and participation in high\-level working groups and official publications, our research focuses upon local, national and international perceptions, attitudes, discourse and priorities. Our research \[R\] led to four distinctive findings \[F\], namely: 

 <ins>F1.</ins> Mobile technology, the default digital learning technology in disadvantaged and development contexts, was intrinsically skewed away from the values, needs, languages and culture of marginal, nomadic, indigenous and otherwise disempowered communities. The concepts and practices of digital literacy, digital learning, and learning more generally have been articulated and operationalised in terms that are implicitly specific to mainstream European culture and institutions. This is neither adequate nor appropriate outside Europe \[R1\] and specifically not in occupied Palestine nor amongst refugees from MENA \(Middle East and North Africa\) in the EU \[R2\]. This led to recommendations for meaningful collaborative design, user\-generated content, indigenous pedagogies, inclusive research ethics and non\-‘edtech’ technologies \[R1 and R2\]. 

 <ins>F2.</ins> The relationships, transactions and interactions between global policymakers and educational researchers around digital learning for development contexts were flawed, out\-dated, biased and partial. Findings challenged established paradigms of ‘mobile learning’ and the policy derived from them \[R3\] and revealed how top\-down, scaled\-up, North\-to\-South researcher\-led, innovation\-driven initiatives failed to match local contextual needs, values, pedagogies, technologies and institutions and perpetuated existing inequalities and hegemonies \[R4\]. 

 <ins>F3.</ins> Linguistic analysis of millions of words of policy texts through corpus\-based critical discourse analysis revealed a dehumanisation of HE policy rhetoric, where disadvantage is perpetuated linguistically, to serve the status quo. This critique of the control of language about digital learning in policy documents demonstrated disadvantages, especially relating to a failure to acknowledge the postdigital positionality of individuals \[R5 and R6\]. 

 <ins>F4.</ins> Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\)\-funded research on data and disadvantage in the Black Country has taken a postdigital approach to demonstrate a deficit in regional digital skills plans, which focus largely on employability but omit important aspects of ethics, digital inclusion, attention to bias, data poverty, and digital citizenship \[R6\]. These factors are particularly problematic, too, among MENA \(Middle East and North Africa\] diasporic communities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact documented in this case study concerns instrumental policy change through shaping and informing the policy debate on learning technology in the UK, on the one hand, and the challenging of norms and shaping emerging digital policy regarding technology in Palestine, on the other. 

 <ins>I1. Shaping and influencing the policy debate on</ins> <ins>learning</ins> <ins>technology in ways that challenge established norms, modes of thought and practices in the UK</ins> 

 Our initial pathway was that more contextual understandings through a postdigital approach led to public debates and participants publishing articles in the *Postdigital Science and Education* \(PDSE\) journal. This influenced the formation of an interdisciplinary research campus based on Postdigital Participation in Braunschweig, Germany, inspired by our work. Interview questions informed by our research evidence on the new policy approach of translating cultural understandings of digital policy issues across local and international public audiences. This led to policy makers funding a new postdigital network \[C1\]. This pathway has enabled the formation of a new group, the new Midlands HE Policy Network \(MHEPN\). 

 MHEPN was formed on the basis of research findings \[F1\] to deal with the implications of digital disadvantage and to raise regional voices to input into policy. Partners now include participants from local businesses, the West Midlands Combined Authority \(WMCA\) and Wolverhampton Council \[C2\]. This is notable for two reasons. First, it showed that our research findings on the resolution of problematic perspectives arising from MENA communities overseas can be applied to diasporic and other underprivileged communities in the UK. Second, there is a very clear resemblance to the problems of digital poverty that are encountered in the current COVID\-19 pandemic. The same issues of lack of equipment, differentiated and incompatible devices, data poverty and interruption of services all apply as readily in some UK homes as they do in Palestine, albeit for different reasons. Understanding issues at play \(e.g. 20% of the West Midlands population are not internet users\) is helping local authorities develop policies to overcome them. The latter is evident in the Wolverhampton Digital website \[C3 and C2\] and through a WMCA cross\-sector coalition to which members of the EPSRC\-funded research team on digital skills plans, data and disadvantage in the Black Country are contributing. 

 This model has been adopted by cross\-sector participants in a series of regional events put on in 2019\-20 by MHEPN concerning digital disadvantage, data and skills strategy in the Black Country \[C4\]. 

 <ins>I2.</ins> <ins>Influencing UNESCO policy and the design and delivery of curricula and syllabi in Palestinian Higher Education \(HE\), manifest in appropriate and improved educational practices, policies on digital technology and dedicated training materials</ins> 

 Underpinning research \[F1, F2 and F4\], combined with project work in HE in Palestine and in Europe with MENA refugees from 2015 has led to informing policy at UNESCO and to curriculum change around digital learning practice in Palestinian HE, Palestinian policy on digital literacy, and in policies for MENA refugees to EU HE. Two Erasmus\+ projects, METHODS and TEFL\-ePAL, have drawn on the research \[R1 underpinning F1\], using it to modernise teaching methods, embed research and build capacity appropriate to MENA and Palestinian culture, contexts, infrastructure and institutions. Partners included Birzeit University, Palestine Polytechnic University, and the University of Jordan. 

 In Palestine, a policy area of central importance is the need to develop strategies to provide equal access for all mobile devices. Traxler was also able to inform UNESCO’s thinking on the informality inherent in the use of digital technologies in education. UNESCO was able to develop a position vis\-à\-vis education where, “moving beyond literacy and numeracy, \[it was able\] to focus on learning environments and on new approaches to learning for greater justice, social equity and global solidarity” \[C5\]. This appreciation is crucial for places like Palestine, where the latter three areas loom larger than they do in the West. 

 In 2019, UNESCO, writing in a specifically Palestinian context, endorsed Traxler’s argument that “empowering people and communities requires culturally specific and culturally sensitive definitions of digital literacy, rather than appropriating those generated outside the region and outside the community” and that “language, values, gestures and culture that are overwhelmingly Anglophone American; it is largely under the control of global corporations and thus alien to many of the world’s cultures and communities.” \[C6\] 

 At the same time as changing policy at UNESCO, the project work has created change on the ground. TEFL\-ePAL has led the introduction of modern language learning materials and practices in Palestinian HEIs in the consortium \[C7 and C7a\]. METHODS has impacted institutional strategy and policy, through effective practice and a collaborative approach giving a strong reassurance that the changes are sustainable. This is evidenced through the buy\-in from key decision\-makers within partner universities, who have affected institutional change as a result of the METHODS project and an EU Technical Assistance Mission to a Palestinian HEI creating digital literacy curricula \[C8 and C8a\]. METHODS was able to influence the situation in Palestine directly as the following example illustrates: 

 “In a country like Palestine, because of the political situation for example Jerusalem on Tuesday there will be no transport and no classes, so we need alternatives so that education is not disrupted. In Palestine you are going to have days where movement is very difficult, but we need to continue. We live in a precarious environment and that’s where technology plays a role. BU Lecturer 2” 

 “Adoption of PBL \[Project Based Learning\] requires a rethinking of curriculum at system level and needs to link to the social context of Palestine directly and its young minds need to be directed to both thinking through and taking actions that solve the problems that are inherent within the developing society.” \[C8\] 

 Co\-development and collaboration between partners in the METHODS project has been strong throughout. The motivation and collaboration between partners in both the EU and Jordan and Palestine have been key to the success of this project. 

 The significance and reach of this impact relate to the extension of opportunity as the direct result of the embedding of research findings. Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Palestine, as beneficiaries, now have digital access and learning in ways they did not before and could not have achieved had the work not been done because of lack of local research\-informed materials and training. 

 As will be seen in both cases, the challenges of digital poverty, whether in Palestine as the result of violence, poverty and upheaval, or in the UK as the result of poverty, inequality and COVID\-19, both have resemblances to each other. The impact discussed here goes some way to helping to begin to redress the imbalance.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research on what matters most to mothers, babies, families, and maternity care providers has directly motivated changes in World Health Organisation \(WHO\) maternity guidance. Because of our findings, the WHO has integrated the critically important outcome of positive childbirth experience in all their recent maternity guidelines and their associated dissemination materials. Our findings have contributed to WHO implementation strategies in nine countries. During COVID\-19, our research on what matters to women has underpinned WHO infographics, and guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives. The 2019 WHO global framework for action for strengthening midwifery education for Universal Health Coverage 2030 cites three of our papers on positive childbirth and midwifery.

 Birth affects everyone. Worldwide, around 130 million babies are born annually. Safety is improving, but now there are concerns about the harms of over\-intervention and lack of human rights in childbirth. Since 2001, the University of Central Lancashire Research in Childbirth and Health \(ReaCH\) group has been examining physiological birth, respectful, compassionate care, and positive wellbeing, based on our active engagement with mothers, families, and service providers. We are the only transdisciplinary research team worldwide that has consistently explored positive childbirth programmatically over two decades. 

 <ins> **The</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>esearch</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>athway**</ins> 

 In 2001, Soo Downe led a world\-first study examining interventions in ‘normal childbirth’. Since then, the University of Central Lancashire team have produced over 200 publications. Most of this work has been informed by service users input, either directly as co\-investigators, or indirectly through consultation at various points with service user groups and networks.  In 2013, we published a seminal qualitative meta\-synthesis, stimulated by our years of work with service users that led us to believe that childbearing women might choose not to use services that do not take account of their views and experiences.This showed that, in low and middle\-income countries, the failure to account for cultural and social norms and beliefs in the design and provision of antenatal care could explain sub\-optimal uptake of services for women from some cultural groups. This is likely to result in excess mortality and morbidity in these sets of people \[1\]. Senior WHO staff noted the findings and the innovative methodology we used to integrate women’s views and experiences with implementation considerations. They commissioned us to undertake a global qualitative meta\-synthesis for their 2016 Antenatal Guidelines \[2\] \[A\]. For the first time, our evidence demonstrated that, in all cultural and socio\-economic settings around the world, a positive pregnancy experience was as important for most childbearing women as clinical safety. Since then, we have provided the qualitative evidence for three more WHO guidelines \[A\]: ‘Intrapartum’, ‘Optimizing Caesarean Section’ and ‘Uterotonics for Postpartum Haemorrhage’, in research worth approximately GBP100,000. The WHO have subsequently funded reviews relating to postnatal care, instrumental birth, and physical and verbal mistreatment in health and social care. These are currently in progress, with a total income of around GBP50,000. 

 Downe was co\-author on two related Lancet Series, one on midwifery and one on caesarean section along with Kingdon \[3, 5\]. We have published nine related papers, including three qualitative systematic reviews underpinning the 2018 WHO Optimising Caesarean Section \(CS\) guidelines. These have emphasised the importance of positive physiological birth and that Caesarean Section can be done safely and compassionately. The WHO have subsequently funded us to undertake research in India, as part of the development of a generic protocol, to assess contexts in which their optimal CS recommendations could be implemented \[6\]. This protocol is informed by the contextual model of CS use, which we developed \[6\], and that was published in our related Lancet paper \[5\]. Three of our papers are cited in the 2019 *WHO Framework for Action for Midwifery Education towards Universal Health Coverage 2030* \[J\]. 

 <ins> **Associated Research**</ins> 

 In parallel, we were funded by the EU Horizon 2020 funded European Cooperation in Science and Technology \(COST\) programme to run two consecutive research networks between 2010 and 2018, worth around EUR900,000. Both were focused on the nature, implementation, and outcomes of positive, salutogenic \(wellbeing\-focused\), physiological childbirth, involving over 120 network members \- researchers, activists, service users, and policy makers \- from 33 countries. The 2014\-2018 network has been acknowledged as **‘world class’** by the EU, and, in 2020, was selected to showcase as one of their successful Actions. Collaborative publications include a longitudinal analysis of around 500,000 Australian mothers and babies from birth up to the age of five, demonstrating, for the first time, the long\-term benefits of physiological childbirth when compared to labour induction and/or Caesarean Section \[4\]. The article concluded that children born by spontaneous vaginal birth had fewer short and longer\-term health problems, compared with those born after birth interventions \[I\]. In 2020 we were funded by the ESRC under the UKRI COVID research programme \(GBP494,000\) to find out which maternity care organisations managed to balance personalised maternity care with safe care during the pandemic.  It will also yield positive lessons to be learned from these successes for future maternity care crises, as well as for routine provision.

 <ins> **The c</ins><ins>ritical importance of the positive experience of pregnancy and childbirth**</ins> 

 In 2016, the UN acknowledged that mothers, babies, and families need to thrive as well as survive. Our research has been a significant agent of change in this field, enabling positive childbirth experience to be integrated into global guidelines and practice \[A\]. Our research has brought the voices of mothers, maternity care providers and healthcare policy makers worldwide into the heart of maternity care decision\-making processes. This has enabled them to shape and implement policy and practice. Together, we have shifted the international conversation about what is best practice for maternity care and what recommendations should be made. Consequently, the findings of our research are directly reflected in the full titles of the WHO antenatal and intrapartum guidelines: *WHO Antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience* and *WHO intrapartum guidelines for a positive childbirth experience* \[A3, A4\]. This is the first time that WHO guidelines have explicitly taken account of the needs of mothers, families and healthcare professionals, and their requests for compassionate and respectful care. The public WHO media site for the antenatal guidelines makes it clear that this is now a central concern: **‘Service providers across all levels and whether working in hospitals or local communities should embrace these concepts and consider how they can work with women, families and communities to provide positive antenatal care experience and ensure optimal uptake of ANC \(ante\-natal\-care\) services’** \[B\]. The importance of this new approach was endorsed by Ban Ki\-moon, then United Nations Secretary\-General: **‘I welcome these guidelines, which aim to put women at the centre of care, enhancing their experience of pregnancy and ensuring that babies have the best possible start in life’** \[A1\]. 

 Up to December 2020, the antenatal guidelines had been downloaded more than 380,000 times from the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing \[A5\]. The WHO has undertaken an active implementation programme, with materials based directly on our findings \[B\]. For example, around 50 government officials, NGOs and senior clinical midwives and doctors attended a two\-day WHO workshop in The Gambia in 2018 to design a policymaker toolkit. This includes our ‘Positive Pregnancy Experience’ concept and our logic models on how the guidelines should be implemented \[A2\].  This programme is being rolled out in Burkino Faso, Rwanda, Zambia and India. There are around 150 key stakeholders per country, totalling around 600, and the programme is being cascaded to other regions and countries around the world. Findings from our review are included in the title and content of a WHO paper setting out an implementation framework for the ANC guidelines \[A2\]. 

 For the WHO intrapartum guidelines there was a similar chain of influence, from the initial framing of the guidelines themselves, to the impact on the ground, in a range of countries, as related WHO consultative workshops. By December 2020, they had been downloaded more than 300,000 times \[A5\]. Demonstrating the reach of our work, Duncan Fisher OBE from the Family Institute witnessed a gathering of midwifery leaders in Trinidad in 2016. He later wrote: **‘It was a really powerful meeting \- such strong feelings about the role of the midwife in championing a woman centred and family inclusive approach.  \[Soo Downes’\] … idea that social/emotional support should be given as much weight as clinical summed it all up’** \[C1\].

 Following our input to the WHO Optimizing Caesarean Section guidelines, our findings have been used in an additional WHO implementation programme, starting in Beirut in 2018 with 20 professional stakeholders and government agencies from across the Middle East. We provided the evidence on what would facilitate the use of nonclinical interventions to reduce unnecessary Caesarean Section and what would provide barriers to such interventions. The implementation protocol, including our model, is being rolled out in China, Argentina, Burkina Faso, Thailand and Vietnam. In October 2018 the WHO conducted a technical consultation in Madrid, attended by influential policy makers, journalists, clinicians and media experts, to explore the feasibility of mass media campaigns  for informed women, families and societies and to identify opportunities to engage with policy makers to advocate, legislate and implement strategies \[C2\]. 

 Our positive pregnancy and birth focus has been included in infographics produced by the WHO in relation to maternity care during the ongoing COVID\-19 pandemic. These infographics have been cited by organisations and NGOs to critique and change restrictions on women’s rights in childbirth during the pandemic around the world. Soo Downe also initiated a professorial advisory group that has co\-authored rapid reviews for the joint Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists/ Royal College of Midwives COVID guidelines throughout the pandemic, taking a positive health and wellbeing approach \[L\]. 

 <ins> **Catalysing change: optimal mode of birth and positive outcomes**</ins> 

 Our EU COST Actions programme has generated practice change symposia for researchers, policy makers, service users, activists and clinical staff in Switzerland, Bulgaria, Spain, and Portugal with the total attendance being approximately 500. The contacts, research, and mentoring available to Yoanna Stanchova, a Bulgarian student midwife who joined our EU COST network, enabled her, along with her colleague Ilona Neshkova, to set up for the first time ever, a midwife\-led maternity service and a birth centre in Bulgaria. Photographs and testimonials on their ‘Zebra’ midwifery website demonstrate the profound impact this has had on local childbearing women and their partners \[E2\]. EU COST Director Dr Ronald de Bruin noted: **“Today we heard about how a scientist from the UK working with Bulgarian midwives led to positive changes…the midwives became better educated and established a community of midwifery professionals in Bulgaria. This clearly demonstrates the power and potential of connecting researchers from across Europe”** \[E1\]. 

 In Spain, the Midwives’ Contribution to Normal Childbirth Care \(MidconBirth\) Study notes that: **‘As a direct impact from the Action, a recommendation has been included in the Catalan Health Plan to review the normal birth model of care. One birth center has been recently opened, and some more are planned…’** Currently, 45 public hospitals are involved, from different regions of Spain \[F\]. 

 The network also generated the rolling citizen\-science based Babies Born Better \(B3\) survey \[D\], led by the ReaCH team. It has a database of responses from nearly 80,000 women in 22 languages, from 66 countries, with 26 relevant outputs currently on the website, from 16 countries, including publications, presentations, press releases, media coverage, undergraduate and masters dissertations, and activist campaigns \[D\]. In line with our unique focus, the B3 survey is designed to find out where women have the best experience of maternity care, around the world, what shapes their positive experiences, and what they would like to change. 

 The Rapporteur summarised the success of the COST Action **“…in several countries the Action managed to get policy makers and other stakeholders involved in order to change the way care is provided to mothers and their newborns. Overall, the Action has a significant positive and long\-lasting effect on maternity care.”** \[G\] 

 Building on our concept of positive experiences, we edited an accessible book called *The Roar Behind the Silence* which has sold over 7000 copies around the world \[H\]. Readers’ comments show that they see the book as a catalyst for change. **“I want every commissioner and CQC inspector to read this book. Every Health Minister, every NHS manager. Heads of midwifery, consultants, registrars, midwives, health care assistants, read this book too\! I want doulas and mothers to read it as well. THIS is where we can find common ground and work towards admitting our mistakes and making birth better, kinder, healthier and more fun, for parents and staff”** \[H\]. 

 The book has generated eleven spontaneous requests for what have become called ‘Roar Tours’ from groups in India, Australia, New Zealand \(twice\), Norway, Ireland \(four times\), Canada and Germany. Over 1,000 obstetricians, midwives, service users and other stakeholders have attended these events. Local movements for change have continued following our tour dates. As one of many examples of spontaneous feedback: **“It has taken me this long to process our day in Portiuncula. Words cannot express how wonderful the day was from every perspective. It was like having my ‘midwifery passion bag’ being refilled with inspiration, positivity and as you say yourselves, love…. I was at the National Director of Midwifery forum and spoke about the day and the benefits for the unit”** \[K\]. 

 Our commitment to research that will directly catalyse positive change in maternity care practice, experiences and outcomes around the world underpins our on\-going and expanding programme. Our recent ESRC/UKRI award that will examine what has worked in the UK for maternal and neonatal services for both safe and personalised care throughout the pandemic is an example of this continuing endeavour. The end product will be a model and a toolkit for optimum care provision, co\-designed throughout with stakeholders from provider groups, organisations, funding and management, and with service users, partners, families, and activist organisations.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Supporting children who are leaving custody \(‘resettlement’\) is a chronic problem across England and Wales as both typical practice and reoffending outcomes have historically been recognised by Inspectors as ‘shocking’. Professor Hazel’s research has raised policy awareness of the issues, directly influenced government policy, driven practice improvements and informed the standards by which resettlement support for children is judged. His research forms the basis for a new cross\-departmental national policy approach to resettlement, national standards for all Youth Offending Teams and custodial institutions, the Youth Custody Service’s new theory of change, inspection criteria and the curriculum for youth justice staff training to support resettlement. Moreover, policymakers and practitioners are increasingly recognising the usefulness of these research findings to guiding practice beyond resettlement, including for non\-custodial sentences and for adult probation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Hazel’s research in the mid\-2000s, including evaluations of initiatives across England and Wales **\[e.g. 3.1\]**, showed how appropriate support for children after leaving custody \(known as ‘resettlement’\) was critical for positive child outcomes, reduced offending and safer communities.  However, it also showed that their complex needs were not usually being met, and that as a direct result, children became disillusioned with support, ended cooperation, reoffended more frequently and faster than adults and were then often returned to custody. 

 These conclusions led to the development of the Youth Justice Board \(YJB\) resettlement consortia to help coordinate multi\-agency partnerships in seven areas, four of which were evaluated by teams led by Hazel between 2008 and 2015 **\[e.g. 3.2, 3.3\]**. These evaluations showed how enhanced resettlement support can reduce reoffending by half and built an extensive knowledge base of protective elements of support associated with success. However, Hazel also continued to show how these elements of good practice \(e.g. temporary release, provision set\-up prior to release, planning support for beyond the sentence\) were still usually absent or unsuitable **\[3.2 – 3.5\]**. Moreover, when unsuitable, such increased support ironically meant children were more likely to be recalled to custody for non\-cooperation **\[3.2\]**. Inspectors, using inspection criteria based on Hazel’s research, found that these protective elements were still often ignored more widely across the country, leading to persistently ‘shocking’ practice and outcomes. Hazel concluded that professionals were often failing to engage with or apply suitable support through lack of common understanding of how such provision helped rehabilitation **\[3.3\]**. 

 The Beyond Youth Custody research programme \(BYC, 2012 – 2018\) found that poor practitioner understanding of resettlement was due to a weakness with the dominant ‘risk paradigm’ \- existing policies and guidance focused on meeting decontextualised structural needs \(e.g. housing and some education\), without a common theory of change **\[e.g. 3.4, 3.5\]**. This focus on structural needs also undermined children’s sense of agency. Other findings included how children leaving custody without sufficient support suffered a period of disorientation with post\-traumatic stress symptoms **\[3.6\]**. 

 BYC reconceptualised successful resettlement as a pro\-social identity\-shift, mirroring ‘secondary desistance’ in adults. Thus, facilitating a child to make this shift should be the common role of all support services. The resulting BYC Framework to promote effective resettlement consisted of: 

1.  a two\-stage casework model where \(a\) *personal support* that guides the child’s identity\-shift informs any \(b\) *structural support* needed to enable it 

1.  a set of principles that reinterpreted existing risk\-based research messages derived from Hazel’s previous work \(above\) through an identity lens, with new principles added to guide a child’s desistance journey \(known as the ‘5Cs’ of Consistent, Coordinated, Customised, Co\-created and Constructive support\) 

1.  a model of ‘identity awareness’ for practitioners to manage messages about the self to and from the child 

1.  a ‘Fresh AIR’ model for understanding the building blocks for identity\-shift, through constructive **A**ctivities, **I**nteractions and **R**oles **\[e.g. 3.4, 3.5\]**. 

 Subsequent work **\[e.g. 3.7\]** has identified how the BYC Framework might be applied more widely than resettlement support, in order to structure more constructive youth justice practice, including for education in custody and for community\-based interventions.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Policymakers have recognised that Hazel’s work has *‘provided an* *excellent evidence base that has underpinned significant and widespread development of resettlement support over several years’* and *‘clear messages that have been fundamental to the continuing development’* of policy and practice **\[5.1\]**. The Secretary of State for Justice referred to research from the BYC consortia **\[e.g. 3.4 – 3.6\]** as bringing *‘an important evidence base upon which we can continue to build our learning’* **\[5.2\]**. Based on his research, Hazel was appointed HM Deputy Chief Inspector of Probation \(2014 – 2015\) and as a member of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales \(YJB, which has statutory oversight of the youth justice system\) with lead responsibility for resettlement \(2018 onwards\). 

 **4.1. Impact on youth resettlement policy** 

 Hazel’s early work **\[e.g. 3.1 – 3.3\]** *‘raised policy awareness’* of the importance of addressing resettlement to help children’s outcomes and he has helped **maintain it as a policy priority** until today **\[5.1\]**. That early work ‘ *fundamentally informed’* the YJB’s lasting model of funded enhanced ‘resettlement consortia’ projects **\[5.1\]**. 

 The YJB’s current overall policy approach to organising all resettlement across England and Wales, ‘ **Constructive Resettlement \(CR\)**’, is the **direct application of the BYC research framework**, including constructive casework, identity\-focus and the ‘5Cs’ model **\[e.g. 3.4 – 3.5\]**, which has been **endorsed by the <ins>Ministry of Justice**</ins> **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. The 2019 <ins>Welsh Government/Ministry of Justice</ins> *Blueprint for Wales* also explicitly adopts the CR approach, specifying that all work with children from Wales leaving custody must follow the ‘5Cs’ model **\[5.1\]**. Applying the ‘5Cs’ model to policy has *‘ **led to specific initiatives directly impacting on children in custody**’* **\[5.1\]**, including a new escalation process when support is not in place before release and better wellbeing support for children on first entering custody **\[5.1\]**. 

 The BYC/CR Framework *‘has been extremely influential in **informing the design and direction** of \[the <ins>Youth Custody Service for England and Wales</ins> \(YCS\)\] and continues to have a major impact across the organisation’* **\[5.4\]**. In 2019, **the YCS adopted the BYC/CR Framework as its theory of change underlying all of its operations for children in custody**. This enabled a sector\-wide reform programme for custody to become more ‘child\-focussed’, providing ‘ *an extremely valuable operational narrative to direct services’* and *‘an important cultural steer’* \[for the workforce\] **\[5.4\]**. Practically, the BYC/CR Framework has since been used as a *‘key reference point’* for \(a\) considering all interventions, activities and approaches with children, \(b\) commissioning any services or institutions, \(c\) senior decision making **\[5.4\]**. It allowed **YCS to** **reform its casework model** for helping children progress \(around ‘Constructive Casework’\) and **informs the basis of its revised Behaviour Management Strategy** **\[5.4\]**. BYC/CR also underpins a new approach for supporting 18\-year\-olds who are transitioning to the adult estate **\[5.4\]**. The Framework has provided YCS with a much needed *‘common language and sense of purpose’* on which it now conducts its multi\-agency working with community partners **\[e.g.** **3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 5.4\]**. 

 In Scotland, Hazel’s research, including that showing disorientation after custody **\[3.8\]**, *‘ **influenced and informed the development of both strategy and practice**’* for the <ins>Scottish</ins> <ins>Prison Service</ins>’s new vision and policies which commit to *‘addressing the potential trauma of liberation’* \(‘Vision for Young People in Custody’ \- 2014\) **\[5.5\]**. It also **directly informed the development of new quality indicators** **for youth custody across Scotland** **\[5.5\]**. 

 **4.2. Impact on youth resettlement governance** 

 Research messages from the evaluations of the resettlement consortia **\[e.g. 3.2\]** and early BYC project findings were **adopted as the inspection criteria for judging the quality of resettlement provision** across England and Wales, ensuring that Hazel’s body of research frames the quality assurance and governance of all youth resettlement provision across the country **\[5.6\]**. The first inspection using these criteria \(2015\) created 30 policy and practice recommendations sent to the Secretary of State for Justice, requiring responses from key agencies. These led directly to **required** **policy ‘actions to address’** that include: 

-  Custodial institutions now contractually bound to make early resettlement planning a priority for all children and begin on entry 

-  A new operational framework to encourage temporary release on licence 

-  A requirement that Secure Training Centres’ strategies now include engaging with community partners and how information will be shared **\[5.7\]**. 

 The **‘National Standards’ for youth resettlement** \(2019\), set by the Secretary of State for Justice, are **based on the BYC/CR Framework** **\[5.1, 5.8\]**. As such, all Youth Offending Teams \(YOTs, delivering services across a local authority\) and secure establishments are **required to produce a** **customised plan for all children in custody** that sets out the personal and structural support to be made available to support the child in developing a pro\-social identity. The National Standards provide a link to a BYC research publication for *‘how to apply the standards’* **\[5.8\]**. 

 **4.3. Direct impact on youth resettlement practice** 

 The summary of policy and practice messages from Hazel’s research to 2012 is the **main resettlement guidance** on the YJB resource hub for practitioners \(1415 reads since 2018\) **\[5.1\]**. 

 The BYC project translated research reports into **policy briefings and practitioners’ guidance documents**. Practitioners have stated that these publications are *‘helping to shape our approach to resettlement’* and that *‘both staff and young people have felt empowered and stronger’* by providing *‘different ways of thinking’* **\[5.9\]**. BYC findings are described by practitioners as *‘incredibly useful \[…\] influenced our progress on resettlement pathways, girls in custody, accommodation, young people’s voice, education’* etc. and *‘provides a structure to audit practice against*’ for YOTs **\[5.9\]**. 

 **58 YOTs have formally adopted the BYC/CR Framework** as the model to redevelop their resettlement practice **\[5.1\]**. The first such adopter, Camden YOT’s *Enhanced Constructive Resettlement* model, has reported positive early outcomes for children and families **\[5.10\]**. The importance of the CR/BYC approach to improving practice is underlined by the **GBP1,500,000 in grants** **secured by YOTs** specifically to embed and develop it further **\[5.1\]**. 

 Third sector and commercial organisations have described BYC research as *‘invaluable’* to their work and *‘new systems and processes have been designed directly as a result of some of the BYC publications and findings’* **\[5.9\]**. Professionals have noted how using BYC research resources has *‘made such a difference in many cases’* **\[5.9\]**. 

 BYC findings have **formed the basis of professional development on custody and resettlement for staff across the youth justice sector** since 2018. Learning and assessment in the ‘Custody & Resettlement’ module \(one of five\) in the ‘Youth Justice Effective Practice Certificate’ is structured around the research messages **\[5.11\]**. The certificate is the **sector\-endorsed professional qualification for all YOT and youth secure estate staff** across England and Wales. 

 **4.4. Impact beyond youth resettlement** 

 Practitioners are increasingly recognising that the BYC Framework and 5Cs model have application beyond resettlement **\[e.g. 3.7\]**. Four YOTs \(Medway, Kent, Lewisham, Kingston & Richmond\) are now also using these to **underpin sentence planning with children on all non\-custodial sentences** **\[5.1\]**. 

 In 2018, Hazel led the **development of the new guiding principle for all youth justice policy and practice**, not just resettlement, and which now underpins the Ministry of Justice’s *National Standards* for youth justice \(2019\). The BYC Framework was **incorporated as the principle’s** **theory of change across the youth justice system**, which guides all work with children to be *‘developing a pro\-social identity’* and be *‘constructive and future\-focused’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 During the COVID\-19 pandemic, the YCS senior leadership team has used the BYC/CR as its **guiding framework** within which to consider how to respond to the emerging operational challenges in a more child\-focused way. On the ground, the YCS used BYC’s ‘Fresh AIR model’ as its ‘key message’ **guiding all custodial staff on how to combat lockdown isolation** for the 840 vulnerable children remaining in the youth secure estate **\[5.4\]**. 

 In adult probation, the <ins>London Community Rehabilitation Company \(CRC\)</ins> and <ins>Thames Valley CRC</ins> have adopted \(since 2019\) the BYC Framework as their overall approach to working with their 30,000 service users at any one time. They employ training guidance, handbooks and practice tools based on the BYC Framework, **recognised by Inspectors as having improved practice and outcomes, offender engagement and sentence compliance**. Specifically, the Framework also structured the guidance to all staff on how to manage service users during the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[5.12\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research carried out by Sheffield Hallam University has improved the effectiveness of universities’ widening participation programmes, directly influencing national policy in this area and driving changes in institutional policy and practice across the higher education sector in two distinct areas.  The majority of UK universities now use tools, developed from Sheffield Hallam research and recommended by OFFA/OfS, to enhance the efficacy of financial support packages \(bursaries\) for students from poorer backgrounds.  In addition, more collaborative and evidence\-led approaches to outreach work have been extended across the sector in response to further research findings, translated through national policy into widespread institutional practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 McCaig and colleagues’ research has sought to understand, challenge, and then improve the effectiveness of universities’ widening participation \(WP\) strategies \- the cumulation of approaches to remedy historic inequalities in the access to universities.  It has contributed to the theoretical understanding of marketisation in higher education systems both in the UK and globally, and thus problematised the changing nature of policy in the area of widening participation \( **R6**\), and social mobility and fair access to higher education \( **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\). These developments have come from two broad programmes of research. 

 Firstly, McCaig et al investigated **the effectiveness of institutional financial support bursaries for higher education students from low income backgrounds**.  This research was commissioned and funded by the Office for Fair Access \(OFFA\), awarded on the basis of the track record and techniques developed by McCaig \(PI\) and Harrison \(Co\-I, University of the West of England \(UWE\)\).  Of particular relevance was their body of research exploring the quantitative impact of institutional financial support and national policy directives on widening participation outcomes, specifically focusing on: comparative analysis of financial support mechanisms \( **R3**\), and the diagnostic value of low participation neighbourhoods \( **R4**\).  This was later extended with follow\-on work on the epistemological challenges of university bursaries \( **R2**\). 

 The OFFA project, Closing the Gap, scoped and developed **a statistical model for the evaluation of the effectiveness of institutions’ financial support packages** \(bursaries, scholarships and fee discounts\).  This involved: quasi\-experimental binary regression analysis of existing institutional datasets and the generation of a new dataset; the production of a survey tool \(linking to individual bursary recipients\); and an interview schedule designed to identify how bursary recipients used this support.  The team included researchers and student data analysts from five HEIs \(SHU, UWE, Oxford, King’s College London, Bedfordshire\), with the whole research programme co\-ordinated by SHU.  The research initially pooled five years of historical student data from the five institutions and **created an evaluation tool** based on four outcome variables: retention into second year of study, completion of degree within five years, attainment of 1<sup>st</sup> or 2:1, and good employability outcome \(DLHE metric\).  The tool drew on data of characteristics including age on entry, gender, ethnicity, home domicile and entry qualifications. When applied to historic data, the tool demonstrated that bursary recipients performed at least as well as non\-recipients across the outcome variables, and thus closed the expected gap in outcomes derived from low\-income backgrounds \( **R1**\). 

 The tool **allowed users \(HEIs\) to undertake their own analysis**, specifically to: track recipients from enrolment to graduate outcomes through student records data; compare outcomes of bursary recipients with those slightly and significantly better off; evaluate the performance of recipients over time and in relation to changes in bursary support levels/conditions; use the tool collaboratively for institutional comparative purposes; link with the survey instrument developed as part of the project. 

 The second research programme focused on **collaborative outreach programmes**, where HEIs, Further Education Colleges \(FECs\), schools, employers, third sector bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\) partner to deliver focused activity to pupils living in areas with low levels of HE participation and where participation is lower than expected given GCSE attainment.  This was funded by HEFCE and its successor body OfS, and sought to explore how consortia partnerships were working and which approaches appeared to be most effective.  It specifically involved **examining the effectiveness of the design and implementation of collaborative approaches to outreach, and contributed to a fuller understanding of what worked, in what context and why**. This impact evaluation assessed the consequential changes resulting from the diversity of collaborative outreach programme interventions, using a range of experimental and quasi\-experimental methodologies.  The key recommendation of this evaluation of the National Networks for Collaborative Outreach \(NNCO\) programme 2014\-16 was that **collaborative outreach was demonstrating valuable benefits and should be further funded** \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Sheffield Hallam research over the period 2014\-20 has impacted on national policy and practice across the higher education sector.  This has addressed two inter\-related problems associated with the need for more effective evaluation of funded WP activities: i\) demonstrating the value of financial support for students throughout their student journey, and ii\) understanding the new potential of collaborative outreach programmes. 

####  Closing the Gap Toolkit 

 Institutions have long been under pressure to shift expenditure away from direct financial support and towards more holistic and pastoral support for students from poorer backgrounds \( **R1**\).  Sheffield Hallam’s evaluation of the impact of the £478 million spent annually by institutions on bursaries, scholarships and fee waivers for lower income students and other under\-represented groups led to a shift in OFFA/OfS policy with regard to the value and use of bursaries.  The OFFA project commissioner noted: “ *The team provided new understanding of how some bursaries are impactful in some contexts so that OFFA could promote better targeting of financial support. They also provided tools that were fit for purpose and accessible in all institutions so that understanding and capability was enhanced across the HE sector.”* \( **E2**\) 

 OfS note that "" **publication of the toolkit has supported an improvement in the quality of evaluation** by those providers who have used it""* and that "" *findings from the statistical tool suggest that bursaries can be successful in supporting recipients to achieve the same outcomes as their more advantaged peers*"" \( **E1**\). 

 Following the publication of Closing the Gap \( **R1**\), OFFA recommended that from 2016/17 **all HEIs use the tools developed, or develop their own equivalent tools, to evaluate the effectiveness of their bursary spending in their annual Access Agreements**.  These findings must be agreed between institutions and OFFA as a condition of registration \( **E1**\).  As of 2019/20, **over half of UK universities are using the Sheffield Hallam tools**, with the remained having developed their own frameworks derived from the same principles \( **E2**\). 

 Professor Sir Les Ebdon, former Director of Fair Access to Higher Education at OFFA, has confirmed: “When I became Director of Fair Access in 2012, universities in England were spending millions of pounds on bursary schemes to attract and retain ‘widening participation’ students with no evidence of the effectiveness of this expenditure. Research by OFFA, which I headed, demonstrated such expenditure had little impact on a student’s decision on whether to go into higher education or on which university to attend… The outcomes of this \[Sheffield Hallam\] research impressed us very much and, as a direct consequence, OFFA rewrote the advice that they gave institutions as to how to prepare their Access Agreements… One of the outcomes of the research was an evaluation tool as to the effectiveness of bursary spend. We required those higher education providers who were spending large sums on bursaries to students to evaluate that spend using the Sheffield Hallam University tool. Such evaluation persuaded a significant number of sceptical universities to redirect their access expenditure in the following years to more effective activity such as sustained outreach. I can think of few better examples as to **a rapid and decisive impact upon public policy and hundreds of millions of pounds of university expenditure** than this research by Professor McCaig. About **£250 million per year expenditure was moved by universities and colleges to more effective investment**.” \(E9\) 

 Follow\-up evaluation with a sample of institutions using the tools found that doing so **led to** **them rethinking financial support**.  This included changing their perception of the potential value and impact of student financial support, using the evidence generated to guide institutional decision making, and enhancing their overall evaluation practices.  Users of the tools have reported shifting attitudes within institutions about the efficacy of their financial support, which brought a renewed focus on bursary support as a means to enhance retention, and thus successful study outcomes \( **E2**\). 

 OfS's perspective on the impact of the tools within universities is that: “ *\[This\] **research has led to a step change in evaluation practice within the sector**.  Decisions about student bursaries are now being made in light of more robust evidence and from a rigorous epistemological basis **.**  As a secondary impact, we are aware that **the capacity of many providers to use advanced statistical techniques to interrogate the data that they hold on their students** **has also increased** as a result of adapting the framework for other purposes.”* \( **E2**\) 

 The University of Southampton, who were early adopters of the toolkit, found that: “ *We were… able to differentiate between the outcomes of those with the lowest household income and receiving a bursary and those \[who\] receive the next tier of support.  These student’s completion outcomes were different, suggesting the university needed to put in place additional interventions or support for these students…   \[The change of bursary levels following evaluation\] **ensured that we continue to offer the bursary to those students who required funding whilst also expanding provision for the groups of students who we have identified as having lower non\-continuation rates**…  We also learnt that… 95% of students stated that they considered the bursary either important or very important in their ability to continue with their studies.”* \( **E2**\) 

 The University of Winchester reported that: “ *The tool has been very useful in disaggregating the data and showing differential performances in groups with certain characteristics. For example, on continuation into second year there are two negative results around entry qualifications and types of accommodation. The outcomes of the data confirm issues that the university is aware of, is considering and **determining its practice going forward**. As one example there is a multi\-departmental project initiated to investigate the prior assessment experience of BTEC entrants in comparison to assessment at level 4.”* \( **E1**\) 

####  Collaborative Outreach Programmes 

 Sheffield Hallam’s research on the benefits of the National Networks for Collaborative Outreach \(NNCO\) programme 2014\-16 \( **R6**\), **led to the establishment of the National Collaborative Outreach Programme \(NCOP\), now known as Uni Connect**. Recommendations to the funder, HEFCE, specified that collaborative outreach activity should be continued, as it provided valuable and enduring outreach activity in schools and colleges.  The potential of this model, identified in the 2016 research, resulted in the **extension and enhancement of collaborative outreach activity from 2017, with 29 collaborative networks now operating nationwide** \( **E8**\).  During 2018\-19 over 180,000 young people, across 1613 schools and colleges, took part in a collaborative outreach programme through the Uni Connect.  **Uni Connect has subsequently had its funding extended to 2025**, as renewed collaborative approaches to HEI outreach programmes, initially advocated by Sheffield Hallam, continue to flourish.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Addressing United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, Woodcock’s design and ongoing leadership of three European interdisciplinary research projects \(totalling over €9m\), has impacted on policy and implementation of new mobility strategies that encourage cleaner, safer and more inclusive transport. The research has led to: \(1\) implementation of cleaner and safer innovative transport solutions; \(2\) new processes and policies within cities to increase sustainable transport measures; \(3\) increased LA capacity in sustainable mobility planning; \(4\) improved inclusion and representation in sustainable transport planning and contribution to wider SUMP \(sustainable urban mobility planning\) uptake in Europe. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Woodcock’s research is driven by her vision for safer, inclusive, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems. Integrated sustainability planning is a major focus for European cities under the SUMP initiative. Supporting Local Authorities \(LAs\) in this process is critical. They control multimillion\-euro budgets \(e.g. beneficiary Transport for West Midlands \(TfWM\) has operational and capital expenditure of £300m p.a.\), with master plans mapping long\-term city development and the health and wellbeing of citizens. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and leadership of over 20 European partners, Woodcock’s research has combined design thinking and organisational change to help LAs deal with global challenges, meet climate and inclusivity targets and improve the quality of active and public transport. Central to her research, has been the application of systems\-thinking, empathy and user\-centred design to understand people’s mobility needs and the development of resources \(training materials, tools and processes\) for stakeholders to apply this information to mobility planning, measurement and implementation \(R1\). 

 In FP7 METPEX \(2012\-2015\) \(G1\), Woodcock recognised the need to 1\) shift perceptions of public transport \(R1\), 2\) widen definitions of hard to reach groups to include women, travellers with dependents, the elderly, young people, commuters, those on low incomes, with communication and mobility difficulties so their journeys could be recorded, 3\) standardise data collection. METPEX developed a whole journey \(from planning through to arrival at destination\) multimodal measurement instrument to capture travel experiences \(R2, R3\) across 8 European cities, and derive and validate 25 Key Performance \(Passenger\-related\) Indicators \(R2\). 

 H2020  [CIVITAS SUITS](https://www.suits-project.eu/) \( *Sustainable Urban Integrated Transport Systems: Transferable tools for small \- medium Local Authorities*\) \(2016\-2020\) \(G2\) built on METPEX, by increasing the capacity of small to medium cities to plan sustainable, inclusive, safe and integrated transport. Without one agency responsible for the whole journey experience \(R2\) and a plethora of new service providers, LAs need additional support to understand and plan appropriate, integrated, safe and inclusive transport innovations \(such as e\-bikes, drones\) to reach environmental targets and make their cities healthier and attractive. Working with 9 EU cities, ranging in size from about 17k to 2.3M citizens \(total population 5.4 million\) SUITS developed a range of tools \(R5\), based on LAs requirements to support organisational change \(Nienaber\) \(R4\), citizen engagement, capacity building, collaboration, innovative financing and procurement, data collection and integration and inclusivity. SUITS outputs \(R4\-5\) have had a significant and direct impact on LA organisation, planning, awards of new tenders and safer, more inclusive measures benefiting all citizens. 

 Following a thread in her work since 1999 and building on previous projects, TInnGO \(Transport Innovation Gender Observatory\) \(2018\-2021\) \(G3\) addresses the need for a paradigm shift in the transport sector to remove gender and diversity gaps in transport education, employment and usage. TinnGO’s Pan\-European website is a one\-stop shop for tools, resources, data and information about gender and transport \(R5\). It incorporates an Open Innovation Platform \( [www.tinngo.eu](http://www.tinngo.eu/)\) for ten national design and research hubs to gather intersectional and gender disaggregated data, and uses citizen science and codesign to engage hard to reach groups and promote tools to improve workforce diversity. The Hubs thereby act as beacons of engagement to collect and increase awareness of women as employees, entrepreneurs and transport users, and facilitate the development of gender sensitive transport innovations \(R5, R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has led to the implementation of sustainable transport measures and changes in public transport policy in six European cities: Alba Iulia, Romania \(S1\), Kalamaria, Greece \(S2\), Turin, Italy \(S3\), Valencia, Spain \(S4\), Coventry \(S5\) and the West Midlands region, UK \(S6\). Benefits have been realised through \(1\) implementation of cleaner and safer public transport solutions; \(2\) new processes and policies within cities to increase sustainable transport measures; \(3\) increased LA capacity in sustainable mobility planning; \(4\) improved inclusion and representation in transport planning. 

###  Implementation of cleaner and safer public transport solutions 

 Woodcock and Nienaber’s research has accelerated sustainable transport planning and the implementation of new technology to improve safety. In Kalamaria, the research has provided a process and tools \(G2\) to help implementation of solar\-powered, smart pedestrian crossings near four schools leading to a reduction in accidents and increased awareness of speed and sustainability issues amongst drivers \(S2\). An intelligent parking scheme has also been agreed for the centre of Kalamaria \(due end 2021\) to reduce pollution and congestion: 

 “Initially 50 spaces were agreed, but the arguments we were able to present \(through increased understanding brought about by the SUITS capacity building programme\) along with our research findings helped us influence perceptions within the municipality and persuaded them to expand the plan to accommodate 150 spaces”. \(S2\) 

###  New processes and policies within cities to increase sustainable transport measures 

 Application of innovative financing and procurement processes \(G2; R5\) has increased the capacity of cities to finance and implement sustainable transport measures \(S1, S3, S5\-6\). In Alba Iulia, this enabled procurement of cleaner vehicles equipped to monitor pollutants: 

 “*Alba Iulia will be one of the first cities in Romania with electric buses in 2022.* *Through an innovative public tender with the Ministry of Development, the city has procured 15 new buses installed with air quality monitors, enabling the monitoring of pollutants in the city”* \(S1\). 

 Through innovative procurement \(R5\), Turin has implemented sustainable freight delivery, with incentives introduced for the acquisition of clean vehicles. As a result, freight operators have experienced a 20% increase in productivity, with a 90% reduction of common air pollutant emissions \(S3\). This increase in transport operator productivity has enabled the municipality to demonstrate to other operators and stakeholders the value of investing in technologies with zero emissions. 

 Implementation of the research \(R4\-5\) through a new organisational change process has optimised trust and skill\-sharing within, and between LAs, and influenced transport policy \(S1, S3\-7\): 

 *“The biggest impact was adopting Professors Woodcock and Nienaber’s approaches to organisational change and trust. Increasingly, we have adopted a ‘bottom\-up approach’ where the management listen to employees and there is daily contact with citizens and the wider society and transport sector.” \(S4\)* 

 The research \(G1, G2\) has directed the refresh of the Statutory Transport Plan for the West Midlands \(S6\) and helped shape Valencia’s people\-centric and sustainable approach outlined in their new Mobility Regulation and associated documentation: ‘ *Towards a \(\+\) sustainable mobility in València. Policies and objectives in the area of mobility and public space of the City Council of València. ’* \(S4\). 

###  Increased LA capacity in sustainable mobility planning 

 Application of Woodcock’s research \(G1\-3\), has increased knowledge and developed capacity in citizen engagement, and the use of data informed approaches to planning, implementing and assessing sustainable mobility measures \(S1, S2, S4\-7\): 

 *“Employing a data driven approach and the METPEX measures developed by Professor Woodcock, has enabled an understanding of community diversity in Coventry in respect to public transport. Following SUITS guidelines, there has been wide consultation with vulnerable road users, which has led to a more effective implementation for the new e\-Scooter and smart crossings schemes.” \(S5\)* 

 The use of mobility data \(R2, R3\) has enabled cities to demonstrate progress against their sustainability plans, gain recognition, benefit from the award of new related projects \(S1, S2, S6\), and grow internal LA capacity \(e.g. S2, S6\): 

 *“Professor Woodcock’s focus on intelligent mobility and the METPEX measurement instruments … have informed our approach to data usage and enabled the measurement of public satisfaction with transport safety and security and public transport. Adopting these principles, TfWM has established the Data Insight Service to collect a raft of data to inform transport decision\-making* \(S6\). 

###  Improved inclusion and representation in transport planning. 

 New approaches to improve the inclusion of marginalised groups in transport planning have been embraced \(G1\-3\). Woodcock’s inclusive and participatory approaches to strategy development and implementation have been embraced by the LAs is each of the 6 cities \(S2\-8\): 

 “*Two sets of lights have been installed in areas selected following consultation with people who are impaired”* \(S2\). 

 Impact is clear in the city of Alba Iulia, where a change in thinking and policy is evident in the adoption of the’ European Charter for Equality of Women & Men in Local Life’ in November 2020 \(S8\). The charter aims to balance participation of women and men in political, social and public decision\-making and was promoted and sustained by the Romanian Hub of the TInnGO project \(R6, G3\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 SOAS\-led research commissioned by the UK Government’s Stabilisation Unit played an instrumental role in re\-shaping the UK Government’s approach to reducing violence and promoting sustainable post\-war transitions in conflict\-affected countries. The research underpinned the 2018 ‘UK Government’s Approach to Stabilisation’, which set out guidelines for the UK Government’s efforts to stabilise violent conflict across the world. Offering analytical tools to be used by policy makers and practitioners working on conflict transitions, the research informed UK Government strategic planning in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Mali and Somalia; it also influenced peace\-building NGOs and UK Government staff training. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Approximately two billion people live in parts of the world affected by violent conflict and fragility. In light of this challenge, the UK Government has recognised the need to deliver more effective interventions in conflict contexts. Conflict resolution and peacebuilding have become key components of international interventions in conflict\-affected states. In the UK, this has been reflected by the 2015 UK Aid Strategy and the UK Government’s commitment to allocate at least 50% of DFID’s budget to fragile states. However, understanding of what works has been limited and partial. Many violent conflicts remain intractable, new conflicts continue to erupt, and violence and instability regularly recur even in countries where international donors have invested heavily in trying to engineer peace. 

 Research on war\-to\-peace transitions has been carried out at SOAS since 2001, when Dr Jonathan Goodhand took up a University Lectureship \(promoted to a Professorship in 2014\). Goodhand has a long track record of research and teaching on war to peace transitions and has worked closely with Dr Patrick Meehan since 2012 \(PhD 2012–2016; Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Co\-investigator since 2017\). In 2016, the UK Government Stabilisation Unit \(SU\) commissioned Goodhand, Meehan and Dr Christine Cheng \(King’s College London\) to conduct research under the ‘Elite Bargains and Political Deals’ \(EBPD\) project to inform UK and international policy and practice on reducing levels of armed conflict and building sustainable post\-war transitions. The resulting report **\[3.1\]** provided a more robust evidence base for the UK’s approach to stabilisation and to guide policy makers in delivering more effective interventions in conflict contexts. Goodhand provided overall intellectual leadership for this report and Meehan developed much of the report’s analytical framework in the initial literature review \[3.2\] he wrote to guide the EBPD project. 

 Three areas of the research findings have been particularly influential in informing the work commissioned by the SU. These include: 

####  Political economy analysis of the drivers of armed conflict 

 Goodhand’s and Meehan’s research has emphasised the centrality of power relations and elite bargains \(discrete agreements that re\-negotiate the distribution of power and allocation of resources between elites\) to understanding the dynamics of armed conflict and war\-to\-peace transitions **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5 3.6\]**. This research – some aspects of which have been augmented with co\-authored policy\-oriented analysis with Dr Mark Sedra \(the Centre for International Governance Innovation\) **\[3.6\]** and the role of war economies in reconstruction with Professor Christopher Cramer \(SOAS\) **\[3.5\]** – highlights the need to focus more explicitly on how power is organised in society. This is crucial in order to understand \(and address\) drivers of violent conflict. Rather than a technical focus on the design of peacebuilding interventions, the research demonstrates that any intervention will be shaped by power relations and political interests and must be resilient to these pressures **\[3.2\]**. 

####  A framework for policymakers to analyse conflict dynamics surrounding war\-to\-peace transitions 

 The research has demonstrated that transitions from war to peace are shaped by the interaction between three dynamics: \(1\) the underlying distribution of power – or political settlement – on which a society is based; \(2\) elite bargains; and \(3\) formal peace agreements **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. The research provides an analytical framework for policy makers and practitioners to assess the multiple dynamics shaping the contexts in which they work **\[3.1\]**. 

####  Accounting for successes and failures of external peacebuilding interventions 

 The research provides a clear explanatory framework to show that where externally\-driven peace processes do not reflect the underlying distribution of power, the foundations for war\-to\-peace transitions will be highly unstable and the risk of renewed violence will be high. This concept of \(mis\)alignment has important policy implications for understanding why external interventions in different contexts have played a role in further destabilising armed conflicts, consolidating pre\-existing power structures, or facilitating more transformative and inclusive post\-war societies **\[3.1\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The work of Professor Goodhand and Dr Meehan in the EBPD research project provided a strong evidence base and a set of analytical frameworks that informed the shaping of the new UK Government policy approach to support stabilisation as well as country\-level strategic decision\-making for UK Government interventions in conflict\-affected contexts. The research also influenced the work of peacebuilding agencies such as the NGO Conciliation Resources and was embedded in the training of UK Government staff in various departments such as the \(former\) Department for International Development \(DFID\) and Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\), and the Ministry of Defence \(MoD\). 

####  Shaping the UK Government policy on stabilisation interventions 

 The research was fundamental in shaping the 2018 UK Government’s Approach to Stabilisation: A guide for policy makers and practitioners **\[5.1\]**. The Minister of State for International Development, Rt Hon. Alistair Burt MP, endorsed these guidelines as setting out the UK Government’s ‘latest thinking on how the UK sees the role of stabilisation in conflict\-affected contexts’ **\[5.2 p2\]**, acknowledging their importance for responding to the failures in Afghanistan and Iraq and the findings of the Iraq Inquiry. Recalling one of **\[3.1\]**’s key findings, Rt Hon. Burt stated that ‘understanding conflict and ending violence requires a total focus on the politics and the power holders at play’ and praised the centrality of this work to set the conditions for more sustainable transitions out of conflict **\[5.2 p4\]**. 

 The guidelines drew heavily upon the terminology, concepts, analytical framework and core arguments developed in the research **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. This included an explicit need to acknowledge and confront the difficult policy trade\-offs that exist between efforts to stabilise violent conflict in the short\-term, and efforts to provide the foundations for longer\-term stability and inclusive development **\[5.1 pp5, 9, 11, 49, 58–59, 85, 87, 92\]**. It also included the need to think and work politically and to acknowledge the centrality of elite bargaining processes to the dynamics of violent conflict and stabilisation **\[5.1 pp27, 38, 87–107\]**. Other core arguments used included the danger that externally\-driven peace agreements and reforms can be destabilising if they misalign with the underlying distribution of power in conflict\-affected contexts **\[5.1 pp8–9, 20, 29, 65, 87, 92\]**; and the destabilising impact of large\-scale militarised interventions **\[5.1 pp9, 61, 65\]**. 

 The guidelines explicitly cited Goodhand, Meehan and Cheng’s research **\[3.1\]** as providing ‘helpful analytical frameworks for analysts and policy makers’ working in conflict contexts as well as a fundamental evidence base **\[5.1 p90\]**. The research underscored the guidelines’ foundational stabilisation principles **\[5.1 pp9 and 89\]** and was cited as a tool for approaches to political deal\-making **\[5.1 pp92, 94 and 97\]**. Rt Hon. Alistair Burt MP also expressed being ‘especially pleased to see the development of a strong evidence base to underpin the Guide . . . and the collaborative and engaged way my team have sought advice and input from experts outside government’ **\[5.3 p2\]**. As noted in the written supporting statement by Ed Hadley, Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor, it is rare for academic research to translate so directly into policy, and the project ‘stands as a shining example of academic/government engagement and interaction’ **\[5.4 p2\]**. The research also had a positive impact on strengthening the reputation of the Stabilisation Unit. The 2018 Annual Qualitative Assessment of HMG \[Her Majesty’s Government\]’s Stabilisation Unit described the SU’s Lessons Team as a ‘key HMG thought leader on current stabilisation’, explicitly citing the EBPD project as a ‘good example’ of this **\[5.5 p6\]**, and also indicating that the project had been ‘well\-received by SU **stakeholders’ \[5.5 p3\]**.The report also attained significant media attention in the UK and internationally; for example, it received deep coverage by *The Guardian* **\[5.6\]** as well as foreign press **\[5.7\]**. 

####  Informing UK Government strategies and interventions in conflict\-affected countries 

 Through its impact on shaping the ‘UK Approach’ to Stabilisation, Cheng, Goodhand and Meehan’s work also influenced UK Government strategies and interventions in conflict\-affected contexts. The SU conducted a careful internal monitoring of research uptake from the EBPD project. As reported by Ed Hadley, the framework for analysing elite bargaining in conflict contexts **\[3.1, 3.2\]** underpinned Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability \(JACS\) reports conducted by the SU in Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Mali and Somalia **\[5.4 p1\]**. The JACS is a strategic assessment used to underpin UK National Security Council Strategies. Furthermore, **\[5.1\]** underpinned the UK Government’s new stabilisation strategy in Libya and Syria **\[5.4 p1\]**. Ed Hadley also noted that in countries such as Mali and Yemen the core principles of **\[5.1\]** guided discussions between Senior SU Advisors implementing partners delivering programmes, providing a realistic framework for UK Government engagement in\-country **\[5.4 p2\]**. Had this not occurred, he stated, there was a clear risk that unrealistic and apolitical programmatic interventions would have been implemented. For example, in Mali, SU advisors used the EBPD framework to engage with Adam Smith International, the implementing partner tasked with developing a stabilisation programme in Central Mali, ensuring that the framework was used as a ‘checklist’ to design interventions that were more conflict sensitive. **\[5.1\]** also shaped conflict analysis and the designing of UK Government conflict interventions in Syria, and underpinned parts of the 2020–2024 UK Government Strategy on Afghanistan **\[5.4 p1\]**. Country\-level strategic government documents are classified and cannot be made available; however, Ed Hadley noted in his supporting statement that ‘the project’s robust evidence base enabled substantive challenge to existing policy and has enabled alternative policy approaches to be considered’ **\[5.4 p1\]**. 

####  Influencing peacebuilding NGOs and other international donors 

 In November 2016, Goodhand and Meehan were commissioned \(alongside Walton at Bath University, and Plonski at Queen Mary University of London\) by Conciliation Resources – an international NGO committed to stopping violent conflict and creating more peaceful societies – to produce a publication entitled ‘Borderlands and Peacebuilding’ as part of Conciliation Resources’ flagship Accord Series. Co\-edited by the Senior Adviser Peace and Transition Processes and others at Conciliation Resources, it was published in November 2018 **\[5.9\]**. It played a further important role in disseminating key aspects of Goodhand and Meehan’s research on war\-to\-peace transitions to policy makers and practitioners working on peacebuilding, and the resulting cross\-border peacebuilding concepts trialled by the NGO has received ‘positive feedback from the FCDO’ \(Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\) **\[5.10\]**. **\[5.1\]** was used extensively to inform the development of the Stabilisation Leaders’ Forum ‘Stabilisation principles’ and shared definition of stabilisation, cementing the UK’s reputation as a ‘thought leader’ in this area. The forum is a group made up of the Heads of over 12 stabilisation\-focused organisations – including from Germany, US, Canada, France, Denmark and Sweden – referred to as government\-to\-government exchanges by Hadley **\[5.4 p2\]**. 

####  Impact on UK Government training 

 Goodhand and Meehan’s research also had a direct impact on the training that the UK Government provides to staff across various government departments including DFID, FCO and MoD. Indeed, between 2018 and 2020, Goodhand and Meehan developed training materials and delivered training for more than 60 government employees as part of the SU’s quarterly ‘Conflict and Stabilisation’ training course **\[5.4 p2, 5.8\]**. The SU also held briefing sessions on the EBPD report **\[3.1\]** with colleagues across government and country offices. This included sessions at the Defence Academy; in Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan; at the UK Government’s Conflict Stability and Security Fund \(CSSF\) Global Workshop; for the Joint Funds Unit \(which administers the CSSF\); and at DFID Governance and Conflict Cadre conferences. Hadley points out that ‘\[a\] daylong annual gathering of SU Senior Advisors focused entirely on **\[5.1\]** and its core precepts’ **\[5.4 p2\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UK policymakers, practitioners and campaigners pursuing better outcomes for disadvantaged households have lacked evidence\-based criteria for addressing low income. Loughborough University’s Centre for Research in Social Policy has developed an internationally innovative method for compiling minimum household budgets based on public attitudes to necessities. The resulting ‘Minimum Income Standard’ and has guided various aspects of policy and practice in the UK, leading to the following impacts: 

 1\) **increasing pay** for 200,000 workers of 6,000 Living Wage employers throughout the UK; 

  

 2\) **targeting assistance** by guiding prioritisation of \(a\) over £20 million annually in *grants by UK charities* and \(b\) £10\-12 billion that the Scottish Government is spending improving *home energy efficiency;* and 

 3\) **improving access to justice**, by supporting a Supreme Court ruling outlawing employment tribunal fees in the UK, after which 64% more workers accessed tribunals. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Continuous research from 2006 to 2020, directed by Donald Hirsch and led by Abigail Davis and Matt Padley at CRSP, has calculated and updated the level of a Minimum Income Standard \(MIS\) **\[R1\].** The research was designed to operationalise the concept of a ‘participatory social minimum’, first articulated in the 1970s by the sociologist Peter Townsend, by producing a usable set of benchmarks based on Townsend’s principles. From the original study onwards **\[R2\]**, MIS applied a rigorous and pathbreaking ‘consensual budget standards’ method, consulting groups of members of the public about what items are needed, not just for survival but in order to participate in society. Groups draw up budget lists, costed by researchers to produce regular weekly budgets required by different household types. This allows calculation of income requirements for any household type, making it a highly practical tool in UK policy and practice. 

 After the method was established in 2008, its funder, Joseph Rowntree Foundation \(JRF\) supported ongoing research at CRSP to establish a standard that could continuously influence policy and practice. Since 2009, MIS has been updated annually, using inflation data and biannual consultations with members of the public to identify changes in household requirements as society evolves **\[R1, R3\]**. JRF also funds CRSP to support knowledge exchange partnerships helping users to benefit from MIS research. For example, CRSP has worked in partnership with bodies such as Child Poverty Action Group, Gingerbread, the Association of Charitable Organisations and the Living Wage Foundation. 

 The research has advanced academic knowledge about how the public thinks about minimum acceptable living standards **\[R3\]**, while at a practical level providing  a unique metric to apply to a range of policy\-relevant issues including the level of a living wage **\[R4\]** and additional living costs in remote areas **\[R5\]**. 

 Key findings from MIS inform efforts to tackle low income in the UK, with the following  findings particularly pertinent to the impacts identified in this Case Study: 

 Finding 1: The National Minimum Wage \(NMW\) is too low to allow most working households to reach a minimum acceptable standard of living **\[R1,R2**\]. 

 Finding 2: More than two in five children, but fewer than one in five pensioners, live in households with incomes too low to reach a minimum acceptable living standard **\[R6\]**. 

 Finding 3: In some parts of the UK, much higher costs increase the risk of having insufficient income. In remote rural Scotland, for example, costs can be 10%\-40% higher **\[R5\]**.

","
1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 MIS has become the recognised benchmark across the four nations of the UK of how much people need for an acceptable living standard. Its authority derives both from the quality of the research and from the ubiquity of its uses, with each new application strengthening its status as a recognised standard. The MIS team have worked with a range of charitable and public bodies \(referred to below\), to show how MIS can be applied, helping them to build practical tools to pursue better outcomes for low income households. The following are key impacts it has had on pay, on financial and other assistance for low income households, and on access to justice. 

 **Impact 1: Influencing pay: adoption of the Voluntary Living Wage** 

 MIS research has provided the main component in calculating the level of the Voluntary Living Wage \(VLW\), now paid by nearly 7,000 UK employers accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, who estimate that this directly affects 250,000 workers’ pay. Throughout the 2010s, the campaign for a Living Wage has grown steadily: the campaign responded to the failure of the compulsory National Minimum Wage to provide adequate income \[R1, R2\]**, by persuading a growing number of employers to pay the higher VLW. The campaign’s leader, Matthew Bolton, stated that MIS 

 “*provided the initial rationale to go national with a campaign previously limited to London, and has been critical in making the case to employers for pay that reflects living costs*” **\[S1\]**. 

 In 2016, the independent Living Wage Commission established by Living Wage Foundation confirmed MIS as the basis for calculating a VLW that would “ *accurately reflect the views and experiences of ordinary people…about what is required to fully participate in society*” **\[S1\]**. 

 Matthew Bolton attested that since the UK Government’s compulsory ‘National Living Wage’ \(NLW\) was launched at a level below the VLW in 2016 “ *the evidence provided by MIS has been crucial in persuading employers to pay the real living wage* \[i.e. the VLW\], *by showing that the NLW is still too low to live on*.”  **\[S1\]**. 

 The VLW has benefited both employers and employees. In 2016, Cardiff Business School surveyed over 840 living wage employers, representing the full range of those accredited. High proportions of respondents reported reputational gains \(78%\), improved recruitment and retention \(over half\) and better\-quality job applicants \(45%\) as a consequence of implementing the VLW **\[S2\]**. An in\-depth, peer\-reviewed study of the impact on employees, carried out by the University of York, found that the VLW helped its recipients afford essentials. One participant stated: *“\[I\] can meet bills better . . . \[the\] extra income helps us not to worry*”. Others said it helped children participate in society, by funding after school activities **\[S3\]**. 

 **Impact 2: Targeting assistance for low income households** 

 The MIS evidence allows public and charitable bodies to ensure that both monetary and non\-monetary assistance are well\-targeted at those whose incomes fall below what they need. Two examples are charitable financial aid and help to households in improving home energy efficiency. 

  

 **\(a\) Prioritising charitable assistance based on evidence\-based income criteria** 

 The Minimum Income Standard is widely used as a criterion by charities helping households in financial need \(benevolent organisations\). A 2017 survey **\[S4\]** identified 22 charities, distributing £21 million a year to needy households. The charitable officers interviewed for the survey welcomed the evidence MIS provides that allows financial need across different types of household to be compared using a common metric. As a result, they had used it to replace previous criteria for awarding grants that had often appeared arbitrary.  For example, reflecting the research’s identification of large income shortfalls for families relative to pensioners **\[R6\]**, the ICE Benevolent Fund found that they had not adequately recognised the costs faced by young families. A caseworker from the charity states that this evidence has “… *led to the awarding of larger grants, enabling families to be able to continue with activities, particularly for their children \(e.g., after school activities\) that they might otherwise have had to stop*.” **\[S5\]**. 

 **\(b\) Reducing fuel poverty in Scotland** 

 In legislating to tackle fuel poverty, the Scottish Government \(SG\) sought an empirically grounded measure of how much money households need after paying fuel bills. Its expert panel found that MIS is the best available predictor of harm associated with low disposable income **\[S6\].** As a result, Scotland’s Fuel Poverty \(Targets, Definitions and Strategy\) Act, 2019, defines fuel poverty as having to spend at least 10% of income on home energy, and having disposable income at least 10% below MIS. The SG is committed to using this metric to ensure that the £10\-12 billion it plans to spend improving home energy efficiency from 2020 to 2040 prioritises low income households **\[S7\]**. Furthermore, as a direct result of CRSP’s evidence to the Scottish Parliament, the SG amended the legislation to set a higher income threshold in remote areas, recognising additional costs in such areas **\[R5\]** *,* and has commissioned CRSP to continue researching those costs **\[S7\].** 

 **Impact 3: Improving access to justice: Ensuring affordability of legal services for low income households** 

 The MIS research helps support the public objective of ensuring that people are not denied justice because they cannot afford legal expenses: it identifies the substantial proportion of households lacking adequate income to live on **\[R6\]**, who could not be expected to cover legal charges *.* In a landmark 2017 case, the Supreme Court accepted the argument of the trade union UNISON, based on MIS evidence, that the introduction of fees for employment tribunals was forcing low income workers to choose between accessing justice and maintaining an acceptable living standard. The Court agreed that workers were having to sacrifice ‘ordinary and reasonable expenditure’ as specified in MIS to pay fees **\[S8\]** and ordered their abolition. In the year following the judgement, 64% \(55,000\) more workers were able to take employers to tribunals **\[S9\]**. This change reversed a situation whereby low\-paid workers had been unable to get a fair hearing when in dispute with their employers: 85% of 719 employment lawyers responding to a 2015 survey said that fees had been detrimental to access to justice. One respondent elaborated: 

 “*Tribunal fees have had a devastating effect on access to justice. This is particularly so in maternity / pregnancy cases where the claimant has run out of money at the point of issuing proceedings because maternity pay has been exhausted or is on SMP. Many of the new family friendly rights will be unenforceable in practice for this reason*.” **\[S9\]** 

 Demonstrating scope for extending the reach of MIS in the legal system, the Law Society commissioned CRSP to use MIS to assess the consequences of the legal aid means test, presenting this analysis in its published submission to the Ministry of Justice’s 2018 legal aid review **\[S10\]**. The government followed this up by reviewing the level of the means test, drawing on MIS as a benchmark.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2015, UNESCO adopted the *Policy on the integration of a sustainable development perspective into the processes of the World Heritage Convention* which ensured \(for the first time\) that the conservation and management of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites aligns with broader sustainable development goals. Professor Labadi, drawing on her research on heritage and social justice, gender equality and sustainable development, was part of the small team responsible for the drafting of this new policy. By integrating environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and inclusive social development into the conservation, management and interpretation of more than 1,000 sites of outstanding and universal value, the policy has significantly impacted on a broad range of stakeholders including: governments; local communities \(young people, women, ethnic and religious minorities\); professionals and practitioners \(heritage professionals, tourist guides, site managers\); and NGOs and other third\-sector organisations. Since the adoption of the policy, Professor Labadi has worked with intergovernmental organisations, NGOs, governments, and civil society organisations to translate the policy into pragmatic action in varied international contexts. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Labadi’s research, which underpins this case study, focuses on the ways that heritage sites can address some of the most pressing global challenges, including social justice, gender equality and sustainable development. Since 2013, she has explored the development problems associated with sites protected by the 1972 World Heritage Convention \(World Heritage Sites\), including gentrification, exclusion and relocation of local populations, and the environmental degradation of urban settlements. The research was based on in\-depth analyses of documents on World Heritage Sites in Asia, Europe, and Latin America; first\-hand experience of working for UNESCO and ICOMOS \(International Council on Monuments and Sites\); and in\-depth ethnographic research at sites in Africa and Asia \(e.g. the Island of Mozambique and at Angkor in Cambodia \(see, in particular, **R1**, **R2**, and **R3**\). Labadi has argued that the conservation, management and interpretation of heritage sites too often occur separately from other sustainable development concerns, and that conservation, management and interpretation plans and activities should thoroughly integrate sustainable development approaches so that sites can contribute to inclusive social and economic development and the quality of life of communities. Sustainable development should tackle issues of peace and security, as well as poverty reduction, gender equality and environmental sustainability. The research has also highlighted a number of possible solutions to these problems, for example, through inclusive economic development, enhancing the quality of life and the wellbeing of locals, and protecting biological and cultural diversity **\[R1\]**. 

 In **R2** and **R3**, Labadi described how ambiguous the official documents for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention had been in the past. In particular, in **R2** she identified how the documents often omitted key principles of sustainable development, thereby overlooking the importance of inclusivity \(both in economic and in social terms\) and intergenerational equity; the requirement for the benefits from World Heritage to be shared equitably; and the need for a rights\-based approach to heritage. In **R3**, she explained the different, and at times conflicting, understandings of heritage and sustainability by key local stakeholders, and revealed the need for a newly designed policy on the topic. **R4** considers issues with the concepts of World Heritage and gender. Gender equality is a core priority of UNESCO, yet Labadi identifies the invisibility of women in World Heritage documentation, and in the Convention’s processes, as well as their lack of influence in decision\-making. 

 Throughout the period when she was undertaking the underpinning research, Labadi was in close contact with Giovanni Bocardi of UNESCO \(who was responsible for the WHSD Policy\), sharing her data and findings. As a result, the new 2015 WHSD Policy integrates the key ideas from Labadi’s publications on World Heritage and sustainable development.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Contributing to a ground\-breaking policy on sustainable development** 

 World Heritage \(WH\) Sites, designated by UNESCO for their outstanding and universal significance are protected by the 1972 World Heritage Convention. Labadi’s research on heritage and sustainable development informed a significant shift in the implementation of the Convention, when the landmark 2015 *Policy on the integration of a sustainable development perspective into the processes of the World Heritage Convention* \(WH\-SDP\), which she helped draft, was adopted. 

 As a result of her research on heritage and development, and in particular her focus on issues relating to gender equality and social and economic inclusion, Labadi was approached by Giovanni Boccardi \(then Senior Programme Specialist at UNESCO\) to contribute to the drafting of the WH\-SDP policy document **\[a\]**. She presented a first draft of the section on ‘Achieving Gender Equality’ at the first workshop on WH and Sustainable Development \(held at Cottbus University, Germany, in October 2014\). During the second workshop on World Heritage and Sustainable Development \(held in Vietnam, 22\-24 January 2015\), she presented a second draft of the text on ‘Inclusive Social Development’. With Boccardi and Jane Thompson \(an independent consultant\), and drawing on background papers and comments received, in February\-March 2015, she finalised the draft policy. She then worked with Boccardi to integrate comments received from government stakeholders after the draft policy was presented to the World Heritage Committee in June 2015. In total, 191 governments were invited to submit feedback on the draft policy **\[a\]**. 

 The WH\-SDP was presented on 19 November 2015 to the 20th General Assembly of the States Parties to the WH Convention and was fully adopted **\[b\]**. The policy represented an historic change to the WH programme, as it identified, for the first time, specific mechanisms to ensure that WH sites comply with, and are managed and interpreted according to principles of inclusive economic development, social responsibility, environmental protection, and peace and security. The policy aligned the WH Convention with the Sustainable Development Goals \(SDG\) adopted by the United Nations in September 2015, and its adoption was described in a UNESCO press release \(November 2015\) as representing ‘a significant shift in the implementation of the Convention and an important step in its history’ **\[b\]**. 

 At a meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, in July 2019, the UNESCO WH Committee noted the significant progress that had been made towards implementation of the WH\-SDP. The Committee reviewed a progress report which described how community\-based conservation projects, in Benin, Lesotho and Botswana, had strengthened the capacity of local communities to safeguard their heritage by integrating the principles of WH\-SDP **\[c\]**. Labadi had, in particular, contributed to the drafting of the policy section on gender equality in the WH\-SDP, and the progress report noted that in response to the WH\-SDP, the ‘World Heritage Centre \[the coordinator within UNESCO for all matters related to World Heritage\] has made structured efforts to ensure a gender\-sensitive and gender\-balanced approach to the implementation of its activities’ **\[c\]**. The progress report also provided examples of specific projects with a strong focus on gender equality. At Lake Ohrid \(on the North Macedonia\-Albania border\), women were clearly represented in leadership positions in an EU\-UNESCO funded project to protect natural and cultural heritage, with female participation in workshops and meetings reaching 56%. In Madagascar, a UNESCO\-led project had provided education, training and opportunities for women in the sustainable tourism sector, thereby improving livelihoods and helping them become more financially independent. In Makli, Thatta \(Pakistan\), women from local villages were being trained in ceramics production and tile making. It was noted that ‘these outreach and income generation activities have improved the lives of local women, who now play a crucial role in the conservation of the property, thereby gaining a sense of ownership, pride and identity, in addition to the material benefits they derive from the production and sale of the ceramics’ **\[c\]**. 

 In addition, the 2019 Operational Guidelines – the key document for the implementation of the Convention – requests States to comply with the principles of the 2015 Policy, including on gender equality \(paragraph 15\); ensuring benefits for heritage and society \(paragraph 112\); and using research for conflict prevention and resolution \(paragraph 215\). In addition, the Third Cycle of the Periodic Reporting Exercise \(2018\-2024\) requests States to detail how the principles from the 2015 Policy have been implemented at property level. Periodic reporting is the key official monitoring mechanism of the Convention, undertaken by governments every six years. Before 2015, states did not have to integrate sustainable development principles in site management, now this must happen and be reported upon **\[c\]**. 

 **Implementing sustainable development policy: practical, real\-world management and interpretation of World Heritage Sites** 

 UNESCO has recognised the need for improved knowledge, planning and guidance to enable stakeholders to harness the potential of World Heritage properties to contribute to sustainable development. UNESCO also recognises the importance of stakeholders having the opportunity to share good practice and experiences of implementing WH\-SDP into operational activities and processes in different regions of the world **\[b, c\]**. Labadi has responded to both these drivers in her work with stakeholders in Europe, Africa and, as of August 2020, Korea **\[d, f, g\]**. Throughout this work, as detailed below, Labadi has developed opportunities for knowledge sharing; provided tools to enhance community engagement; created detailed guidance for broad audiences; and ensured sustained engagement with governments, practitioners, advisory bodies, civil society organisations and other stakeholders. 

 In 2018, Labadi organised a workshop which brought together representatives from 40 civil society organisations involved in the implementation of the WH\-SDP. The event was part of the official programme of the European Year of Cultural Heritage \(29 March 2018, Brussels\) and was organised in cooperation with Europa Nostra \(the leading citizens movement on heritage in Europe\) and the European Cultural Foundation **\[g\]**. The aim was to find innovative ways for civil society actors, who often play a key role in the management of World Heritage sites, to implement WH\-SDP. The workshop was attended by the ICOMOS \(International Council on Monuments and Sites\) Focal Point for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. ICOMOS is responsible for evaluating cultural and mixed properties for inclusion on the UNESCO WH List and their state of conservation once on the list. Globally, it is the largest NGO on cultural heritage. The workshop made several recommendations which were published in an Action Plan that was widely disseminated to civil society organisations worldwide **\[h\]**. Subsequently, the ICOMOS Focal Point reported that the Action Plan was included as part of ICOMOS’ Advocacy Kit and was distributed at the 2019 Session of the WH Committee in Baku, as well as at the 2019 UN High Level Political Forum in New York. She further noted that ‘The activities undertaken by Prof. Sophia Labadi at the University of Kent, related to the implementation of the Policy \[WH\-SDP\], have been a catalyst for the heightened prominence of the Policy in my advocacy work connecting cultural heritage and sustainable development’ **\[i\]**. 

 Building on her 2018 workshop, in August 2019, Labadi organised a workshop in conjunction with the African World Heritage Fund \(AWHF\) and Robben Island Museum, Cape Town **\[d\]**. The AWHF is the inter\-governmental organisation which, as a UNESCO entity, works on the conservation and management of World Heritage sites in 39 African countries. The workshop was attended by WH site managers, heritage practitioners, national authorities and researchers from 18 African countries. It was also attended by the Africa Business Group, ICOMOS, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN, responsible for assessing natural and mixed properties nominated for inclusion on the WH List and their state of conservation once on the List\), and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Participants exchanged experiences and identified local\-level best practices and approaches for integrating the 2015 WH\-SDP. A draft Action Plan was initiated, and a follow\-up workshop planned for Cameroon in 2021. Following the workshop, Labadi worked with the African World Heritage Fund and the Robben Island Museum to publish a 109\-page policy report, sharing experiences of balancing conservation and sustainable development at World Heritage sites in Africa. The report, which has been widely disseminated, included case studies from seven African countries, highlighted issues and solutions to implementation of the WH\-SDP in the context of Africa, and advocated for a pragmatic approach to the integration of sustainable development perspectives into the conservation and management of World Heritage sites **\[e\]**. 

 Six months after the workshop, a follow\-up survey was conducted, in order to understand the practical impacts of the workshop and whether participants had gone on to integrate principles of the 2015 WH\-SDP into the operation of heritage sites in Africa. The results clearly indicated ‘that a number of the participants have integrated the principles of the 2015 UNESCO Policy on World Heritage and Sustainable Development into their work’ **\[e\]**. The AWHF noted examples where the outcomes from the workshop had directly influenced the practice of site management. At the Okavango Delta World Heritage Site in Botswana, the principles of the policy had been used to review their management plan. At Lake Malawi, socio\-economic initiatives were being developed to benefit local communities. At Victoria Falls/Mosi\-oa\-Tunya \(Zambia and Zimbabwe\) the Lwande Mixed Farming project was helping local communities to grow and market agricultural produce, thereby creating better food security. The site manager at Victoria Falls/Mosi\-oa\-Tunya indicated that, as a direct result of the knowledge acquired at the workshop, he had evaluated a number of tourism project proposals and activities to better align them with the principles of sustainable development articulated in the WH\-SDP **\[e\]**. 

 As a result of her research and publication with Professor Logan **\[R1\]**, in 2020 Labadi was commissioned by the Korean Government to write a paper on ‘Integrating Heritage Interpretation into a Sustainable Development Perspective’ \(August 2020\) **\[f\]**. This paper is now informing the Korean Government’s discussions on interpretative approaches and plans at World Heritage sites, and their efforts to fully integrate the principles of the WH\-SDP into this important work.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton has enhanced the European Space Agency \(ESA\) and European Commission’s \(EC\) capability to monitor global vegetation from space. Specifically, Southampton’s algorithm underpinned ESA’s development of the only global satellite data product estimating terrestrial chlorophyll content in vegetation in near real\-time. Distribution of this data through the ESA and EC’s flagship Copernicus programme has generated major benefits for agricultural and environmental service providers, including timely and targeted response to poor harvests or plant disease outbreaks. Southampton have also developed validation data and protocols that are essential to support quality assurance of satellite\-derived vegetation products and ensure their suitability for numerous operational applications, ranging from monitoring biodiversity to drought surveillance. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Chlorophyll content and concentration within a vegetation canopy control the condition and productivity of vegetation. Reliable estimation of vegetation chlorophyll content is vital for those forest and agricultural service providers who monitor crop yields, plant health, seasonality, carbon fluxes and carbon sequestration. Therefore, accurate and near\-real\-time vegetation chlorophyll content estimation enables timely response to poor harvests or plant disease outbreaks, whilst global chlorophyll content estimates enable improvements in carbon flux modelling and evaluation of vegetation response to climate change. 

 The European Space Agency’s \(ESA’s\) Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer \(MERIS\) satellite sensor was launched in March 2002, aiming primarily at improving our understanding of ocean productivity via measurement of water colour. In 2004, **Curran** led the development of the **algorithm** \[ **3.1**\] to exploit MERIS imagery for the estimation of vegetation chlorophyll content. The algorithm uses a specific feature called the ‘red edge’, which is proportional to the vegetation chlorophyll content and can be detected by MERIS. The resultant index, the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index \(MTCI\), can be derived automatically from MERIS imagery and this led to establishment of **MTCI as a** **dedicated ‘land’ product** from the MERIS sensor. 

 MERIS sensor operation ended suddenly in 2012 following unexpected loss of satellite contact, ending generation of the MTCI product. ESA identified a continued need to provide similar quantitative information on vegetation canopy chlorophyll content to the user community through subsequent satellite missions. Based on the foundation of the MTCI algorithm and requirements from many users, **Dash** led research \(Grant B\) to develop and validate a **second vegetation chlorophyll content product, OTCI** \[ **3.2**\] from ESA’s Sentinel\-3A optical sensor, launched in 2016. Sentinel\-3A is an ocean and land observation satellite that forms part of the European Union’s Copernicus programme, one of the largest and most ambitious space programmes globally. This is the first time the ESA has produced a dedicated operational global vegetation product. 

 Subsequent research at Southampton and elsewhere demonstrated the superiority of MTCI over alternative satellite\-derived products in estimating vegetation chlorophyll content and monitoring vegetation condition. For example, **Dash** and **Ogutu** developed a new **MTCI\-GPP** model to estimate terrestrial vegetation primary productivity using estimates of vegetation chlorophyll content derived from the MERIS sensor’s MTCI product \[ **3.3**\]. Further independent research demonstrated the MTCI’s suitability in quantifying vegetation processes such as phenology and productivity. For example, among over **700** papers citing Southampton’s algorithm \[ **3.1**\] is the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, which used MTCI to map forest canopy nitrogen across the Mediterranean region \(Loozen *et al.*, 2018\). 

 To be fit for purpose for specific applications, it is essential for satellite\-derived products to undergo rigorous validation to assess data accuracy and measurement uncertainty. Through research funded by ESA in 2009 \(Grant A\), **Dash** established a new procedure for validation of satellite\-derived vegetation chlorophyll content products at various sites \[ **3.4**\]. This procedure is crucial to measuring the accuracy of ESA’s operational vegetation chlorophyll content products, and is delivered to users through the Copernicus programme. Building upon the validation work, **Dash, Ogutu** and PhD student Luke Brown developed new techniques to analyse time series data and assess the accuracy of satellite\-derived land products \[ **3.5**\]. This included: \(i\) systematic estimation and propagation of **uncertainty of in\-situ measurements** \(Grant C\) and \(ii\) establishing for the first time a framework for operational validation of Copernicus land products \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton made a key contribution to the European Copernicus programme’s capability to monitor global vegetation by \(i\) providing near real\-time data on global vegetation chlorophyll content that are routinely distributed to users by the ESA, and \(ii\) establishing an operational validation procedure for vegetation monitoring products. Both of these contributions are vital to meeting the objectives of the Copernicus land monitoring services programme to provide geographical information on the status of vegetation cover to a broad range of users in the field of terrestrial environmental applications, including those in agriculture, food security and forest management. 

 ESA used Dash’s algorithm to develop a new vegetation data product, the **OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index \(OTCI\)**. OTCI is based on the Sentinel\-3 satellite’s Ocean and Land Imaging spectrometer \(OLCI\) instrument, and replaced MTCI after MERIS ceased operation in 2012. User demand for a replacement product, coupled with evidence of the Southampton algorithm’s robustness, led ESA to include the ‘red edge’ detection capability offered by OTCI within the mission requirements document for the Copernicus Sentinel\-3 satellite programme. Since Sentinel 3 was launched in October 2016, ESA has used OTCI as a near real\-time, global data product on vegetation chlorophyll content. Dash’s group authored the user guide and algorithm description \[ **5.2**\]. The OTCI is currently \(February 2021\) the only near\-real time, global operational product estimating terrestrial vegetation chlorophyll content. An operational data product is one that ESA has committed to deliver long\-term and in near\-real time, guaranteeing users its continued and timely production. It is distributed to users free of charge through the Copernicus programme. As ESA states *‘the unique capability of the OTCI algorithm to exploit the red edge position, thus providing accurate information on very high level of chlorophyll contents which cannot be performed by other sensors, put Europe and the European Space Agency and Copernicus Programme in a unique and leading position for monitoring the state of vegetation all over the world*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 During 2017 alone, 2.44 pebibytes \(> 1000 terabytes\) of Sentinel 3 OTCI data were downloaded from Copernicus’ dissemination system \[ **5.3**\]. Copernicus programme users have deployed OTCI to monitor and manage terrestrial ecosystems, including estimating forest and crop health. As ESA stated “ *The innovative product \(OTCI\) that was developed by Dash’s team now contributes to an overall observation system that allows us to better understand how our planet is evolving and how it is responding to climate change and at the same time allows us to better understand climate change itself*” \[ **5.1**\] *.* 

 To ensure the quality of their operational data products meets the expected user requirements, in 2016 the European Commission established a new service called the Ground\-Based Observations for Validation \(GBOV\). Southampton’s research on the ground\-based validation of satellite\-derived vegetation data products \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\] led to **Dash**’s group writing an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for the European Commission specifying validation procedures for three other vegetation products – leaf area index, **LAI**; fraction of vegetation cover, **FVC**; and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, **FAPAR** \[ **5.4**\]. **Dash**’s group led the validation of the vegetation component \[ **5.5**\] and from 2017, conducted one of the largest and most comprehensive ground validation exercises globally, processing ground data across the world to determine the products’ accuracy as part of ESA’s Sentinel\-3 Validation Team. In 2017, ESA noted *‘Feedback from the Sentinel\-3 Validation Team meeting provided essential information to ESA and EUMETSAT to progress with the evolution and improvement of Sentinel\-3's core data products’* \[ **5.5**\]. The validation data are now being routinely used by the European Commission \(EC\) to ensure the operational products meet user requirements. The EC has noted that they ‘… *reproduce well the changes due to drought and wet conditions in Europe, as well as the realism of the temporal variation over specific events around the globe’* \[ **5.6**\]. Since 2017, the EC has delivered these three products – LAI, FVC, FAPAR – through the Copernicus programme to users worldwide. They are used by more than 6,000 organisations and users worldwide for a wide range of applications ranging from monitoring biodiversity to drought surveillance \[ **5.7**\]. For example, the EC’s Joint Research Centre uses Copernicus FAPAR and LAI product as key inputs to the Europe\-wide Monitoring Agriculture ResourceS \(MARS\) crop early warning programme \[ **5.8**\], which supports the Common Agricultural Policy and food security assessments worldwide. 

 In addition to ensuring the quality of the three satellite\-based vegetation products \[ **5.4**\], the Copernicus programme has distributed the ground\-based GBOV validation data set produced by **Dash**’s group since October 2018. The GBOV data are the largest ground data set for in\-depth quality assessment of any satellite\-derived vegetation product. Since their release in 2019, they have been downloaded by more than 300 users worldwide \[ **5.9**\]. Through such downloads, users have applied Southampton’s ground data to accuracy assessment of other satellite\-derived vegetation data products \(e.g. those from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer \(MODIS\) sensor\) alongside the data products distributed through the Copernicus programme \[ **5.10**\]. 

 Meanwhile, users have also benefitted significantly from implementing Dash’s chlorophyll algorithms independently of ESA. For example, in 2018 the World Bank reviewed the performance of algorithms for their prediction of crop yields from satellite data and recommend use of MTCI for countrywide maize crop yield estimates in Uganda, noting *‘the superior performance of MTCI is noteworthy’* \[p. 17\] and *‘The large boost in performance when using MTCI with Sentinel2 therefore more than outweighed any loss in accuracy from using coarser resolution’* \[ **5.11**\]. 

 The MTCI and OTCI algorithms developed at the University of Southampton thus formed the basis for innovative and robust data products for global vegetation monitoring which help the European Commission to deliver part of its flagship Copernicus programme. These data products provide accurate and timely information for users to monitor and manage both crops and our terrestrial biosphere.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In the UK, type 2 diabetes \(T2D\) affects over 4.2 million people and the overall costs exceed £23 billion. Although it was previously thought to be inevitably progressive, Newcastle research showed that remission of T2D was possible when it is diagnosed within 10 years. A specific low calorie diet returns insulin secretion to normal in approximately half of participants. This paradigm\-shifting research informed the 2016 WHO Global Report on Diabetes and the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan. In 2020, over 500 patients in England were enrolled in an NHS pilot scaling up Newcastle clinical trial techniques. Over the next 2 years, 5,000 patients will be enrolled into this pilot. A similar low calorie diet intervention has been implemented across Scotland. These pilots offer hope to millions of patients that their T2D can be reversed.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Diabetes burden</ins> 

 By 2040, approximately 642 million people \(10% of the world’s population\), are expected to be affected by diabetes. In the UK, about 4.7 million people live with diabetes, of which over 90% have type 2 \(T2D\). The annual amount directly spent on diabetes treatment \(including type 1\), complications and associated diseases \(including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, retinopathy, amputation, neuropathy and depression\) is over £23 billion. 

 <ins>Identification of the cause</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>T2D</ins> 

 Before Newcastle University research, the causative mechanism of T2D was unclear, although caloric restriction \(for example through gastric surgery\) was known to improve glucose control in some patients. The Twin Cycle hypothesis, proposed following research from Newcastle \(R1, R2\) and elsewhere, postulated that modest but prolonged excess calorie intake promotes a fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance. The compensatory increase in insulin further stimulates conversion of sugar to fat in the liver, setting up a vicious cycle. This also increases liver output of plasma triglyceride. As a consequence, fatty acids delivered to and taken up by islets in the pancreas cause metabolic stress on the beta cells, decreasing their ability to produce insulin after meals. The hypothesis implies that a sudden decrease in calorie intake should decrease liver insulin resistance, with normalisation of overnight plasma glucose, and allow return of normal insulin secretion. 

 <ins>Successful remission of T2D</ins> 

 To test the Twin Cycle hypothesis, a practical and reproducible method of achieving 15kg weight loss in research participants within 8 weeks during everyday life was developed from clinical insight and previous study knowledge. Substantial weight loss was achieved and recorded *in vivo*. Detailed metabolic testing, coupled with new MRI techniques, determined the change in the fat content of the liver and pancreas \(R3\). The Counterpoint \(R3\) and Counterbalance \(R4\) studies used this 8 week, 600\-800 calorie per day liquid diet to achieve successful T2D remission in patients and establish that: 

-  Liver fat, fasting liver glucose production and fasting blood glucose levels normalise within a month. 

-  Intra\-pancreatic fat and first\-phase insulin secretion \(previously thought to be irreversibly lost in T2D\) gradually returned to normal over 8 weeks, permitting post\-meal control of blood glucose to be normalised and maintained over 8 months. 

 Importantly, these studies established that T2D remission is achievable in 50% of patients diagnosed within 10 years, and that starting the diet closer to initial diagnosis improved remission success \(90% response within 4 years of diagnosis, R4\). 

 <ins>DiRECT trial of T2D remission</ins> 

 Following this success, Newcastle and colleagues from the University of Glasgow conducted the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial \(DiRECT\), a cluster\-randomised controlled trial designed to test diet applicability in a routine primary care setting \(R5\). A total of 306 patients with a time\-after\-onset of less than six years were recruited from 49 GP surgeries in Scotland and North East England. Patients were given Counterweight\-Plus, a specific low calorie diet \(LCD\) involving a 12 week period of 800 calories a day, followed by food reintroduction and continued weight maintenance for a total of 12 months. After 12 months, 46% of LCD participants achieved remission \(defined as glycated haemoglobin of less than 6.5% after 2 months off antidiabetic medication\) contrasted with only 4% of the control group. In the intervention cohort, remission correlated with weight loss \(R5\), and a 2\-year follow up of DiRECT patients showed that remission persisted in patients who maintained weight loss \(R6\). Studies on the Newcastle cohort of DiRECT confirmed the long term improvement in liver and pancreas function during remission of diabetes, and that weight regain \(in a minority\) caused accumulation of fat in liver and pancreas with redevelopment of diabetes, confirming the final aspect of the Twin Cycle Hypothesis. 

 Newcastle research also disproved the widely\-held belief that T2D is caused by death of beta cells, finding instead that these simply become “dormant”. R7 reported that the functional beta cell mass, decreased by 50% in diabetes, gradually returned to normal by 12 months then remained steady to 24 months. Secondly, R8 showed the shrunken pancreas typical of T2D gradually returned to normal. These findings explain why T2D can be reversed, and also why this is more likely in patients with shorter\-term T2D. The impact of this paradigm\-shifting research is described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impacts on policy</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>health services</ins> 

 Newcastle research informed several high\-level policies, which underpinned subsequent impacts on health services. 

 First, R2 informed the 2016 WHO Global Report on Diabetes \(EV1\), the first of its kind to discuss the global challenges facing diabetes treatment and current recommendations. Newcastle research supports the section on T2D remission through weight loss, stating “ *It has been suspected for some time that energy restriction through a very low\-calorie diet can lead to the reduction of symptoms or to the reversal of hyperglycaemia typical of type 2 diabetes – the reversal may be maintained so long as weight is not regained \[R2\].*” 

 The Scottish Government’s 2018 framework \(EV2\) provides guidance to partners delivering a £42 million 5\-year strategy to combat T2D. Newcastle research on the potential for T2D remission \(R3, R4\) informs the background to “Level 3 – Targeted intervention”, and suggests DiRECT total diet replacement techniques \(R5\) as a successful strategy for T2D remission. The Scottish Government began implementation of the framework in 2018 in 3 early\-adopter NHS Scotland Boards including the East region, Tayside and Ayrshire and Arran \(EV3\). By April 2019, all 14 Boards were implementing the framework \(EV4\). Counterweight\-Plus, the same diet replacement formula provided during the DiRECT study, is the only programme currently recommended by NHS Scotland for eligible patients and, as of the end of 2020, is used by 13 Boards \(EV3, EV4\). 

 The 2019 NHS Long\-Term Plan cites R5 in section 2.17: “ *some people with type 2 diabetes can achieve remission through adoption of a very low calorie diet. This allowed nearly half of patients to stop taking anti\-diabetic drugs and still achieve non\-diabetic range glucose levels \[R5\]”.* Furthermore, the document commits to an NHS programme which uses diet as an intervention for T2D. *“We will therefore test an NHS programme supporting very low calorie diets for obese people with type 2 diabetes”* \(EV5\). 

 NHS England began this low calorie diet \(LCD\) pilot programme in September 2020, delayed from March 2020 due to the COVID\-19 pandemic. The pilot is a joint initiative between NHS England, Public Health England and Diabetes UK to test LCDs and total diet replacement \(TDR\) approaches informed by DiRECT on a nationwide scale, to achieve T2D remission \(EV6a, EV7\). 

 <ins>Impacts</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>patients and healthcare providers</ins> 

 Ultimately, the goal of the NHS pilot and Scottish implementation is to treat patients. The NHS LCD programme is committed to recruiting 5,000 patients to the implementation pilot over 2 years: as of December 31<sup>st</sup> 2020, around 500 patients have been enrolled and begun remission intervention \(EV7\). The 10 NHS England LCD pilot sites are supported by service providers and as an example of the impacts to them, Momenta Newcastle Ltd \(the Birmingham and Solihull CCG provider\) confirms that the 3\-phase DiRECT model is the core of the intervention, delivered as “ *20 group sessions plus an individual phone call in three phases over 12 months to groups of up to 15 participants*” \(EV8\). 

 Although national data for Scotland is not yet available, 500 patients were anticipated in 2019\-2020 \(EV4\). In 2020, 77 patients were enrolled in the East region NHS board \(47% of the region’s T2D patients\), with 15 completing TDR and achieving a median weight reduction of 19kg 6 months after returning to a normal diet \(EV9\). Enrolment in both countries was delayed due to the COVID\-19 pandemic, reducing patient numbers, but enrolment has now resumed \(EV3, EV7\). 

 A survey of GPs from 19 practices in Scotland and Tyneside who participated in DiRECT found that 90% have consequently changed their routine treatment of T2D patients \(EV10\). Comments included an increased focus on recommending weight loss and lifestyle changes as a method of diabetes treatment, especially in newly\-diagnosed patients. 

 DiRECT findings have also expanded beyond the NHS to inform diabetes remission programmes delivered by other healthcare providers. One example is Diabetes 800 from Oviva \(EV11\), and since it is delivered digitally patients can be given personalised feedback. Since January 2020, 52 people from the Wolverhampton and East Riding CCGs have used this programme \(EV11\). 

 <ins>Economic i</ins><ins>mpacts</ins> 

 Counterweight Ltd., a spin\-out of Robert Gordon University, provided the specially formulated Counterweight\-Plus LCD for DiRECT in 2014. Following involvement with other research projects, Counterweight Ltd. was incorporated as a new company in March 2018. The CEO confirms that “ *Without DiRECT and the wide coverage of the results, Counterweight Limited would not now exist, nor would the company have been in a position to raise any funds*” \(EV4\). A small company, as of 2020 they directly employ 7 people but also outsource services to a network of 150 Counterweight\-trained freelance dietitians. Counterweight Ltd. provide Counterweight\-Plus to 13 NHS Scotland Boards and hold contracts to support several NHS weight\-management teams in England and Wales \(EV4\). 

 <ins>Impacts</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>education about T2D remission</ins> 

 Remission of T2D has been met with considerable enthusiasm from charities and patient groups. In 2017, independent research by the James Lind Foundation for Diabetes UK, the leading UK diabetes charity, found that diabetes remission was the most important research question for people with type 2 diabetes \(EV6b\). Diabetes UK has since made remission one of their four priorities and included it as a key part of their research strategy \(EV6a\). Diabetes UK have also made significant updates to information provided to the general public and practitioners, such as a freely available “Information Prescription” document used by primary care staff when discussing T2D remission with patients. They have fully updated their website, adding pages explaining the results of DiRECT and including resources on T2D remission. These pages were accessed 380,000 times between January 2019 and 30<sup>th</sup> June 2020 \(EV6a\). 

 <ins>In summary</ins> 

 Newcastle research determined the cause of T2D and showed that remission is possible through an LCD, and that the DiRECT intervention framework provides suitable strategies at the clinical level. Following high\-level policy changes, DiRECT principles have been implemented across Scotland and are being trialled at 10 NHS England sites, supporting thousands of patients with T2D.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Britain today is home to over 3,000,000 people of South Asian heritage, and – because many of their forebears hailed originally from Punjab and Bengal – almost all their families were affected by the 1947 Partition of British India.  Enduring historical perceptions about Partition continue to reinforce mutual suspicions at community level, with lingering bitterness a direct consequence of the violence that accompanied it.  Ansari’s research on Partition’s long\-term consequences highlights its complex legacies.  By challenging engrained assumptions about Partition, her research directly informed the activities of interfaith and community groups, teachers, think tanks, arts organisations and young people in present\-day Britain. Against the backdrop of its 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary \(2017\) and in preparation for its 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2022, Ansari’s historical expertise engages different publics actively with a key event that is as much part of Britain’s history as that of South Asia.  Ansari’s research advanced understanding, learning and participation through shaping educational and community initiatives relating to Partition in present\-day Britain. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Much history writing about India and Pakistan in the second half of the twentieth century was rigidly separated along nation\-state lines, even though their histories remained ‘entangled’ due to having been part of the same British empire in South Asia.  The result was an uncomfortable, at times tense, historiographical ‘division’ in terms of how far directly comparable social and political developments taking place in the two states were explored.  This is a shortcoming in the existing literature that Ansari’s research has consistently challenged. R1 sheds valuable light on the interconnected impact and legacies of the 1947 Partition of India.  It shows how far Partition’s ‘aftershocks’ went on to shape political relationships and social interactions on the ground and highlights how far these legacies are core to any understanding of the subsequent difficult relationships between different communities brought together by Partition. 

 By identifying and explaining the common experiences shared by people living on both sides of the new border in the 1940s and 50s, R5, the culmination of a decade’s exploration, makes a key contribution to a significant historiographical move away from understandings of Independence based on high\-level political decision\-making to instead accommodating popular experiences of the end of empire in South Asia.  This research emphasises the crucial importance of taking proper account of what was happening in the localities as well as at centres of national power.  It draws attention to shared, cross\-border histories within the region more broadly, challenging the exclusivity of national narratives that have emerged thanks more contemporary political rivalries and concerns.  Finally, by straddling the colonial and postcolonial periods, her historiographical approach connects key episodes in the history of South Asia that are have been addressed separately in much history writing. 

 The AHRC collaborative research project associated with this Impact Case Study was directly prompted by the need to respond in a new historiographical way to issues exposed by Partition’s 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2007 \(G1\).  Public events in Britain in 2007 highlighted very starkly the dearth of comparative understanding about ‘what had happened next’ in both India and Pakistan.  Crucial early years of state creation and nation\-building remained poorly understood from a comparative perspective, with historians of South Asia generally overlooking these developments in favour of earlier or later events.  Ideological fixities, nationalist histories and limited access to archives and other documentary forms of evidence had previously made comparative assessments of this transition period very challenging.  Accordingly, Ansari’s research on South Asia’s ‘formative’ experiences in the decade after Independence, with especial reference to parallel developments in Pakistan and India, reveals what notions of belonging meant in practice during a key period of political transition and nation\-state making.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prior to this research \(and before 2015\), many people of South Asia heritage did not appreciate the complicated immediate or long\-term effects of Partition on their communities. Ansari’s research has raised awareness of Partition’s legacies in Britain, both within South Asian heritage communities and in wider society. Her historical expertise has shaped activities of her partners across the cultural, heritage and education sectors and driven initiatives between 2015 and 2020 to generate better\-informed public understandings of Partition.  Key beneficiaries are community and inter\-faith groups, arts organisations, theatre companies, youth charities, teachers, young people, and a race equality think\-tank. 

 **Advancing community reconciliation initiatives linked to 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Partition \(2017\)** 

 Ansari’s historical expertise informed the ‘Partition History Project’, an educational pressure group established by interfaith Church of England clergy \(active between 2015 and 2018\) to raise public awareness of Partition’s continuing significance. Its founder Canon Michael Roden explained how Ansari’s research changed their approach: “we had identified a problem but had not as yet a solution, so we reached out to secular academic historians working in this field to help.  This is when you came to our help\! ... giving a very clear explanation of the trauma of Partition, the huge difficulties of explaining this difficult history to pupils and, at the same time the complete necessity of trying to do so not just for inter\-communal understanding but because it is now a major chapter in the history of Britain” **\(S1\)**. 

 The Partition History Project ran a pilot programme of educational work centred on Partition with two schools in Bedfordshire \(Luton\) and Hertfordshire \(Stevenage\). Both towns contain sizeable South Asian\-heritage populations \- Muslims in Luton and Sikhs in Stevenage – whose families were directly affected by Partition displacement and violence.  Ansari worked closely with the Runnymede Trust \(brought in as a partner by the Partition History Project\) to deliver this pilot study in 2016, which drew on educational materials prepared by Ansari and a teacher member of the Partition History Project.  The Trust’s evaluation report \- 'Nations Divided: How to teach the history of partition' – was launched in the House of Lords in February 2017 to a positive reception.  According to the Runnymede Trust, the initiative “chart\[ed\] opportunities and challenges in teaching this history and serve\[d\] as a case study for future projects … students and teachers in the participating schools had a very positive experience of the pilot ... The pilot project was successful in increasing student understanding of the history of partition” **\(S2\)**.  The Partition History Project findings directly fed into and drove later initiatives to expand Partition education from 2018. 

 **Shaping heritage and arts organisations’ response to Partition’s 70th anniversary \(2017\)** 

 Ansari used her research expertise in the run\-up to Partition’s 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary \(2017\) to drive home the urgency of recognising the shared legacies of Partition, and why institutions in Britain had a responsibility to engage proactively with this history.  In December 2015, she chaired the British Council’s national scoping discussion in Manchester at which representatives from approximately 100 UK arts and heritage organisations addressed how to mark the commemoration in 2017. According to Jim Hollington \(British Council Director Arts, South Asia\), Ansari’s “session was cited by everyone that I spoke to as the highlight of the day, bringing the events of 1947 to life through very personal reflections” **\(S3\)**; indeed, many of the commemorative events that took place in 2017 focused precisely on individual, often intimate, memories of Partition as the starting point for enhancing public understanding of why and how and with what consequences it occurred. 

 **Generating young people’s awareness of the impact and legacies of Partition** 

 Ansari’s research on the legacies of Partition helped drive a successful Heritage Lottery Fund application by Slough\-based youth and community organisation Aik Saath \(lit. ‘together as one’\) to fund a local oral history project in 2017.  This ‘Partition Women’s Voices’ community project brought together young people from diverse heritages \(i.e. not just South Asian\) who collected Partition testimonies from women belonging to South Asian communities in the town and then used these to mount a well\-received local exhibition in Aug 2017.  According to Aik Saath’s Heritage Learning Officer, Charlotte Williams, “It was down to \[Ansari’s\] introductory workshop, which engaged 40 young people in activities to explore the history of Partition, that the project got off to such a successful start…. Furthermore, \[Ansari’s\] vital support advising on the content of the exhibition was crucial to ensuring that this significant event was told in an accurate and accessible manner” **\(S4\)**.  According to the other project partner Culture Studios, Ansari “encouraged the young people to use their imagination and empathy … As a result, many young women were keen to volunteer and work on this project”, and the project contributed to improved cross\-community understanding within the town **\(S4\)**. 

 As a result of the work with schools in Luton and Stevenage, Ansari’s historical expertise was utilised to engage young people with Partition’s continuing relevance. The Historical Association \(UK National Charity for History that supports history teaching and learning\) commissioned her to provide its briefing on Partition to schoolteachers in its journal *Teaching History* \(June 2017\).  Print copies of the edition which featured her briefing were distributed to \[text removed for publication\]. In 2017 The Historical Association’s secondary membership reach was \[text removed for publication\], which included staff members in departments with access to the print or the digital copy.  By December 2020, the briefing’s page had been viewed \[text removed for publication\] on line since it was published **\(S5\)**. In 2017, the not\-for\-profit media outlet ‘ *The Conversation*’ commissioned Ansari to write a comment piece entitled ‘How the Partition of India happened – and why its effects are still felt today’, with publication timed to coincide with the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary \(August 2017\) **.**   This article continues to be downloaded on a regular basis by huge international readership \(Dec 2020 approximately 555,000\+ hits, approximately 10\-12,000 per month\), and has also been republished in *Business Standard* \(circulation: 96,000; one of the largest Indian English\-language daily edition newspapers\) and *The Independent* \(online\) **\(S6\)**. This international readership for Ansari’s comment piece included school students, including students in the USA and South Korea who subsequently interviewed Ansari for their own ‘National History Day’ assignments, and produced projects that focused on the themes of ‘Conflict and Compromise in History’ and ‘Partitions’. 

 **Inspiring collaboration between theatre\-makers and educational initiatives \(2016\-18\)** 

 Ansari’s research was used by the playwright, Sudha Bhuchar to provide the historical context for the revival of her 2006 play *Child of the Divide* in 2016. The play contributed to the Partition History Project as the creative vehicle through which young people in Britain could understand Partition.  The play resonated strongly with audiences: e.g. “Being a Muslim living in England, the play has really struck a chord. … I will celebrate more \[sic\] on community cohesion and encourage and promote the same thinking among our younger generations” **\(S7\)**. In 2017, having obtained further funding \(another GBP40,000 from The Kirby Laing Foundation and GBP80,000 from the National Lottery\-Arts Council England\), *Child of the Divide* toured nationally \(London, Manchester, Burnley, Bolton, Luton, Liverpool, Bradford, Letchworth and Stornoway\). As Bhuchar explained, throughout 2016\-18, “Professor Ansari undertook talks, workshops and post\-show platforms with the cast and creative team and inspired teachers and our team to grasp the historical knowledge and context so that they felt able to talk to students and audiences about the play with confidence” … “This was a brilliant collaboration between a dedicated and passionate academic and artists which I think stands as a model for future collaborations”.  Bhuchar commissioned Ansari to produce the introduction for a new edition of *Child of the Divide* \(Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017\):  “it really framed my play within the history of the period and provided a context for it in all the platform and post show events that Sarah was part of” **\(S8\)**. 

 *Child of the Divide* Production Report showed that 4,778 people watched the play, including 2,550 young people, and 25 creative learning and wrap\-around events involved 2,009 participants. Between 40\-50% of the total audience were of a South Asian/BAME background. A digital audience of a further 47,000 engaged with *Child of the Divide* via the ‘Bhuchar Boulevard’ website, and both national and regional radio coverage was deemed as “ *excellent*”.  In May 2018 *Child of the Divide* \(winner of the Best Stage Production category at the UK 2018 Asian Media Awards\) was invited to Toronto’s Harbourfront international festival for children and young people, where Ansari was resident historical expert, enabling Canadian audiences to understand why the story of a child in 1947 India remained so relevant in a world of travel bans and illegal border crossings **\(S8\)**. 

 **Shaping South Asian history and heritage national initiatives \(2018 onwards\)** 

 From 2018 onwards, Ansari’s historical expertise has informed the ‘Partition Commemoration Campaign’.  This initiative was spearheaded by grandchildren of Partition survivors together with Faiths Forum London and the Grand Trunk Project and is backed by a cross\-party group of MPs and British South Asian journalists and community organisations.  In 2018, the Campaign organisers approached Ansari following her contribution to at a Grand Trunk Road public event at the British Museum in 2017, inviting her to co\-chair its new ‘Partition Education Group’ with William Gould, University of Leeds. The Partition Education Group, which includes museum and archive professionals, community education specialists, schoolteachers and students, are tasked with raising awareness of the urgency of teaching South Asian history – and specifically Partition – in British schools.  The 2020\-21 chair \(Raj Unsworth\) has highlighted how much this initiative has benefitted from Ansari’s involvement, citing her expertise as “highly influential in our thinking about the Partition”. Ansari “has actively and significantly helped \[the Group\] organise meetings, workshops and seminars, and has regularly put us in touch with important contacts as well as assisting us with funding applications” **\(S9\)**. 

 The Partition Commemoration Campaign drew directly on Ansari’s historical expertise in its four scoping meetings \(2018\-20\), during two roundtable events in the Houses of Parliament \(July 2018; February 2019\), and at the launch of the Campaign’s own ‘South Asia Heritage Month’ national initiative \(July 2019\).  \[text removed for publication\] **\(S9\)**.  Despite the disruptive impact of Covid\-19, the inaugural South Asia Heritage Month went ahead as scheduled between 18 July\-17 August 2020 albeit online, holding over 60 official events and more than 150\+ fringe events, with its hashtag \#southasianheritagemonth gaining 83,600,000 impressions and a 30,000,000 reach around the world. According to one social media post in August 2020, “The biggest lesson I have taken from the first year of South Asian Heritage Month is how intertwined British history is with that of South Asia” \(Ruby Bokhari\) **\(S9; S10\)**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: Research underpinning greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emission calculations has improved the accuracy of estimates from UK agricultural systems and showed soil\-derived emissions of nitrous oxide \(N<sub>2</sub>O\) are lower than previously estimated. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: Improved understanding of the sources of agricultural GHGs allows targeted control measures aimed at reducing overall emissions. Our research made an important contribution to the UK and Scottish Government’s development of GHG mitigation support policies \(Committee on Climate Change report 2019; the Scottish Climate Change Plan 2018\). As a result, the developed policies focus more on mitigating methane \(CH<sub>4</sub>\) emissions from livestock production rather than N<sub>2</sub>O soil\-derived emissions. Internationally, our research has informed the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GHG reporting guidelines and been adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change . 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

####  The Challenge: Develop understanding of the sources of agricultural GHG emissions and improve emission inventory reporting. 

 The UK Climate Change Act \(2008, amended 2019\) sets legally binding restrictions on total greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions. Progress towards these targets is assessed against the annual UK\-GHG inventory. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) guidelines allow the UK\-GHG inventory to be updated with improved data, analysis and estimates of Emission Factors \(EFs\) since 2017. High accuracy reporting is important to enable effective mitigation measures and policies. 

 Considerable uncertainty has surrounded the portion of agricultural GHGs attributed to nitrous oxide \(N<sub>2</sub>O\) in the UK\-GHG inventory. We have developed a unique, integrated, and interdisciplinary research programme to improve the accuracy of GHG\-UK reporting and influence policy priorities to deliver future “low\-carbon” farming systems. By accounting for UK\-specific climatic, geographical, and farming practices we have refined GHG reporting at national and devolved levels. Most notably, this work has shown that soil\-derived emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O are lower than previously calculated \(prior to 2016\) but estimates for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions remain unchanged. Consequently, we showed CH<sub>4</sub> accounts for a greater proportion of overall agricultural GHG emissions in the UK than previously thought. 

  

####  A UK\-specific method for increasing the precision of GHG emissions factors. 

 Our research played a leading role, managing 7 of 37 national experiments \(resulting in 12 peer reviewed publications\) in the multi\-disciplinary, collaborative GHG Platform Research Programme which involved 15 UK research groups. We received more than GBP5,000,000 between 2011 and 2015 from funders including the UK Government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the European Union, and the Scottish Government to support research on GHG reporting. By leading the national programme of field experimentation, we provided evidence for a UK\-specific method of calculating emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O. Unlike previously used methods, our new emissions model takes account of soil type, fertiliser, and rainfall, and has now been incorporated into the most recent inventory reporting on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from 2016 onwards first reported in 2018 \[3.1\-3.4\]. 

 To allow national comparison and validation of results collected using our new UK\-specific method for calculating N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, we developed new measurement approaches using chamber measurements \[3.1\] and harmonised approaches to experimentation and data analysis to improve estimates of GHG emissions \[3.1\]. This is important because of the high global warming potential of N<sub>2</sub>O \(298 times that of CO<sub>2</sub>\). Research on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions has been developed in a series of papers published between 2016 and 2019 \[3.2\-3.4\] and demonstrates that newly calculated emissions fall well below previously published estimates. For example, the EF for urine of grazing livestock was reduced from the previous inaccurate estimate of 2% to our improved estimate of 0.44% \[5.1c\]. N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soils are now 40% lower across the time series from 1990 than were reported prior to our research. 

####  Integration of emission estimates with economic and social impacts of interventions to support policy interventions. 

 Using our estimates in national level GHG Marginal Abatement Cost Calculations \(MACCs\) has supported development of UK Carbon Budgets and the Net Zero goals. Our developments in GHG MACCs include a method to account for other pollutants such as ammonia, phosphorus, and sedimentation \[3.5\] and for uncertainty of the calculations \[3.6\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

####  
Pathways to impact 

 Our work to improve Emission Factor \(EF\) accuracy estimates has directly informed UK and Scottish Governments, through providing evidence for developing GHG mitigation support policies. As a result of our work, CH<sub>4</sub> contribution to agricultural emissions is recognised as higher than previously calculated \(54% versus previously estimated 48%\), so policies have been developed to increase focus on mitigating emissions from livestock production rather than from soil \[5.1a\]. Internationally, our research has fed into the IPCC GHG reporting guidelines \[5.2\] and been adopted by international reporting of GHG emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) \[5.1c\]. The improved EF accuracy has directly impacted the farming industry through advisory support and policies developed in the Scottish Government’s Climate Change Plan \[5.3\]. In addition, providing a mechanism by which our above described research can directly impact farming practice, we developed a tool, AgRECalc©, that determines on\-farm resource efficiency and emissions to help the farming industry lower its carbon footprint \[5.4a, b\]. 

####  Impact on UK GHG reporting and carbon budgets 

 Our experimental, modelling and synthesis research formed a pivotal role in GHG emissions reporting and was commended by the UK national emissions inventory team \[5.3b\]. As a result of our lead research on the GHG Platform programme and EF calculations, estimates of UK agricultural emission have become more accurate, and these more accurate estimates are now incorporated into annual reporting in the National Inventory \[5.1\]. Our more detailed methodology better reflects environmental conditions and management practices and has allowed the UK to adopt more detailed reporting, moving from IPCC defined Tier 1 to Tier 2 reporting \[5.1\]. 

 Owing to this higher reporting Tier, the UK’s reports of agricultural GHG emissions were reduced by 5.7MtCO<sub>2</sub>e/year \(via lowered N<sub>2</sub>O emissions\), compared with the previous IPCC default methodology. This reduction equates to a 11.6% reduction in agricultural emissions in the 2016 inventory report compared to the 2015 inventory figures. The implications for policy and industry of our improved method and the reduced emission estimates places greater emphasis on reducing other GHG sources such as ruminant CH<sub>4</sub> emissions \[5.5d\]. 

 Our GHG research has provided information on the potential mitigation in UK agriculture and the cost\-effectiveness of mitigation methods to the Committee on Climate Change \(CCC\) \[5.5 a, b\]. The CCC used our results in their carbon budget recommendations, which in turn form the basis of UK Carbon Budgets including those published at the end of 2020 \[5.5 c, d\] and set the target date earlier for the net zero target in the Climate Change \(Scotland\) Act 2009 \[5.3a\]. At a UK level, our analysis has identified that there is the potential for cost\-effective mitigation of 7.1MtCO<sub>2</sub>e/year by 2035, in work that has been referenced by the CCC Sixth Carbon Budget \[5.5d\]. Research results also informed Scotland’s Climate Change Plan, which sets out the planned policies to achieve the climate targets \[5.3a & b\], and influenced policies on nutrient management, soil testing, livestock management and precision farming \[5.3\]. 

####  Impact on economy through footprint calculator 

 Our research has driven the development and improved design of an on\-farm GHG calculator tool \(AgRECalc<sup>©</sup>\) \[5.4\], that calculates resource use and GHG emissions for the whole farm, per enterprise and per unit of saleable product. AgRECalc<sup>©</sup> has been used to footprint more than 4,000 farms with clients including major retailers Morrisons and Waitrose, providing farm enterprises with detailed information on emission sources and approaches to mitigation as well as benchmarking against similar enterprises. The calculators allowed farms to reduce costs by an average of GBP10,000 per year while achieving approximately 10% reductions in farm carbon footprint and has generated GBP52,000 of commercial income to SRUC in 2019/20 \[5.6\]. 

####  Impact on agri\-environmental policies 

 Our GHG mitigation work contributed to the UK and Scottish Governments’ development of new carbon budgets and agri\-environmental policies \[5.7\]. AgRECalc<sup>©</sup> is freely available on the internet and was deployed by SAC Consulting together with the wider farming community, through the Farming For a Better Climate \(FFBC\) policy programme, established by Scottish Government \(2010\). A 2018 evaluation of FFBC by the Scottish Government showed that a mixed farm in Perthshire was able to achieve a financial saving of around GBP11,000 per annum and a 10% decrease in the farm’s carbon footprint by using the footprint calculator \[5.8\]. The programme is running in its third phase \(2010\-2013, 2014\-2017, 2018\-2021\), with a cumulative investment of approximately GBP2,000,000 \[5.3a\]. AgRECalc<sup>©</sup> has also influenced Scottish Government climate change policy by supporting the Beef Efficiency Scheme \(BES, 2018\), which aims to support beef breeders to improve their efficiency, sustainability, and quality of their livestock \[5.6\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Recent events in British\-Irish relations have indicated a lack of sophisticated understanding across Britain and its media about the complexity of Northern Irish identities. Public discussion of identity in Northern Ireland itself often cleaves to sectarian binaries, and Northern Irish culture is often marginalised within the Irish diaspora. Dr Magennis’s research on contemporary Northern Irish literature and culture underpins important counternarratives that address these problems. Through public talks, journalism and sustained social media engagement, Magennis has translated her innovative research into a programme of activity which has increased public awareness in Britain of Northern Irish cultural production and the complex identities this new writing represents. She has brought new voices into mainstream cultural discourse in Britain and Northern Ireland, enhancing understanding of these issues and changing minds about stereotypical representations of ‘post’\-conflict societies. The diverse beneficiaries of her work extend to the publishing world, where her scholarship has bolstered and enriched cultural life and encouraged risk\-taking in reading and writing. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The period following the Good Friday Agreement in 1996 has seen a marked increase in the publication of Northern Irish novels, short stories and non\-fiction prose which Magennis has examined in depth in her academic work. Northern Irish authors are becoming more experimental in both their technique and subject matter **\[3.1\]** and this has led to a wealth of exciting, innovative prose. Magennis primarily works on literature and popular culture from 'post'\-conflict Northern Ireland \(broadly defined as post\-Good Friday Agreement\) with a further focus on issues of class, race, gender and sexuality. Her work seeks to ask precisely what fiction can tell us about the period following the Troubles, when authors directly engaged with this ever\-shifting landscape to produce works that range from science fiction and magical realism through to romance and experimental literary fiction. In 1995, the novelist Glenn Patterson stated that ‘There is more than one way to live in Northern Ireland and more than one story to be told’ **\[3.2\]**. This imperative is vitally important for understanding the complexity of Northern Irish identity behind the headlines about political violence and discovering how different kinds of people write and imagine their experiences. Magennis’s work draws on a variety of theoretical approaches to examine how fiction might offer alternatives to the traditional national narratives of conflict, resolution and uneasy peace. Her two main thematic concerns in this research are: 

1.  The representation and contestation of the past in a ‘post’\-conflict setting 

1.  The depiction of intimacy, sexuality and women’s lives. 

 Within the first theme, Magennis has examined the contestation of memory in a ‘post’\-conflict context **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]** and also uncovered lesser\-known Northern Irish texts **\[3.2, 3.4\]**. Within the second theme, she has examined the discussion of taboo subjects such as sexual assault and non\-political violence **\[3.1, 3.4\]**, the role of women within the conflict **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6\]** and the depiction of sexuality, sexual pleasure and intimacy in ‘post’\-conflict writing **\[3.1, 3.5\]**. This work places well\-established authors in dialogue with emerging voices and also uses developments in critical theory to push these representations beyond more traditional interpretations of Northern Irish culture. 

 Magennis’s work examines fiction from Northern Ireland to draw attention to stories from outside the political mainstream and explore novels that are not often included in accounts of British or Irish fiction. It examines the role of history and truth recovery in this fiction **\[3.6\]**, as well as the representation of the body and sexuality **\[3.5, 3.6\]**. In particular, Magennis is invested in the ways in which our intimate selves and our public roles intersect, and how this is explored in fiction. The theoretical framework for this argument draws on contemporary affect theory, approaches to ‘post’\-conflict culture and literary history to chart how this fiction makes a distinct break from previous ‘Troubles’ novels **\[3.1, 3.5\]**. The hyper\-masculinity of a prolonged civil conflict **\[3.4\]** left little space open in literature to turn towards intimate encounters: Magennis’s work charts the energy and vitality of a range of contemporary texts which look at the intersection of public and private lives.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1. Using social media to raise awareness among a wide range of beneficiaries** 

 This project uses a consistent programme of digital tools and public engagement to promote and track the understanding of the complexities of Northern Irish identity. Social media connects the project immediately and interactively with a broad, diverse readership of the public, writers and publishers and has brought Northern Irish fiction to a wider audience. In January 2019, Magennis began a project recommending a Northern Irish book each day to her over 7,500 followers **\[5.1\]**. The scale of this audience can be measured through the following analytics: 

-  This thread was viewed just under 1,000,000 times \(as of October 2020\), with views growing daily. 

-  Specific engagements with this project were collated and added to Wakelet, a content curation platform for social media. In particular, approximately 300 tweets either said they had picked up books as a result of the thread or indicated a clear intention to read them **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. The Books Editor for *The Irish Times* summarises these contributions: ‘Through her engagement on social media, in particular Twitter \[…\] Caroline has significantly raised awareness and understanding of the richness, complexity and diversity of the distinctive north of Ireland literary tradition’ **\[5.3\]**. A Professor in Germany added texts to their course as a direct result of the thread **\[5.2\]**. One reader in England specifically noted that they had read David Park’s novels due to Magennis’s promotion of his writing and learnt about themes of masculinity and vulnerability **\[5.2\]**. Another reader in England began to read Northern Irish Crime Fiction with her father **\[5.2\]**. The publisher of an emerging press that specialises in Northern Irish writing discovered several novels **\[5.2\]**. A reader in England read 40% of the over 100 novels recommended **\[5.2\]**. An English novelist read ‘LOADS\!’ **\[5.2\]**. An Irish academic said they had a ‘whole new reading list’. And finally, an Irish novelist said they were ‘still finding treasures’ on the blog **\[5.2\]**. 

 Magennis has written about Northern Irish fiction in a variety of online blogs **\[5.4\]**, tweeted these articles and engaged with readers in comments **\[5.4\]** and direct messages. These include the *Four Nations History Network, Writing the Troubles, Alluvium* and *The Conversation* **\[5.5\]**. She has also written on the project topic for mainstream media outlets such as *Prospect* Magazine, *The Independent* and several articles for *The Irish Times* **\[5.5\]** that have led to further direct engagement on social media. The Books Editor for *The Irish Times* states that: ‘I am indebted to Caroline for her regular contributions to our coverage of literature from the North of Ireland’ **\[5.3\]**. Her expertise has led her to host numerous public panels, including events on Northern Irish Comedy \(Nations and Regions Media Festival, Media City UK, streamed on Facebook live\), Repeal the Eighth \(Manchester Literature Festival\), Northern Irish Fiction \(Irish World Heritage Centre\) and a conversation with Maurice Fitzpatrick \(Director, *John Hume in America*\). These events have raised the profile of Northern Irish texts and authors, who often receive a relative lack of engagement than their more straightforwardly ‘Irish’ or ‘British’ peers. Of this engagement, the Head of Literature and Culture for the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, stated that ‘Dr Magennis moves with rare authority, giving to often complex ideas of identity and belonging, dislocation and repair, a wider reach and deeper presence in the lived culture, than would otherwise be expected or encountered’ **\[5.6\]** and that ‘Over the last five years in particular, Dr Magennis has been one of the few intellectuals to accord consistent academic respect to fiction from Northern Ireland beyond the headline works’ **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.2. Engaging audiences with digital tools and public talks** 

 Magennis has also increased awareness through public lectures in Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, London, Newcastle, Huddersfield, York, Ormskirk, Limerick, Galway and Belfast. One attendee noted: ‘The other day I got out my notes from your excellent talk for inspiration of what to read next’ **\[5.2\]**. In particular, she has had a productive working relationship with the John Hewitt Society, which promotes an ethos of ‘utilising literature and the arts as a medium for tackling prejudice, exclusive concepts of identity, and sectarian hostility’ **\[5.7\]**. Following her 2017 keynote address to the Summer School in Armagh, which was uploaded as a YouTube video and posted on the popular political website Slugger O’Toole, she was invited to give the annual public John Hewitt lecture, to an audience of over 250 **\[5.7\]**. One attendee, a writer from Northern Ireland, said that they ‘came away with lots to think about regarding writing about intimacy’ **\[5.2\]**. She presented at a public event on Protestant writing, and live\-streamed the talk to Twitter via Periscope, which has been listened to over 500 times. Following these events, she offered literary and cultural recommendations to the audience in person and on social media which has empowered and energised new audiences for Northern Irish fiction, as measured by the broad range of comments on social media **\[5.2\]**. 

 Magennis co\-organised two public engagement projects with the Manchester Irish community at the Irish World Heritage Centre for the Being Human festival which drew directly on her research interest in the representation of the recent past in Northern Irish literature and culture **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. The first of these, on the 20\-year anniversary of the 1996 Manchester Bomb, co\-organised with George Legg \(Kings’ College London\), had approximately 120 attendees, with public talks and discussion on the legacy of the incident from a historical, literary, political and geographical standpoint. This was called a ‘fascinating’ and ‘enjoyable’ evening by attendees **\[5.2\]**. This was highlighted by the Being Human management team as a particularly successful event and Magennis was invited to write a recap blog for their website for future applicants. The second, held in April 2018, was a large\-scale multi\-media public engagement project on the Good Friday Agreement in the age of Brexit negotiations, which was funded by the Reconciliation Fund of the Government of Ireland \(Magennis was PI\) and attended by a delegation from the Embassy. The event was described as ‘rich’ and ‘rewarding’ **\[5.2\]**. This was co\-organised with Maggie Scull \(Galway\) and George Legg \(King’s College London\). The centrepiece of this project was a two\-day public facing event with significant media interest, and there were a range of other outputs designed to maximise impact. Magennis wrote the introduction for *The Irish Times* *Agreement20* microsite of twelve freely available articles, which she selected. Magennis, Legg and Scull edited ‘\#Agreement20: The Impact and Legacy of the 1998 Agreement’, an open access special issue of the *Open Library of the Humanities*. In addition to this, Magennis organised the Northern Irish news website Slugger O’Toole to host a \#Agreement20 microsite with freely available YouTube broadcasts of the talks. Following the COVID\-19 lockdown in Spring 2020, Magennis immediately pivoted to further online public engagement activity, translating a public event sponsored by the Irish Government on Northern Irish women’s literature **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.6\]** into YouTube talks. In May 2020, as Chair of the British Association for Irish Studies, she organised a month\-long free online festival of research, where she also presented her own work on intimacy based on research in **3.1, 3.4** and **3.6**, in which one listener described the ‘connections’ made to the ‘current pandemic’ as ‘offering much to think about’ **\[5.2\]** and another described as raising their awareness of ‘everyday life’ and ‘everyday speech’ in Northern Ireland **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.3. Beyond public engagement – shaping writing across Northern Ireland** 

 One journalist detailed the homogenizing ways in which Northern Ireland is represented in the media, noting that, ‘in contrast, Dr Magennis amplifies a full, rich range of voices’ with her ‘thoughtful, lively and generous public scholarship’ **\[5.8\]**. A novelist considers Magennis to be at the ‘vanguard’ of critics who are ‘critiquing, celebrating, championing Northern Irish literature, culture and questions of identity in both academic and wider public spheres’ **\[5.9\]**. Another novelist described Magennis’s public engagement activities as providing ‘a vital platform for me to help educate readers and address the complex questions of identity and belonging which are integral to much of my work’ **\[5.10\]**. The Head of Literature and Drama at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland notes that ‘Dr Magennis’s high\-grade work in research and comment, in class nuance, post\-Troubles and the fiction of gender perspective, restores complexity to the fundamental problems of allegiance and identity, and interacts in a most lively and engaged way with the quotidian, to the clear benefit of the wider culture’ **\[5.6\]**. 

 The beneficiaries of this research extend beyond the public to creative practitioners through this engagement activity, with one novelist identifying the impact of Magennis’s work on her own writing practices: ‘Having an academic treat my writing so seriously encouraged me to continue writing and creatively exploring the possibilities in themes pertinent to Northern Ireland’ **\[5.10\]**. The novelist details how Magennis’s programme of public engagement has brought writers together and into productive conversation with each other: ‘Her work has also helped to establish a lively and supportive community of Northern Irish writers who are now collaborating on projects and supporting each other creatively’ **\[5.10\]**. Through work with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, the Head of Literature and Drama has seen first\-hand the impact of Magennis’s work on new and established writers, noting that it ‘encourages writers to reach higher than they may have done by instinct; it sets up a counter narrative to the hand\-me\-downs of “it’ll do rightly” or “that’s pretentious”. It demands daring and risk\-taking and élan. The respect is rarer than one might think; and I can state that it has had a marked impact on the character and ambition of work now being written’ **\[5.6\]**. This demonstrates that Magennis’s research has proven and demonstrable beneficiaries across the creative industries, particularly publishers and writers.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study describes impact across four areas: \(1\) the research has led to a new, evidence\-based lifestyle intervention based on group singing, leading to improved outcomes for women with symptoms of postnatal depression; \(2\) music and health practitioners have used the research findings to inform their practice, methods, and ideas; \(3\) the research has influenced the development of policy with respect to the provision of maternal and creative health services; \(4\) public awareness of the mental health benefits of singing has been raised via dissemination of the research and subsequent media coverage.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The RCM has pioneered research into music, health, and wellbeing for the past decade. From 2015, with funding from Arts Council England, Dr Perkins and her team led the first large\-scale, systematic project to investigate how music can be used to support maternal mental health. With around one in eight women in the UK experiencing postnatal depression \(PND\) and challenges with existing treatment models, the research met an important health need. 

 The cornerstone of the research was a three\-armed Randomized Controlled Trial \(RCT\) run in 2016 to establish whether group singing could support recovery from PND. 134 women with symptoms of PND were randomly allocated to either 10 weeks of group singing with their baby, 10 weeks of creative play with their baby, or 10 weeks of care as normal. Analysis revealed that, among women with moderate to severe symptoms of PND, group singing led to significantly faster reductions in symptoms of PND than either creative play or care as normal.<sup>\[1\]</sup> In\-depth qualitative research showed that group singing provides an authentic, social, and multicultural creative experience, calms babies, provides immersive ‘me time’ for mothers, facilitates a sense of achievement and identity, and can enhance perceived mother\-infant bonding.<sup>\[2\]</sup> Additionally, the singing workshops led to changes in maternal singing behaviours; women who had attended the singing workshops were significantly more likely to sing to their baby on a daily basis, were significantly more confident in singing, and had a significant increase in the number of songs they knew to sing to their babies compared with the control group.<sup>\[3\]</sup> 

 A set of further studies complemented and contextualized the main RCT. The first focused on the music facilitators who were recruited and trained by the RCM to run the singing and creative play groups in the RCT. A qualitative study with these facilitators evidenced the specific practices necessary to run workshops successfully, including a balance of forward\-planning with the need to retain flexibility and to provide women with autonomy and opportunities for bonding with each other and their babies. Key challenges included coping with the emotional nature of the work. A strong sense of team, the progressive rather than one\-off nature of the sessions, and the use of appropriate spaces supported the facilitators in their role.<sup>\[4\]</sup> The second focused on why singing in particular supports maternal mental health. A within\-subjects experiment comparing group singing with group play showed that singing is associated with greater increases in maternal perceptions of emotional closeness than other social interactions. Mother–infant singing is also associated with greater increases in positive affect and greater decreases in negative affect, as well as greater decreases in both psychological and biological markers of anxiety.<sup>\[5\]</sup> The third was an England\-wide survey involving over 2,500 pregnant women and new mothers, in order to understand the wider context of their music use. Findings demonstrated that there are associations between singing to a baby and lower symptoms of postnatal depression, enhanced wellbeing, self\-esteem, and perceived mother\-infant bonding,<sup>\[6\]</sup> suggesting that singing to babies at home, or outside of formal settings, may also be beneficial to maternal mental health.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impacts on the health and wellbeing of people: outcomes for women** 

 As a direct result of the research, a new evidence\-based lifestyle intervention has been established for women with symptoms of postnatal depression. The 10\-week programme that was designed and tested in the original RCM research was implemented in 2017 as an ongoing service – *Melodies for Mums* – by Breathe Arts Health Research, a social enterprise spin\-out of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity. The research led to the formation of this service, as explained by Breathe’s interim director \(2019\): “Our *Melodies for Mums* service came about directly as a result of the Music and Motherhood research; it would not have happened without it. The research study has both informed how we deliver the programme \(in that we closely follow the study’s 10 week course structure, style and screening process\) and been the basis on which we’ve been able to fund the service; individuals, the NHS and a large grant funder have all supported the programme financially because we have evidence from the RCM study that the programme is effective”. To date, £282,309 of funding has been secured for delivery of *Melodies for Mums* on the basis of the research. 300 women have benefitted with a further 620 set to benefit in the next two and a half years \(with the roll\-out delayed in 2020 due to COVID\-19\).<sup>\[1\]</sup>  Women participating in the *Melodies for Mums* programme report that it supports their recovery, for example: ”I remember the first *Melodies for Mums* that I went to and it made me cry because I just felt quite invisible at that point and quite useless, and I think that having something that I could do with her \[my baby\] made a real difference. It was something to look forward to every week, and things started to get better. The feeding got better and she started to put on weight…and I think it was a turning point for me”.<sup>\[2\]</sup> 

 **Impacts on practitioners and the delivery of professional services: music and health practitioners** 

 For music practitioners, the research has provided evidence to underpin and support the development and continuation of singing groups for new mothers. For example, the Bristol\-based Folks & Bairns Choir, London/Sheffield based Pram Chorus, London\-based Big Red Bus Club, and UK\-wide Music Bus all cite the research in their marketing materials, using it to develop and justify programmes, to attract participants, and to publicize the mental health benefits of singing.<sup>\[3\]</sup> The research has also supported continued professional development for both musicians and health professionals. In March 2019, the research formed the basis for a Thinktank hosted by Snape Maltings, where music practitioners worked alongside researchers and health professionals to consider how to develop their own use of music with mothers and families. Outcomes included a residency to develop training for practitioners wanting to deliver this work and a proposal to funders to upscale the *Melodies for Mums* programme \(subsequently granted\).<sup>\[4\]</sup> A music practitioner and one of the thinktank participants, commented \(2019\): “The Music and Motherhood research has contributed significantly to my professional development and direction over the past two years. Whilst I've worked with parents and young children for many years, it helped me to 'connect the dots', and gave greater depth and meaning to what I do. I regularly reference this research when either writing funding applications, or advocating the work I do, as being foundational to the projects that I design and lead”. 

 For healthcare practitioners, the research has been used to raise awareness of the role of music in maternal healthcare. For example, the evidence of music’s effectiveness was featured at the Central and North West London Trust Learning Round in November 2018, as well as at the Psychological Medicine Clinical Network Perinatal Mental Health Stream in September 2020, with participants describing the input as “interesting”, “informative”, and “relevant”. A thinktank participant and perinatal healthcare practitioner from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation commented \(2020\): “Experiencing first\-hand the discussion and practical session offered enabled me to confirm my knowledge around the importance of music and the mental health benefits to women. Music has always been a part of interventions in my work over the years, and having this research and knowledge as a practitioner is empowering to build on the knowledge and confidence as a tool to promote positive wellbeing, throughout some of the most difficult times as a new mum and parent"". 

 **Impacts on public policy** 

 The research has contributed to key policy documents which have established the evidence and need for the role of the arts in healthcare. For example, it was cited in the World Health Organization \(WHO, 2019\) scoping review on the role of the arts in improving health and wellbeing which “in light of the size of the evidence base mapped…raises a number of policy considerations for members of the WHO European Region to support the development of long\-term policies or strategies that will provide more synergized collaboration between health and arts sectors that could realize the potential of the arts for improving global health” \(p.57\). Further, it was listed in the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health, and Wellbeing 2017 Creative Health report as evidence for the recommendation that “local authorities might ensure that health visitors, midwives, GPs and antenatal teachers are informed of the health and wellbeing benefits of arts participation for expectant mothers and those with pre\-school and school\-age children, and that these benefits are communicated to expectant and new mothers. Where there is little or no provision, local authorities might encourage partnership projects with local arts organisations” \(p.86\) and was cited in the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health, and Wellbeing Submission to the Arts Council Strategy Consultation \(2019\) as “just one example of the enormous potential the arts has shown” in supporting maternal health.<sup>\[5\]</sup> Additionally, the research has been cited in public\-facing discussions as evidence for the importance of the rapidly expanding social prescribing movement in the UK.<sup>\[</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>\]</sup> 

 The research was featured in the *Tomorrow’s Child* *Exhibition* at the Houses of Parliament, 26 June–1 July 2016: ""This was a powerful showcase of mixed media art and science that ignited a lively and informed dialogue amongst participants and the 4,000 politicians and staff, generating greater awareness of the importance of the conception to age two period with an overwhelmingly positive response”.<sup>\[</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>\]</sup> The Mayor of London City Hall blog also cites *Melodies for Mums* and the “pioneering research” as “one of the programmes that inspired us as we researched how arts and culture can positively affect mental health and wellbeing”.<sup>\[</sup><sup>8</sup><sup>\]</sup> Finally, the research has underpinned health policy via stakeholders. A consultant perinatal psychiatrist at St Mary’s Hospital, London, commented \(2019\): “The research Music and Motherhood \[MM\] has had a profound impact on the newly established perinatal mental health services \[PMHS\], and as clinical lead of one of the largest services, I will ensure that the outcomes of the research will shape the future development of the PMHS in the context of the 10\-year NHS plan. The current services target specifically women with severe acute or enduring mental illness providing assessment, psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. However, there are limited provisions to promote the recovery after discharge from specialist services and to maintain well the large proportion of women with mild to moderate degree of illness who do not meet criteria to access secondary specialist services. The research of MM indicates that this gap in provisions can be filled by participatory music\-based initiatives”. 

 **Impacts on understanding, learning and participation: Public awareness** 

 Public awareness of the role of singing in maternal mental health has been raised via extensive media coverage of the research. In January 2018 the research was featured in 99 news outlets around the world, including in the UK, Europe, Asia, and North America,<sup>\[</sup><sup>9</sup><sup>\]</sup> resulting in over 14,500 engagements. The research was also featured as a ‘Top 100 breakthrough’ by MadeAtUni, a campaign to bring to life the impact of universities on people, lives, and communities. After its opening at the Houses of Parliament, the *Tomorrow’s Child Exhibition* toured to Oxford, Brighton, and London,<sup>\[</sup><sup>7</sup><sup>\]</sup> with the exhibition Director commenting \(2019\): ""\[We had\] lots of visitors and very good feedback…Pretty much everyone said it made them think differently about the 1001 days period, definitely raised awareness, even prompted changes in behaviour. One lady and her brother came three times from quite a distance to see it over the weekend as it had such an impact on them and said it helped them to understand their childhood\! Everyone said it was inspiring”. Finally, in 2019 the research featured on BBC2 Trust Me I’m a Doctor \(Series 8 Episode 4\) as part of a broadcast to 1.27 million people focusing on the “health evidence you can really trust”: “the study gives new insight into how singing can help you recover from postnatal depression…as the mums in this group have shown, finding the right support or treatment can lead to a full recovery”.<sup>\[</sup><sup>10\]</sup>

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lynch syndrome \(LS\) is characterised by an increased likelihood of early\-life colorectal cancer and other malignancies, with an 80% lifetime likelihood of developing cancer. Reliance upon very frequent colonoscopy and removal of polyps has been shown to be of limited effectiveness in this high risk population. Newcastle investigated the protective effect of 600mg daily aspirin dosing over a two\-year period with a 10\-year follow\-up of 861 patients. This confirmed the protective effect of aspirin with a significantly lower number of colorectal cancers in patients taking aspirin compared with placebo. These findings led to changes in UK, European, Australian and US guidelines for the prevention of colorectal cancers in LS patients and continued patient benefit through additional clinical trials.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Lynch syndrome and colorectal cancer</ins> 

 Lynch syndrome \(LS\) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterised by a high risk of colon and other cancers including endometrial, ovarian, urothelial and gastric cancers. Cancers begin to appear in LS patients from the age of 25, a median age approximately 20 years earlier than the general population. 

 There are an estimated 175,000 people with LS in the UK, and of these 1,100 develop colorectal cancer \(CRC\) annually**Footnote:**

Carriers are offered 2\-yearly colonoscopies with removal of all polyps, though this is an invasive procedure associated with decreased quality of life. Indeed, a large scale prospective international study, co\-led from Newcastle, has shown that the lifetime risk of CRC in LS patients is 50% even after colonoscopy and polyp removal**Footnote:**

 <ins>Aspirin as a preventative for colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome patients</ins><ins>: the</ins> <ins>C</ins><ins>A</ins><ins>PP2</ins> <ins>trial</ins> 

 Newcastle research tested the hypothesis that aspirin could prevent CRC. From 1996, Newcastle collaborated with The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Leeds, to initiate and lead the Colorectal Adenoma/Carcinoma Prevention Programme \(CAPP2\). This trial was one of only two randomised trials of aspirin with cancer as an endpoint. The Newcastle trial was unique in focusing on those with hereditary CRC resulting from LS, offering greater statistical power. CAPP2, investigating the use of aspirin as a preventative for LS \(R1\), was the first large\-scale, genetically\-targeted chemoprevention trial. CAPP2 was based on the smaller CAPP1 trial looking at polyp formation in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis patients begun in 1993, also led by Newcastle. 

 Between 1999 and 2006, 937 patients were recruited to CAPP2 from 43 centres in the UK, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the Americas. This randomised, placebo\-controlled trial recruited patients with proven pathologic mismatch\-repair DNA mutations or who were affected members of a diagnosed family. Patients were randomly assigned to aspirin \(600mg daily doses\) or placebo groups and followed up for signs of adenoma or carcinoma formation \(R1, R2\). 

 <ins>Long term aspirin dosing protects Lynch syndrome patients against colorectal cancer</ins> 

 As the protective effects of daily aspirin were anticipated to take several years to become apparent, a 10\-year follow up of patients was built into the study design. This was later complemented by analysis of up to 20 years of national registry data. Analysis halfway through the follow up showed that nearly twice the number of placebo group patients developed CRC \(6.9%\) than the aspirin group \(4.2%, R2\). The full follow\-up dataset, completed in 2017, confirmed this persistent protective effect with a significantly reduced HR \( *intention to treat*\) of 0.65 \(0.43\-0.97; p = 0.04\) in patients prescribed aspirin for 2 years compared with placebo. The incident rate ratio *per protocol* taking account of all cancers in those who took the aspirin for the full 2 years was 0.50 p=0.005 \(R3\). These results indicated that 2 years of daily aspirin halved the incidence of CRC, an effect which persisted for up to 20 years \(R3\) The protective effect of aspirin also appeared to mitigate the excess risk in obese recruits \(R4\). 

 Research to identify the optimal aspirin dose is currently underway in the ongoing CaPP3 \(Cancer Prevention Project 2014\-2024\) randomised trial.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impacts on national guidelines</ins> 

 CAPP2 results, specifically R1 and R2, informed the 2019 guidance from the British Society of Gastroenterology and other groups, stating: “… *individuals with LS should be advised that regular use of daily aspirin reduces CRC risk. … Long\-term data from the CAPP2 RCT suggests that aspirin reduces this risk by approximately half as compared with placebo \(R2\)*” \(EV1\). R1 and R2 also informed the 2020 NICE guidance \(NG 151\) which recommended daily aspirin as a preventative for CRC, stating: “ *Consider daily aspirin, to be taken for more than 2 years, to prevent colorectal cancer in people with Lynch syndrome*” \(EV2\). CAPP2 is one of only two studies informing this recommendation and the only clinical trial \(the other source is a retrospective cohort study\). Although aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding, NICE concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks, noting that the “ *CAPP2 trial found no difference in the occurrence of adverse events between aspirin and placebo groups.*” NICE also noted that this intervention is likely to be cost\-effective as aspirin is inexpensive and is already used widely in practice for other health conditions. 

 Even before publication of the NICE guidance, results were robust enough to encourage uptake in practice. A 2017 national survey of 1,007 UK GPs who were shown the CAPP2 study results reported that 62.3% would prescribe 600 mg of aspirin to LS patients to prevent CRC \(EV3\). 

 <ins>Impacts on international guidelines</ins> 

 CAPP2 has also informed American, Australian and European guidance for treating LS. The 2015 American Gastroenterological Association recommend that *“aspirin be offered for cancer prevention in patients with Lynch syndrome.*” \(Page 781, EV3\), citing R2 as the evidence basis for their recommendation. The guidance states “ *One high\-quality randomized controlled trial \(R2\) in adults with Lynch syndrome… showed a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer beyond that with colonoscopy surveillance alone … and a trend toward a decreased incidence of other cancers.*” This is important as data from an international prospective LS database, shows that colonoscopy screening has a limited impact on CRC incidence<sup>4</sup> highlighting the importance of daily aspirin in countries such as the US where colonoscopy is frequent. 

 The 2018 Cancer Council Australia clinical practice guidelines recommend that LS patients begin taking aspirin at the same time as colonoscopy screening \(EV4\), and directly cites the CAPP2 trial: “ *The most convincing benefit was found with per\-protocol analysis, where aspirin reduced colorectal cancer incidence after ≥ 2 years on trial treatment compared with placebo … \(R1, R2\)*.” The Royal Hospital Melbourne confirms that this advice also appears in the Australian eviQ guidelines and the RACGP Redbook, which are widely\-read and accepted sources of advice for Australian oncology and cancer genetics practitioners and GPs, respectively \(EV5\). They also confirm that since the introduction of these guidelines, all hereditary cancer clinics and genetics services across Australia advise LS carriers to take 100\-300 mg aspirin daily. 

 The 2020 European guidance for LS management update, from the European Hereditary Tumour Group and European Society of Coloproctology, recommended that patients “ *be advised that daily acetylsalicylate* \[aspirin\] *intake will reduce CRC risk*” \(EV6\). These recommendations, again directly citing R1 and R2, were reached using rounds of Delphi voting from 18 European healthcare experts. As such, this recommendation indicates pan\-European support for the use of aspirin as a preventative for CRC in LS patients. 

 CAPP2 and specifically R3, were recognised by the American Society of Clinical Oncology \(ASCO\), a network of 45,000 oncology professionals in more than 150 countries**Footnote:**

 [https://www.asco.org/about\-asco/asco\-overview](https://www.asco.org/about-asco/asco-overview) 
. Their report of oncology advances published in 2020 which “ *highlights the most important clinical research advances of the past year*” and selects “ *advances that improve meaningful patient outcomes and have a strong scientific impact*” cited R3 to exemplify the preventative effect of daily aspirin \(EV7\). 

 <ins>Impact on patients</ins> 

 While the protective effect of daily aspirin on cancer incidence will take several years to become apparent, patients in the UK, the US, Australia and Europe stand to benefit the most. These countries have adopted guidelines earlier than other countries but also have the highest global incidences of CRC. 2018 World Health Organization and Global Cancer Observatory data reported that, cumulatively, approximately 610,000 new cases of CRC were reported in these regions**Footnote:**

 USA, UK and Australian data collected from country specific datasheets from  [https://gco.iarc.fr/today/fact\-sheets\-populations](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/fact-sheets-populations), European data calculated from totals from  [https://gco.iarc.fr/today/data/factsheets/cancers/10\_8\_9\-Colorectum\-fact\-sheet.pdf](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/data/factsheets/cancers/10_8_9-Colorectum-fact-sheet.pdf) 
. As LS is estimated to cause around 3% of CRC cases, approximately 20,000 CRC patients and their families across these locations will benefit from the introduced guidelines. 

 More immediately, patient groups and charities have benefitted from the publication of CAPP2 results \(EV9, EV10\). The co\-founders of the US\-based AliveAndKickn LS patient group confirm that the results have informed their patient community, especially about ongoing clinical trials \(EV9a\). Similarly, the clinical team at the Dana\-Farber Cancer Institute in the USA has commented that CAPP2 has impacted patient health and given them a “ *sense of empowerment that comes from “putting prevention in their hands” with aspirin*” \(EV9b\). In Europe, increased confidence, simplicity of treatment and increased cancer prevention options have also been welcomed by Lynch Syndrome UK, a patient group with over 2,000 members. Established in 2015, Newcastle PIs were instrumental in the establishment of Lynch Syndrome UK \(EV10a\). Helsinki University Hospital also confirms that “ *The high grade of evidence has resulted in widespread uptake of aspirin as a chemopreventative agent in clinical practice*” \(EV10b\). 

 Additionally, 1,879 LS patients enrolled from 26 UK centres and 7 parallel centres in 5 countries, are benefitting from daily aspirin as part of the follow\-up CaPP3 trial, a continued collaboration with the University of Leeds aiming to identify the optimal aspirin dose \(EV11\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The aim of the Touch project was to examine, and thereby improve, how youth work can respond to violence both between, and directed at, young people in the EU. As well as a direct and transformative impact on all the project participants and partners, the transnational and innovative nature of the project meant we could create, through an expansive dissemination strategy, profound impact on the social ‘problem’ of youth violence beyond national boundaries, and raise public awareness of how youth workers might meaningfully respond to it. Learning from the project has been directly incorporated into the educational and training regimes of youth workers and other professional communities. Findings reached policy\-makers, academic institutions, NGO’s, youth workers and young people across Europe, through a research monograph, guidelines for youth work practice, international academic and practitioner conferences, a round table discussion with European policy makers in Brussels, and a documentary film. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Led by Mike Seal and Pete Harris, and overseen by a steering management group made up of government policy advisors and academics, the Touch project was funded \(£442,000\) via the EU Daphne III program. It involved building partnerships with Islington Borough Council, London; West Bowling Youth Initiative, Bradford; Jugendstreetwork, Caritas Der Graz\-Seckau, Austria; Rheinflanke gGmbh, Cologne, Germany; The Federation For Detached Youth Work, UK and Dynamo International, Belgium. Two British young people, both of whom had direct experience of violence, were recruited as peer researchers. The research team made a series of visits to the 4 locations. 50 youth workers and 170 young people from a range of ethnic backgrounds participated, all of whom had some experience or involvement in violence either as perpetrators, witnesses, or victims. 

 Research activity incorporated workshops based on community philosophy, focus groups, case studies, semi\-structured interviews, seminars and conferences, and a range of audio\-visual techniques including music composition and recording, photography, visualisation, diagramming and role play. Much of this robust research activity was incorporated into youth work activities including group work, sports\-based work, and residential experiences in youth hostels. As part of our commitment to participatory methods, a film company not only documented the research process and produced an hour\-long documentary, but also supported young people in creating films of their own. These centred on *their* perceptions of the area where they lived and what part violence played in their lives. The whole project design meant therefore that all empirical data was co\-produced and disseminated with youth workers and young people as full partners.

 The project research monograph “Responding to Youth Violence Through Youth Work” \(published 2016\) is now regularly used as a teaching resource \(on module reading lists\) for Youth and Community Work training courses in the UK and Europe. It will form part of new plans to introduce youth violence training for youth workers currently being considered by the National Youth Agency in the UK \(See ref. Workforce Development Officer National Youth Agency below\).  Over 2000 copies of the “Guidelines For Youth Workers” publication were distributed at European conferences and these have been formally adopted by the leading practitioner network in the UK \(The Federation for Detached Youth Work, see Sources to corroborate the Impact below\) and Europe \(Dynamo international\).  The documentary film has also been incorporated into youth work educational and training programmes and courses for workers in related fields. For example, the sport education provider Street Games were commissioned to engage their national network of sports providers as part of the Home Office ‘Building Stronger Britain Together’ \(BSBT\) programme. A Touch partner and facilitator \(from The Federation for Detached Youth Work, see Sources to corroborate the Impact below\) was able to use the film as an evidence base and stimulus for philosophical enquiry, particularly about questions of professional identity. 

 Following our presentation of the findings to the European Parliament \(11/12/12\) the Styrian Regional Government in Austria passed a motion in their parliament about the right of young people to be in public space, citing the research as an influence. The Public Health Intelligence Team \(PHIT\) at Birmingham City Council also cited the Touch Research in a report which led to the development of violence related services for young people. We also provided evidence to the ‘call for evidence’ for the ‘Youth Violence: Community and Youth Services Parliamentary Commission’. We have testimonials about the impact of the Touch project and research on individual young people, from the young people themselves and the youth workers. Both peer researchers went on to full time employment and further study; one has set up a community organisation, completed a Masters degree and contributed a book chapter. Pete Harris has given key note talks conferences based on the Touch research in the UK, Denmark and Malta; the latter was attended by the Minister for Youth on the island. The team continues to be asked to comment on media stories relating to youth violence. For example, the editor of *Children and Young People Now* interviewed Pete Harris following a recent spate of knife attacks in London and commissioned an opinion piece on the relationship between social media and youth violence. \(see Project Partners in Sources to corroborate the Impact below\) 

 The original, service\-user informed insights generated via the Project have led to the setting of new agendas within youth workforce development and contributed to debates around intervention methodologies, professional identities of youth workers, managerial and evaluation regimes and the ‘problem’ of youth violence, an area that presents considerable conceptual and logistical challenges, especially in terms of user engagement and inter\-agency collaboration.  Project findings were disseminated in 2 broad categories: practice and policy. Practice recommendations included calls for a re\-framing of youth work within this practice context and a re\-examination of youth worker\-young people relationships. We made specific suggestions designed to maximise the desistance promoting potential of youth work, including detailed guidance on how to build trust within relationships and how to engage with young men and women who are not accessing existing services. We also called for, and provided illustrative case studies of, a number of themed practical initiatives in music, drama and sport and made specific recommendations for improving the training and CPD regimes of youth workers, especially in relation to building the skills of ‘home\-grown’ workers from within communities affected by violence. Our report also gave practical advice to managers on how to reduce bureaucracy, allow workers to opt out from corporate identification, conduct meaningful risk assessments and make changes to worker job descriptions. \(See Sources to corroborate the Impact below\) 

 Policy recommendations included calling for regular policy round\-tables, reducing emphasis on ‘disabling’ policies such as targeted approaches in favour of ‘targeting through universalism’, ensuring adequate space for worker reflection, a call for long term funding and a reduction in commissioning and contracting regimes. These recommendations have catalysed calls for an end to moves towards de\-professionalisation within youth work, and provided impetus for a number of new initiatives including the development of a Masters degree in street\-based youth work. We also called for an end to social policy narratives that demonise young people who gather in public space by simplistically identifying them as a threat to others and for formal recognition of the positive value of young people’s social mixing in public space. We were able to make significant contributions to theory building in a number of related areas, introducing new theoretical concepts such as the value of ‘proxy trust’ and ‘near\-peer’ experiences, and the shortcomings of ‘chasing violence’. The project was externally evaluated and the evaluation concluded that our findings will remain an important point of reference for the field, continuing to influence practice and policy in youth work and criminal justice. \(see Sources to corroborate the Impact below\)

 *“As part of the Home Office ‘Building Stronger Britain Together’ \(BSBT\) programme Street Games I was commissioned to engage their national network of sports providers in BSBT. There was an emphasis on supporting their practitioners \(mostly sports coaches\) to develop critical thinking skills. I put together a programme based on Community Philosophy methodology, using the Touch project as an evidence\-base. In this, I used video clips from the Touch documentary as a stimulus for thinking about youth work identities, and how they can be promoted to wider, diverse, audiences and stakeholders. Practitioners have confirmed that when they are in a multi\-agency partnership, where, as a youth worker, they are getting bullied into some corrupted version of ‘youth work’, they have been able to push the book forward, and say: “see this, this says …”. I envisage Touch being really useful as the state tries to incorporate youth workers in to the Serious Youth Violence agenda”.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 From 2004 to 2017, University of Kent researchers developed novel federated identity management \(FIM\) and privilege access management \(PAM\) technologies, which have been integrated in OpenStack since November 2013. OpenStack is a community cloud project involving 135\+ international leading vendors, including Lenovo, Oracle, RedHat, IBM, Rackspace, and Cisco. FIM allows OpenStack users to use their existing usernames and passwords, instead of having to create a new pair whenever they want to access a new cloud service. Introducing FIM has been recognised by OpenStack for accelerating and shaping the project’s federated identity system’s performance and by OpenStack users for advancing their organisational security and efficiency whilst also saving significant costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Background** 

 Since **2004**, Professor Chadwick and his team in the School of Computing at Kent have undertaken extensive research in the field of Information Systems security. The work began with the development of PERMIS – a suite of open\-source privilege and access management \(PAM\) software that provides novel authorisation technologies to developers’ software systems. This was the subject of an impact case study in REF2014. Since **2009**, the research has progressed into the novel application area of federated identity management \(FIM\). 

 The underlying problem addressed by the research was the hundreds of usernames and passwords that users are forced to remember, which leads to significant vulnerabilities. FIM greatly reduces this number by allowing a single identity provider \(using one username/password\) to log a user into dozens of federated systems. The FIM research has been of practical benefit to OpenStack – the most popular open source cloud software in the world that has a membership of 135\+ international organisations, including global vendors such as Lenovo, Oracle, RedHat, IBM, Rackspace, Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu and Huawei. Prior to November 2013, OpenStack only supported traditional access control methods by individually allocating new usernames and passwords to users – a process that reduced security, impeded business proficiency, and wasted time for both users and service providers. The work on FIM changed that by allowing users to authenticate to an OpenStack cloud using their existing credentials through an external Identity Provider, rather than creating another username and password pair for a particular OpenStack cloud. 

 **The research** 

 Chadwick’s reputation and expertise in the field of system security led to him being invited to present the concept of FIM at FOSAD **2008**. The International School on Foundations of Security Analysis and Design \(FOSAD\) is one of the foremost events for disseminating knowledge in the area of computer systems and networks security. In **2009**, the presentation evolved into a seminal and highly\-cited paper that provides an introduction to digital identity, identity management, and FIM, and the key issues faced, as well as ideas on how to address them **\[R1\]**. 

 In **2011**, following the work on PERMIS **\[G1\]** and the FOSAD talk, Chadwick responded to an ESPRC call for cloud computing with an argument for the integration of FIM. The resulting funded project **\[G4\]** led to the publication of an introductory paper **\[R2\]**, which describes a policy\-based authorisation infrastructure that can be used by cloud providers to ensure that the usersʼ privacy policies are stuck to their data. This was followed by a paper demonstrating the feasibility of a policy\-based authorisation infrastructure in cloud infrastructure **\[R3\]**, and a final results paper that describes open source software to support a trust, privacy and security infrastructure for the cloud **\[R4\]**. 

 This research initiated Chadwick’s collaboration with OpenStack. He presented the approach at several OpenStack meetings between **2011** and **2013**. Since there were many different FIM protocols in use and still in development, one of the key challenges was how to support *interoperability*. The concept, *protocol independent FIM*, was adopted by the OpenStack developers and now all OpenStack releases support FIM with several protocols supported as standard. 

 Furthermore, new FIM protocols can easily be added, as and when they are developed. The incorporation of FIM into OpenStack was demonstrated in **2014** in **\[R5\]**, which presents a detailed federated identity protocol sequence. The paper also describes the implementation of the protocol independent system components, along with the incorporation of two different FIM protocols, namely SAML and Keystone. The FIM protocols were further validated through GÉANT's CLASSe project \( **2013\-2015**\) **\[G6\]**, which showed how cloud services such as OpenStack can be smoothly integrated in a federation built with an AAA \(Authentication, Authorisation, and Accounting\) infrastructure, by using Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web \(ABFAB\) technologies **\[R6\]**.

 Chadwick was invited to the OpenStack summits in the USA in 2012 and 2013 to discuss the Kent research on FIM, educating and informing OpenStack stakeholders on its processes through the discussion of key blueprints **\[a\]**. As a result, in **November 2013** Chadwick’s novel FIM design was implemented in the ‘H’ phase of OpenStack, adding federated access to Keystone \(OpenStack’s identity manager\) **\[a\]\[b\]**. The Kent FIM protocol was the first \(and remains the only\) system to have introduced federated identity to OpenStack, and since its implementation in **November 2013** Chadwick has continued to support OpenStack and its developers and users via his advisory role in the Keystone working group \( **2011\-2017**\). 

 In response to Chadwick’s continued contribution and support of the Kent FIM, OpenStack’s Keystone Project Lead, Steve Martinelli, stated: ‘David \[Chadwick\] and his team\[‘s …\] expertise and guidance in the area of Federated Identity has been priceless. I can confidently say that their collaboration and background on the subject has helped accelerate and shape Keystone's support of Federated identity \[…\] David's opinion is sought out when discussing Keystone issues on OpenStack's mailing list, where his deep understanding of security, and identity management is made evident. The same can be said about David's involvement at OpenStack summits \(our bi\-annual design conferences\), where he is involved in the architectural design of new Keystone features’ **\[c\]**. 

 Jisc – a company supporting institutions of higher education and research in the UK – also benefits, as stated by Stefan Paetow, Jisc’s Research Liaison Coordinator: ‘University of Kent readied the Openstack software stack for use with federated identity technologies, including Moonshot, by piloting Openstack with the pre\-Assent Moonshot pilot infrastructure and the UK Access Management Federation, submitting fixes to Openstack and Jisc where required, and driving the web\-based use case for Moonshot forward’ **\[d\]**. 

 **Improving OpenStack developer proficiency** 

 Many developers are interacting with OpenStack in order to use its interface. Of these developers, Chadwick has advised and educated many as a result of his consultancy via the OpenStack summits and working group mailing list. His Kent team has also generated many new lines of code or patches, for instance, to enhance the usability and proficiency of the software. A senior manager at RackSpace identified that between **2011** and **2014**: ‘University of Kent has contributed 1400 lines of code, 102 reviews, 71 patches, 14 blueprints \[and…\] have been approachable subject matter experts, whose knowledge was widely adopted by the Keystone community’ **\[e\]**. Similarly, an engineer from RedHat in **2017** stated that: ‘Professor Chadwick was essential in enabling the project to properly implement Identity Federation, a set of features without which OpenStack would be unusable by a great many organizations \[…\]. As a software engineer at Red Hat, I have seen a direct correlation between the success of our implementation and the work that Professor Chadwick and his team contributed to the project’ **\[f\]**. 

 **Enhancing OpenStack users’ security and cost\-effectiveness while reducing administrative burden** 

 Users save time and effort while increasing security, because with FIM, users do not have to create and remember a large number of different passwords. Having to create and memorise numerous passwords leads users to choose weak and easily crackable passwords. With FIM, they need to create and maintain only one strong password. 

 Over 135 international organisations are currently utilising OpenStack, and running their jobs and applications off it. We carried out a survey of OpenStack users to assess the impact of having FIM integrated into Open Stack **\[g\]**. Sixty per cent of the respondents \(n=14\) stated that adopting FIM makes the system more \(or much more\) secure. A Cloud Manager from a national computer network for universities and research noted: ‘\[we\] don’t have to manage safety of credentials, since we store none. We are not subject to brute\-force, since services are accessed via identity tokens only’ **\[g\]**. The Head of Identity Management of the same institution noted further: ‘No passwords inserted in web forms, no passwords kept in the keystone, no recovery/force\-passwords\-on\-the\-phone, etc.’ **\[g\]**. 

 Traceability is important as part of implementing security, and this is facilitated by FIM. A System Administrator at a small company highlights the benefit of FIM: ‘We will get to know who accesses what and when’, while a researcher pointed out: ‘R&S and Sirtfi \[Security Incident Response Trust Framework for Federated Identity\] helps. Also using the institutional accounts helps with traceability’ **\[g\]**. Similarly, an organisation’s security relies on a proper audit of their users. For example, it is imperative to revoke access from former employees who had left the organisation. Evidently, the advantage of FIM is clear, as further established by one Network Engineer: ‘We can audit access controls from a central system and we can easily require MFA \(Multi Factor Authentication\) for user logins’ **\[g\]**. This is echoed by an Administrator/Architect from an American telecommunications company dealing with several thousand users: ‘Old account remove quicker’; this echoes the view of a Technical Architect at another organisation, who states: ‘revocation is central. Centralized group management assignment are key as well’ **\[g\]**. 

 In addition, FIM offers a potential for saving time and money. The time\-saving benefit of having FIM is highlighted by a Cloud Manager from a European institution: ‘Registration time is just few clicks wrt \[with respect to\] alternative procedure for identity verification’ **\[g\]**. An Administrator at a large American telecommunications company elaborated further: ‘Multiple Operation people were spending >30% of their time just managing accounts before we implemented hooking into corporate Active Directory System’ \[g\]. Meanwhile, a Cloud Architect at a UK Government agency believed that FIM reduces operational costs, affording a saving of ‘0.5 of a person to maintain the identity proxy’ **\[g\]**. Similarly, a System Administrator at a small company noted a saving of ‘roughly $5000’, while the Head of Identity Management at a European institution reported a saving of ‘0.2 FTE’ **\[g\]**. 

 Administrative burden can also be reduced by using FIM, with 47% \(n=11\) of the respondents suggesting that there is less or much less administrative burden in running their system. A Senior Software Engineer at a public open cloud exchange project commented: ‘A unified authentication management has allowed us to let users use the same accounts for OpenStack and OpenShift, which we are operating. So we and users don't have to deal with multiple accounts or systems of access management \[…\] Also we can offload verifying a user to the identity providers they are coming from’ **\[g\]**. A Technical Specialist at a European organisation pointed out: ‘when a user leaves the home organisation, and his account is deactivated, this user cannot log in anymore in the open stack environment. Effectively, his permissions are revoked while openstack maintainers don't know \(and now don't care\) that he is gone’ **\[g\]**. A Cloud Platform Architect at a multinational telecommunications company summarised the impact in reference to his 3,600 users: ‘No more account management, users shall do it for us’ **\[g\]**. 

 Based on his FIM research and as a result of the growing recognition of his expertise in this field, Chadwick was an invited expert to the nascent W3C Verifiable Credentials working group in **2017**. His contribution led to his co\-authorship of the Recommendation and its associated Implementation Guidelines **\[h\]** and Data Model **\[i\]**. In **2019**, the University created a spin\-out company, Verifiable Credentials Ltd, to capitalise on the implemented Proof of Concept.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Although microfinance is recognised as a tool to promote self\-employment and inclusion among disadvantaged groups in Europe, its impact is limited by a lack of scale and low financial self\-sufficiency for microfinance institutions \(MFIs\). To address this, the European Commission contracted Dayson and Vik to develop a microfinance code of conduct based on their research into appropriate standards and self\-regulatory frameworks for microfinance in the developed world. The Code has been adopted by 53 MFIs across 19 countries, and the European Union now requires compliance with it in order for non\-bank MFIs to access microfinance funding. In addition to influencing national legislation and trade body recommendations, adoption of the Code has resulted in larger and better funded MFIs with stronger reputations, greater accountability and improved oversight. Services are now provided in a more consistent and transparent manner to customers whose rights are unevenly covered by existing regulation within different European countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2004, Dayson and Vik have, at the research centre Community Finance Solutions \(CFS\), conducted research into viable and effective models for microfinance institutions \(MFIs\) in Europe. Dayson compared the financial performance and staff time use \(from timesheets\) for four UK MFIs \(2004\) **\[3.1\]** and Dayson, Vik and colleagues conducted a comparative analysis of the efficiency and sustainability of five UK MFIs \(2007 – 2008\) **\[3.2\]**. Among the first and most detailed studies of the business and operating models of MFIs in Europe, these studies provided key insights into the nature and determinants of financial sustainability of microfinance in developed economies: 

-  The operating environment for MFIs in European nations differs from those in the developing world. In Europe, the potential market is smaller, due to lower self\-employment rates and highly developed financial sectors. Income generation is restricted because consumers are more price\-sensitive and interest rates are often subject to caps **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. 

-  There is significant variation in the financial performance across MFIs in the same context due to differences in pricing, scale, efficiency and productivity **\[3.2, 3.4\]**. Hence standardisation and sharing good practice can improve performance **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. 

 As further evidence of their contribution to the field, Dayson coedited the first research handbook on European microfinance \(2010\) and was among the founding members of the European microfinance research network \(2005\). Together with Vik, he was awarded the 2008 European microcredit research award for their benchmarking study **\[3.2\]**. 

 Following this work, the European Commission awarded Dayson and Vik a contract in 2010 to draft the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision. As a result, Dayson and Vik started conducting research into self\-regulatory frameworks focusing on two areas: 

-  **Operating standards for European MFIs:** The first part focused on developing standards appropriate for the European context. The overwhelming majority of existing standards have been intended and designed for the developing world. Dayson and Vik conducted an extensive review of more than 70 existing standards on governance, customer protection, management information systems, risk management and reporting standards. They then tested the applicability of these international standards through a series of stakeholder workshops that discussed the standards in terms of fit with existing legal frameworks, cost and resource implications, and effectiveness. The authors subsequently piloted the proposed standards with 12 European MFIs \(2011 – 2012\). More recently, Dayson and Vik led the drafting of social performance standards \(2016 – 2017\), which were incorporated into the Code in 2020 as part of a consultation. This project involved adopting and adapting relevant practices from international social performance frameworks through a series of practitioner roundtables. This was the first ever systematic analysis of the appropriateness of international microfinance standards in the developed world. Once combined, this work revealed that international standards are often ill\-suited to the European sector because MFIs in this market focus on riskier, smaller and more marginal client groups, and are also smaller and less mature compared with their developing country counterparts **\[3.5, 3.6\]**. 

-  **Role and effectiveness of self\-regulation:** More broadly the research focused on how the Commission could develop an effective self\-regulatory framework for the Code. Dayson and Vik analysed the existing international frameworks in terms of validation of compliance, allowance for differentiation by type of institution, mechanisms for dealing with non\-compliance and whether they generated a quantifiable rating for MFIs. Hitherto, this was the most extensive review of international standards in microfinance. The research concluded that the effectiveness of self\-regulation is hampered by the lack of consequences for and enforcement of non\-compliance, by an inclination to promote minimum rather than aspirational standards, and a lack of transparency to encourage peer learning and improvements through market discipline **\[3.5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Microfinance is a growing policy area in Europe due to its ability to promote social inclusion and employment among disadvantaged groups denied access to mainstream finance or employment, such as women, migrants and low\-income individuals. Microcredit refers to loans of up to EUR25,000 available to new or existing microenterprises. By 2017, the European microfinance sector had disbursed  [635,000 microcredits with a value of EUR2.1 billion](https://www.european-microfinance.org/publication/microfinance-europe-survey-report-2016-2017) per annum. Yet, for the most part, MFIs are still small, dependent on subsidies and lack capacity to grow and become sustainable. To address this, the European Commission identified the need for a code of practice in 2007 to disseminate and promote good practice in the sector. Given the regulatory and institutional diversity in the European microfinance sector, the Commission identified a voluntary code as the best way to set pan\-European practices and rights for the benefit of all customers and stakeholders. 

 **4.1. Establishment of a European framework for good practice** 

 Dayson and Vik drafted the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision in 2010 –2011 through a contract with the European Commission. They were invited to tender for the drafting of the Code based on their experience and expertise in microfinance in developed countries and were subsequently awarded a second contract to develop the methodology to assess compliance with the Code \(2012 – 2013\) **\[see 5.1\]**. The Code now contains over 150 clauses detailing recommended practices in customer relations, governance, risk management, management information systems \(MIS\) and reporting. The MFIs signing up to the Code are subject to an external evaluation by the microfinance rating agency MF Rating. In 2014, the EU made compliance with the Code a precondition for accessing European microfinance funding for nonbank MFIs **\[5.1\]**. Banks were not included, already being subject to significant regulation. 

 The European Commission summarised Dayson and Vik’s extensive contributions as follows: 

 *‘The research conducted by Dayson and Vik as part of these contracts significantly influenced the content and process of the Code. Firstly, based on a review of best practices, they developed detailed standards in the themes identified by the European Commission in the terms of reference. Secondly, two chapters were added on the topics of customer and investor relations, and reporting standards and public disclosure on the recommendation of researchers. Thirdly, they influenced the evaluation and award process for the Code, especially the creation, role and membership of the steering group, the evaluation methodology and process, and the importance of external validation and having mechanisms dealing with noncompliance’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2. Uptake of the Code and impact on microfinance sector regulation** 

 To date, the Code has led to widespread changes and improvements in the microfinance sector. Out of  [138 nonbank MFIs](https://www.european-microfinance.org/publication/microfinance-europe-survey-report-2016-2017), 53 MFIs \(38%\) from 19 European countries, including France, the UK, the Netherlands, Romania and Poland, were awarded the Code between 2016 and 2020. This included all the MFI board members of the EU microfinance trade body, the European Microfinance Network **\[5.2\]**. MFIs, bank partners, regulators and governments see the Code as a best practice framework against which to benchmark MFI performance and practices. There are examples of newly established European MFIs using the Code *‘as a blueprint for developing systems and processes to a high standard’* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In Greece and Romania, the Code has been used as a template to inform national regulation and practice **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. On 24 June 2020, the Greek Parliament adopted a new law on microfinance that requires MFIs to be compliant with the Code to be funded under national investment programmes. Organisations that are awarded the Code are allowed to provide microcredit under this law **\[5.5\]**. In the Romanian microfinance sector, the Code has significantly improved practice and performance through adoption by a leading MFI trade body **\[5.4\]**. Romania is among the largest microfinance markets in Europe and has the largest concentration of Code awardees **\[5.2\]**. According to the Romanian trade body representing 15 MFIs awarded or in the pipeline for the Code, *‘there have been many concrete changes resulting from implementing the Code’* **\[5.4\]**, including greater consistency and transparency in the information provided to customers as well as greater use of customer satisfaction surveys. The positive effects of these changes are *‘evidenced by increased customer satisfaction levels and increased membership numbers’* **\[5.4\]**. The MFIs have put in place more robust processes for dealing with conflicts of interest, management succession planning and board induction and training. *‘Taken together these changes have strengthened governance arrangements across the sector’* **\[5.4\]**. The changes in practice resulting from the Code *‘have led to higher performing organisations, better served customers and stronger governance. Overall the Code has led to greater impact through the increase in the number of customers supported’* **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.3. Improvements to business practices benefitting MFIs and their customers** 

 Across Europe, ‘ *the Code has motivated the MFIs to revise their practices as a whole, through the lens of the customer, and implement processes that increase their level of accountability’* **\[5.6\]**. A survey of 42 MFIs from 19 countries shows that 40%\-70% have made changes in practice in customer treatment, governance, risk management, reporting standards and MIS to comply with the Code. According to one respondent: *‘The Code forced us to have a 360 degree review of our practices \(clients protection/communication, governance, risk monitoring.’* Another *‘used it as guidelines for development of our institution’* **\[5.7\]**. MF Rating identified 14 MFIs that have made 28 changes in practice explicitly to comply with the Code, including pricing transparency, customer rights, business planning, risk management and customer complaint procedures **\[5.6\]**. 13 of the 14 MFIs taking part in an external evaluation of the impact of the Code reported improving their practice as a result of the Code **\[5.3\]**. MFIs made changes in the following areas: 

-  **Customer experience:** The Code has brought greater consistency and impacted *‘positively in terms of transparency’* **\[5.7\]** regarding the information provided to customers, even within the same countries **\[5.3, 5.5\].** Nearly 70% of MFIs surveyed had made changes to customer rights and complaints and information provided to customers, whilst 60% had altered customer complaints procedures **\[5.7\]**. Four MFIs, interviewed as part of the external evaluation, reported improving their communication with customers through the information provided to customers when applying for loans as well as introducing customer satisfaction surveys. Five organisations changed their complaint procedures to make it clearer and more accessible by putting it on their website and two improved the customer journey **\[5.3\]**. MFIs also started disclosing effective interest rates and allowing customers to withdraw within 14 days of the granting of the microcredit, thereby placing customers in a better position to make informed decisions **\[5.6\]**. 

-  **Business planning:** Nearly 60% of MFIs made changes to their approach to business planning and over 40% altered personnel and management policies **\[5.7\]**. Three MFIs moved to a 3\-year planning cycle as stipulated in the Code forcing them to take a more strategic approach to business planning **\[5.3\]**. MFIs also started including detailed budgeting and forecasting and incorporated risk assessment in their business plan **\[5.6\]**. 

-  **Improved governance:** According to an external evaluation, MFIs enhanced their governance, board performance, oversight and accountability by adding more formal board induction \(3 MFIs\), recruiting additional board members \(3\), removing board members \(2\) and providing more Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) for board members \(4\) **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **Risk management:** Several MFIs improved their risk management, including improving or adding internal audit mechanisms **\[5.3\]**. Organisations implemented internal audit functions, appointed senior managers to be accountable for risk management and put in place mechanisms to identify, assess and prioritise risks. MFIs started using PAR30, the internationally accepted portfolio quality measure in microfinance, to measure loan delinquency **\[5.6\]**. Around half of MFIs surveyed changed loan portfolio monitoring and processes for identifying risk, whilst 40% altered/introduced internal audit function. 

 **4.4. Reputational and financial benefits for MFIs** 

 MFIs experienced clear reputational benefits through adoption of the framework due to its requirement for improved governance and accountability. This resulted in increased levels of funding, a larger customer base and strengthened their stakeholder relationships. 

-  **Enhanced reputation:** Eight out of ten MFIs surveyed reported that the Code had greatly improved or improved the reputation and credibility of their organisations, whilst nearly 70% reported greatly improved or improved visibility of their organisations. For half, the Code had greatly improved or improved their ability to attract new partners. For one respondent *‘it offered recognition and appreciation from peer institutions’* **\[5.7\]**. An external evaluation found that the Code enhanced the reputation of 12 MFIs vis\-à\-vis external stakeholders. It facilitated establishing and operating partnerships with banks and strengthened the negotiating position by demonstrating the importance of microcredit provision **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **Ability to raise funding:** Out of the MFIs surveyed, 32% or 14 providers reported that the Code had improved their ability to access funding. Estimates of impact on funding ranged from EUR250,000 to EUR35,000,000, with one respondent estimating *‘an impact of 20\-30% of total funding’* **\[5.7\]**. According to an external evaluation, nine MFIs reported improved access to funding, nine were able to access European funding and three were able to access wider funding as implementing the Code helped with due diligence with other investors. Specifically, the Code requirements meant that MFIs were in a better position to provide more complete information. According to three MFIs, the Code award enhanced their standing and ability to get increased funding from existing investors **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **Increased customer numbers and satisfaction:** MFIs reported that improved consistency, transparency and use of customer satisfaction surveys led to greater customer satisfaction and increased customer numbers **\[5.3\]**. It set apart four MFIs from their competitors by highlighting to their customers that they are responsible lenders **\[5.3\]**. Out of the MFIs surveyed, 60% found that the Code had enabled them to differentiate themselves in the market **\[5.7\]**. 

 Adoption of the Code has resulted in numerous positive impacts on MFI organisational culture, which will also be transmitted to their customers and stakeholders. According to an external evaluation of the Code: *‘It is notable that fourteen of the fifteen people interviewed felt that the code had had a positive impact on their organisation or the organisation\(s\) that they supported. This came across clearly and comprehensively during the interviews’* **\[5.3\]**. According to MFI survey respondents, the Code had *‘improved internal ethical culture’*, *‘increased transparency’,* had a *‘positive impact on staff alignment with the values of the company’* and led to ‘ *better trained employees.’* According to a third of MFIs surveyed, the Code had also strengthened their ability to cope with the effects of COVID\-19 **\[5.6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The START \(STrAtegies for RelaTives\) intervention is a psychological therapy to reduce anxiety and depression in family carers of people with dementia. It was developed and evaluated by a multidisciplinary team at UCL, including essential contributions from statisticians led by Dr Barber. Statistical modelling showed the START intervention to be cost\-effective and clinically relevant over the short\- and long\-term. The intervention has improved UK policy and guidance on dementia care. The intervention is used in the UK by at least 24 services across 12 NHS Trusts and by charities such as the UK Alzheimer’s Society. It has also been translated and adapted for use in 5 other countries: Australia, Spain, Japan, India and Hong Kong.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The increasing dependence and challenging behaviour of people with dementia strongly affects the mental health of family members, who provide much of their care. Approximately 40% of these carers have clinical depression or anxiety, while others have significant psychological symptoms. Evidence from systematic reviews suggests that psychological interventions individualised to the carer are most effective in preventing breakdown of patient care and delaying care\-home admission. As the number of people with dementia in the UK is projected to increase by 80%, from almost 885,000 in 2019 to around 1,600,000 by 2040, it is critical to develop strategies to decrease the distress of carers. 

 Dr Julie Barber \(UCL Statistical Science\), together with a multi\-disciplinary group of researchers led by Professor Gill Livingston \(Division of Psychiatry, UCL\), developed and evaluated the STrAtegies for RelaTives \(START\) intervention; a programme of therapy and coping strategies for dementia carers. The multi\-disciplinary team comprised clinical psychiatrists specialising in older adults, clinical psychologists, neurologists, qualitative researchers, health economists, and statisticians. Dr Barber led the statistical team and was responsible for all statistical aspects of the evaluation of the START intervention. 

 In 2009, the research team conducted a randomised trial of START. The trial recruited 260 carers, who were randomly allocated to the intervention \(START\) group and to the ‘treatment as usual’ \(TAU\) control group in a 2:1 ratio. Within the intervention group, participants received 8 sessions of manual\-based therapy \(performed according to specific guidelines to maximise consistency\), delivered over 8\-14 weeks by psychology graduates supervised by the research team. This was the first UK randomised trial on the clinical effectiveness \(long\-term reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms\) and cost effectiveness of individual manual\-based therapy for dementia carers. 

 Dr Barber’s research is predominately in design and analysis of randomised trials of new health care interventions. She led all statistical aspects of the START trial, including inputting into the design of the trial; designing the statistical analyses, including identifying and evaluating optimal methods; supervising the data preparation and analysis; and writing peer\-reviewed articles. The effect of the START intervention was evaluated after 4 and 8 months \( **R1, R2**\) **,** 24 months \( **R3**\), and 6 years \( **R4**\). Dr Barber supervised two statisticians, Mark Griffin \(UCL Primary Care and Population Health\) and Dr Aidan O’Keeffe \(UCL Statistical Science\) in analysis of the clinical data and advised the Health Economists on statistical analysis of economic outcomes \( **R2, R3, R4**\). 

 Dr Barber’s underpinning research in design and analysis of trials allowed her to ensure the most appropriate and up\-to\-date methods were used for the START evaluation. Her analysis plans incorporated new statistical methodologies which had not previously been widely used in applied research, but which were essential to address specific complexities of the START trial design, ensuring unbiased and precise estimates of the intervention effect. In particular, she identified that modelling needed to account for the clustering of outcomes for carers receiving the intervention from the same therapists. Typically in previous trials, such clustering had been ignored, but Dr Barber’s research identified that this approach could result in inflation of type 1 errors and in false claims of important intervention effects. The START analysis was therefore carried out using a particular specification for a multilevel mixed\-effects model that allowed for differential clustering in the trial arms \( **R1, R2**\). For the 6\-year evaluation, Dr Barber found that results from analyses of the longitudinal HADS\-T scores could be biased due to “informative censoring” when the person with dementia was admitted to a care\-home or died. Informative censoring is usually ignored in trial analyses, resulting in estimation of potentially incorrect intervention effects. To address this Dr Barber used joint mixed effects models that incorporated time until institutionalisation or death alongside the HADS\-T measurements \( **R4**\). 

 Analysis of HADS\-T over the 8\-month evaluation period showed a significant improvement in anxiety and depression for carers receiving the START intervention. For the depression sub\-score, carers who participated in the TAU group were four times more likely to have clinically significant depression compared with those who received START \( **R1**\) **.** The corresponding economic calculations demonstrated a high probability of cost effectiveness \( **R2**\). 

 The positive clinical effect of the START intervention was sustained after 24 months, as evidenced by improved carer mood and lower anxiety levels \(lower HADS\-T\) \( **R3**\). START was also shown to be cost effective with respect to carer and patient outcomes, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) thresholds. 

 The most recent analysis over a 6\-year period, showed that carers who participated in the START programme were five times less likely to have clinically significant depression than carers in the TAU group \( **R4**\). Costs of care were nearly three times lower among families in the START group \(GBP5,759 per patient\) compared with the TAU group \(GBP16,964 per patient\), likely due to the improvement in family carers’ mental health and quality of life \( **R4**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The number of people living with dementia is rising rapidly owing to increased longevity. Two\-thirds of people with dementia \(approximately 567,000 in the UK\) live at home, with their family providing most of their care \( **S1**\). According to the Alzheimer Society’s estimation, more than 600,000 family members provide GBP13,900,000,000 per year of unpaid dementia care in the UK, however, 40% of the family carers have a clinical depression or anxiety, while others have substantial psychological symptoms \( **S1**\). Family care is pivotal as it exerts a 20\-fold protective effect against the risk of care home admission \( **S1**\). Therefore, the wellbeing of family caregivers and providing them with effective support is crucial. 

 The usefulness of the START psychological intervention for family carers was evaluated in a well\-conducted randomised trial, which relied on use of optimal statistical methodologies to ensure accurate and unbiased estimates of the intervention effect. This trial provided robust evidence of clinical and cost\-effectiveness of the intervention and has subsequently influenced decisions about guidelines, policy and practice for supporting family caregivers. 

 Approximately **66% of trial participants continued to use the techniques** they had been taught after the programme ended \( **S2**\). The manual and associated resources to deliver the intervention are freely available and can be downloaded \(in English, Urdu, Spanish and Japanese\) from the UCL website \( **S3**\). The page has been viewed approximately 30,000 times until the end of 2020 \( **S4**\).

 The evidence of START’s effectiveness has led policy makers to cite it in national guidance and policy documents. The UK Government included START **in The Prime Minister’s Challenge on Dementia 2020** \(published in 2015\), which set actions to improve dementia care, support and research in England \( **S5**\). They noted that “Carers of people with dementia undoubtedly provide a vital role and we know that the availability of appropriate care and support and the quality of services has a significant bearing on whether carers feel able to take a break from their caring responsibilities” \( **S5**\). The government recommended carers of people with dementia should be aware of and be offered the opportunity for respite, education, training, emotional and psychological support, to better enable them to cope with their caring responsibilities. To allow carers to have a life alongside caring, the guidelines recommend that more employers should have carer friendly policies and practice enabling more carers to continue working and caring. The Government also mandated that NHS England \(2016\-2017\) should provide measurable improvements in all areas of the policy, including quality of post\-diagnosis treatment and support for people with dementia and their carers \( **S5**\). 

 The Chief Executive of **Alzheimer’s Research UK** \(the country’s leading dementia research charity\) acknowledged the programme’s importance: “Around 23,000,000 people in the UK – roughly a third of the population – have a close friend or family member with dementia, and it’s these unsung heroes who take on much of the strain of the condition. It’s important to find ways to support carers and protect their health, and these results suggest that the START programme can help reduce anxiety and depression for carers” \( **S6**\). 

 START was evaluated in the **National Institute of Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines on Dementia** \(NG97 Assessment, management and support for people living with dementia and their carers; June 2018\). The NG97 evidence committee noted, “The evidence from the 2014 Livingston HTA report which demonstrated that successful non\-pharmacological interventions for managing non\-cognitive symptoms could be cost saving, due to the reductions in subsequent treatment costs for those receiving early interventions. The committee agreed that this recent HTA report represented the best quality economic evidence available and supported the recommendation for the first line use of non\-pharmacological management” \( **S7**\). Whilst the document recommended a variety of approaches for carer support, such as START or a similar intervention, the committee agreed that “the topics covered by START are a good representation of the topics that should be covered in this type of intervention” for carers \( **S7**\).

 The publication of the START intervention has generated a lot of interest and enthusiasm from NHS trusts for its adoption and it is now being delivered in one third of London memory clinics. 

 The Alzheimer’s Society \(the UK’s leading dementia support charity\) provided funding for dissemination of START, allowing training of 134 clinical psychologists and 39 admiral nurses in 9 UK locations from October 2014 to September 2015. Since then, the UCL team has provided training for 30 staff members in another London trust \(NELFT\) and others are being trained by the members of the dissemination groups. These trained professionals then cascaded training to others in their area, and this resulted in START being delivered locally to 136 carers across 11 service areas in 2016. A survey carried out in July 2018 by the UCL team indicated that **START is being used by at least 24 services over 12 NHS trusts, with approximately 192 carers** having received the intervention in 2017 \( **S8**\) **.** Individuals who completed the training reported better understanding of the condition and how it can cause challenging behaviour. This understanding made it easier for them to cope with psychological distress and improved their wellbeing, with a related improvement in their ability to provide care: “Yesterday I had the feeling of happiness I haven’t had in a long time. I suddenly felt positive and ‘able” \( **S8**\). This is echoed by voices from the dementia support workers, START facilitators and managers at the Alzheimer’s Society:“The work I got to do with START was really meaningful. Personally, I feel that START gave me the opportunity to work closely with carers, building a relationship that I normally wouldn’t get to, helping them to deal with the everyday practical sides of caring”; 

 “I really enjoyed making an actual difference to people’s lives, literally \(…\) the feedback from the carers is that it does work \(…\) it’s nice to know that there is a tool that can help carers that are really struggling”; 

 “That day is hard, seeing the consultant, trying to get ready and it’s a heavy day. Whereas with this, it’s in someone’s comfortable space and it’s at their own time and it’s looking at strategies \(…\) The things that maybe aren’t discussed with GPs or even a support worker on a home visit. This really opens up quite a lot more, it helps with exploring a lot more detail into what’s happening in the home and I think that’s really good”; 

 “I felt like it really highlighted and made my job more meaningful, because often I would come away thinking I’ve not done anything other than sat with a family for an hour and a half and talked about what dementia is \(…\) START actually gave them that one to one, especially for the carer \[to\] actually help the person with dementia in the long run” \( **S8**\). 

 <ins> **Worldwide implement</ins><ins>ation of the START intervention**</ins> 

 The START intervention has also been adopted by the international community. An online video conferencing version of START was developed in **Australia** to enable delivery of the intervention from Melbourne and Perth to people in remote communities **.** By November 2018 **,** 4 therapists had completed extensive training provided by UCL researchers and 28 carers had already completed the 8\-week programme \( **S9**\). Work in 2018\-20 enabled delivery to the **South Asian community** \(Urdu translation\) **.** Translation of the START manual into Japanese \(2019\) enabled 14 people to receive the intervention in an ongoing study in **Japan**, with 27 receiving training by February 2020 \( **S9**\). A START pilot project was conducted in **Hong Kong,** where 13 family carers have received training since the manual was translated into Chinese in 2017. Translations into Tamil and Hindi have been trialled successfully and START is now being delivered remotely in **India** \(Chennai, Mysore and New Dehli\) \( **S10**\) **.** In **Spain** it was trialled in 4 people after consultation about the translation. Unfortunately, plans for the regional authorities to begin implementation in Northern Spain have been delayed by the COVID pandemic \( **S10**\). 

 START has been adapted \(in collaboration with UCL\) for delivery in several different contexts and populations. The UCL Institute of Neurology adapted and trialled START for patients with **Parkinson’s Disease dementia**, and it has been adapted to **Lewy Body Dementia** \(with training already delivered to carers through third sector partners\). Furthermore, the success of the START intervention built a team and a method that led to funding further research programmes focused on dementia. These include the DREAMS\-START intervention involving a similar style of intervention to improve sleep in people with dementia living at home and a project to improve quality of life in people with dementia.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The IVAN trial, led by Professor Chakravarthy, is regarded by the National Institute of Health Research as one of the most important trials of the last decade. It proved that bevacizumab \(Avastin\) is a much cheaper, effective alternative to ranibizumab \(Lucentis\) for neovascular age\-related macular degeneration. This led to widespread demand by healthcare providers in the UK and internationally to be able to use the cheaper drug, a 2018 judicial decision in England and Wales \(upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2020\) to approve this switching, favourable comments about bevacizumab in the NICE guidelines \(2018\), use of bevacizumab instead of ranibizumab in NHS Scotland \(2019\) and a decision to no longer update the relevant Cochrane Review because the evidence to which IVAN makes such an important contribution was so robust \(2019\).

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The ophthalmology group at Queen’s University Belfast was established more than 30 years ago and has developed internationally\-recognised expertise in the genetics and treatment of age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\). It was ranked among the top 20 institutions in the world for research into macular degeneration in 2020, with Professor Chakravarthy in the top dozen global experts \( [http://expertscape.com/ex/macular\+degeneration](http://expertscape.com/ex/macular+degeneration)\). In 2007, under her leadership, the group was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme to work with colleagues in the universities of Bristol, Liverpool, Oxford and Southampton, and with the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Hospital in London and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust to conduct a randomised trial of the clinical and cost\-effectiveness of alternative treatments to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor \(VEGF\) in age\-related choroidal neovascularisation, called IVAN for short \(ISRCTN92166560\). IVAN recruited, randomised and treated 610 participants across 23 ophthalmic units in the NHS from March 2008 to October 2010, with the final primary outcome \(best corrected distance visual acuity at two years follow\-up\) being collected in November 2012. The trial sought to answer two main treatment questions through a head\-to\-head comparison of bevacizumab versus the more expensive ranibizumab, and a second randomisation of patients to continuous or discontinuous treatment. 

 The clinical results were published in a landmark paper in the Lancet in July 2013 \(less than nine months after the last patient had their 2\-year check\-up\) **\[R1\],** following the publication of the 1\-year findings the year before **\[R2\].** These papers were followed by the health economic findings in 2014 **\[R3\]** and the full NIHR HTA monograph in 2015 **\[R4\].** The results showed that the two drugs improve eyesight by a similar amount and that monthly treatment improves eyesight slightly more than intermittent treatment and appeared to be safer. 

 The results, coupled with the within\-trial economic evaluation of the incremental cost and cost\-effectiveness of discontinuous and continuous treatment from the cost perspective of the NHS and the health perspective of participants clearly showed that ranibizumab was not cost\-effective compared with bevacizumab. Two years of treatment with ranibizumab cost more than GBP18,500 compared with GBP3000 for bevacizumab. The health economic analysis showed that continuous ranibizumab would only be cost effective compared with continuous bevacizumab if the NHS were willing to pay GBP3,500,000 million per quality\-adjusted life year \(QALY\) **\[R3\].** 

 The cohort of patients in IVAN have also continued to be followed up producing important findings on the relationship between fluctuations in retinal thickness and prognosis for patients with neovascular age\-related macular degeneration **\[R5\]** and the trajectory of functional decline in their study eye **\[R6\].** 

 IVAN’s findings have also had an important influence on the results and conclusions for Cochrane Reviews of the safety and effectiveness of anti\-VEGF treatments for AMD \(Moja 2014; Solomon 2019\):

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 AMD affects more than 600,000 people in the UK and tens of millions globally and, without treatment, it quickly leads to blindness. Modern treatments, such as anti\-VEGF drugs injected directly into the eye \(e.g. ranibizumab and bevacizumab\) typically limit the loss of vision over 5 years to 1 to 2 lines of the eye test letter chart, with many patients maintaining vision sufficient to hold a driving licence. However, the very high cost of ranibizumab imposes a huge burden on healthcare services around the world. For instance, in their longitudinal study of the use of anti\-VEGF therapy for a variety of eye conditions \(including AMD\) in England between 2005 and 2015, Hollingworth *et al* concluded in 2017 that ‘The high and rising cost of anti\-VEGF therapy affects the ability of the NHS to provide care for other patients’. They noted how ‘current regulations encourage the increasing use of ranibizumab and aflibercept rather than bevacizumab, which evidence suggests is more cost\-effective’ and concluded that ‘NHS patients in England do not have equal access to the most cost\-effective care’ **.\[S1\]** 

 It is against this backdrop that IVAN has had such an impact. The trial is regarded by the NIHR as one the most important trials of the last decade, and it featured as a NIHR Impact Case Study in August 2019, highlighting that ‘The IVAN trial led to significant cost savings for the NHS as well as leading to new clinical guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It also had international repercussions: the trial's finding were \[sic\] the basis for new recommendations in a World Health Organisation report’. **\[S2\]** 

 IVAN had a rapid impact on policy, practice, and debate. As arguments in favour of using bevacizumab are won, the impact on policy and practice is growing, with policy makers and clinicians switching from ranibizumab to bevacizumab.

 In 2013, the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) added bevacizumab to its list of essential medicines \(EML\) for macular degeneration, citing the IVAN findings on safety and efficacy **.\[S3\]** When the list was revised 2 years later, Novartis \(the pharmaceutical company that made both drugs\) applied to have ranibizumab added but this was rejected by the WHO Expert Committee, who referred again to the IVAN findings and kept bevacizumab on the list, rejecting the option of showing ranibizumab as an alternative to bevacizumab, noting ‘given the difference in current prices of the 2 products and the legislation relating to “off\-label” use of medicines in many countries, the Committee decided that indicating interchangeability could well result in considerable additional expenditure at country level, without additional clinical benefit’ and ‘The Committee considered that inclusion only of the less expensive bevacizumab on the EML might serve to facilitate its use \(albeit off\-label\) for this indication’ **.\[S4\]** 

 **Impact on policy in the UK** 

 In the UK, IVAN catalysed the debate about the cost of medicines and led to a campaign for approval for use of bevacizumab. NHS Commissioners joined with doctors in calling for the right to use the drug, lobbying the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\), the Department of Health, the Secretary of State and the General Medical Council. It was reported in February 2015 that ‘clinical leaders from 120 Clinical Commissioning Groups, representing almost 60% of all CCGs, have come together to call on the doctors’ regulator the General Medical Council, the Department of Health and NHS England to remove the current barriers preventing CCGs from commissioning safe and effective eye care services using the drug Avastin ‘off\- licence’ to treat the debilitating condition of Wet Age related Macular Degeneration \(AMD\)’ **.\[S5\]** In September 2018, in a ruling welcomed by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists **,\[S6\]** the High Court of England and Wales supported the request from 12 NHS clinical commissioning groups \(CCG\) in the north of England to give bevacizumab to people with worsening sight loss, upholding the principle that commissioners of health care and doctors may offer patients this drug instead of ranibizumab or other more recently licensed treatments, **\[S6\]** and the ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal in March 2020 **.\[S6\]** In 2019, practitioners in NHS Scotland began to use bevacizumab in preference to ranibizumab. 

 **Impact on policy elsewhere in Europe** 

 In November 2017, the European Union Court of Justice supported the use of bevacizumab for AMD by agreeing that it is not contrary to EU law for a national healthcare insurance system to reimburse the costs of a medicinal product for a use not covered by its marketing authorisation \(off\-label use\). **\[S7\]** In September 2020, France fined Novartis and Roche EUR444,000,000 after its competition authority ruled that the drug companies used abusive practices to promote the use of one of their drugs Lucentis \(ranibizumab\) over Avantis \(bevacizumab\). **\[S8\]** 

 **Impact on guidance in the UK** 

 Current NICE guidance on AMD \(published in January 2018\) makes wide use of IVAN. The Guideline Committee took the view ‘that there is equivalent clinical effectiveness and safety of different anti\-VEGF agents \(aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab\)’, but that ‘At the time of publication \(January 2018\), bevacizumab did not have a UK marketing authorisation for, and is considered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) to be an unlicensed medication in, this indication. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the prescribing decision. Informed consent would need to be obtained and documented’. **\[S9\]** The Royal College of Ophthalmologists noted ‘There is now the potential to make considerable cost savings whilst empowering ophthalmologists to make clinical judgements with individual patients on the most appropriate choice of treatment’ **.\[S10\]** 

 **Impact on health expenditure in the USA** 

 In financial terms, in 2014, Hutton et al estimated that switching to bevacizumab from other anti\-VEGF agents could lead to total health savings of up to USD29,000,000,000 over 10 years in the USA **.\[S11\]** A later study, published in 2018, estimated that Medicare in the USA had saved USD17,300,000,000 billion between 2008 and 2015 from the use of bevacizumab for AMD **.\[S11\]** 

 **Impact on the evidence base** 

 In March 2019, the most recent update of the Cochrane Review of anti\-VEGF treatments of AMD concluded that ‘ranibizumab and bevacizumab have equivalent safety and effectiveness in such eyes’ and that the stability of this evidence meant that the authors ’do not anticipate a need for future updates to this systematic review’. **\[S12\]** 

 Finally, IVAN’s importance was also a key factor in awards received by Professor Chakravarthy. These include her CBE \(2016\), the Bowman award from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists \(2018\), the Gass Medal from the international Macula Society \(2019\) and a lifetime honorary Fellowship at the Royal College of Ophthalmologists \(2019\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Effective regulation and technological assessment of new medicines are key to ensuring that drugs are safe and effective for patients, and cost\-effective for health systems. Research from King’s College London has shown how regulatory developments in the US and EU have allowed new drugs to enter the market on the basis of less robust clinical evidence, which in turn may undermine appropriate clinical decision\-making, patient safety and the ability of policy makers to determine the value of new therapeutics for health systems and population health. 

 This research has \(i\) influenced World Health Organization \(WHO\) policy on new cancer drugs, including criteria for the inclusion of these drugs in its Essential Medicines List; \(ii\) strengthened the capacity of civil society organisations to scrutinise and advocate for enhanced medicines policy within the EU and internationally; and \(iii\) informed and empowered patient activists in the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Paradoxically, during a period in which decision\-makers have expressed a commitment to evidence\-based medicine and policy, a dominant trend in the United States and the European Union over the past 30 years has been to lower evidence standards for, and ‘fast\-track’ an increasing number of new therapies onto the market despite significant uncertainty around their benefits and risks. For example, in 2018, 48 of 59 \(81%\) new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) benefited from some kind of regulatory pathway allowing for expedited testing or regulatory review. In both the US and EU, these special regulatory programmes most commonly benefit high\-cost cancer drugs. 

 Proponents claim these initiatives incentivise medical innovation and speed patient access to promising therapies, and that critical data on drug efficacy and safety \(which would normally be required before drugs enter the market\) can be generated in the post\-market period while drugs are being prescribed to patients. However, health policymakers, clinicians and patients depend on the availability of reliable evidence to determine whether the benefits of new and more costly medicines will outweigh their harms and offer meaningful improvements over older, cheaper drugs. 

 An on\-going programme of research by Dr Courtney Davis – supported by competitively\-awarded grants from the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\), the Wellcome Trust, and the European Commission’s Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency \(CHAFEA\) – explores the drivers and implications of these trends. 

 **Investigating new paradigms in US and EU medicines policy** 

 Between 2001 and 2012 Davis and colleagues undertook the first EU\-US comparative analysis of the drivers, implementation and impacts of new ‘fast track’ policies for regulating innovative pharmaceuticals \[1\]. Through in\-depth, case study analyses of regulatory decision\-making in those regions over a twenty\-year period, King’s research showed the new policies did not necessarily lead to the prioritisation, incentivisation or approval of therapeutically important medicines. On the contrary, in each case examined, regulators had approved onto the market drugs of marginal or highly uncertain benefit. Some of those drugs posed unacceptable risks to patients and were subsequently withdrawn. Drawing on these findings, Davis’s 2016 *BMJ* paper \[2\] considered the implications and potential dangers of proposals by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) to further loosen regulatory standards by expanding the pathways through which companies could market new drugs on the basis of immature evidence. The paper noted that the proposals had been subject to minimal scrutiny and called for a more public and inclusive debate. 

 **Exploring the implications of current regulatory policy for cancer care** 

 Davis’s most recent research has focused on the regulation of new cancer drugs, which now comprise the single largest category of new drug approvals in Europe and the US. Davis’s research shows that although uptake of new cancer medicines is often accompanied by steep prices, and high expectations, evidence at their point of approval rarely supports claims to ‘breakthrough’ status \[3,4,5\]. For example, a retrospective cohort analysis by King’s researchers of all cancer drugs approved by the EMA between 2009 and 2013 \[3\] showed that the majority lacked evidence that they extend patients’ survival or improve quality of life. Where survival or quality of life gains *were* demonstrated, they were marginal according to established thresholds. Critically, King’s research \[6\] also showed that adequate evidence to address knowledge deficits is rarely demanded by FDA or EMA in the post\-market period, undermining claims that clinical uncertainty at time of market approval will be resolved through evidence generation once drugs are being prescribed to patients. The research recommended that regulators raise standards of drug approval by requiring that new drugs demonstrate clinically meaningful gains in survival and quality of life at the time of their approval. 

 King’s researchers also undertook the first systematic analysis of the health and budgetary impacts of the UK’s NHS Cancer Drugs Fund \(CDF\) – a ring\-fenced fund set up to enable patients to access high\-cost cancer therapies \[4\]. The research highlighted the problems of setting a low threshold for reimbursement by demonstrating the limited clinical benefits associated with these drugs and concluded that the CDF had failed to provide meaningful benefit to patients or society, recommending the avoidance of similar ‘ring\-fenced’ drug access funds in other countries. Critically, the research suggested that the GBP968,000,000 spent on the CDF resulted in overall net harm to population health since it displaced other, more cost\-effective treatments. Moreover, unrealistic expectations in relation to the clinical benefits offered by new drugs may actually harm individual patients if these expectations result in aggressive and inappropriate treatment with toxic chemotherapies towards the end of life \[5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As spending on expensive new medicines increasingly displaces other treatments, and policies modelled on the ‘fast\-track’ initiatives of the FDA and the EMA are adopted by drug regulatory agencies across the globe, careful evaluation of these initiatives, and transparent, inclusive debate has become ever more important. Through engagement with, and dissemination to regulators, international governmental bodies, clinicians, politicians and civil society groups at national and supranational levels, research led by Davis has influenced policy and practice in a variety of ways. 

 **Influencing World Health Organization \(WHO\) policy on new cancer drugs** 

 According to expert advisors sitting on the WHO’s Essential Medicines Committee for Cancer, Davis’s research \[3,4\] *“has been pivotal in drawing attention to the often marginal and uncertain benefits offered by many new cancer drugs relative to their price”* \[A\] and has shaped WHO policy with respect to eligibility criteria for cancer medicines proposed for the WHO’s Essential Medicines List, and WHO policy and recommendations around affordability and access to cancer medicines. 

 In March 2018, the WHO convened the Essential Medicines List Cancer Medicines Working Group \(EML\-CMWG\) to advise on criteria for the selection of cancer drugs for WHO’s Essential Medicines List, a list of the most efficacious, safe and cost\-effective medicines for priority conditions. Drawing on King’s research, which challenges the increasing tendency of regulators to approve new cancer drugs without evidence of clinically relevant impacts on patient survival or quality of life \[3; B p.7\-8\], the EML\-CMWG advised on “the need to have overall survival as the main eligibility criterion of a medicine proposed for EML listing” \[B p.4\]. This recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines \[C p.xvi\]. As noted by members of the WHO Essential Medicines Committee for Cancer; “Dr Davis’ seminal publications in this area provided crucial underpinning policy research that shaped the recommendations and conclusions of the working groups & subsequent WHO policy around inclusion \(and exclusion\) criteria for inclusion of cancer medicines on the Essential Medicines List” \[A\]. In 2019 the EML was updated, adding 12 cancer medicines, purposefully selected due to their designation as ‘best in terms of survival rates’. As noted by the WHO Director\-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “around the world, more than 150 countries use WHO’s Essential Medicines List to guide decisions about which medicines represent the best value for money, based on evidence and health impact. The inclusion in this list of some of the newest and most advanced cancer drugs is a strong statement that everyone deserves access to these life\-saving medicines, not just those who can afford them” \[D\]. 

 Davis’s research \[3,4\] also informed WHO recommendations related to the pricing and reimbursement of new cancer drugs. In 2017, the World Health Assembly requested guidance from WHO on options to enhance the affordability and accessibility of new cancer medicines. In response, the WHO convened an expert advisory group to report on the pricing of cancer medicines and its impacts. The resulting report drew extensively on King’s research \[E, p.11, 20, 35, 67, 106\], including the finding that the UK Cancer Drugs Fund “failed to deliver meaningful value to patients and society” \[E, p.67\]. As a result, the recommendations resulting from the report advised that countries should *“\[a\]void the use or establishment of funds earmarked for the provision of cancer medicines”* \[E, p.106\]. 

 **Building capacity of civil society organisations to scrutinise and advocate for enhanced medicines policy within the EU and internationally** 

 Through collaboration and engagement with advocacy groups and consumer health organisations, Davis’s research \[1,2,3\] has also facilitated a more transparent and inclusive discussion on medicines policy internationally. Her research, and subsequent dissemination activities, have strengthened the capacity of such groups to engage in high\-level discussions with policymaking and regulatory bodies, improving effective scrutiny and better enabling them to pursue favourable outcomes. \[text removed for publication\] 

 The International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities \(ICDRA\) provides drug regulatory authorities of WHO Member States with a forum to meet and discuss ways to strengthen collaboration. The ICDRAs have been instrumental in guiding regulatory authorities, WHO and interested stakeholders, and in determining priorities for action in national and international regulation of medicines. In 2016 an international coalition of patient groups and NGOs \(including AIDS Treatment Action Campaign South Africa; the Global TB Community Advisory Board International; SECTION27 South Africa; Health Gap International; and Treatment Action Group US/International\) drew on Davis’s BMJ analysis piece \[2\] to petition national medicines agencies and governments attending the ICDRA to stop lowering regulatory standards \[G\]. With Davis’s research, the coalition of five patient groups and NGOs concerned with the regulation of medicines in the public interest, both in their various countries and globally were able to create more succinct arguments based on evidence. In particular their petition directly referenced Davis’s research and stated that “the lowering of regulatory standards must be stopped… the public interest requires that medicines must be proven to be safe, effective and of high quality before allowed onto the market” \[G\]. 

 Similarly, key European consumer health organisations, including BEUC \(the European umbrella organisation for Consumer Associations\), EPHA \(the European Public Health Alliance\), the Medicines in Europe Forum, Test Achats \(the Belgian Consumers’ Association\), and Health Action International Europe have drawn on Davis’s research to develop evidence\-based policy recommendations and advocate for stronger medicines regulation in their interactions with the public health community, the European Medicines Agency, the European Commission and politicians at European and member state level. 

 For example, at a national level, the NGOs Test Achats, Stand Up for Cancer, and Doctors of the World used findings from Davis’s research \[3\] to develop their knowledge and understanding of the marginal or uncertain benefits offered by some new anti\-cancer drugs \[H1\]. As a result, the group developed ten key recommendations on the accessibility and affordability of medical treatments at a symposium with members of the Belgian House of Representatives on 8 November 2018 \[H2\]. Recommendation 3 cited Davis’s research \[3\] to argue that price should be proportionate to the health gains offered by new therapies \[H3, p.29\]. This recommendation was supported by the majority of Belgian political parties \[H2\]. 

 At the level of the supranational EU: “the evidence provided by Dr Davis and her colleagues has helped civil society groups like BEUC make a stronger case for the need to reinforce the EU medicines approval system, and to engage with the EMA and EU policymakers with a more authoritative voice. BEUC’s advocacy efforts in the last years have resulted in increased awareness among EU policymakers about the need to continue strengthening the regulatory framework, so it can provide more value to patients and consumers” \[I\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Wolke's research into babies born preterm or sick has influenced care standards in the UK and internationally, leading to improved screening of developmental delays and educational outcomes. His work was instrumental in informing the European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants \(EFCNI\)’s standards of follow\-up care in 2018; these have been endorsed and adopted by 170 professional and parent organisations across Europe. Wolke’s work influenced UK Government guidelines on delayed school entry for preterm children. The PARCA\-R \(Parent Report of Children's Abilities\-Revised\) questionnaire, developed by Wolke and colleagues, is recommended as the most suitable and best validated tool for screening of all very preterm children at 2 years of age in NICE \(2017\) and other guidance. Available in 14 languages, it has been accessed by users in 67 countries. It became a major follow\-up tool internationally when face\-to\-face assessment was not possible during the COVID\-19 crisis. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Preterm birth affects 15 million children, or 11% of births, every year worldwide. It is the major cause of childhood mortality and reduces life chances into adulthood. Wolke, with expertise in the birth, care and development of pre\-term babies, drew on a number of longitudinal studies including the EPICure study, a national cohort of children in the UK born in 1995 at less than 26 weeks’ gestation, and the Bavarian Longitudinal Study in Germany, which has followed very preterm children \(<32 weeks’ gestation\) and full\-term birth controls since 1985. 

 In the last decade Wolke and colleagues identified a distinct phenotype of difficulties experienced by children after preterm birth: multiple cognitive problems \(intelligence, executive function\), developmental coordination disorder, specific learning difficulties with mathematics, increased ADHD \(ADD type\) symptoms, anxiety and increased social problems \(autism spectrum\) and a more withdrawn personality **\[3.1\]**. These findings have been replicated, are universal and robust, and are identified as the *core areas* of psychological development affected by preterm birth that require monitoring in follow\-up care. 

 In 2015 further research revealed an increased vulnerability for neurocognitive deficits in those born very preterm \(<32 weeks gestation\) and moderately preterm \(32\-33 weeks gestation\) **\[3.2\]** e.g. being born at 30 weeks versus 31 weeks was related to a loss of 2.3 IQ points \(IQ reduces for each week lost in very and moderately preterm children\). In contrast, a loss of one week of gestation above 34 weeks was related to a loss of 0.3 IQ points per gestation week and was not significant. 

 From 2014 to 2019, Wolke and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that very preterm children do not outgrow cognitive problems, ADHD problems, educational and social difficulties by adulthood **\[3.1, 3.3\]**. They show lower neurodevelopmental plasticity than late preterm or term\-born children: the functional deficits still detected in adulthood are related to alterations in brain growth and in brain networks, and cognitive functions with reduced cholinergic basal integrity **\[3.4\]**. Wolke showed that follow\-up at the optimal time of 2 years of age is crucial for early identification of those with cognitive problems and for managing their care and schooling. 

 The findings on the high stability of cognitive deficits from 2 years into adulthood informed the development, testing and, later, standardisation of the PARCA\-R \(Parent Report of Children's Abilities\-Revised\) questionnaire, a parent\-completed screening instrument of cognitive and language development at 24 months to triage intensive follow\-up of preterm children **\[3.5\]**. It has been normed on over 6,500 children at 23\-27 months, can be used across the gestation span and has been validated to detect early cognitive impairment not only by Wolke and colleagues but also by independent groups in other language versions. 

 In 2012, Wolke’s general population longitudinal research established that summer\-born \(youngest in class\) children are specifically disadvantaged compared to autumn\-born \(oldest in class\) in academic tests **\[3.6\]**. Summer\-born \(before 31 August\) preterm children are most disadvantaged as they are routinely admitted to school early, using their birth date rather than expected date of delivery, and should be permitted to delay school entry. In contrast, using data from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study, in 2015 Wolke showed that delaying school entry by a year for autumn\-born pre\-term children has no discernible advantage **\[3.7\]**. Rather, early identification of learning difficulties may aid improved educational pathways and success of all preterm children. They are the fastest growing group of special needs children **\[3.8\]** but teachers and educational psychologists in 2015 had very little knowledge of their specific needs and had received no training **\[3.9\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Professor Wolke and colleagues’ cumulative research into babies born preterm or sick has had an impact on a large number of beneficiaries: policymakers, commissioners, healthcare professionals, education and social care services, parents and carers for children and young people born preterm, in the following ways: 

 **Impact on European standards of care for follow\-up of children or young people born preterm** 

 Based on the politically identified need to achieve common standards of care and national guidelines across more than 30 countries, between 2013 and 2018 the European Foundation of the Care of Newborns and Infants \(EFCNI\) developed 96 standards of care **\[5.1\]**, of which 15 were concerned with follow\-up and continuing care. Wolke chaired the international expert committee and edited these 15 standards. The chair of EFCNI confirms that “ *Professor Wolke's research was instrumental in informing the Follow\-up and Continuing Care standards. Several of his research publications, for example ‘Universal gestational age effects on cognitive and basic mathematic processing’, helped inform guidelines on cognitive development of infants born very preterm or those infants with risk factors*.” **\[5.2\]**. 

 Wolke presented the standards to MEPs and interest groups at the European Parliament in Brussels in November 2018, highlighting the need for common standards of follow\-up care across the member states, with approx. 650,000 preterm births per year. The standards have been endorsed by 120 healthcare professional societies and 51 parent organisations who support the call for action to implement them across Europe **\[5.1\]**. 

 **National and international adoption of PARCA\-R as a screening tool for neonatal care in child development clinics** 

 <ins>Professional guidelines in the UK:</ins> Since 2017 the PARCA\-R has been recommended by NICE in its guidelines, Developmental follow\-up of children and young people born preterm, to screen for cognitive and language problems in the follow\-up of very preterm children at 2 years \(affecting 7,000 very preterm children per year in the UK\) **\[5.3\]**. 

 <ins>International professional guidelines:</ins> EFCNI in one of its standards on ‘motor and neurological follow\-up assessment’ recommends that healthcare professionals should *“start a service that uses parent reports using screening questionnaires \- Ages and Stages Questionnaire or PARCA\-R”* **\[5.1\]**. PARCA\-R is the recommended patient outcome measure at 2 years in the Standard Set for Preterm and Hospitalised Newborn Health by the International Consortium of Health Outcomes Measurement \(ICHOM\), launched in August 2020 **\[5.4\]** \(potentially 15 million newborns per year\). 

 <ins>During the COVID\-19 pandemic:</ins> The British Association of Neonatal Neurodevelopmental Follow Up recommended the use of PARCA\-R for two years’ review in their March 2020 guidance for telephone–video clinics **\[5.5\]**. The Swiss Society of Neonatology \(SwissNeoNet\), which hosts the official medical quality register for Switzerland’s neonatal intensive care \(level IIB\) units and neonatal intermediate care \(level III\) units, also adopted the PARCA\-R in 2020, when strict restrictions prevented face\-to\-face contact, to undertake routine follow\-up assessments at 24 months of children born very preterm or who have suffered from neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy \(approx. 1,000 per year\). The Co\-ordinator of SwissNeoNet said: *“\[PARCA\-R\] has given perinatal centres and paediatric units the capacity to continue delivering their services remotely and, more importantly, ensuring that infant patient needs continue to be met.”* **\[5.6a\]**. In addition, in April 2020, the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, started using the PARCA\-R in place of their key follow\-up tool \- the Bayley Scale, with at least 120 children benefitting from the PARCA\-R assessments **\[5.6b\]**. 

 <ins>Practitioners and parents:</ins> Since its standardisation \(age\-and sex\-adjusted\) in 2019, PARCA\-R has been the preferred tool for cognitive screening of children at all gestations \(630,000 per year in England and Wales\) by healthcare professionals and parents. In December that year, the PARCA\-R Technical and Interpretive Manual, describing the development and standardisation of the test and providing the norms tables needed to score the questionnaire by hand, was sent to all \(204\) neonatal units in the UK, reaching around 5,000 neonatal nurses, to support the test’s use in clinical practice. Its non\-standardised version is available in 14 languages and since May 2018 has been accessed by more than 1,200 users, mainly professionals and parents \(71%\), in 67 countries. **\[5.7\]** 

 PARCA\-R is free to download and can be completed by parents in around 15 minutes, compared to 2 hours for the resource\-intense standard developmental or IQ testing. As an example, PARCA\-R was instrumental in Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Children \(RHC\)’s redesign of its neurodevelopment outpatient service in 2017. Before NICE guidance RHC had not used a standardised assessment at two years corrected age; for the last three years, 53 \(100%\) of families attending the clinic at two years corrected have completed a PARCA\-R questionnaire **\[5.8\]**. The consultant neonatologist states that, “ *Many children do not demonstrate their full potential within the outpatient clinic setting, particularly with language and cognition. The PARCA\-R overcame this challenge while integrating families into the assessment process. Our families engaged well with the questionnaire, with every family completing the questionnaire in the first 2 years of its introduction.”* **\[5.8\]**. 

 **Improved awareness and measurement of outcomes by healthcare and educational professionals** 

 <ins>National guidelines:</ins> Informed by Wolke’s research, the NICE guidelines \(2017\) on the special needs of preterm children and lack of knowledge and training of teachers and educational psychologists recommended “ *recording routine educational measures at key stage 2 \(including special educational needs and disability\) on an operational delivery network\-wide basis, to allow educational outcomes at 11 years to be linked to neonatal information*.” Healthcare professionals are also recommended to provide information about the risk and prevalence of developmental problems and disorders in babies born preterm to parents and carers, and offer to discuss this with them **\[5.3\]**. Wolke’s research informed the Swedish Neonatal Society’s guidelines for the follow\-up of neonatal risk babies \(2015\), highlighting the prevalence of extremely premature babies that need extra support at school age **\[5.9\]**. 

 <ins>Other guidelines for practitioners, parents and carers</ins><ins>:</ins> Local authorities e.g. Hampshire County Council and NHS Hampshire Hospitals, drew on Wolke’s research to increase parents’, carers’ and teachers’ understanding of how premature children are affected in their development and learning **\[5.10\]**. Neonatal societies e.g. Royal College of Occupational Therapists, used his work in practice guidelines \(2017\) to raise awareness for occupational therapists about how preterm children remain at high risk for neurodevelopmental disability compared with term peers **\[5.11\]**. 

 <ins>Department for Education \(DfE\) guidelines:</ins> DfE’s *Advice on the admission of summer born children for local authorities and school admission authorities and parents* \(July 2013, revised September 2020 as Summer Born Children Starting School: Advice for parents\) used Wolke's research as part of the evidence base to *""…take account of the age group the child would have fallen into if born on time.*"" **\[5.12a; 5.12b\]**. This guidance from DfE details the framework that UK school authorities must operate under and takes account of the needs of 12,000 parents of preterm children per year who are able to request a delayed enrolment date \(around 15% of all requests\) **\[5.12c\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Using public interest in Jodrell Bank’s world\-leading research, researchers at The University of Manchester \(UoM\) developed a broad and innovative programme of activities with a focus on educating, inspiring and reaching previously underserved audiences. Activities are primarily run from the Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre \(JBDC\), a purpose\-built facility run as a social enterprise. Since August 2013, the Centre has attracted 1,017,015 visitors \(including 141,292 school pupils\) to engage with UoM’s cutting\-edge research, in areas ranging from pulsars to cosmology. This has had measurable impacts on education \(94% of visiting teachers agreed their pupils were inspired about STEM\), tourism \(exceeding estimates of GBP21,000,000 economic impact in the REF period\) and wider culture \(the award\-winning annual Bluedot festival attracted new audiences to celebrate science, music and art\). The significance of Jodrell Bank’s research output and engagement resulted in its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2019. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact is based on a wide body of research carried out at UoM’s Jodrell Bank during the past 20 years. Over this time, Jodrell Bank astronomers have made a number of seminal contributions to astrophysics, particularly in radio astronomy, and to the technical development of observing techniques. A few selected research highlights are listed below with key staff in each area identified. These few examples are drawn from the wide\-ranging research programme carried out by the researchers named above, as well as a very broad group of additional researchers from Jodrell Bank. This research regularly features in the material presented at the JBDC through exhibits, workshops, talks and Bluedot festival activities. 

 Paper **\[1\]** reported the discovery of the Double Pulsar, a unique system allowing unprecedented tests of fundamental gravitational physics such as that reported in Paper **\[2\];** the first to measure precession in a strong gravity environment. These papers epitomise the significant volume of ongoing world\-leading work on pulsars at Jodrell Bank using the Lovell Telescope and others, which comprises over 300 refereed publications in the REF period. 

 Paper **\[3\]** describes e\-MERLIN, the array of seven radio telescopes developed and operated at Jodrell Bank, and providing sensitive, high\-resolution radio images. This paper represents Jodrell Bank’s long\-standing and continuing development and use of radio interferometers also including the European Very Long Baseline Network of telescopes and the Square Kilometre Array \(whose global HQ is at Jodrell Bank\). The e\-MERLIN/VLBI National facility has contributed to at least 595 research papers just since 2010 – research across a wide range of areas including star formation, gravitational lensing, active galaxies, and more. 

 Paper **\[4\]** reports the analysis of Planck spacecraft observations of the cosmic microwave background \(CMB\) with specific reference to Galactic foregrounds. The Jodrell Bank group’s work on the CMB has included developing the Very Small Array in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, making early observations of the power spectrum, building ultra\-low\-noise amplifiers for the Planck spacecraft and leading on the analysis of foregrounds.

 Examples of underpinning research cited in Section 2 are listed below \(UoM authors in bold font\) and should be taken as representative of the significant volume of ongoing world\-leading research undertaken by the Jodrell Bank group. Paper **\[1\]** resulted in the group being awarded the 2005 Descartes Prize. Paper **\[3\]** contains the technical description of the instrument used by >300 astronomers from >100 institutions, which led to the Jodrell Bank team being awarded the 2015 Royal Astronomical Society Group Achievement Award. Work on the Planck spacecraft, some of which is described in Paper **\[4\]**, led to the award of an OBE to R. J. Davis in 2011. Citation data is from Scopus, and accurate as of 8 March 2021.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The breadth and depth of this programme, coupled with the wider long\-term appeal of Jodrell Bank and the operation of its iconic telescopes, attracts a large number of people to JBDC. This has helped Jodrell Bank to play a leading role in public engagement with astrophysics research, and deliver impact across a range of areas. 

 **Economic impact:** The JBDC opened in 2011 with two new buildings. The funding \(from the Northwest Regional Development Agency, European Regional Development Fund and UoM\) was awarded following an independent analysis by consultancy firm EKOS, which calculated an additional GBP27,000,000 economic impact to the region over the decade from opening in 2011 *i.e.* \~GBP21,000,000 over the current REF period **\[A\]**. This assumed that the site would attract 189,620 new visitors \(over a baseline of GBP80,000 *p.a.*\) up to 2016/17, safeguarding nine existing jobs and creating six more. In actuality, JBDC attracted 306,254 new visitors up to 2016/17 and as of February 2020 employed 32 staff \(at 27 FTE\) **\[B\]**. This success led to the addition of a third building costing GBP1,400,000 which opened in 2015, and a GBP1,800,000 upgrade and expansion of the car park in 2019. In 2019, JBDC’s economic impact was recognised through the receipt of Marketing Cheshire’s Special Contribution to Tourism Award **\[C\]**. 

 **JBDC visitor demographics:** Over the current REF period there have been a total of 1,017,015 visitors \(including 141,292 school pupils on educational visits\) **\[B\]**. In 2016/2017, Jodrell Bank commissioned a major external survey conducted by marketing consultants Morris Hargreaves McIntyre \(MHM\). The survey found that, excluding school visits, nearly half of all visits to Jodrell Bank \(47%\) are family groups, and nearly one third of all visitors are children \(just under one in five are aged between 5 and 11 years old\) **\[B\]**. This significant proportion of family\-group and under\-18 visitors shows that JBDC is succeeding in engaging with young audiences, and works towards our goal of inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. There is an even gender split, and 37% visit from outside the North West \(NW\) region. However, JBDC has historically struggled to engage certain demographic groups; the 16\-24 age group were under\-represented in the visitor profile, making the fewest visits at just 3%, whilst 97% of visitors were from white ethnic groups. Likewise, in academia, women and people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds have low levels of representation in the fields of physics and engineering. To expand the audience engaged by Jodrell Bank’s outreach, and to help address these low levels of representation, we developed several additional programmes, some of which are described in the sections below **\[B\]**. 

 **JBDC general visitor motivation, satisfaction and learning impact:** Visitors are attracted to Jodrell Bank because of its scientific research. For those that visit \(285 responders in the MHM survey excluding schools\), the biggest attractor is the Lovell Telescope \(77%\) whilst 54% wish to ‘improve my own knowledge’ and 40% to ‘stimulate my own/children’s imagination’ **\[D\]**. This survey also shows visitors’ expectations are exceeded: 95% are likely to recommend a visit to others, 70% thought they had improved their knowledge, whilst half said the visit gave them something to think or talk about compared with 20% who said this was a motivation to visit. The high proportion of return visits \(44%\) also demonstrates this satisfaction. The MHM survey also found that of 2,117 adults across the UK, 37% were aware of Jodrell Bank \(compared with, for example, 77% for Chester Zoo, 27% the National Space Centre and 11% At Bristol Science Centre\) and that 70% of these know that it is a centre for world\-leading scientific research **\[B\]**. 

 Non\-school visitors to JBDC engage with our research in a number of ways, including: 

-  An interactive exhibition – supported by on\-gallery explainers and guided tours around the Lovell Telescope explaining its work. The exhibition contains elements directly discussing pulsars, Planck/CMB and e\-MERLIN research conducted at Jodrell Bank **\[1‒4\]**. 

-  *Meet the Scientist*: 48 active researchers from Jodrell Bank have taken part in sessions describing their research and answering questions about it, engaging with >16,113 attendees to date. A survey during the 2017 May school half\-term attracted 63 responses representing 73 adults and 62 under\-16s **\[D\]**. 55% of adults were aged 35\-50, 48% of u\-16s were aged 10\-14. 54% had not visited Jodrell Bank before. When asked ‘Why did you visit Jodrell Bank today?’, the two most popular responses were ‘We’re interested in science done at Jodrell Bank’ and ‘We wanted to see the Lovell telescope’ **\[D\]**. 100% agreed that they had learnt something new, 76% agreed that they were now more interested in science as a result of attending the event, with only 1% disagreeing **\[D\]**. Some of the regularly featured presentation themes are pulsars and cosmology and often directly showcases results about the Double Pulsar and the Planck Mission **\[1, 2, 4\]**. 

-  *Lovell Lectures*: 39 evening events, half delivered by Jodrell Bank staff on their research, with a total of 5,954 attendees. An evaluation in 2017 found 87% of the audience are over 45, 56% are regular attenders, 94% learnt something new and 66% agreed they will find out more about the subject as a result **\[D\]**. Lectures featured the Double Pulsar/pulsars, e\-MERLIN and the Planck **\[1‒4\]**. 

-  *Girls Night Out*: a female researcher\-led series of evening events promoting women in STEM, 11 events over REF period with 1,369 attendees. From 33 survey returns in 17/18, we find they were rated excellent by 70% and very good by 30%, whilst 36% strongly agreed and 52% agreed they would find out more about science as a result of the event **\[D\]**. 

 **Educational impact on schools:** Over the REF period, 141,292 school pupils have visited JBDC on formal educational programmes. The programme extends from Early Years to post\-16 with a majority \(62%\) at Key Stage 2 **\[E\]**. 

-  From 102 post\-visit evaluations in 18/19, 100% of teachers agreed that their learning objectives were met \(72% strongly agreed\) and that students learnt something new \(83% strongly\), whilst 94% agreed that the visit inspired their learners about STEM \(48% strongly\) **\[E\]**. This positive impact leads to an increasing number of return visits \(45% in 17/18\) **\[E\]**. 

-  JBDC also takes part in the UoM widening participation \(WP\) programme, attracting 2,506 pupils over 15/16\-18/19 **\[E\]**. 

-  JBDC estimates \(assuming learners are representative of their schools\) that in 18/19, for example, 22% of those visiting were eligible for free school meals \(NW average 18%\), 39% had English as an Additional Language \(NW 28%\), and 13% were non\-white British \(NW 14%\) **\[E\]**. This demonstrates that JBDC’s school\-focused outreach has successfully engaged with young people who are typically underserved by science outreach and under\-represented in astronomy. 

-  Research from Jodrell Bank, including real data, is specifically used in several workshops. The Pulsars workshop **\[1, 2\]** has attracted 905 A\-Level students in 42 school visits since it was developed during 2016/2017; the Radio Telescopes workshop **\[3\]** has attracted 2,107 A\-Level students in 108 visits over the REF period; and the Exoplanets workshop 1,179 GCSE students in 38 visits **\[E\]**. From 31 post\-event responses between 2017 and 2019, 100% of teachers would recommend the workshops to others, 58% felt their students’ learning at the workshops was outstanding and 39% good **\[E\]**. Teacher comments included: “ *One of the best educational workshops I have taken students to*”, “ *Really good workshop. Our students enjoyed using the real data and discussing pulsars*”. In a survey of 99 students taking the pulsar workshop, 28% said they were now more likely to study physics at university, 27% were now more interested in becoming a physics researcher and 86% said they now had a clearer idea of what scientists do **\[E\]**. 

 **Bluedot festival:** As outlined above, JBDC activities have engaged and inspired people from many different demographics but has historically struggled to engage people from certain backgrounds. To try and engage people from these groups with science, and with Jodrell Bank’s research in particular, UoM developed the annual Bluedot festival. Launched in 2016 and held on the Jodrell Bank site, Bluedot festival combines music and cultural activities typical of festivals with science engagement events. The four Bluedot festivals held in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have had 72,649 attendees. 

 The programme includes multiple talks by Jodrell Bank researchers, several stands and bespoke sci\-artworks featuring our research on pulsars, technology development and cosmology/Planck mission **\[1‒4\]**. As with JBDC, Bluedot visitors are attracted by the work of Jodrell Bank and the science engagement offered. From onsite and post\-event surveys for the 2019 festival \(306 and 2,166 respondents\): 

-  81% knew Jodrell was an active research site and 80% agreed they had learnt something about science at Bluedot, 59% said they were likely to visit another science centre in the next 12 months and 74% said they would return to JBDC as a general visitor **\[F\]**. This demonstrates that visitors to Bluedot festival were drawn by its scientific track record and were successfully inspired by their visit. 

-  A 1,339\-respondent sample were asked to mention anything they had learned whilst at Bluedot, 92% mentioned something scientific without being prompted **\[F\]**. 18% of the facts mentioned were identifiably related to Jodrell Bank research. For example, 44 mentioned pulsars **\[1, 2\]** and 15 mentioned the Square Kilometre Array **\[F\]**. Comments included: “ *Black widow spider pulsars\!*”, “ *The talk around the Lovell telescope was super, and I learnt about pulsars and quasars*”, “ *Understanding why pulsars emit a narrow, intense beam of electromagnetic radiation*”, “ *The networking, timing and computing challenges around the SKA are huge\!*”, “ *SKA radio telescope project development, scope and size of the project, and what we will learn with it*” **\[F\]**. A further 34% of the responses were relating to astronomy and space but not necessarily Jodrell, 12% were about other physics, 17% environmental science, and 12% other general science **\[F\]**. 

 With Bluedot festival, UoM researchers successfully engaged with a greater number of people from demographics underserved by science outreach, including by JBDC. Survey analysis by MHM found that 63% of attendees at Bluedot were in the 16\-44 age range, compared with 35% at JBDC **\[F\]** and 13% of attendees were in the range 16\-24, compared with only 3% at JBDC **\[F\]**. Additionally, 9% were from a non\-white ethnic group, compared with only 3% at JBDC, and that 55% had travelled from outside the North West of England, whereas only 37% of visitors to JBDC came from outside this region. Taken together, this demonstrates that Bluedot successfully engaged with a broader and more diverse audience than JBDC activities. 

 Bluedot also has an impact on the scientists taking part. For example, in the 2019 exhibitor survey, from 90 responses, 97% either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt their participation had inspired others, 55% developed new skills, 85% learnt something new and 47% made new professional connections **\[F\]**. Comments included: “ *Audience feedback suggested enthusiasm about being able to talk directly to/ ask questions of scientists about their research*”, “ *We got a real sense of engagement and interest from groups who don't normally engage with science*”, “ *It gives our young leaders an excellent platform to demonstrate and improve their communication skills face\-to\-face*” **\[F\]**. 

 In 2019, Bluedot won the Best Medium\-Sized Festival Award \(daily capacity 10,000 \- 39,999\) at the industry’s UK Festival Awards **\[C\]**. 

 **Wider outreach & citizen science:** To widen their reach beyond visitors, the JBDC Education team visits WP schools, engaging with 3,189 students over 2016\-19 **\[E\]**. 

 Three series of BBC’s Stargazing Live \(each with 3 episodes\) were broadcast from Jodrell Bank during the REF period \(2014 – average 2.6 million viewers per episode, 10.8% audience share; 2015 – 1.8 million, 8.6%, plus eclipse special 4.1 million viewers, 55%; 1.4 million, 6.2%\) **\[G\]**. These strongly featured Jodrell Bank research, including two citizen science projects: Space Warps \(searching for new gravitational lenses\) in January 2014 and Pulsar Hunters in January 2016. The former inspired tens of thousands of viewers to make 7.5 million classifications online leading to the discovery of a new Einstein Ring imaged by e\-MERLIN during the programme and published in a refereed journal in 2015 **\[G\]**. This project was directly underpinned by e\-MERLIN **\[3\]**, which was used to detect the Ring during the TV programme. Pulsar Hunters, developed by Jodrell Bank researchers, similarly attracted over 10,000 people to make around 3 million classifications leading to the co\-discovery of a new pulsar which was observed with the Lovell Telescope during the TV broadcast **\[G\]**. Pulsar Hunters has since been used in a number of events \(including Bluedot, Mozilla Festival and Manchester Science Festival\). 

 **World Heritage Site:** Jodrell Bank Observatory was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019, recognising the significant impact of its research on a wide international stage and bringing our scientific research to a new global audience whose primary interest is in heritage **\[H\]**. This followed a 10\-year process of developing a case, which was peer reviewed by UK Government, UNESCO and ICOMOS.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Healthcare contexts frequently give rise to situations which leave individuals feeling powerless: chronic illness, end of life, as well as caring for people affected by these issues. In such situations, are there ways for individuals to flourish, or at least cope better? This was the core question of our 3\-year, interdisciplinary, AHRC\-funded project: ‘The Ethics of Powerlessness: The Theological Virtues today’ \(EoP\). Our research has \(i\) influenced NICE \(National Institute for Clinical Excellence\) guidelines for palliative care; \(ii\) promoted public understanding of powerlessness and the distinctive importance of ‘virtues of powerlessness’ such as hope, with public engagements such as involvement with Radio 4’s *In Our Time* broadcast and podcast reaching in excess of 3,000,000 people \(iii\) improved professional understanding of powerlessness in end\-of\-life care and moral distress and influenced the delivery of ethical practice in palliative care through CPD training. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In the course of our lives we are likely to be faced with situations which can lead to acute feelings of powerlessness: being given a life\-changing or terminal diagnosis; or caring for a loved one with a chronic or terminal condition; or practicing as a healthcare professional in a hospice or discharge unit with tight financial constraints **.** Patients report feeling powerless as they lose familiarity with their own bodily movements or environment, for example, or as they face increased social insecurity or loneliness. Carers and family members report feeling powerless because of their inability to remedy the situation or simply in the face of its relentless demands. 

 Such feelings of powerlessness often have an ethical dimension, as in the case of moral distress, where the powerlessness is typically experienced in relation to institutional constraints. Moral distress is a widespread experience in which carers \(typically nurses\) believe that they know the best way to care for a patient but feel prevented \(often by senior staff or institutional circumstances\) from doing what they believe is right. Moral distress is an acute experience which involves a complex interplay of feelings of guilt and victimhood: carers blame themselves for failing to meet their standards of care and yet also feel disempowered by their context. US studies suggest that moral distress is a significant contributor to burnout and drop\-out rates in the medical profession. 

 While widespread, such experiences of powerlessness are often poorly understood. For example, to this day there is no primary NHS literature on moral distress. Consequently, our impact work focuses on two main questions: 1\) How are we best to understand experiences of powerlessness such as moral distress? 2\) How might we best respond to them, whether in our own case or in those for whom we care? 

 In a UK context of an aging population and urgent policy review around palliative care as well as rising dropout rates in the NHS, EoP has adopted a tripartite approach: 

-  **First**, we offered an account of a core feature of all experiences of powerlessness: namely a felt loss of *the power to be oneself*. This account is articulated in **\[R1, R2\]** and has its foundations in primary research on the theme of powerlessness and selfhood in the tradition of existential phenomenology, especially on Nietzsche, Heidegger and Kierkegaard **\[R3, R4, R5\]**. This account has been central to the delivery of our aim, in CPD training and in the wider public sphere, to advance understanding of powerlessness as a lived experience: for example, by helping to correct one\-dimensional views of powerlessness merely as loss of control. 

-  **Second**, we identified a distinct response to powerlessness according to which, rather than trying to wrench back control, individuals seek to accept their powerlessness, and find themselves empowered by such acceptance. Paradigmatic examples can be found in twelve\-step programmes, which begin with the acknowledgement that ‘we were powerless over \[…\]’. Acceptance is both something that happens to us \(the result of a complex process\) and something we do. EoP research has shown that the distinctive character of this type of response is occluded by standard accounts of the dichotomy between patients and agents **\[R1\]**. Han\-Pile has worked out an original account of the mode of human agency at work in such cases as acceptance **\[R3, R4, R6\]**. These results are reflected in our influence on NICE guidelines and also in the recommendations we advanced, for example, in our EoP leaflet on moral distress. 

-  **Third,** we drew on the Christian tradition of the so\-called theological virtues – faith, hope and love – to show how these and related virtues can help with experiences of powerlessness across both religious and secular contexts, through instances of ‘strong hope’, for example, or ‘practices of acknowledged dependence’ **\[R1, R6\]**. This dimension of our research has come to the fore in our advocacy for the distinctive importance of ‘virtues of powerlessness’, for example through the In Our Time broadcast on hope.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **\(i\) Shaping public policy: changing NICE guidelines on End of Life Care** 

 According to a recent NICE report, ‘ *around half a million people die in England each year … effective end of life care improves the quality of the dying person and those important to them*’ **\[S1\]**. Yet the typical emphasis on autonomy and choice in NHS guidelines and policies can be counterproductive. This is because some patients in situations of powerlessness are not able to make rational choices: they may be too worn out or lack motivation. Such patients only feel all the more disempowered by the demand that they should take control, so another approach is needed **\[R1\]**. The Ethics of Powerlessness \(EoP\) thus decided to register as a stakeholder in NICE guidelines so as to be able to influence future changes in policy. EoP first participated in an NHS consultation exercise on a draft of the NICE guidelines: Care for Dying Adults in the Last Days of Life. NICE accepted an EoP recommendation on this draft and Han\-Pile was then invited to a scoping workshop for a further set of NICE guidelines on Care at the End of Life, in November 2016. Through her contributions at this workshop, EoP recommended that a key phrase running through this draft should be changed: from ‘ *live as actively as possible*’ to ‘ *live as well as possible*’ **\[S2\]**. 

 This recommendation was based on our research on the first\-person experience of powerlessness as an experience of the loss of power to be oneself in **\[R1\]**, which had shown that prioritising activity and autonomy at the end of life may get in the way of living as well as possible, and that the latter is the most important goal. Our recommendation was accepted and is reflected throughout the published guidelines: *End of Life Care: Delivery of Adult Services for people in the last year of life \(NICE; Jan 2016\)* **\[S2a\]**. This benefited both health care practitioners, who follow the guidelines, and patients. A 2020 NICE document also reflects our engagement with the drafts by stating that palliative care ‘ *ensures that people live well until they die’* **\[S1\]**. The breadth and depth of this impact is indicated by the wide reach of NICE guidelines: according to NICE, these ‘ *have touched the lives of everyone in England in ways few realize*’ **\[S2a\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Improving public understanding: raising awareness of the ethics of powerlessness and moral distress** 

 Having already taken part in three ‘ *In Our Time*’ programmes with Melvyn Bragg, Han\-Pile contacted the producer of the series, in 2017 to suggest a further programme on ‘Hope’ \(as a virtue of powerlessness\) **\[R6\]**. He responded enthusiastically and the programme was aired on Thursday 21 November 2018.The programme reached a word\-wide audience of circa 2,450,000 listeners for the first two broadcasts, with the podcast being downloaded circa 800,000 in the first month after broadcasting **\[S3, p.1\]**, and Han\-Pile received many unsolicited emails from members of the public, commenting on how they had been inspired to rethink the ethical significance of hope: *‘you gave me concepts and ways of thinking I hadn’t dreamt of’; ‘I greatly appreciate your skill in making profound ideas accessible to non\-\(professional\)\-philosophers.’* **\[S3, p.2\]** *; ‘it inspired a blog\-post’* **\[S3, p.3\-4\]**. The producer summarised the listener feedback he also received as: ‘ *Brilliant—enlightening—really enjoyable—inspiring—and many stimulated to think about hope*’ **\[S3, p.5\]**. The BBC hosted links to the project’s research as part of its recommended further reading **\[S3, p.6\]**. 

 EoP also informed a leaflet on Moral Distress available to download on the project’s website. This was designed to help informal carers and hospice staff to recognise the signs of moral distress and suggesting ways to help with these signs. The leaflet was co\-produced with, and endorsed by, St Francis Hospice and disseminated in at least four hospices **\[S4\]**. 

 **\(iii\) Improving professional understanding and influencing the delivery of ethical practice in palliative care** 

 From the outset of the project, EoP established a close cooperation with the Chief Executive of St Helena Hospice in Colchester, who noted that *‘\[B\]ringing academic and practitioner perspectives together to consider and reflect on real\-world ethical challenges relating to experiences of powerlessness in the context of palliative and end of life care has helped generate new insight and understanding*.’ **\[S5\]**. This involved visits to the hospice and interviews with staff. In July 2017, EoP delivered a one\-day training module on ‘Experiences of Powerlessness at the End\-of\-Life’. This was based on the research developed during our first year of the project and published in our first two Green Papers **\[R1\]**. The module, which was attended by staff across a wide range of roles within the Hospice, was very well received \(100% of participants judged it *‘very useful’*\) and discursive feedback included the following: *‘feel better equipped to talk with people re \- how they perceive themselves and \[‘their\] way forward’; ‘Made me reflect on ‘existential loneliness’ and how this fits with practice; ‘more understanding of how to help patients and family members’; ’helped me process emotional experience’* **\[S6\]**. 

 In the summer of 2017, EoP delivered a shortened version of the module at the Essex Autonomy Project \(EAP\) Summer School. This time, the audience comprised not only health care professionals, but also lawyers and social workers. Feedback questionnaires indicate again that the session was deemed very useful by the attendees, one of whom noted that *‘the concept of powerlessness was extremely pertinent for the groups of people I work with’* **\[S6\]**. 

 Since 2017, the reach and significance of EoP impact on professionals and delivery of ethical practice in healthcare contexts has been building. A new research strand emerged from our work on powerlessness, namely an investigation of the concept of moral distress. This concept has been the object of numerous studies in the US, but not in the UK. We got in touch with Pat Benner, an emeritus professor at the University of California, a seminal figure in the anglophone palliative care nursing world. She was very enthusiastic about our work and organised a Knowledge Exchange Event on EoP research in Berkeley in the spring of 2018, attendees at this event included hospice palliative care physicians and nurses.  She recognised that *‘it is easy to imagine that nurses need help rather than empowerment … your work has built\-in protection against this ‘victimization’ with your view of ways of overcoming loss of agency in states of powerlessness’* **\[S7\]**. Following up on this, we designed a CPD module on ‘Moral Distress’ which we delivered at the 2018 EAP Summer School. One practitioner commented on how it shifted her thinking from being focused on practical problem solving to attending to lived experience. Feedback also included the following: ‘ *a fascinating concept. I felt I knew it intuitively – the session named it – I would like to know more’* **\[S8\]**. We are currently working with a group of 20,000\+ physicians to develop UK\-wide questionnaires about moral distress and pandemic\-related moral distress. 

 Our CPD training has been extended to institutions across the East of England. In May 2019, we visited St Francis hospice to deliver a full study day on ‘Moral Distress’. This study day complemented the Moral Distress leaflet: the Director of Education at St Francis noted that the leaflets supported learning from the 2019 Study Day and has ‘ *generated further thought*’ **\[S9\]** Again, 100% of attendees deemed the workshop ‘ *very useful’*. On average, the audience’s understanding of moral distress went from 2 to 5 \(on a scale from 1 to 6\), a gain of 50%. In September 2019, EoP delivered CPD training on Moral Distress to St Luke’s Hospice \(Basildon\) and Arthur Rank Hospice \(Cambridge\) which was likewise well\-received **\[S8\]**. 

 These events again drew participants from a wide range of roles within the Hospice setting including doctors, nurses, teachers, counsellors and managers. Many participants described their personal relief simply at being given resources properly to recognize moral distress as part of their experience. Comments included: ‘ *gives me awareness of being more in tune to recognise situations that could potentially become moral distress situations’*; ‘ *exploring moral distress has helped me to recognise when I had experienced this previously and different ways I have reacted throughout my career*’ **\[S8\]**. Another form of impact, which was less anticipated, came more from a managerial perspective, in which participants advanced their understanding of how best to handle staff experiences of moral distress and of best practice in this area within healthcare institutions. Such feedback included: *’it will be good now as an organisation to take this further forward, helping others within our organisation to better understand the meaning of moral distress’*; ‘ *will advance and enhance skills in recognising what clients bring to counselling sessions*’; ‘ *Useful for clinical supervision of others*’ **\[S8\]**. The Head of Quality and Education at St Luke’s Hospice also acknowledged the significance of this training on moral distress in the increased capacity to offer targeted clinical support and training: ‘ *There is a recognition of the importance of reflective discussion around some of the moral distress situations but following the training we have a name for the feelings expressed.* \[...\] *during the pandemic we have increased the availability of supervision sessions adding drop in supervision and support sessions for all staff three times a week.* \[...\]. *In addition to this St Luke’s hospice is introducing a Human Rights training programme*’ **\[S10\]** *.*

 Morton’s research at Bath Spa University has made important contributions to the ongoing debate on the repatriation of human remains from museum collections. 

 Focusing on repatriations of ancestral human remains from The Royal College of Surgeons of England \(RCS\) as a case study, Morton’s research has impacted on practice and decision making at RCS. The Director of Museums and Special Collections at RCS stated that Morton’s research on the materiality of the remains repatriated from RCS “has been significant in stimulating conversation knowledge exchange” between RCS and other institutions \(E1\). 

 In addition to impacting on policy and practice at RCS, Morton’s research has informed wider repatriation practice and contributed to sector and public debates on restitution and decolonisation. A senior museum professional stated that Morton’s research publications “have been important for museum staff beyond \[RCS\], including for my own practice as keeper of Science and Technology at the National Museum of Scotland” \(E5\). Morton’s interviews and discussions with members of Indigenous communities in Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii have also helped to foster relationships between museums and those communities \(E2\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Morton’s research provides the first study of the histories and legacies of repatriation in the nationally and internationally significant collection of the Royal College of Surgeons of England \(RCS\), which as a leading medical institution holds a particularly high number of human remains. Morton’s RCS case study considers three key areas relevant for the museum sector worldwide: the impact of repatriation on museum landscapes; the journey of the repatriated remains; the repatriation archives’ future potential and meaning within a post\-colonial context. 

 Restitution is one of the ‘most important, yet emotive and contentious issues facing Western museums in the twenty\-first century’ \(Tythacott & Arvanitis, 2014, p1\). The repatriation of the human remains of Indigenous peoples removed within a colonial context poses particularly strong ethical questions and has been the subject of debate within UK museums over the last 30 years, with the main focus being the arguments for and against repatriation. Following the publication of DCMS ‘Guidance for the Care of Human Remains in Museums’ \(2005\), many UK museums with human remains collections have developed their own human remains policies based on the principles of respect and consultation. Yet, despite the documentation of ‘the journey home’ and of the initial impacts of repatriation, there has been little research on the longer\-term impacts of the process. Given the ongoing debates around the display of human remains and the colonial legacy of ancestral remains and material culture held in European museums, a better understanding of the legacies of the repatriation process on the different stakeholders involved is required in order to inform policy, practice and public understanding. 

 Morton’s research focuses on the repatriations from RCS to Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii to address this gap. Exploring repatriations from the significant and high\-profile collection of the Museums and Archives of the RCS both gives visibility to Morton’s research and makes it relevant for museum professionals and researchers working in wider contexts. 

###  The impact of repatriation on museum landscapes 

 Morton’s research explores the legacies of RCS repatriations between 2001 and 2011. These repatriation events consisted of returns of over 80 sets of remains to four locations: Tasmania \- Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre \(May 2002\-2009\); Australia \- Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research \(April 2003\); New Zealand \- Te Papa Tongarewa \(November 2007\); Hawaii \- Hui Malama \(September 2011\). The research made explicit the impact that Indigenous repatriation claims have had on wider UK museum practice through opening up new ways of theorising and discussing repatriation and understanding the process. Morton’s research illustrates the complexities of the repatriation process and how it intersects with issues of Indigenous land rights, health, sovereignty and politics at local, national and state levels \(R1\). 

 As well as looking in depth at the legacies of the RCS repatriations, Morton’s research has also provided analysis and a deeper understanding of the impact of repatriation on museum practice across institutions in the United Kingdom \(R2\). Through interviews with staff at the RCS, the Natural History Museum, Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Manchester Museum, and The British Museum, along with ethnographic observations, Morton’s research casts new light on the changing attitudes and practices relating to repatriation in UK museums, and demonstrates that in challenging and problematising that authority, repatriation has contributed to a re\-articulation of museum ethics, the development of new consultative approaches and the formation of new relationships \(R2\). As such, the research also highlights the ways in which an awareness of cultural sensitivities surrounding human remains and an appreciation of the multiple and shifting meanings they have, has created new networks around the collections, as museums consult on issues of care and respectful display with source communities, as well as sharing new understandings and areas of debate with museum visitors and other groups of stakeholders \(R2\). 

###  The journey of the repatriated remains 

 What the journey of the ancestral remains repatriated by RCS illustrates is the emotive materiality of the remains, and the agency they and the distributed archive have as actors in social networks. Rather than framing repatriation as a post\-colonial act, Morton makes clear it should be understood as part of a process of decolonisation in which there is space for discussion, disagreement and debate amongst all stakeholders. Her contribution to *The Routledge Companion to Indigenous Repatriation* \(R2\) focuses on the impact that repatriation has had on UK museums. Morton advocates for a more nuanced and contextually sensitive understanding that recognises the role of the human remains in social interactions that impact on the emotional geographies of museum practice. 

 Through a series of in\-depth interviews carried out with representatives from Indigenous communities, including the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Corporation, the Ngāti Te Ata, the Ngarrindjeri Regional Authority, and the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre \(R1, Appendix 1\), Morton’s research also highlights the complexities encountered once remains have been returned to their country of origin. Repatriated remains are often still stored in museums many years after their return, while communities may struggle to find burial sites and have difficulty covering the cost of burial \(R1\). Repatriation can be a unifying process that brings connection to family; however, the feelings of obligation and responsibility towards ancestral remains, expressed by many of the Indigenous people interviewed as part of Morton’s research, mean that the repatriation of ancestral remains can be practically and emotionally challenging for communities \(R1\). 

###  The repatriation archives 

 Morton’s research identified that a significant legacy of repatriation for UK museums is the documentation that museums continue to hold \(R1\). While the museum sector has engaged in much discussion about the repatriation of human remains and restitution of cultural artefacts, Morton has uncovered new understandings of the meanings, use and management of documentation once the objects to which it relates have left the collections. 

 When items are deaccessioned from the collections, copies of this information, as well as the records of the deaccessioning process itself, are gathered together to create an ‘exit file’. The exit files provided Morton with a rich and detailed source of information from which to reconstruct the history of repatriation at RCS, and were also read against the grain to explore how repatriated material was, and is, conceptualised within the museum. The process of repatriation creates a distributed archive as information is added, reconfigured in new ways, and becomes multiple and mobile \(R1\). Morton’s research has also opened up new understandings about the importance of archive material for Indigenous groups, as well as prompting new questions about how archives should be managed within museums. 

###  Overview and Dissemination 

 While Morton’s research has focused on repatriations from the RCS and other UK institutions, and provides much needed histories of particular remains and particular institutions, her findings have implications for institutions worldwide, by highlighting the need for accessible and connected repatriation archives, and by providing a conceptual framework to rethink the museum as a site of death, and develop the relational ethics of human remains and repatriation as part of an ongoing process of decolonisation. Morton has disseminated her work not only through academic publication and reports but through workshops for the museums sector and a number of open access resources, which are available to museums and communities worldwide.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Morton’s research has made important contributions to the ongoing debate on repatriation and had an impact on three key areas: policy and practice at the Royal College of Surgeons; sector practice and public understanding; fostering relationships with Indigenous communities. 

###  Impact on Policy and Practice at RCS 

 Morton has made an important contribution to RCS policy and practice relating to the impacts of the repatriations, the current and future role of the human remains still in the collections and the potential for maintaining the relationships formed as part of the return process \(E3\). The debate around repatriation tends to centre on art historical and ethnographic collections and museums; Morton’s work in the context of the RCS is significant, since it highlights the repatriation of human remains from medical collections, resulting in a widening of the discussion and opening up new issues for debate not only among curators, but also the medical and scientific stakeholders of the collection. 

 Based on Morton’s research “the records the museum holds on repatriated material became recognised, collections records were enhanced and the details of the repatriations made available to staff and trustees” \(E1\). This has allowed RCS to respond to requests for information about their current and former holdings. The Director of Museums and Special Collections at RCS stated that Morton’s research has supported the RCS to respond to requests for information about their current and former holdings: 

 An example being the evidence submitted to the Parliament of New South Wales in October 2019 in response to an enquiry about the whereabouts of the head of Pemulwuy, an Aboriginal warrior and political leader who has become a publicly recognised historical figure and subject of a high\-profile repatriation campaign. \(E1\) 

 Information from the RCS archives was also provided to National Museum Australia \(NMA\). Although this information had been returned with the ancestral remains in 2003, Morton’s research revealed that it had become separated from the remains and NMA did not have a copy and were not aware there was any further information held at RCS. As information about repatriated remains is key in being able to return them to the right community this was an important outcome of the project as it aided ongoing repatriation work. 

 Morton’s research has been used to inform collections policy and decisions. Notably, Morton presented the key project findings to the RCS Board of Trustees in 2018 to directly inform their discussion about the future display of the remains of Charles Byrne \(popularly known as the ‘Irish Giant’, whose remains were on display in the Hunterian Museum at the RCS as an example of gigantism from the early 19th century until 2018\), while her research has also impacted on wider discussions of the treatment of Charles Byrne after his death \(E4\). 

 Summarising the impact of Morton’s research, the Keeper of Science & Technology at National Museums Scotland \(former Director of Museums and Archives at the Royal College of Surgeons of England\) stated that the *Legacies of Repatriation of Human Remains* project had allowed the RCS to: 

 to enhance its knowledge base associated with the remaining non\-European collection, further develop and revise its policies on the treatment and use of human remains, and contribute to policy making and professional development within the museum sector. The project also provided resources and empirical evidence to inform future discussions around repatriation, the treatment of human remains retained within collections and the development of relations with communities to whom remains have been repatriated. \(E5\) 

 The current Head of Museum Collections at RCS stated the importance of medical museums having “the same high standards of ethics that govern medical practice more generally” and asserted that Morton’s review of past repatriation had better informed “practices related to the care, use and display of human tissue today” \(E2\). 

###  Informing Sector Practice and Public Understanding 

 Morton’s work has informed sector approaches to repatriation through participation in events and workshops, and through the contribution to open access resources. These events allowed professionals from international museums to come together “to share their experiences of caring for human remains within a museum context, share experiences of repatriation and also to discuss the use of human remains in past, present and future in research” \(E2\). 

 Morton has also taken an active role in the recent Museum Ethnographers Group \(MEG\) events *Restitution: A View from the Regions* \(July 2019; approximately 30 attendees\) and *Decolonisation at the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Brussels* \(February 2020; 6 MEG members met with 4 staff from the museum\) during which conversation between colleagues over the 3 days included restitution and repatriation. MEG are an international collective, whose members include museum professionals, academics, researchers & students, artists, activists and enthusiasts; their events focus on continual professional development for museum professionals and offer members “time to reflect” \(E7\). They have been evaluated as “tremendously rewarding…” “I’ve come away with lots of ideas for doing things back at work” \(E7\). The ongoing events on repatriation have been a place where MEG members are supported and are able to ask questions and get advice in a friendly, supportive environment. The Chair of MEG has stated that discussion and support on this subject is important: “The urgency of acknowledging and working through the colonial nature of our institutions and collections is crucial, but many are working in isolation with little, or unstable, institutional support… In other contexts there is the institutional will, coupled with anxiety over risks to funding. We feel sharing best practice and making changes collectively can help” \(E7\). Morton’s involvement in MEG events contributes to this support network. 

 Morton’s report on the legacies of the repatriation of human remains from The Royal College of Surgeons of England stands as a valuable resource, not only for the organisations involved in the research \(E3\), but also by forming part of the Museum Ethnographers Group \(MEG\) Repatriation Resource, a free, open access resource for museum professions, originating communities, research institutions and anyone interested in museums and repatriation. The resource aims to extend MEG’s “advocacy and support to museum colleagues and originating communities globally” \(E7\). In this way, Morton’s research provides new knowledge to a wide network of museum experts and has initiated new discussions about creating new models of best practice for managing archives and documentation relating to repatriation. 

 Morton’s research has also been used to inform the wider public debates around restitution and decolonisation. This has included contributing to a Higher Education Today debate in February 2017 \(E6\), which has over 1480 views on YouTube, and responding to journalists enquires about repatriation. In a contribution to an article in the Guardian on repatriation \(23<sup>rd</sup> April 2019\), which generated 538 comments from the public, Morton highlighted some of the key findings from her research, and added nuance to an often polarised debate by stating that ‘\[t\]here’s more thinking about collections from the point of view of how things were acquired and the circumstances they were taken in \[…\] people are addressing the colonial foundations of museums and challenging that” \(E6\). 

###  Fostering Relationships with Indigenous Communities 

 In addition to contributing to new knowledge and understandings of the difficulties and complexities that emerge after repatriation, the time spent by Morton in Australia and New Zealand interviewing and talking with representatives from Indigenous groups worked to “develop and foster relationships with recipient communities” \(E2\). 

 Undertaking research in Australia and New Zealand also allowed Morton to feed into the Australian Research Council Funded *Return, Reconcile, Renew* project \(2014\-2020\). She has contributed to the project publications and online resources \(E9\), which aim “to raise awareness and understanding about repatriation and assist repatriation practitioners and researchers in their efforts to bring Old People home” \(E9\). A member of the Repatriation Team at Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand's National Museum stated: 

 \[Morton’s\] work in the area of repatriation as part of the *Return Reconcile Renew* Project has been a real asset for those working in the South Pacific. Her knowledge and understanding of the collection and subsequent return of Ancestral Human Remains held in UK institutions has been an important addition to the project over all. Her work has already had an impact on museums to better understand repatriation, and will continue to do so going forward into the future, as she continues to provide the academic and museum sectors with valuable research into understanding our relationships with our Ancestors. \(E8\) 

 A senior member of the *Return, Reconcile, Renew* project stated that Morton “has used her research experience with RRR to feed into one of the key conversations to come out of the MEG events \- an increasing appreciation of the importance of the repatriation archives, particularly the recognition that these archives contain Indigenous knowledge” \(E9\). By identifying that the archives are also important records of Indigenous activism and involvement in repatriation, Morton’s research has supported an ongoing process of decolonisation by creating and sharing the repatriation archive. She was able to provide information held by RCS to Indigenous communities in Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii along with the final project report. 

 This information and the project findings have been used to support research, education and activism around repatriation. However, in order to not reinforce colonial power relations, it was not felt to be ethical to ask Indigenous communities to provide testimonials for a process that will not provide any support for that community. This follows the ethical procedures agreed from the start of the research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UCL’s Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave\-ownership \( **LBS**\) has informed and led evidence\-based discussions about the impact of colonial slavery on British society, economics, and culture. Nationally and internationally, LBS has engaged media professionals and wide public audiences in ongoing debates about slavery, economic accumulation, national identity and race through its open access website \(including a searchable database\), award\-winning documentary, co\-production and outreach activities. Underpinning discussions and policy\-making within governmental bodies and financial institutions on the subject of reparations for slavery, LBS research and collaboration have also provided innovative pedagogic tools for schoolteachers and pupils. They have changed curatorial practises in cultural and heritage organisations such as Tate Britain, fostering the public display of new narratives of race and nation in contemporary Britain. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 LBS research combines quantitative data and qualitative analysis in a body of work that re\-inscribes slavery in historical understanding of the formation of modern Britain. Launched in February 2013, the project’s major outputs, including its open access website and embedded searchable database \( [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/)\) \( **R1**\), have documented awards of compensation made by Parliament to 46,000 slave\-owners following the abolition of slavery in 1833 and traced their wider legacies in Britain. In 2014, LBS research extended to track slave\-ownership in the British Caribbean from c.1763 to abolition in 1833. Between 2014 and December 2020 the database was updated, adding 16,000 new individuals to the known universe of Caribbean slave\-owners and new data on 7,300 Caribbean estates \(each with 15 or more enslaved people\). 

 Nationally, the dominant understanding of Britain’s involvement in slavery has been that Britain was the first country to abolish the slave trade and the first to abolish slavery—an interpretation that has highlighted British commitment to liberal values including racial equality. LBS data and publications have fundamentally disrupted that pervasive narrative by demonstrating 1\) the wide scope of British investment in slave labour from the 1760s to the 1830s and 2\) the extent to which this engagement pervaded and shaped society, culture, identities and economics in Britain beyond emancipation. A major monograph co\-authored by the project team, *Legacies of British Slave\-ownership* \( **R2**\), comprehensively analyses LBS’s database of British slave\-owners and mortgagees who received state compensation for the end of slavery. Chapters by Draper show that up to 10% of British elites directly benefitted from slave\-ownership, revealing that wealth deriving from slave\-ownership was a significant stream in banking, finance, agrarian growth and industrial development. Chapters by Donington, Hall and McClelland demonstrate that the “legacies” of this slave\-ownership flowed into British commerce, politics, philanthropy, fine art collection and the built environment even as Britons worked to conceal their longstanding association with Caribbean slavery. These legacies continue to mark 21<sup>st</sup>\-century corporations, educational institutions, museums and heritage sites, shaping public understandings of race and nation in contemporary Britain \( **R2**\), \( **R3**\). 

 The LBS database \( **R1**\) showed the pervasive presence of slave\-owners across Britain not only in areas where they might be expected – London, Bristol, Liverpool – but also in areas with apparently little direct connection with the slavery business — such as Newcastle\-upon\-Tyne and north\-east England, Exeter, Devon and Pembrokeshire. The database also revealed the disproportionately large numbers of slave\-owners in Scotland, discussed by Draper in \( **R4**\). Draper’s chapter, “British Universities and Caribbean Slavery,” also examines the links between universities, “faculty members” and students as slave\-owners to demonstrate how debts to slavery are embedded within UK higher education institutions \( **R3**\). 

 Hall’s work has led to new understandings of the history of race in Britain. Her case study of Archibald Alison \(in **R5**\) shows that pro\-slavery discourse was part of a wider set of attitudes to race and the social order, nation, class and empire. Hall’s chapter in \( **R2**\) demonstrates the ways in which compensated slave\-owners wrote slave\-ownership out of their family narratives while producing highly racialised narratives of British society, culture and empire.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 LBS research has enriched and transformed evidence\-based public debate around Britain’s historic and ongoing debt to slavery. Changing the terms of that debate, LBS’s open access website and database have also expanded the range of its participants and audiences. By disrupting abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and of slavery in 1833 as, respectively, the focal point and the end point of Britain’s relationship to Caribbean slavery, LBS has challenged dominant understandings of Britons’ longstanding commitment to liberal values such as racial equality. This work has encouraged a wide range of stakeholders to acknowledge slavery’s profound and enduring effects on modern and contemporary Britain. Working with media, policy\-makers, cultural organisations, charities, educational professionals and students, LBS has stimulated new thinking about race, nation and inequality in Britain. 

 **Raising awareness of Britain’s relationship to slavery:** LBS’s award\-winning website and underlying database \( **R1**\) has been a powerful tool for research by, and engagement with, public stakeholders in the media, including social media. 1,759,811 website users in 224 countries or territories accessed this online resource between 1 August 2013 and 31 December 2020, an average of over 20,000 users per month \( **A**\). Journalists, broadcasters and members of the public have extensively used \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) to inform, report and participate in public debates on slavery, wealth and race in Britain. Peaks in website use that follow specific current events and/or media publications that draw upon LBS research have repeatedly attested to LBS resources’ broader utility for enhancing public understanding of the past. In partnership with film\-maker David Olusoga and the BBC, the LBS team made *Britain’s Forgotten Slave\-owners*, a 2\-part television programme first broadcast in 2015. Inspired by and based on LBS’s research in \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\), this programme revealed to an initial audience of \[TEXT REDACTED\] how modern Britain was built on the profits of slavery. Its July 2015 broadcast led to a spike in LBS website engagement with 227,000 users accessing \( **R1**\) that month \(compared to 6,692 in June\), demonstrating viewers’ active appetite for LBS research. The programme won the 2015 Royal Historical Society Public History Prize for Broadcasting and the 2016 Specialist Factual BAFTA award. The RHS judges commended the series for tackling “an extremely difficult subject in a measured way by showcasing new historical research,” noting that it “explains the complex economics of slavery and encourages viewers to take a better informed and more critical stance on current economic issues” \( **A**\). 

 LBS’s role in engaging and informing public understanding of the past was especially significant during British debates about statues commemorating slave\-traders and slave\-owners and the wider international Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. The LBS database \( **R1**\) and television programme \(featured on BBC iPlayer in July 2020 and still available\) were major resources informing public discussions of Britain’s relationship to slavery. Users of \( **R1**\) rose to 322,000 in June 2020 \(compared to 24,000 in May\). LBS findings were drawn on in social media, the press, and broadcasting to support arguments about individuals’ and institutions’ involvement in slavery and reveal how the legacies of slavery continue to underpin national and racial identities and experiences in Britain today. In the week following 7 June and the toppling in Bristol of the Victorian statue of the slave\-trader Edward Colston, the biggest sources of traffic to \( **R1**\) were the 74,589 referrals via Twitter and Facebook. Tweets highlighting the insights offered by the LBS database garnered substantial interactions and drove traffic to the site as the public were prompted to learn more. Booker Prize winning novelist Bernadine Evaristo shared the website and encouraged followers “To find out how slavery shaped Britain \[…\]. Enter names & you get the FACTS of post\-slavery compensation for many recognisable institutions/companies/ families who flourish today” \(435 retweets, 766 likes\). A London\-based community organiser created a thread of tweets that drew directly upon, and linked to, \( **R1**\) to highlight slave\-ownership within the ancestry of the political establishment \(over 6,200 retweets, 15,000 likes\) \( **B**\). 

 Nationally and internationally, journalists relied upon LBS research, especially \( **R1**\), to inform their reports and interpretations of BLM. In Britain alone, 26 national newspaper articles used LBS research \( **R1**\) between 7 June and 15 August 2020, including prominent articles in the *Daily Telegraph*, the *Guardian*, the *Observer*, the *Financial* *Times*, and the *Daily* *Mail* online. The *Guardian* articles were shared by online users 23,761 times. Many articles that appeared in the national press, particularly in Scotland, cited LBS research: there were 27,007 referrals to the website \( **R1**\) in these weeks. This period also saw at least 58 international news articles cite LBS research, including in *Le* *Monde* \(France\), the *New* *York* *Times* \(USA\), and *Yomiuri* *Shimbun* \(the biggest selling newspaper in Japan\). Two programmes on CBS TV and one on CNN Business featuring McClelland led to a spike in interest in \( **R1**\) in the USA. In the week beginning 9 August, there were more users in the USA \(7,111\) than in Britain \(6,002\) – the first time in the project’s history that British users were outnumbered by those from elsewhere. 

 **Reparation debates and policies:** LBS has had a palpable impact on national and international debates around the role and responsibilities of intergovernmental organisations, states, financial institutions, and universities with respect to slavery and reparations. Internationally, its research has been central to the debate over reparations among the 15 Caribbean states and dependencies within CARICOM, an organisation promoting economic integration and cooperation. The sustained campaign for reparations led by Chairman of the CARICOM Reparations Commission Sir Hilary Beckles, publicly credited as “the chief spokesman of a global movement for racial justice” \( **C**\), has drawn heavily on LBS work in mounting the case for reparations: in 2015 he “credited Draper’s research with shaping much of his own book \[ *Britain’s Black Debt*\],” which “lays out the Caribbean case for reparations” \( **C**\). In 2018, the UN commissioned Draper as an author of \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) to write a report, *Some Potential Lessons from the British Financial Sector's Role in Perpetuating and Ending Chattel Slavery* \( **D**\). This provided historical background for the Financial Sector Commission’s development in 2019 of an “Implementation Toolkit,” a set of practical tools and initiatives to accelerate action by the sector in combatting this modern USD150,000,000,000 industry affecting 40,300,000 people. In June 2020, the Bank of England apologised for the involvement of some of its past governors and directors in the slave trade, and pledged to remove all statues and paintings of them from public display in its headquarters. Reports of this decision, such as in the *Financial Times* \(19 June 2020\), explicitly linked LBS to the Bank’s decision. In 2020 Greene King, one of the largest of the UK’s pub chains and Lloyd's of London, the insurance firm, both committed to pay large sums to Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) communities after their roles in the slave trade were highlighted by *Daily Telegraph* investigations using \( **R1,R4**\). Responding to LBS research, five universities—Bristol, Cambridge, Glasgow, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent—have investigated their historical links with slavery, an imperative articulated in \( **E**\). As *The Economist* reported in 2020, LBS research “has been critical in pushing institutions, in higher education and beyond, to look into how they benefited from slavery and the slave economy.” The University of Glasgow’s 2018 report, “Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow,” makes 37 references to \( **R1**\). It resulted in the university’s 2019 commitment to establishing a Glasgow\-Caribbean Centre for Development Research with the University of the West Indies, investing £20 million over the next 20 years \( **E**\). 

 **Impacts on Schools, Pupils and Teachers:** LBS research has made a significant contribution to school\-teaching through the development of new pedagogic materials, co\-produced with pupils and teachers, and public engagement activities with UK archives, schools and charities.  With Hackney Archives and two local schools, LBS implemented the Local Roots/Global Routes project in 2015, which facilitated the co\-creation of a Key Stage 3 resource concerning the historic links between Hackney and transatlantic slavery. This was clearly a transformative experience for pupils of African\-Caribbean heritage: one student told LBS that taking part “was for me mental reparations; it repaired me mentally.” In 2015 and 2016, LBS ran work experience weeks for twelve BAME pupils from City and Islington College. The students contributed to the LBS database and learned “how slavery was intertwined with the development of Britain as a nation and how its legacies…can be recognised today,” of which they had been previously unaware \( **F**\). 

 LBS also contributed a section to the Runnymede Trust’s online “Our Migration Story” teaching and learning resource \(launched in 2016\), which showcases the often untold stories of the generations of migrants who came to and shaped the British Isles. OCR and AQA exam boards recommend “Our Migration Story” as a key resource for teaching GCSE history modules on migration, taken by a total of 11,615 students in 2019\-20. The LBS page introduces Britain’s links to slavery and the African diaspora, using \( **R1**\) to structure a student activity to facilitate discovering local connections to the slave trade and received 2,418 views in the impact period \( **G**\). Collaborating with the Historical Association, LBS established and helped staff a Teacher Fellowship \( **HATF**\) to train a cadre of schoolteachers able to inspire colleagues in their own disciplines. In April\-July 2019, 17 UK schoolteachers participated in this professional development scheme. Using LBS research \( **R1, R2**\), they explored how best to teach Britain's complex entanglement in slavery and abolition, and its legacies. Working with Draper and Donington, teachers developed new resources and lesson plans, as well as 14 working principles for future best practise when teaching this subject, which were adopted by the Historical Association in 2019 \( **G**\). The benefit of this “transformative experience” extended beyond the workplace, “this Fellowship was a profoundly important part of my development, not just as a history teacher, but as a citizen of the United Kingdom, coming to terms with this country’s past” \( **G**\). 

 **Cultural institutions and curation:** LBS has worked with major cultural entities to reframe and re\-present the UK’s national narratives surrounding slavery. Many cultural and heritage organisations rely on Oxford University Press’s *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography \( **ODNB**\)* as a key, authoritative reference tool for framing of the national story for public audiences. From 2016, *ODNB* collaborated with LBS to commission and publish 35 new entries for slave\-owners \(of which LBS members wrote 15\) and to amend hundreds more to reflect the LBS data, changing and enlarging the national narrative to recognise Britain’s extended histories of slavery \( **H**\). Informed by LBS research, Tate Britain, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have begun a systematic and comprehensive accounting of the legacies of slave\-ownership in their collections of British art. LBS searchable data \(from **R1**\) and collaboration were fundamental to each of these initiatives. Each of the galleries is identifying links between artists and works in their collections and slave\-ownership in order to re\-present the material in their public displays. At the Tate’s request, LBS developed a public statement on the connections of the Gallery to slavery, which was published on the Gallery’s website in 2019. The Head of Research at the Tate writes that LBS “has had a profound impact on Tate’s efforts to account for the legacies of slave\-ownership both in relation to the national collection and the institution’s history” \( **I**\). LBS has also had major impact on the work of both the National Trust for England & Wales and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust's September 2020 report on the links between colonialism, slavery and properties in its care cited LBS work \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) in its main text and in 29 endnotes, thanking the LBS team for their assistance in its acknowledgements. The National Trust for Scotland's work on addressing the legacy of slavery and empire in its properties amply registers the importance of LBS. The Project Leader for Facing Our Past states that “the real game\-changer for all of us has been this amazing website called the Legacies of British Slave\-ownership” \( **J**\). Providing both high\-calibre, open access data and scholarly expertise on histories of slavery, LBS research has provided cultural organisations and wider publics powerful new resources for navigating contested heritage debates and policies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at University of Lincoln has contributed to international practices of conflict prevention and shaping the national curriculum in Rwanda through applied performance practice\-as\-research. The research has had wide\-ranging impacts on international practices of conflict prevention; public awareness and understanding of conflict issues; public access to and participation in political processes; the design and delivery of school curricula and new extra\-curricular opportunities for young people; the inspiration, creation and support of new forms of artistic and social expression \(particularly in performance art\); and the integration of participatory practices as a teaching and learning method in the UK and abroad. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The impacts described here arise from research conducted by Professor Ananda Breed since joining the University of Lincoln in January 2018. Breed works both nationally and internationally as an applied performance practitioner and researcher, contributing to several important projects exploring the relationship between participatory art and peacebuilding processes. Breed served as Co\-Investigator on the £2M AHRC GCRF Network Plus ‘Changing the Story: building inclusive societies with and for young people in 5 post conflict countries’ *\(NB grant confirmed Oct 2017, research commencing 2018\).* She implemented a critical review pilot project entitled ‘Mobile Arts for Peace’ \(MAP\) working with partners University of Leeds, Rwanda Education Board \(REB\) and the Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace \(IRDP\) alongside five schools in the Eastern Province. This project received £100,000 AHRC GCRF funding for project ‘Ubwuzu: Shaping the Rwandan National Curriculum through Arts’ to extend the initial pilot project to the other four provinces \(Western, Northern, Southern, Kigali\) reaching 25 schools in total \(2018\-20\). In January 2020, Breed was awarded as Principal Investigator of a £2M AHRC GCRF Network Plus project to extend her research and its impact to three additional countries including Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia and Nepal. This AHRC GCRF Network Plus project ‘Mobile Arts for Peace: Informing the National Curriculum and Youth Policy for Peacebuilding in Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Indonesia, and Nepal’ 2020\-24. \( [https://map.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/](https://map.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/)\) includes 8 Co\-Investigators and 22 partnering organisations. 

 Across this work, Breed’s research investigates the relationship of underlying collective or ‘public transcripts’ and personal or ‘hidden’ transcripts to socio\-political contexts of conflict \[3.1\] working with local communities to identify how cultural forms can be adapted for dialogic purposes and to stage possible solutions to conflict issues. Breed's research has developed arts\-based methods that: a\) help communities and individuals forge peace\-building initiatives in post\-conflict countries \[3.2 and 3.3\]; b\) engage young people in peace\-building strategies after conflict and trauma; and c\) develop policy and knowledge\-exchange partnerships co\-led by countries affected by conflict and trauma \[3.4\]. Through MAP, Breed’s research has underpinned practice\-based initiatives in post\-genocide Rwanda. Notably, Breed’s research responded to the UNESCO Rwanda 2017 report \(‘Diversity of Cultural Expressions’\) to inform the subject of Music, Dance and Drama in primary and secondary schools in Rwanda. 

 This research has contributed new knowledge about how embodied local discourses may inform or counter hegemonic or national constructions of post\-conflict identity formation. It responds to wider international debates concerning participatory practices for conflict prevention. Breed developed this specific approach through her consultation with artists, educators, young people, academics and CSO workers to adapt local games and performance traditions into applied practices for dialogic purposes \[3.2\]. Her research exploring the use of the arts in post\-conflict contexts yielded several notable publications \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Breed's underpinning research focuses on the relationship between applied performance practice\-as\-research and international practices of conflict prevention. Her research has delivered measurable and sustainable benefits for peacebuilding initiatives and civil society organizations \(Institute for Research and Dialogue for Peace, Kwetu Film Institute, and Uyisenga Ni Imanzi\) in all five provinces in Rwanda. Many of the broad benefits of the research are described in two Kwetu documentaries about the impact of Breed’s methodology in Rwanda **\[5.1\].** 

 More specifically this research has had demonstrable national impact through underpinning the development of: \(a\) subject provision for Music, Dance and Drama and Peace Education within Rwanda's National Curriculum Framework; \(b\) MAP activities which, to date, have supported the teaching practice of over 479 educators and worked with 9,682 Rwandan young people **\[5.2\]**; and \(c\) a Youth Advisory Board \(2019\) composed of youth representatives from each province to make recommendations for Rwanda’s Curriculum Framework. Between 2018\-2020, MAP was the Rwandan strand for the GCRF ‘Changing the Story' Project \(University of Leeds\). As a result of the listed impacts below, Breed has been awarded a £2M GCRF award \(2020\-24\) to expand MAP to three additional ODA countries: Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, and Nepal. 

 **Development of MAP Curriculum and contribution to Rwandan National Curriculum** 

 Breed conducted the pilot project for MAP in Rwanda's Eastern Province, which extended to the other four provinces \(Western, Northern, Southern, Kigali\). Applied performance is new to this region, and MAP adult trainers report in personal testimonials that MAP’s participatory techniques have ' *enriched teachers' communication skills and leadership skills'* and had a ' *huge impact*' on teachers ‘ *using \[MAP\] methodologies in teaching and learning processes*' in schools across all five provinces of Rwanda **\[5.3\].** 

 In 2020, the University of Rwanda commissioned a critical review report that concluded that MAP has demonstrably ' *contributed to the academic achievement of students and raised their leadership skills*' and that MAP has ' *contributed greatly to conflict resolution among students in schools'* **\[5.2\].** The report cited testimonials from MAP trainers who commented that using MAP techniques in their classrooms had increased their confidence as teachers and enhanced the ' *motivation*', ' *critical thinking*', and ' *discipline of learners'* **\[5.2 & 5.3\].** Breed's contributions to teaching and school resources in all five Rwandan provinces include a curriculum manual, cultural arts workshops, training of trainer workshops, youth camps, and establishment of MAP clubs and arts\-based electives within schools. The Rwanda Education Board has recognized the benefits of MAP's participatory approaches as addressing the need for a national curriculum in Music, Dance and Drama in Rwanda. The Director of the IRDP, notes that Breed led a productive ' *partnership with Rwanda Education Board \(REB\) and College of Education, University of Rwanda for MAP to provide both formal and informal routes to inform the national curriculum'* **\[5.4\].** REB's endorsement of the MAP curriculum ensured the sustainability of MAP training and methodology in Rwanda. The Director General from REB noted *‘Breed has served as an exemplary researcher, trainer and consultant to inform the National Curriculum through informal and formal mechanisms working alongside partnering organisations…Breed has sought to serve an existing need; to inform the National Curriculum in the subject of Music, Dance and Drama alongside Peace Education.’* **\[5.5\].** 

 **Integration of interdisciplinary participatory arts into peacebuilding initiatives** 

 Leading civil society organisations including the IRDP, Kwetu Film Institute and Uyisenga Ni Imanzi, noted the importance of Breed's work in enhancing dialogue and peacebuilding initiatives **\[5.1, 5.4, 5.6. 5.7\].** Uyisenga Ni Imanzi is an organization that provides support to orphan\-headed households in Rwanda and its Director, Chaste Uwihoreye, recognizes that MAP has demonstrably improved the organisation's understanding of ' *how young people can play an active part in research, policy and community\-building'.* Uwihoreye notes that MAP has provided Uyisenga Ni Imanzi *'with a clearer understanding of the strategic steps which we could take to generate new opportunities for youth\-led community dialogue that could provide opportunities to address trauma and conflict resolution'* **\[5.7\]** Similarly, Breed's focus on local Rwandan cultural forms within applied performance has provided teachers with exceptional participatory resources that connect Rwandan cultural heritages to psychosocial initiatives. IDRP's testimonial affirmed that MAP ' *has achieved exceptional impact due to the curriculum design, training, and facilitation of Breed*' and has equipped teachers to ' *integrate psychosocial approaches to mental health within the design and delivery of the project, to create participatory theatre performances based on conflict issues, and to develop the role of arts for dialogue and peacebuilding*' **\[5.4\].** Through the ‘MAP at Home’ project funded by UKRI GCRF/Newton Fund \(\~£500k, 2020\-22\) Breed \(PI\) has connected the existing MAP community with leading mental health providers in Rwanda during COVID\-19, including the Rwanda Biomedical Centre and the National Rehabilitation Services. 

 **MAP Youth Advisory Board \(YAB\)** 

 MAP has demonstrably widened young people's access to, and participation in, political processes. This has occurred through the development of a Youth Advisory Board \(YAB\) to work alongside the Rwanda Arts Council and National Youth Council. The YAB has delivered policy\-informing documents related to young people's issues and problems to policymakers. According to a YAB member 'With MAP I have come to understand that art \[Music, Dance, and Drama\] plays an important role in the Rwandan society. Art \(for instance through songs\) can expose problems prevailing in Rwandan society. Art serves as an efficient means of communication' **\[5.2\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Impact has been achieved by making high\-profile physics accessible beyond academia through a multi\-strand engagement strategy. Specifically, we have: 

-  **Enhanced physics teachers’ professional practice** and influenced curricula change; 

-  **Improved the awareness of STEM subjects amongst schoolchildren**, leading to these subjects being chosen as career pathways; 

-  **Influenced artists’ creative practice** to explain complex science; 

-  **Improved engagement and reach** with the public’s understanding of physics. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Birmingham’s world\-leading research in Particle Physics and Astronomy sits at the heart of the School’s public engagement strategy. The work of five researchers underpins the impact. They are investigating the fundamental building blocks of nature \( **Particle Physics**: Lazzeroni, Nikolopoulos\), opening a new window on the universe \( **Gravitational Waves**: Freise\) and illuminating the life cycles of stars and their planets \( **Stars and Exoplanets**: Chaplin, Triaud\). 

####  **Particle physics** 

 Since the 1930s, physicists have largely explained the universe through the *Standard Model*. The final piece of this framework came with the discovery at CERN in 2012 of the Higgs boson particle, which attracted the Nobel Prize in Physics. Our physicists led key parts of the analysis that uncovered the Higgs \(Nikolopoulos\) and built part of the ATLAS experiment that detected it \[R1\]. The *Standard Model* cannot however explain everything that we know exists and we are in the forefront of efforts to search for new physics beyond it, using two major experiments at CERN, NA62 and LHCb \[R2\]. Lazzeroni leads the international NA62 collaboration. The overall portfolio underpins our programme of engagement on Particle Physics with schoolchildren \(including workshop activities\). Our experimental detector work underpins our programme deploying particle detectors in schools, which the children use to conduct their own research. 

####  **Gravitational Waves** 

 Einstein’s theory of gravity revolutionised our understanding of space and time. His theory predicted the existence of gravitational waves, created by massive objects such as colliding black holes. In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory \(LIGO\), an international collaboration we are part of, detected gravitational waves for the first time \[R3, R4\]. This discovery launched a new era in astronomy, revealing previously unseen objects in far\-away galaxies. We have led analyses in LIGO to reveal the astrophysical sources of measured signals. We are one of only three UK universities that built LIGO detector hardware \(Freise\) and this activity underpins work with an artist developing a musical synthesiser based on the detectors. Our development of the widely used gravitational wave detector design software FINESSE was critical in the construction of our gaming apps for mobile phones. 

####  **Stars and Exoplanets** 

 Stars are the building blocks of the Galaxy and provide sources of energy for creating the conditions that may support life on the planets they may host. We are a world leader in using the natural, resonant oscillations of stars \(Chaplin\) — asteroseismology — to characterise and study thousands of stars in our local solar neighbourhood \[R5\]. We use data from our own telescopes and NASA missions to reveal the otherwise hidden interiors of the Sun and stars. The resonances are due to trapped sound waves, like those of a musical instrument, and the use and interpretation of stellar oscillations and the pictures they paint of stellar interiors underpins our work with artists. We are also involved in breakthrough discoveries and studies of exoplanet systems \(Triaud\) \[R6\]. Our work with artists uses data on the characteristics and orbits of these newly discovered planets.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have improved the confidence of school teachers to teach physics and provided them with tools to do so, and we have improved the perception of STEM subjects amongst schoolchildren \(primary and secondary\) and made these subjects more accessible. We have enabled under\-represented cohorts to feel they can continue with STEM subjects in higher education, and we have enhanced public understanding of physics through collaborations with artists to facilitate improved communication of science. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Enhancing physics teachers’ professional practice and their capacity to teach physics**</ins> 

 **The way school teachers deliver physics curricula and syllabi has changed** as a result of them participating in our training programmes \(Lazzeroni\), which are underpinned by lessons and resources based our Particle Physics research \[R1, R2\]. Specifically: 

 **Over 300 primary schoolteachers from the UK, Italy and Greece delivered our lessons and resources in their schools** after we had trained them \[A, E\]. This exposed children to cutting\-edge physics research for the first time and reached around 5,000 UK children at more than 10% of primary schools in the West Midlands. Two international pilots reached around 550 children in Italy and 750 in Greece \[A, E\]. It was our dissemination of best practice in the educational literature \[H\] that led to the Italian programme, in which we trained teachers from 20 schools in collaboration with the Italian National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Research \(INFN\) \[A, E\]. The programme is in the process of being formally adopted \(from 2021/22\) as part of the teachers’ training programme at the University of Turin \[E\]. 

 **A key change which resulted from our programme was that teachers are more confident to deliver physics in lessons.** A Head Teacher in Italy said: “one of the key aspects of the program, namely the training of teachers by scientists, has been crucial in enabling the teachers to acquire a confident knowledge of the subjects” \[E\]. As a proxy indicator, of the 50 UK and Greek teachers we trained through the CERN pilot project *Playing with Protons* \[A, G\] which includes our resources, 100% said they had become more creative in their teaching methods and 80% confirmed that their confidence to deliver lessons had increased \[C\]. 

 **Our programmes have also changed how educators approach their everyday practice.** Of 900 UK secondary schoolteachers who undertook our training, around half of those surveyed said there would be visible changes in their daily teaching delivery, and 78% said they would use our resources \[C\]. This equates to changing practice at one in ten of UK secondary schools, and the majority of those in the West Midlands. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Improved the awareness of, and attitudes towards, STEM subjects among primary and secondary school pupils**</ins> 

 Perceptions of science have been positively changed for those cohorts of **primary and secondary schoolchildren in the UK and Italy who** engaged in our programmes. Specifically: 

 **Understanding, attitude and interest towards physics was promoted amongst schoolchildren** though our *World of Particles*, *Particle Physics through Visual Art* and *Particle Dance* programmes, which used activities based around play, drawing and sculpture to teach Particle Physics and our latest results at CERN \[R1, R2\]. This is bridging the gap between making science physically accessible, and understandable and relevant, which is essential to capturing students’ interest during their education. These engagements improved levels of understanding of physics, shown by the fact that of 595 primary schoolchildren at 17 UK schools who participated in *World of Particles*, 90% reported that they had spoken to their family about what they had learnt and 95% were able to correctly recall information taught on the programme over a month later \[C\]. *World of Particles* was developed with the Ogden Trust, supported by a prestigious STFC Public Engagement Fellowship \(Lazzeroni\). This impact was recognised through the award of the 2019 Institute of Physics *Lise Meitner Medal and Prize* to Lazzeroni for “her exceptional innovation and leadership in making contemporary Particle Physics accessible to a large and diverse audience.” 

 The programmes have **made physics a more accessible subject** \[H\], with more than three quarters of the 200 children who took part in the *Particle Physics through Visual Art* and *Particle Dance* workshops confirming this. Nikolopoulos won the inaugural *ERC Public Engagement with Research Award* \(2020\) for this “impact on people that are not the regular audience for frontier science.” Children’s interest in science has also improved through their participation in the programme, with 93% of the 595 UK children and 75% of the 550 Italian children who took part reporting that they were more interested in science than before \[A, C, E\]. 

 **We have made** **studying STEM subjects at university and pursuing a career in science more attractive for secondary school students**, especially for women and for those from disadvantaged groups. We did this through our student\-led research programme \[A, C, E, G\] where schoolchildren used particle detectors \[R1, R2\] from the European HiSPARC Project to perform their own research. We engaged 1,650 children in 13 regional schools. 90% of the 2015 cohort who were surveyed in detail decided to pursue science in Higher Education compared to fewer than 10% considering this before \[C, E\]. Half of the schools are from deprived areas, with a quarter in the most deprived decile \[A\]. Ensuring that students from these backgrounds, who tend to lack science capital, have opportunities to engage further in this area is important in terms of its contribution to diversification in STEM subjects. Around half of this cohort were female students, who are also less likely to study a STEM subject at university or enter a STEM career than their male counterparts; enhancing their understanding and enthusiasm for science subjects is vital to ensuring that the field is more inclusive. To give an example, one HiSPARC year\-group from Bordesley Green Girls School in an under\-privileged area of Birmingham presented their work at a Royal Society Summer Exhibition. Their teacher said “some were mistaken for undergraduates and offered jobs\!” \[E\]. This change in attitudes was also seen among those on the *Particle Physics through Visual Art* workshops, of which 33% reported being more likely to study physics at university than they were before the activity \[H\]. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Influencing artists’ creative practice to explain complex science and improve their audience reach**</ins> 

 **New ways of thinking among artists have been generated** through our co\-production of exhibitions, performances and events \[A, E\]. Working with artists who employ sound, dance, opera, photography, film and technology, our PHYART@UoB programme produced **new forms of artistic expression** — inspired by and incorporating all areas of the underpinning research \(Chaplin \[lead\], Triaud, Nikolopoulos and Freise\) \[R1–R6\] — and ultimately **enabled the artists to reach audiences in new settings** \[A, C\]. One artist said that working together had “fostered new relationships and platforms to share the work”, while another stated that “sharing ideas with direct feedback and applying them directly afterwards allowed for richer and creative compositions” \[E\]. Key examples of this extended audience reach are the presence of our collaborative work at science museums \(Thinktank, Birmingham; We The Curious, Bristol\) and science festivals \(e.g. Oxford IF\) with a combined audience of almost 14,000 \[A\] who otherwise may not have engaged with this novel interconnection of art and science. 

 These collaborations, which benefit both science and the arts, have been **identified as exemplars of best practice** in the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement’s \(NCCPE\) consultation and report on how researchers and artists can work together to engage the public with research \[G\]; and in the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) *Cultural Value Project*, which looked at why the arts and culture matter and how we capture the effects that they have \[G\]. That this has enhanced creativity within the STEM field is evident through *Wire* music magazine’s review of our work with artist Devine, which stated it “reminds you that it’s still possible to factor in human imagination and physical presence into our understanding of the universe, something that’s missing from so many other big data projects” \[F\]. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Improving the public’s engagement and understanding of physics and extending its reach**</ins> 

 **Public audiences’ perceptions of physics have changed** through their engagement with our research \[R1–R6; C, E\], especially around how art and science can intersect to better communicate science. This has enabled members of the public to make new connections between physics and the world around them \(90% of those surveyed \[C\]\) and changed their views on how artists and scientists can work together to communicate science \(>90% \[C\]\). Audiences we interviewed at our public events said they had learned new ideas \(98% \[C\]\) and more than 80% wanted to find out more and would continue to talk and think about the event they attended. These changed perceptions help citizens appreciate and value the relevance of STEM science to their everyday lives, which is important given the vital contribution of STEM to the prosperity of society. 

 Our work with artists has been picked up in the mainstream media, which enabled this change in perception to reach millions more people. This includes popular Channel 4 programme *Gogglebox* featuring a BBC news segment on our asteroseismology research \[R5\] — including turning stellar oscillations data into sound, which underpins our work with artists Devine and Robson — that reached millions of people \[B\], as well as multiple BBC radio programmes featuring our work \[B\]. One presenter stated “what a totally astounding, amazing project.” 

 We used a range of approaches to achieve this and extend the reach to alternative audiences, including: 

-  Co\-productions with artists as part of our PHYART@UoB programme \[A, E\], which engaged 15,000 people at live performances and exhibitions \[A\]; 

-  Developing and making available gaming apps for mobile phones, based on gravitational wave detectors \[R3, R4\], which have been downloaded by the public almost 40,000 times and one game completed more than 15,000 times \[D\]. Freise was awarded the 2017 *Education and Outreach Award* by the LIGO collaboration in recognition of his pioneering efforts in creating LIGO\-oriented interactive educational applications; 

-  Traditional forms of engagement, demonstrating particle and gravitational waves detectors \[R1–R4\] at Royal Society Summer Exhibitions \(2014–2017\) and other national science festivals, to a total audience of over 130,000 \[A\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Acute myeloid leukaemia \(AML\) is a common, aggressive and frequently fatal blood cancer. King’s College London has led a programme to develop and implement highly sensitive molecular tests in patients. These allow precise measurement of treatment response and thus allow therapy to be more appropriately tailored to individual patients \(“molecularly guided therapy”\). Our work has \(a\) led to changes in national clinical practice and international treatment guidelines \(b\) reduced the number of patients requiring bone marrow transplant \(a highly toxic and expensive procedure\) \(c\) allowed earlier detection and treatment of relapse, resulting in improved survival and quality of life for patients with this blood cancer and \(d\) paved the way for innovative clinical trials which are likely to further improve survival and quality of life in the future. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 AML is an aggressive form of blood cancer diagnosed in \~3000 individuals each year in the UK and \~18,000 across Europe. Currently, fewer than half of AML patients survive for more than two years after diagnosis: the leading causes of death are disease relapse and side effects of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. King’s ground\-breaking programme of research is focussed on harnessing advanced molecular technologies to develop new diagnostic tools which can provide powerful prognostic information and permit a more personalised treatment approach. Treatment can be intensified in patients identified as being at high risk of relapse, whereas those patients who are likely to be cured can be spared from the risks of undergoing unnecessary treatment **\(1\)**. These tests can also rapidly evaluate responses to experimental or novel drugs both on an individual and clinical trial population level. 

 **King’s research accurately identifies patients at risk of relapse and shows that fewer patients require risky bone marrow transplant procedures.** In a large clinical trial performed between 2009\-2014, King’s analysed 2569 samples obtained from 346 patients with AML who had undergone intensive treatment in the UK National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) AML17 trial **\(2\)**. King’s research showed that molecular assessment provided extremely powerful prognostic information: molecular measurable residual disease \(MRD\) status could split patients into two groups with dramatic differences in survival rates. Survival at 3 years was 24% for patients with, and 75% without MRD.  The MRD test also significantly outperformed traditional ways of assessing relapse risk and therefore provided a much more accurate way of deciding which patients should undergo bone marrow transplantation \(BMT\), a procedure carrying significant risks of long\-term morbidity and a 10\-20% chance of treatment\-related death.  Importantly, the findings showed that significantly fewer patients require BMT when the MRD tests are incorporated into treatment decision making. 

 **King’s identifies a group of patients at high risk of relapse after bone marrow transplantation.** Following on from this study, King’s focussed on patients with a positive MRD test and therefore a high risk of relapse and studied whether having extra treatment or changes in the transplant procedure could help overcome the risk of disease relapse. This analysis defined a threshold MRD level associated with very poor outcome, identifying patients that may benefit from further treatment prior to transplantation. Moreover, King’s researchers showed that a particular type of transplant \(called T\-replete\) was associated with improved survival in this group **\(3\)**. 

 **King’s demonstrates that sequential molecular testing accurately identifies patients destined to relapse, allowing pre\-emptive interventions to be deployed.** King’s showed that regularly repeating MRD tests after completion of treatment can reliably detect relapse in a subset of AML patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia \(APL, accounting for 10% of AML\). By incorporating molecular monitoring coupled with pre\-emptive molecularly guided salvage treatment, the rate of disease relapse was reduced from 12% to 5%. Further data generated by King’s in the NCRI AML17 study revealed that sequential monitoring also reliably predicts relapse in patients with non\-APL AML **\(2\)**. In this study, all patients with either rising MRD levels or conversion from negative to positive MRD status, went on to experience clinical disease relapse. Molecular indicators of relapse occurred in patients at a median of 3 months in advance of clinical manifestations, providing a window of time that can be exploited for the delivery of pre\-emptive interventions to prevent relapse. 

 **King’s develops a novel treatment that can eliminate molecular evidence of disease and prevent relapse.** To exploit the window for pre\-emptive intervention provided by sequential molecular testing, King’s went on to test the effectiveness of a novel, non\-intensive treatment \(venetoclax \+ cytarabine\) as molecularly guided salvage treatment. The data revealed a complete clearance of disease at the molecular level in 92% of patients treated with this combination, and 83% of these patients had prolonged disease\-free survival **\(4\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 King’s work has led to the development and widespread implementation of highly accurate prognostic tools for AML patients, allowing them to receive personalised molecularly guided treatment. This has translated into changes in clinical practice, improvement in quality of life and survival and NHS cost savings. It has also paved the way for new clinical trial designs that will evaluate the effectiveness of new treatments more quickly and more accurately. 

 **King’s research changed national clinical practice and incorporated molecular MRD assessment into international AML treatment guidelines.** Following publication of King’s landmark study in 2016 **\(2\)**, molecular assessment of MRD status has now been adopted as standard of care for therapeutic decision making in patients with AML including those treated outside clinical trials. In collaboration with Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust, these tests have been made available for routine use in the NHS and in the past year, 5799 samples have been analysed from 1440 patients **\(A\)**. This represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of AML away from a single treatment pathway towards a personalised approach in which therapy is tailored based on each individual’s response to initial therapy. 

 Beyond the UK this change in practice has been reflected in international guidelines, for example those produced by the European Leukaemia Network **\(B\)** and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network **\(C\)**. These guidelines are used by the majority of physicians treating leukaemia worldwide and NICE takes them into account as part of their decision\-making process. 

 **King’s molecularly guided therapy advances patient survival, quality of life and long\-term side effects of treatment.** Improvement in patient outcome stems from \(a\) the ability to rationally select patients for bone marrow transplantation \(BMT\) and therefore to reduce the number of patients exposed to the toxicity of this procedure and \(b\) the ability to pre\-emptively diagnose and treat relapse. 

 BMT has powerful anti\-leukaemia activity but is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Transplant\-related mortality occurs in >10% of patients and many survivors experience serious long\-term health issues particularly as a result of graft\-versus\-host disease \(GvHD\) which affects \~30% of transplant recipients. Whether to perform BMT as part of primary treatment has been controversial for many years and the decision has been based principally on risk\-factors present at the time of diagnosis and clinician preference. The molecular MRD tests developed at King’s have substantially refined outcome prediction and therefore allowed much more rational selection of patients for upfront BMT. Precise numbers on uptake have not yet been obtained since they are only published a few years after the treatment is finalised. However, the Chair of the National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) Acute Myeloid Leukaemia \(AML\) working group estimated that \~100 patients per year can safely avoid upfront BMT in the UK alone based on King’s approach **\(D.1\)**. Additionally, at least 5 patients per year would avoid transplant\-related death and \~20 avoid the long\-term morbidity associated with GvHD **\(D.1\)**. 

 Using King’s serial MRD assessment approach  after completion of treatment, patients destined to relapse can be reliably identified. Treating patients at “molecular relapse” rather than full\-blown haematological relapse has major advantages **\(D.1\)**: 

-  Rather than requiring salvage therapy, which is conducted after the patient does not respond to standard therapy, in molecular relapse this can be timed carefully or in some cases avoided altogether. An increasing proportion of patients can receive treatment for molecular relapse as an outpatient using novel therapies such as venetoclax \+ cytarabine or gilteritinib, resulting in major improvements in patient experience and quality of life. 

-  For those patients who are treated with salvage chemotherapy in hospital, those treated at molecular relapse require fewer cycles of treatment than those treated in frank haematological relapse. It is estimated that \~25 patients per year can avoid at least one cycle of salvage chemotherapy. 

-  The early detection of relapse provides extra time for the identification of optimal donors for BMT and allows patients to enter salvage treatment and BMT in much better physical condition. 

 **King’s approach presents ongoing cost savings for the NHS.** As well as being highly toxic, BMT is also a highly expensive procedure with NHS costs of approximately GBP100,000 per patient **\(D.1\)**. A reduction of 100 procedures per year therefore results in cost savings to the NHS of \~GBP10,000,000 annually. Treatment at the time of molecular relapse also results in a substantial reduction in healthcare resource use compared to treatment at frank haematological relapse. It has been estimated that 25 cycles of salvage chemotherapy are avoided each year by exploiting molecular monitoring which results in a saving of 800 bed\-days as well as the associated antibiotic and blood product usage **\(D.1\)**. 

 **King’s led the development of emergency national guidelines and temporary new drug commissioning during the COVID\-19 pandemic.** During the peak of the COVID\-19 pandemic it was unsafe to treat AML patients with intensive chemotherapy due to the high rates of fatality following infection, and it was desirable to reduce pressure on NHS bed occupancy. Based on their knowledge of molecular responses to novel therapies in different patient subgroups, King’s researchers led the rapid development of national treatment guidelines based on the use of new drugs. This guideline was first published in late March 2020 and was updated every few weeks **\(E\)**. 

 Some of the recommended new treatments relied on the use of drugs which had not yet been approved for use in the NHS. Therefore in parallel to developing the treatment guideline, King’s played a pivotal role in urgent discussions with both pharmaceutical industry partners and NHS England which led to a rapid and major change in policy to supply two novel agents \(gilteritinib and venetoclax\) across the NHS from April 2020 for defined patient groups for the duration of the pandemic **\(D\)**. 

 **National guidelines and drug availability developed by King’s were highly valued by clinicians and patients throughout the UK.** An example of this is confirmed by a Consultant Haematologist at Blackpool Victoria Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in charge of a patient with AML who had an early relapse three months after the end of treatment **\(F\)**: “As we identified that he had low level disease, we did not feel the need to step in with intensive chemotherapy like Flag\-Ida. He therefore was able to be started on molecularly targeted treatment in the form of gilteritinib, a novel FLT3 inhibitor that has recently been approved for use. \(…\) This is worlds apart from Flag\-Ida chemotherapy which would have required intensive inpatient treatment, with significant immunosuppression and significant risk of developing COVID. This all occurred during the height of the pandemic. I am delighted to say that he went into a second molecular remission following treatment with gilteritinib. He therefore was entirely well going into an allogeneic transplant as result of this targeted therapy. All of this could not have been achieved without the help and dedication from yourself, your laboratory and your colleges. I feel this represents truly cutting\-edge treatment for acute leukaemia that is unrivalled anywhere else in Europe or indeed the world. I feel myself very fortunate to have your support and expertise on the laboratory side to help and inform my clinical decision making *.”* 

 Another example of this is verified by a Consultant Haematologist at Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust Foundation St James’s Institute of Oncology **\(G\)** who expressed how the guidelines during the COVID\-19 pandemic have been extremely helpful to him and his colleagues: “Just writing to thank you for your help recently with the management of AML and MDS patients, specifically regarding the advised changes to management during the COVID\-19 pandemic to try reduce the amount of time patients are both in hospital and neutropenic but at the same time balancing that with therapies that still provide excellent responses. \(...\) This has been very helpful in terms of treating patients who have molecular relapses before they get full blown relapses and for those with molecular persistence of disease markers and has also impacted in an extremely positive way the treatment pathways we are now able to offer patients.” 

 As of October 2020, over 350 patients have been treated using these drugs and King’s is leading the collection of real\-world outcome data which will inform practice in the future, including in the event of further COVID\-19 waves **\(H\)**. 

 **King’s research paved the way for the development of novel trial designs which evaluate new drugs more quickly and accurately.** Incorporation of molecular MRD measurement has provided substantial added value to the UK national AML clinical trials, allowing better understanding of effects of new treatments **\(I\)**. Molecular MRD status is now increasingly used as an endpoint for clinical trials because it provides a rapid read\-out of treatment efficacy, while being highly correlated with traditional outcome measures such as relapse and death. King’s research on MRD assessments during and following therapy have become a key element of risk stratification in many other types of AML and have been integrated into the trials to guide therapy, predict outcome and monitor for relapse. The Chief Investigator of the NCRI AML17, AML18 and AML19 trials confirms that King’s “has been pivotal in pioneering this programme, its integration into the clinical trials and establishing MRD monitoring as a national standard of care. It is the only lab performing this work for the trials and provides a national clinical advisory service on the interpretation of the results **\(I\)**.” 

 This has led to the development of new trial designs where patients with molecular evidence of treatment failure are pre\-emptively switched to alternative therapy but still counted as a failure event for the trial endpoint.  An example of this design is the VICTOR trial \(Venetoclax or Intensive Chemotherapy for the Treatment Of favourable Risk AML, EudraCT 2020\-000273\-24\) **\(D.1\)**. This trial, which is being led by King’s, is testing an original outpatient\-based non\-intensive treatment against standard intensive chemotherapy. Molecular MRD status is used as the primary endpoint to assess efficacy of the new combination but is also used to switch patients failing this less intensive treatment back onto standard therapy thus allowing treatment de\-escalation to be safely tested without putting patients at risk of relapse. This has substantial potential benefits to patients and the NHS in terms of quality of life and resource use. 

 A participant from the AML17 clinical trial and patient ambassador for Blood Cancer UK said: “I am particularly excited to be involved in the VICTOR trial which I think could offer real hope for older, less fit AML patients who might otherwise be only eligible for palliative care. Venetoclax really does seem to be offering hope for kinder, less damaging treatment. Although I remain in remission almost five years on from my transplant, I am still living with the side effects of my treatment. New drugs like Venetoclax offer real hope for successful treatment without resulting in long lasting side effects. I am very proud to be involved and support the work of Dr Dillon and his team and the AML working group **\(J\).** *”*

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The collapse of the real estate bubble between 2007 to 2009 led to one of the longest and deepest recessions in modern history. As a result of research undertaken at Lancaster University Management School \(LUMS\) into the real estate market, policymakers and the general public are now equipped with comprehensive indicators to monitor risks and financial stability in the UK and international housing markets. The methods and indicators produced by the research team on a regular basis are freely available to the public at two online portals: the International Housing Observatory \(IHO\) *,* in collaboration with a USA policymaking institution, and the UK Housing Observatory. These tools are used by central banks to enhance decision\-making regarding macroprudential policies. They have also become part of the toolkit taught in training programs aimed at practitioners from central banks and regulatory authorities from around the world. In addition, the methods and indicators have been employed on numerous occasions as an internationally recognised benchmark to inform the debate about the impact of house prices on households and on financial stability. 
","
 **2.** Underpinning research 

 Pavlidis and Paya’s research has contributed to the development of methods for analysing asset price deviations from fundamental values that can signal exuberance and potential downside risk in asset markets and economic uncertainty that constitutes a key determinant of macroeconomic fluctuations that can amplify recessions. Although the methods are valid for any asset class, the empirical contribution has focused on the housing market due to its importance in the overall economic system: “A house is the most valuable thing many people will ever own… Mortgages are the greatest source of debt for households in the UK… Mortgage lending is also the main activity for banks, which in itself makes it a risk to the UK banking system,” \( [Bank of England \(BoE\)](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/whats-the-bank-of-englands-role-in-the-housing-market)\). The research has advanced understanding of the contribution of the housing market to systemic risk, and the dynamics of house prices in the UK and abroad. 

 Asset Prices and Financial Stability 

 The last four decades have been characterised by prolonged build\-ups and sharp collapses in asset markets in the industrialised and developing world. Accordingly, policymakers have increasingly addressed the potential role of central banks and prudential regulatory agencies in preventing financial instability \(e.g., the creation of the Financial Policy Committee by the BoE\). In \[R1\] and \[R2\], Pavlidis and Paya \(with Peel\) developed novel methods for detecting speculative bubbles applicable to any asset price. These methods are attractive because they can be implemented in real time and exclusively rely on high\-frequency, readily available financial data. These features allow these methods to be employed as part of early\-warning diagnostic tests of great importance for financial stability and policymaking. 

 Housing Markets 

 Boom\-bust episodes in housing, similar to that experienced in the 2000s, cause large variations in household wealth and affect homeowner borrowing and spending abilities, which ultimately impacts financial stability and the real economy. Similarly, macroeconomic shocks and changes in financial conditions, such as credit tightening and loosening, are an important source of housing market fluctuations. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of property prices and the nature of historical episodes of property price exuberance becomes particularly important. In \[R3–R5\], Pavlidis and Paya \(with Peel and Yusupova\) developed and applied state\-of\-the\-art time series methods to detect potential risks arising from housing markets. Using international house price data from the last four decades, the research has established: \(i\) when the exuberance in domestic housing markets escalated; \(ii\) whether synchronisation across countries led to global exuberance; and \(iii\) which factors were the drivers of exuberance. 

 Following the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008, measuring and explaining systemic risk has attracted much interest. In \[R6\], LUMS research examined the role of the real estate sector in the determination of systemic risk in the UK. The research quantified for the first time the systemic risk of the housing sector and examined the role of unaffordability in its build\-up. The research provided quantitative evidence of the tail dependency \(probability of distress\) between the real estate and financial sectors. In addition, the research sheds light on the factors driving such relationships that could be leading indicators of systemic risk.

 **4.** Details of the impact 

 The research described in the previous sections led to a close relationship with the  [International House Price Database](https://www.dallasfed.org/institute/houseprice) \(IHPD\) team of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas \(FRBD\). The FRBD is one of the 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., form the USA’s system of central banks whose role is to implement monetary policy and to supervise and regulate financial institutions. Pavlidis and Paya’s collaboration with the FRBD initiated in 2014 with a joint research project on monitoring international house prices for episodes of exuberance \[R3\]. Since then, Paya and Pavlidis have been providing the IHPD team with statistics that detect and date periods of housing market exuberance for all the OECD countries. These statistics are constructed following the methods developed in \[R3\] and \[R4\] and are updated every quarter. Exuberant or explosive price behaviours may occur when house prices deviate from housing market fundamentals, so these indicators provide a useful signal of emerging misalignments and are a powerful means of market surveillance. 

 The engagement with the FRBD further developed with the launch of the  [International Housing Observatory](https://int.housing-observatory.com/) \(IHO\) in spring 2019. Pavlidis and Paya, together with a Senior Researcher from the FRBD, are the founders and co\-directors of this collaborative project that provides real\-time information of housing markets around the world. Website users can manage and work with the data that is updated regularly, and use the tools available in the portal to customise their own reports and results. Notable users include members of the European Stability Mechanism \(ESM\), the IMF, the BoE, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the European Central Bank \(ECB\), and business analysts, CEOs and Executive Directors of corporations \[S1\]. As part of the collaboration with the FRBD, Paya and Pavlidis also created the R statistical package *exuber* \(freely  [available from CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/exuber/index.html)\), which allows users to conduct their own analysis of asset market exuberance. Between 2018 and 2020, the package has been downloaded >14,000 times \[S2\]. 

 In parallel, Paya and Pavlidis developed a related but independent initiative at LUMS, the ‘ [UK Housing Observatory<ins>’</ins>](https://uk.housing-observatory.com/) which began its activities in the second quarter of 2015. This was the first freely available knowledge\-transfer online portal dedicated to the analysis of the UK real estate market. Guided by the underpinning research, the portal provides a series of indicators reflecting the state of the housing market. Apart from UK national and regional house price exuberance indicators, these include a novel house price uncertainty index \(HPU\) and a new house price index, the Housing Observatory Price Index \(HOPI\), based on all housing transactions in England since 1995. The LUMS team have made this available at the three levels of statistical territorial aggregation in the UK. Just as for the IHO, all of this information is updated every quarter and, due to the interactive nature of the portal, users can download the data and the results of the analyses for their chosen geographical area. The portal facilitates real time monitoring of domestic real estate markets at the national and regional levels and has been used as an internationally recognised benchmark by policy institutions and the media as documented below. 

 Impact on policy decision\-making 

 The new tools, indices and indicators produced on a regular basis facilitate the development of better monitoring mechanisms and more effective and proactive policies. The BoE has been looking at these indicators in their risk assessment exercises \[S3\]. 

 The international reach of the research and collaboration with the IHPD has been particularly relevant for international organisations and central banks that closely monitor developments in housing markets, as attested by the Vice President of the FRBD, “The partnership with you and your colleagues has helped inform our views about international housing markets and has been a great asset for the Dallas Fed”. He also stated that, “Developing and maintaining the database not just for internal policy purposes, but also to better inform policymakers and analysts elsewhere in the United States and around the world. Indeed, the International House Price Database is now one of the most accessed parts of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ website, and seems to be attracting more and more attention” \[S4\]. 

 This increasing attention has spread internationally among users such as macro\-database analysts and policy\-oriented organisations. In reference to the spread of this tool, as illustrated by the breadth of figures at leading financial institutions known to have been informed by the resource, a Senior Research Economist and Advisor of the FRBD and the IHPD indicated in 2018, “The impact of this resource is being greatly underestimated with these references: CBRE Econometric Advisors, Macrobond database, Quebec Finance Ministry in Canada, International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), Economic Cycle Research Institute \(ECRI\), Statistics Canada \(STATCAN\), Fannie Mae, Central Bank of Chile” \[S1\]. 

 Methods developed from the research are becoming part of the toolkit for analysing financial stability, as evidenced by their use in training programmes by the BoE's Centre for Central Banking Studies \(CCBS\) \[S5\]. The CCBS runs an extensive programme of events aimed at practitioners from central banks and regulatory authorities from around the world that facilitates the transfer of knowledge and expertise in the area. The methods are also employed by the South East Asian Central Banks \(SEACEN\) Research and Training Centre, where participants comprise mainly middle to senior level staff of the 19 SEACEN Regular Member Central Banks/Monetary Authorities. This is corroborated by their Director of Macroeconomic and Monetary Policy Management: “I continue to use the dataset and the methodology in my lectures and exercises on asset prices and bubbles. On average… about 27\-28 participants… from the 19 member central banks/monetary authorities in the region attend our courses” \[S6\]. 

 Informing the public debate on the impact of house prices on households and on financial stability 

 The financial stability indicators generated by the research have been used by mass media as academic and rigorous benchmarks to inform the public and contribute to the debate about potential financial and economic risks originating in the housing market. The UK Housing Observatory was mentioned as one of the specialist bodies warning of a possible ‘housing bubble’ in London by November 2015 \( *the Financial Times, Mail Online, Mirror, Evening Standard, This is Money, MSN*\) \[S7\].  [Quoting the Financial Times in November 2015](https://www.ft.com/content/d364168a-847a-11e5-8095-ed1a37d1e096), “Worries about over\-exuberance were further stoked when academics from Lancaster University released research arguing that London was on track to be in a house price bubble.” 

 The articles coincided with measures adopted by the UK government in the 2015 autumn budget aiming to reduce housing market risks. More recently, the team’s novel HPU index was featured in an *i News* analysis of the effects of Brexit on the housing market \[S7\]. 

 Further afield, concerns about the sustainability of prices in the housing market and the associated financial implications have been raised by the media in Canada and the USA employing the information developed from the research, i.e., the indicators supplied every quarter to the IHPD to raise awareness of potential risks in their housing markets. A series of Canadian articles published between January 2014 and April 2018 quoted/referred to the methods and indicators to stimulate a discussion about the factors driving house prices and whether prices had detached from fundamentals or not, with its associated financial risks \[S7\]. Between January 2014 and May 2020, the combined potential readership of the outlets with articles referring to the work is 115,612,656 \[S7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. received an Honorary Doctorate from Newcastle University where he delivered a powerful impromptu speech concerning the global civil\-rights struggle. This event and King’s words were lost to public memory for decades until Professor Brian Ward’s archival research enabled the episode, and the speech, to inform urgent contemporary debates about social inclusion, national/regional identity, and immigration. The research became the foundation for Freedom City 2017, a major commemorative festival that brought together 100,000 people across Tyneside and improved public awareness of the region’s cultural heritage. The research directly informed the work of organisations: it enabled Journey to Justice to expand from a Newcastle\-based pilot to social justice projects in UK 14 cities with approximately 170,000 people visiting its exhibition and educational events; and Northern Roots \(creative arts charity\) secured over GBP1,000,000 in funding to support their outreach work with displaced communities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In recent decades, the 1967 visit of Martin Luther King Jr. to Tyneside had largely disappeared from popular memory. This was symptomatic of a lack of public awareness about the deep, longstanding, and meaningful links between the African American freedom struggle and progressive politics in the North East of England. There was also little public awareness of the long history of racial, ethnic, and religious diversity of the region within which those links were forged. Ward’s multifaceted body of scholarship, which includes histories of anti\-slavery activism, migration, and transatlantic musical cultures, provides a corrective to this historical amnesia. It establishes the historical links between Britain, the US South, and the African American freedom struggle, placing popular understandings of the US South and its racial dynamics in transatlantic frameworks \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 Ward’s 2017 monograph builds on this work by providing the definitive history of King’s 1967 Tyneside visit in two respects \[ **R3**\]. First, by drawing on extensive transatlantic archival research, the monograph reconstructs the politics of the visit itself, examining Newcastle University’s decision to invite King, his acceptance, the visit itself, and the visit’s wider reception. The monograph, and its subsequent impact, are underpinned by Ward’s discovery of unknown footage of King’s impromptu speech \(British Film Institute\), which restored to the public record a lost element of King’s oratorical legacy. By ‘ *illustrating the broader international dynamics of the civil rights struggle’* \(review by *Journal of American History*, 105, 2019\), the research placed understanding of King in a wholly new setting, ‘ *employ\[ing\] a global perspective to illuminate the African American freedom struggle’* \(review by *Immigrants & Minorities*, 36, 2018\). Second, Ward contextualised King’s visit in terms of the complex history of racial, ethnic, and religious relations in North East England since the eighteenth century. By giving voice to hitherto marginalised historical figures, this monograph is an act of historical recovery. 

 Praised as ‘ *the most detailed historical account of race relations in the North East yet written’* \(review in *North East History,* 49, 2018\), it closely documents the complexity of the racial and ethnic relations in the North East, and neither romanticises Geordie tolerance nor sensationalises white working\-class racism. Instead, the historical significance of the North East as a site of global migrations and interactions is carefully delineated, and its largely unacknowledged connections to the African American freedom struggle are established, not least through analysis of visits by prominent black activists, including Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, and Muhammad Ali. 

 Ward’s research played a formative role in securing Arts Council funding \(GBP595,000\) and a US Embassy grant \(GBP30,000\) to support Freedom City 2017 \(FC2017\), and it formed the cornerstone for this city\-wide cultural festival commemorating the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of King’s visit. As a member of the FC2017 Steering Committee, Ward provided expert guidance to the strategic partners, including *Newcastle Gateshead Initiative* \(NGI\), a municipal partnership supported by *Gateshead Council;* *Newcastle City Council;* over 170 private sector organisations; and *Northern Roots* \(NR\), a major creative arts charity that works with schools, refugees and displaced communities through outreach projects focussed on roots music. Ward’s involvement with the latter, drew upon his body of work on the role music played in campaigns for social justice and racial tolerance and includes research on the influence of the US freedom struggle on the career of Eric Burdon, the Newcastle\-born singer with The Animals, the successful 1960s pop group \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. 

 Ward’s research links the neglected history of diversity in North East England to transnational traditions of progressive social activism, and re\-frames understanding of North East/British heritage within a previously undervalued transnational and multicultural context.

 In re\-assessing the deep\-rooted connections between North East England and the African American freedom struggle, Ward’s research improved understanding of an overlooked, yet integral feature of the region’s cultural heritage and informed urgent contemporary debates about social inclusion, national/regional identity, and immigration. Ward’s insights were intrinsic to the success of the major commemoration, **Freedom City 2017 \(FC2017\)**, and its lasting influence on public awareness of the region’s diverse history. Educational and creative practitioners used Ward's research to foster community engagement with local BAME \(black and minority ethnic\) history. This went on to reach beyond the initial focus of North East England to directly inform educational projects across the UK \[ **E1**, p2\]. 

 **4.1 Improved understanding and commemoration of regional BAME history** 

  

 Reflecting on the change she had witnessed since 2015, Chi Onwurah \(MP, Newcastle Central\), recalled that while growing up as a mixed\-race child on Tyneside she ‘ *simply had no knowledge*’ of the region’s connections with King and the US civil rights movement \[ **E2**\]. This experience, noted by Adam Collerton \(Co\-Director, Northern Roots, a creative arts charity\), was common throughout the North East \[ **E3**, p1\]. Yet thanks to what Onwurah called the ‘ *indispensable*’ contribution of Ward’s research, a ‘ *transformation*’ had occurred in public awareness of the region’s complex racial history, ‘ *bringing to light a lost, or at least deeply buried, history of racial, ethnic, and religious diversity*’ \[ **E2**\] **.** Northern Roots secured over GBP1,000,000 in funding ‘ *that simply would not have been forthcoming without \[Ward’s\] research and expertise*’ \[ **E3**, p3\]. This supported a range of outreach work where people participated in activities that confronted the challenges in King’s Newcastle speech: ‘ *the great and urgent problems of racism, poverty and war’.* 

 Ward’s research was praised by leading civic stakeholders as the driving force behind FC2017, a large\-scale commemorative festival \[ **E4**\]. FC2017 events ranged from exhibitions by world\-renowned contemporary artists, to the ‘Freedom on the Tyne’ production, an immersive performance where 400 volunteers and 5,000 members of the public followed global civil rights stories through the streets of Newcastle to rally at the Tyne Bridge \[ **E5**, p3\]. Approximately 100,000 people participated in the wider FC2017 programme, with approximately 30 civic, cultural, and educational partners, working across 26 venues \[ **E3**, p3\]. FC2017 received extensive media exposure from local to international news outlets \[ **E6**, listed\], showcasing what Newcastle\-Gateshead Initiative \(NGI\) described as an ‘ *exciting*’, ‘ *thought\-provoking’*, and ‘ *inspiring*’ commemorative festival \[ **E5**, p2\]. 

 NGI’s evaluation showed 88% of attendees felt more knowledgeable about King’s visit and regional BAME heritage in a broader sense \[ **E5**, p3\]. BBC News reported that activities, such as ‘ **\#MLK1967**’ \(an immersive production by award\-winning artist Jeremy Dellar that drew on Ward’s research by having King’s ‘lost’ speech read in public spaces by fifty local volunteers\), transformed popular understandings. Interviewees confirmed they were previously unaware of historic ties between Tyneside and the US civil rights movement \[ **E6**, p4\-8\]. This sense of revelation is summed up by the Lord Mayor, who explained how it was not only fascinating to think that King visited Newcastle, but thanks to Ward’s research the region is able to celebrate ‘ *the reasons why he came to our City, the only place in the UK outside of London he ever visited’* \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.2 Renewed and sustained engagement with BAME cultural heritage** 

 Ward’s key historical findings ‘ *brought Dr King’s legacy to life for a new generation*’, according to the Lord Mayor of Newcastle \[ **E4**\] and were the basis for his collaborations with a variety of cultural/educational practitioners. 

 **Journey to Justice \(JtoJ\)** is a social justice organisation that undertakes educational projects for local communities, using histories of US and UK civil rights campaigns to inspire contemporary activism. JtoJ approached Ward to serve as historical advisor for its Newcastle\-based pilot \(Spring 2015\). Approximately 3,000 visitors attended the main exhibition \[ **E1**, p3\], which used Ward’s research for content and thematic focus. Carrie Supple \(Director\) describes Ward’s input as ‘ *instrumental*’ in achieving this outcome, ‘ *his unrivalled research into the history of race relations on Tyneside \(…\) provided us with valuable insights that were otherwise unavailable*’ \[ **E1**, p2\]. Feedback from the JtoJ pilot indicated that, after attending, 80% of respondents felt more aware of the African American freedom struggle, as well as the UK’s own history of civil rights activism. Most participants stated they were inspired to learn more about other social justice campaigns. 

 Motivated by this success, JtoJ grew into a national organisation, with 375 full members and hundreds of volunteers, across 14 cities throughout the UK. Approximately 165,000 people have visited their travelling exhibition since 2015, with 6,000 attending associated arts and educational events \[ **E1**, p2\]. JtoJ continued to draw on Ward’s scholarship and expertise, utilising exhibition materials he developed for the Newcastle pilot and seeking guidance when elements of his research are relevant to specific activities **.** By providing a fresh, international perspective on the history of UK race relations, Ward’s work supported JtoJ’s ability to engage with under\-engaged, often marginalised communities, such as a project involving cross\-generational work with Bristol’s Somali community \(Feb\-Nov 2018\), which drew on Ward’s work on the North Shields Somali community in his monograph \[ **R3**; **E1**, p2\]. 

 Ward’s research benefitted the **Summerhill Trust;** a community heritage organisation dedicated to preserving the historic area of Summerhill in Newcastle \(as featured in popular BBC’ series ‘A House Through Time’\). Ward’s research into the visit of former slave and civil rights advocate Frederick Douglass, provided the Trust with ‘ *a wholly new race relations dimension’* to their work. These insights were ‘ *invaluable’* in helping the Trust to persuade Newcastle City Council of Summerhill’s significant ties to transatlantic abolitionism \[ **E7**\] **.** In February 2018, a new memorial was unveiled at 5 Summerhill Grove, where Douglass had stayed with the Richardson family, who led the campaign to formally purchase his freedom. This, along with a bronze statue of Dr King erected in 2017, illustrate a new interest in the region’s links to global struggles for racial justice, which according to Newcastle City Council, has greatly ‘ *added to the diversity of Tyneside’s commemorative landscape’* \[ **E8**\]. 

 The Summerhill Trust also utilised Ward’s research to improve community\-heritage engagement with a Douglass\-themed North Stars event \(approximately 400 attendees, November 2018\) and a permanent information installation in its community centre \(viewed by approximately 22,000 people\). The Trust believes initiatives predicated on Ward’s work have created ‘ *lasting and widespread awareness of \[their\] community’s long\-overlooked history of diversity, tolerance, and activism’* \[ **E7**\]. 

 Following the success of FC2017, **Northern Roots \(NR\)** continued to draw extensively on Ward’s research findings. These insights into contemporary North East race relations supported the development of a FC2017 legacy programme and improved NR’s educational capacity. NR explained how they have been able to secure funding totalling GBP198,500, facilitating entirely new outreach activity that promotes sustained engagement with the historical themes explored by Ward and FC2017 \[ **E3**, p2\]. This includes mentoring for refugee, black and Asian artists, and music and social justice projects with **Ouseburn Learning Trust schools** involving 665 children, plus staff and parents \[ **E3**, p8\]. Adam Collerton, Co\-Director of Northern Roots explained how Ward’s research continued to inform their work, helping ‘ *to inspire a new generation with the words and teachings of Dr King’* \[ **E3**, p3\]. 

 **Famous 4.15** Performance School used Ward’s research into Tyneside’s links to the black freedom struggle, to inform their work on \#RESPECT2018 \(an original drama\-music\-dance production about social inclusion, performed for approximately 450 people in October\-November 2018\). Audience feedback revealed impacts on the BAME community, as Founder\-Director, Katherine Monaco, observed, \#RESPECT2018 ‘ *greatly improved people’s knowledge of Tyneside’s black heritage and history of racial diversity*.’ Famous 4.15 routinely consulted Ward on performances that *‘celebrate the region’s diversity’,* demonstrating lasting impact on the organisation \[ **E9**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 An increase in physical activity by just 25% could prevent over 1.3million deaths per year around the world. In England only 17.5% of children in England meet the Chief Medical Officers’ guidelines for physical activity for health. Research by Duncan and Eyre has considered how children’s health and physical literacy can be enhanced through the development of Fundamental Movement Skills \(FMS\). Their work provided teachers, coaches and community sport\-providers with new knowledge, which has changed practices at international, national and local levels. The embedding of these improvements in guidance has helped thousands of children reach a positive trajectory for health. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Fundamental Movement Skills \(FMS\) are considered the building blocks for all forms of physical activity, comprising: locomotor, object control and stability skills. Poor FMS in childhood can impede a child’s development and lead to poor health in adulthood.  Research led by Professor Mike Duncan and Dr Emma Eyre at Coventry University has helped create a pathway for children to engage in physical activity for life through development of their FMS.</ins> 

 <ins>In 2012 and to 2015, Coventry City Council approached Duncan to find a new method to assess whether children in local schools were acquiring movement skills for Physical Education \(PE\) at the ‘optimum’ chronological milestone. Prior to 2012, data assessing the PE skills of UK children was scarce. Duncan assessed movement skills, relating to eight FMS \(including run, hop and jump\), in children from years 2–6 \(ages 6\-11\). The children’s movements were</ins> <ins>analysed</ins> <ins>using biomechanics software. Results highlighted that a child’s specific year group \(age\) influenced seven out of the eight skills, and that factors such as weight status and gender showed significant correlation with levels of mastery over different skills \(R1\). The research demonstrated how analysis of FMS attainment could be used to inform targeted interventions amongst primary school children.</ins> 

 <ins>From 2016 to 2017, the British Academy funded Duncan \(G1\) to develop the scientific understanding of the relationship between FMS, physical activity, weight status and related health indices in children \(R2\). Duncan used a storytelling activity, through a</ins> <ins>randomised</ins> <ins>control trial in 74 children aged 3\-4 years of age, to examine connections between these factors. Duncan’s research was the first investigation to evidence that combining FMS development with</ins> <ins>storytelling could enhance both language and movement capacity in early years children to a greater extent than movement or storytelling\-only interventions alone.</ins> 

 <ins>Concurrently, Duncan undertook research with the United Kingdom Strength and Conditioning Association. This assessed the safety and effectiveness of using resistance training interventions within primary school children on FMS, physical self\-efficacy and health\-related fitness. The research demonstrated the importance of developing FMS during childhood, judged against the key health\-related metrics of physical activity and weight status \(R3\).</ins> 

 <ins>From 2017 to 2020, Duncan and Eyre carried out research funded by the Ba</ins><ins>dminton World Federation \(BWF\)</ins> <ins>to examine the efficacy of</ins> <ins>a badminton\-s</ins><ins>pecific movement intervention for primary school children, t</ins><ins>he</ins> <ins>Shuttle Time</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>\(STP\),</ins> <ins>compared to traditional physical education</ins> <ins>\(G2, G3\)</ins><ins>. Using a cluster</ins> <ins>randomised</ins> <ins>design with 124 children, Duncan and Eyre evaluated FMS attainment levels before, during and after participation. The research showed that FMS development could be anchored to a specific sport rather than a generic</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>of activities, as is more common. It demonstrated that the STP was not effective in all children, as had been assumed by BWF, and raised important questions about the efficacy of ‘one\-size\-fits\-all’ interventions \(R4\).</ins> 

 <ins>Duncan’s work on FMS and the development of physical literacy amongst young people is ongoing, and he was recently invited to be lead author of an Expert Statement on FMS for children’s health on behalf of the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by Duncan and Eyre has helped provide children with the ‘tools’ to be physically active for life: improving knowledge, guiding practice, and informing policy for teachers, sports organisations and private companies. 

 <ins>Guidance for BWF Outreach</ins> 

 Launched in 2012, ‘Shuttle Time’ \(ST\) is the flagship young person’s programme of the Badminton World Federation \(BWF\) that supports its implementation in 138 countries, with over 50,000 coaches trained. In 2017 BWF approached Duncan and Eyre to measure the effectiveness of the programme with FMS. They found that ST best enhanced FMS in children below seven, but was far less effective in those aged 10 or above. As a result, FMS development was embedded for the first time within a governing body of sport’s work. BWF used the research to change the way ST was implemented, and to support ‘the further growth of the programme globally’ \(S1\). 

 BWF disseminated new guidance based on CU findings to all coaches worldwide, resulting in improved coaching knowledge and practice \(S1, 2\). Implementation guidelines now specify that ST is most effective in Key Stage 1 \(equivalent\); BWF revised ST for KS2 as a result, refocussing the programme on Fundamental Sport Skills \(rather than FMS\). The Development Director of Badminton Pan America stated that this has ‘changed thinking ‘on how they ‘use Shuttle Time to enhance children’s experiences of badminton and… help enhance children’s movement skill development’ \(S2\). 

 <ins>Enhancing FMS for Schools, Early Years and Community Sports Providers</ins> 

 Following engagement with CU researchers, since 2016 Coventry City Council have used analysis of children’s FMS to inform development of targeted interventions relating to physical literacy: schools now include child\-specific resistance exercise training in statutory PE at Key Stage 1 \(S3\). Duncan’s work has also provided an effective framework for assessments of primary PE, which are mandatory but often poorly conceptualised: schools across Warwickshire – catering for some 82,000 children \- now include FMS assessment in their standard monitoring and observation strategies for curriculum PE \(S3\). Warwickshire Education’s Integrated Disability Service also used this research to change motor\-skill and movement interventions to better enhance education opportunities for children with special educational needs, integrating speech therapy with FMS to improve language development \(S4\). 

  

 From 2015 to 2020, Duncan worked closely with one of the largest grassroots football clubs in Birmingham County FA, reaching some 1,500 junior footballers over five years. Over 30 community grassroots coaches were trained in the best ways to enhance movement and motor skills for children, and the chairman reports the ‘positive influence’ it has delivered to help develop foundation skills \(S5\), proven to benefit lifelong physical activity and health. 

 <ins>Promoting S</ins><ins>torytelling to Enhance Movement and Language</ins> 

 Research combining FMS development with storytelling activities \(R2\) informed a novel intervention designed to be practically useable by pre\-school teachers, with activities based on the popular children’s book ‘The Gruffalo’. This work was utilised as a template within teachers’ ‘INSET’ training across Warwickshire, leading to the incorporation of child\-specific resistance training and/or combined movement with storytelling in classrooms \(S3\). Schools attest to the ‘sustained impact on the physical education outcomes’ of pupils, improving ‘motor\-development related outcomes’ and the way it has helped ‘provide continuous professional development’ for teachers, improving provision \(S3\). 

 The research was also utilised by HE institutions Dublin City University \(DCU\), Mary Immaculate College \(MIC\), Limerick, and Instituto Universitário da Maia \(ISMAI\), Portugal to inform teacher education programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate level \(S6\). A Senior Lecturer from MIC notes that ‘many student teachers have adopted this practice during the school placement experiences’. At ISMAI and MIC the research was also used to inform wider community\-based programmes: for example, the findings of R2 were ‘central to changes’ in ISMAI’s ‘PETIZ’ community gymnastics programme, which ‘enhanced’ the experiences of participants, helping babies and toddlers ‘to move more effectively’ \(S6\). 

 <ins>Informing</ins> <ins>UK Government Policy</ins> 

 In 2015 the UK Government gave Sport England a new remit to support children aged 5\-14 years. SE commissioned Duncan and Eyre \(R1, R2\) to undertake a review \(completed in March 2017\) to inform the body’s response to this, and provide knowledge on childhood development. This led SE to integrate FMS into their approach. As a result from 2017 new questions related to physical literacy were included within the annual ‘Active Lives’ survey, a cross\-government decision\-making tool collecting data from 96% of English school children in years 1\-11 \(S7\). Guided by Duncan and Eyre, SE now measures the data received against key performance indicators relating to positive attitudes towards sport, physical literacy, and being active, informing the way SE assesses children’s physical development for the Government \(S7, S8 S9\). 

 <ins>Informing Commercial Development</ins> 

 In 2017 Jupiter Play, a UK\-based SME producing play equipment for children in public spaces, used Duncan’s work to adjust their strategy and ‘explicitly embed the development of FMS in the design of spaces for local communities across the UK’ \(S10\). Jupiter used the research to demonstrate FMS benefits of their product range to customers in an online campaign during the first COVID\-19 UK lockdown period \(March \- June 2020\). It ‘informed the advice, design and products supplied by Jupiter Play’ at residential sites Houlton, Rugby and Alconbury Weald, Huntingdonshire, marking the beginning of Duncan’s collaboration with largescale development company Urban&Civic plc \(S10\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In Ethiopia, the government rolled out second chance education programmes for out\-of\-school children in five regions on the basis of evidence produced by a Sussex research evaluation, which demonstrated that ‘Speed Schools’ in Ethiopia significantly reduce dropout, improve learning outcomes and enhance school completion rates. In Ghana, the government used similar research evidence to commit 1% of the basic education budget to complementary basic education targeting school dropouts. In both countries, the evidence was used to justify government adoption of second chance education programmes targeting 450,000 school dropouts to access public basic schools and address governments’ commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Achieving educational equality is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 4. The widest inequalities occur in the least developed countries, where only about 4 in 10 children complete primary education. Of all Africa’s regions, Sub\-Saharan Africa \(SSA\) has the highest rates of children who do not complete primary and lower secondary education; over 20% of 6\-11 year olds, 33% of 12\-14 year olds and almost 60% of 15\-17 year olds are out of school \(UNESCO Institute of Statistics\). Once children miss a few years of school, bringing them back is very difficult because many public school teachers lack the ability to teach to bridge these learning gaps. 

 The Centre for International Education \(CIE\) at the University of Sussex conducts research into educational inequalities and the causes and effects of school dropout in low\-income countries \[R6\]. CIE research has also focused on the production of knowledge for education policymakers in sub\-Saharan Africa \(SSA\) to improve access to quality education for all. In particular, CIE’s research \(2004\-2016\) on educational access, transitions and equity produced knowledge \[R6\] underpinned the framing of research on second chance accelerated education programmes for out\-of\-school children in Ghana and Ethiopia. 

 A CIE research programme \(2005\-2010\), the Consortium for Educational Access, Transitions and Equity \(CREATE\), analysed regional variations in educational access and participation in SSA. This showed that in much of SSA, most children who are out of school have attended school at some point but the major cause of dropout was the poor quality education many experienced in the early years of schooling. The risk of dropout was highest in the early years of primary education, where many children were ‘silently excluded’ from learning due to teachers teaching above their level \[R6\]. CREATE concluded that for public schools to deliver quality education in African contexts, it needs fundamental reconceptualisation of teaching and learning in the early years so that funds of knowledge from African children can find better and deeper expression to achieve meaningful learning and prevent school dropout \[R6\]. 

 In 2009, CIE’s two\-year Teacher Preparation in Africa research Project \(TPA\), funded by the US Hewlett and Flora Foundation, examined teacher preparation in six African countries \(Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Tanzania & Uganda\). It found that many trained teachers lacked the capacity to organise suitable learning in the early grades for many children to master basic literacy and numeracy skills, and contributed to the skills gap and school dropout \[R5\]. 

 In 2014, CIE researchers, funded by the US philanthropy consultancy company Geneva Global, studied the long\-term impact of a 10\-month second chance education programme ‘ *Speed School*’ for out\-of\-school children in Ethiopia to measure the impacts on formal primary school completion, learning outcomes, and attitudes towards learning. It found that former out\-of\-school students: 

1.  Perform consistently better than government school students for all three basic school subjects – math, Sidama and English 

1.  Are generally less likely to drop out compared to government school students who have had the same primary education 

1.  Are more likely to have aspirations to progress beyond primary education. 

 Crucially, this research revealed that the Speed School instructional approach was superior to the standard instructional practices of teachers in government schools \[R1\]. The pedagogy transformed the learning environment, enabling children who were initially unable to recognize letters to progress to reading passages in just 10 months. It found that the Speed School pedagogy was effective because it: utilised traditional group and multimodal learning methods; promoted greater collaboration in knowledge construction, linguistic expression and learner contribution to curriculum content; awakened and sustained the ability to learn among poor and marginalized children; and enabled them to repurpose learning after transition into public schools. In addition, Speed Schools achieved long\-term impact because of the use of mother\-tongue instruction and produced persistence and commitment to learn \[R1\]. 

 Subsequently CIE tested the effectiveness of another second chance complementary basic education \(CBE\) programme for Ghanaian school dropouts. This two\-year DIFD\-funded CBE research completed in October 2018, confirmed that it was possible to raise the achievement levels of previously out\-of\-school children to levels attained by children who have had four years of schooling in government schools. Many significantly outperformed their peers in government schools in literacy and numeracy skills. It also revealed \[R2, R3, R4\] that: 

1.  As in the Speed Schools, local language learning is essential for bridging the learning achievement gap for former primary school dropouts 

1.  CBE graduates developed skills, learning strategies and confidence, that they used to repurpose their education in public schools.

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

 CIE research on educational access, equity and transitions generated evidence that was used to engage key policy makers and stakeholders to influence policy and practice. Meetings held with Ministry of Education officials and key education stakeholders in both Ethiopia and Ghana discussed the significance of evidence showing how school dropouts closed basic skills gaps and successfully transitioned to public basic schools. The discussions on the evidence gave government officials confidence to introduce policies and strategies to roll out second chance education programmes for out\-of\-school children to access public basic education in both countries \[S4, S5, S6\]. 

 In Ghana, evidence from the CBE research was used to inform Ghana’s Education Strategic Plan on how to increase access to 250,000 out\-of\-school children \[S3, S4\]. Akyeampong presented evidence of the impact of CBE in Ghana to a specially convened meeting attended by the Minister of Education, his senior officials, and officials from the UK Department for International Development \(DFID\) and the US Agency for International Development \(USAID\) in September 2018. According to a senior official in Ghana’s Ministry of Education, the Sussex research “was instrumental in informing the Ministry’s policy”, directly influencing Ghana’s Education Strategic plan including the policy decision to spend 1% of the basic education budget on extending CBE to reach all out\-of\-school children \(equating to a spend of USD26,200,000 according to World Bank figures for 2018\) \[S4\], as also indicated in the press release by DFID \(now reconstituted under the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office \- FCDO\) \[S1, S2\]. 

 The British High Commission in Accra reported that the evidence from research led by “Professor Kwame Akyeampong from the University of Sussex, in collaboration with academics from the University of Cambridge, showed the importance of the government of Ghana taking forward the CBE programme to reach children from the poorest, and rural communities” \[S2, S3\]. In particular, they emphasised the findings of the research that, “after completing the CBE programme, CBE children placed in public schools \(often at P3 and P4 levels\) showed similar learning levels as children in public schools” \[S2\]. The key argument of the research was that the CBE programme was capable of meeting the learning needs of children who had dropped out of school and provided a way back into public schools. The result was new policy on second chance education to provide quality education for out\-of\-school children in Ghana \[S3\]. 

 Ghana’s Education Strategic Plan emphasised government adoption of the CBE to improve educational access for out\-of\-school children in Ghana. In November 2019, Akyeampong was invited by the Ghana Ministry of Education to present findings of the CBE research at the annual Education Evidence Week in Accra. The presentation showcased the role of mother\-tongue instruction and participatory pedagogy in improving learning in CBE schools. Evidence from the research inspired the Ministry of Education to introduce policies and reforms to ensure that all out\-of\-school children had a second chance to access quality basic education \[S3a, S3b\]. As a result of the government’s decision to increase focus on CBE in its education strategic plan, progress had been made in reducing the population of out\-of\-school children from 153,986 in 2018 to 35,432 in 2019 \[S3c\]. 

 In Ethiopia, the government adopted a second chance education programme upon the advice and support of Geneva Global, using Sussex research on Speed Schools. According to the Luminos Fund “The diligent work of Akyeampong and his team to provide robust evidence on the positive long\-term impact of the second chance program on out\-of\-school children … was used to secure commitment from the Ethiopia Ministry of Education to pursue government adoption and nationwide scale\-up of the program” \[S6\]. 

 The Ministry of Education commissioned Mekelle University in Ethiopia to confirm the Sussex findings on Speed Schools. Evidence from both was presented at a national education policy event in June 2018 \[S5\]. A senior official from the Ministry of Education said the Sussex research “contributed significantly in persuading many decision makers on the merits and usefulness of the Speed School model” and is “also influencing the country’s education system to bring about a system change … and bring about \[a\] shift in mindset of education officials and practitioners in Ethiopia” \[S5\]. 

 The model was first adopted by the Tigray Regional Education Bureau which fully financed 32 Speed School classrooms. Following this, the Ministry decided to use the Speed School model to condense the school curriculum into the national and regional curriculum frameworks and included Speed Schools in the sixth education sector development plan \(2020\-2025\) \[S5\]. Already the Oromiya region has started to set up a Speed School class in each of its 14,000 schools to help older children catch up; “just one example of the many other usages of the research to positively change the education system in the country” \[S5\]. The Ministry of Education’s investment in second chance education programmes has been seen as a key strategy in reaching 2.2 million out\-of\-school children. Starting in four regions, the programme is intended to be rolled out in other regions across the country \[S5, S6\]. 

 Sussex research continues to have influence. Over the next three years \(2020\-2023\), the Ministry of Education is taking further steps to take full ownership of Speed Schools in Ethiopia, using them as the preferred strategy for reaching out\-of\-school children throughout the country. The Ministry credits the work of Akyeampong and colleagues for this bold decision which is expected to reach over 4.7 million primary school aged children \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The challenges for ex\-offenders in finding employment are well known and hard to overcome, despite employment being one of the strongest predictors of reduced reoffending. Northumbria University’s research into programmes to support offenders, particularly the social exclusion of young offenders, identified key factors in improving their success, such as individualised rehabilitation programmes and sustained engagement through mentors. This research provided the blueprint for the practices of an independent not\-for\-profit social enterprise called The Skill Mill, in Newcastle upon Tyne from October 2013. The Skill Mill has provided direct support for 158 vulnerable young people aged 16\-18 \(around a third of those eligible\) with poor educational outcomes, experiencing unemployment or under\-employment, and who have several previous criminal justice interventions. In partnership with private and public organisations, The Skill Mill creates opportunities for education and job training in outdoor work. Engagement by this cohort with The Skill Mill has served to reduce re\-conviction rates from 72% down to 9.5%, with 75% of participants going on to find employment, education, or training opportunities. The success of the Skill Mill has led to it being rolled out across England to a further seven sites and expanded internationally to Estonia, Holland, Serbia, and the USA.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The national reoffending rate for young people is 42%. The reoffending rate for those released from prison or young offender institutions is even higher at 68%. The prevailing system of early interventions but without sustained support for these vulnerable young people is failing to deliver long term rehabilitation and contributing to high reoffending. The personal vulnerability of young offenders is often exacerbated by their social exclusion and stigma, and the absence of mid\- to long\-term support mechanisms which promote sustainable employability. Employment can significantly reduce reoffending rates over the longer term. Changes in probation and the supervision of offenders – including under the Ministry of Justices’ 2013 Transforming Rehabilitation strategy – has meant that traditional rehabilitation and reintegration approaches have relied on short\-term and impersonal, rather than trust\-based and person\-centred, support \[ **R1**\]. 

 In 2010, Newcastle Youth Offending Team \(YOT\) commissioned Northumbria University’s Department of Social Sciences to undertake a critical evaluation of the delivery and impact of Triage \- an established early diversion intervention for first\-time entrants into the criminal justice system \[ **R2**\]. This evaluation, conducted by Professor Sarah Soppitt and Dr Adele Irving, found that though the Triage method showed promise in promoting desistance, there were clear shortfalls with regards to relationship\-building, which undermined young offenders’ understanding of the process, stymied engagement, and resulted in resistance to follow\-up and restorative justice activities \[ **R2**\]. 

 Expanding these findings, subsequent research from Soppitt and colleagues at Northumbria \(including Dr Mike Long, Professor Paul Stretesky, and Professor Mike Rowe\) challenged the prevailing system and has shown that, without reform of the institutional support on offer, young offenders can become entrenched as a further marginalised group within a group which already faces significant obstacles to social and economic mobility. This in turn means that, because of their previous criminal offences, even precarious work such as zero hours’ contracts can be inaccessible thereby creating what Soppitt described as a *sub\-precariat* \[ **R3**, **R6**\]. Soppitt, Long, and Stretesky argue that this sub\-precariat constitutes a new subset within the systemic experience of precarity. These young people face an additional barrier to escaping the cycle of short\-term, unstable employment because of their criminal background. This sub\-precariat of young offenders is thus permanently excluded from the stability offered by secure employment and financial solvency support that provide resilience against reoffending \[ **R3**, **R4**\]. 

 Building on her research on the limitations of the adult probationary service and the obstacles faced by young people when they transition to adult criminal justice agencies \[ **R1**, **R4**\], Soppitt and colleagues explored similar issues in youth justice initiatives \[ **R5**\]. This research included working with educational initiatives and agencies \- who aim to tackle novel psychoactive substance misuse among young people \- in order to develop more effective intervention methods and develop enhanced ongoing support. This latter research identified that many young people who had been involved with the criminal justice system faced persistent and overwhelming barriers in accessing the labour market. Many had complex needs and chaotic lifestyles that required a more tailored approach to supporting their integration \[ **R5**\]. 

 Soppitt and the team’s research argued that trust and personal relationships are central in supporting desistance \[ **R4**\]. Even where support services were informed and engaged, and the young offenders motivated to reform, greater capacity to support individuals and the development of stable relationships with a bank of trusted employers were necessary to overcome the obstacles to employment \[ **R6**\]. In this way, the research established that the character, culture, and ethos of the programmes developed by public, private, and third\-sector organisations can provide these trusting relationships so pivotal to promoting motivation and maintaining engagement in desistance \[ **R2**\]. Soppitt and team proposed a model under which a revised and expanded supervisor role offers more personalised and sustained mentorship to support young people to address their complex and chaotic lifestyles \[ **R4**\]. This model \- carried out through The Skill Mill \- allows for a more bespoke, individualised programme of rehabilitation not offered by the current institutional framework.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The findings’ from Soppitt’s work were embedded in the programme of an independent not\-for\-profit social enterprise called The Skill Mill, set up by former members of the Newcastle YOT, using Soppitt’s research findings to create mentorship roles providing bespoke support and partnerships with local organisations to create new employment opportunities. The first Skill Mill was established in October 2013 and began trading in February 2014, with operations guided by the research of Soppitt et al. \[ **E1**\]. David Parks, Founding Director of The Skill Mill, explains: *‘It was vital that Skill Mill worked with young offenders in a way that overcame these enduring obstacles to further education and sustainable* employment’ \[ **E1**\]. Parks praised the research conducted by the Northumbria team, saying that it *'offered a clear remedy that we used to shape the governing policy and operational practices of Skill Mill’* \[ **E1**\]. The Skill Mill programme has now spread across the UK and into Estonia, Serbia, the Netherlands, and USA. 

 **4.1 Establishment of The Skill Mill's work with young people** 

 The Skill Mill works with 16\-18\-year\-olds with poor educational outcomes, experiencing unemployment or under\-employment, and who have several previous criminal justice interventions. This group represent the sub\-precariat Soppitt identified in her research as being most in need of sustained support to find employment and complete the process of rehabilitation and avoid reoffending. For example, this included 88 people under the Newcastle YOT’s jurisdiction between 2014\-2019. Some young offenders were not eligible for the Skill Mill programme due to custodial sentences being imposed or because of the sensitive nature of their offences. However, many of those eligible have taken part in The Skill Mill \- 158 participants to date \[ **E2**, p3\]. In partnership with private and public organisations, including the Environment Agency, Northumbrian Water Ltd, and Newcastle City Council, The Skill Mill provides opportunities for education and job training in outdoor work, primarily in the areas of watercourse management and horticulture. The work provides physical activity, in nature, contributing to conservation and ecology, all of which bring benefits to participants \[ **E2**, p1\-5\] **.** 

 Typically, this sort of work programme has a mentor to offender ratio of 1:15 or 1:20, however, the Skill Mill adopted a *‘more holistic mentorship role’,* of three to four offenders to one mentor, as advocated by Soppitt et al.’s research. The intensive nature of this mentor\-mentee relationships has proved vital to the continued engagement of the young offenders in the educational and employment opportunities offered by the Skill Mill. Parks states this mentorship role has *‘helped establish the Skill Mill’s strong links with trusted employers, integrated our participants into a supportive community, and offered guidance and consistency with their multiple and complex needs …and it has been instrumental in accomplishing the successes in sustained employment and increased desistance that our participants have achieved’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 **4.2 Beneficial effects of The Skill Mill on young people’s lives** 

 The volume and frequency of reoffending was significantly lower among The Skill Mill participants than a control group with similar lifestyle challenges, offending histories, and psychological support needs \[ **E3**\]. Specifically, involvement in The Skill Mill reduced the number of offences by an average of 1.12 over each three\-month period, compared to ex\-offenders in the control group \(mean offences 0.82\). In the six years that The Skill Mill has been operating, it has employed 158 young people in the UK, of whom only 15 have been re\-convicted. This means their re\-conviction rate is just 9.5%, compared to a counter\-factual of 72% for young offenders with 11\+ convictions. In addition, 75% of the young people that The Skill Mill has employed have progressed to further employment, education, or training \[ **E2**, p3\]. 

 Barry Coppinger, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cleveland, described the impact of The Skill Mill on young offenders as *‘invaluable in preventing the cycle of offending behaviour’* because they *‘give young people mentoring and qualifications*’ \[ **E2**, p5\]. Young people at The Skill Mill complete six\-months of paid work at roughly 30 hours per week and most also gain a nationally recognised qualification during their time on the programme \[ **E2**, p2\-3\]. Those completing the programme have celebrated the benefits they have gained, saying, for example, that The Skill Mill *‘gave me that massive chance to prove I’m not a criminal and I can work, I’m willing to work, and get up every morning and to do stuff for the environment*’ \[ **E2**, p5\]. An important part of The Skill Mill experience is that young ex\-offenders are able to develop a sense of civic duty that helps them become connected to their communities. They can take pride in the work they do and the positive impact it has \[ **E3**, p14\]. 

 **4.3 Changing youth offending practice across the UK: The Skill Mill approach** 

 The expanded supervisor/mentor relationship adopted by The Skill Mill from Soppitt’s’ research is crucial and that this programme can mark a critical turning point for young people \[ **E3**, p2\]. In 2016, Her Majesty’s Inspection of Probation carried out a Full Joint Inspection of Probation of Youth Offending work in Newcastle \[ **E4**\] specifically noting the relationship with Northumbria University, *‘which allowed for a rigorous and quick response to local issues*’ \[ **E4**, p24\]. The Skill Mill was noted as a good example of moving young people to employment \[ **E4**, p30\]. In April 2018, the Local Government Association produced a Youth Justice Resource pack, designed to share good practice with a national audience. When highlighting the work of The Skill Mill the pack’s authors noted, *‘The supervisor role within the Skill Mill is key, providing both a managerial and mentoring role to the young people involved in placements’* \[ **E5**, p27\]. Andy Peaden, the Chair of the Association of YOT Managers \- a body that represents over 80% of YOTs in England – confirms the importance of Soppitt’s insights: *‘The research of Soppitt and colleagues which underpins the Skill Mill activities, has been indispensable …Not only have we experienced high levels of engagement both by the young people themselves and by local partner agencies but, as a result, we are witnessing substantial reductions in local re\-offending rates’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 The success demonstrated by the evaluation of The Skill Mill cohorts \[ **E3**\] led to the development of further Skill Mill sites with a resulting shift in engagement with young offenders in Leeds \(2015\), Durham \(2017\), and North Yorkshire \(2017\) \[ **E2**, p1\]. In 2018, the UK government committed to supporting The Skill Mill in ten locations, with commentators noting that this will *‘accrue significant savings through the beneficiaries’ life course as they transition out of the criminal justice system and lead productive adult lives’* \[ **E7**\]. Five new sites were added in 2020, in Croydon, Birmingham, Nottingham, Rochdale/Bury, and Surrey \[ **E2**, p1\]. The Skill Mill’s successes in multiple cities and with multiple cohorts of young people has been recognised and recommended as an example of best practice by local and national government. Lord Taylor, shortly before becoming Chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales in March 2017, carried out a review of the Youth Justice System in England and Wales in 2016 on behalf of the Ministry of Justice \[ **E8**\]. In this report, Lord Taylor discusses the evolution of youth justice in the community and highlights The Skill Mill as one of a *‘number of innovative models for delivering youth offending services which seek to strengthen \[multi\-disciplinary links\]’* \[ **E8**, p7\]. 

 The Skill Mill has also been recognised for its contribution to tackling youth offending through being shortlisted for and winning numerous awards, including commendation from the Howard League Community Awards Restorative Justice Award 2017. It also won the Constructing Excellence Award 2016 and the Children and Young People Now Youth Justice Award, in both 2014 and 2019 \[ **E2**, p6\]. 

 **4.4 Impacts on youth offending practice in Estonia, Serbia, the Netherlands, USA** 

 In 2016, The Skill Mill expanded to Tallinn, Estonia with support from the National Civil Society Fund, an organisation which supports non\-governmental organisations through Estonian Ministry of Interior financing \[ **E3**, p16; **E9**, p2, p4\]. Further Skill Mills are also being launched through similar partnerships in the Netherlands and Serbia, with the prospective Serbian Skill Mill site confirmed as the town of Kruševac in May 2020 and the Netherlands site soon to be announced \(delayed by COVID\-19\) \[ **E2**, p9\-10\]. In the USA, the National Partnership for Juvenile Services \(NPJS\) – which supports professional development across the USA and promotes best practices and standards in the field of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention – is also adopting The Skill Mill model \[ **E10**\]. The Skill Mill has been represented at its National Symposiums for the past five years and has directly informed its training and operational practices. As Managing Director, Michael A. Jones, explains: 

 *‘This research has played a vital role in shaping some of the training we offer at the NPJS … which includes discussions around the importance of vocational skill development and the use of mentoring in improving youth engagement’* and *‘The work of Skill Mill …  is helping to shape practice procedures amongst other juvenile services in the United States and encourage them to adopt similar positive youth development approaches*’ \[ **E10**\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Robust evidence about changing patterns of disease in England was needed to inform national priorities for healthcare and funding. The Global Burden of Disease Study \(GBD\) quantifies death and disability comparably across time and place, and the University of East Anglia \(UEA\) collaboration with Public Health England and GBD innovatively extended GBD to 150 localities across England, incorporating information on deprivation. 

 The NHS Long Term Plan used the new epidemiological evidence UEA provided to set priorities for tackling the major causes of death and disease in England. These new priorities led to more equitable allocation of GBP4,500,000,000 extra NHS funding and improved care in key areas including mental health, cancer and musculoskeletal conditions. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Setting fair priorities to improve people’s heath requires accurate, timely, and credible evidence about the burden of disease. Who gets sick and dies, from what conditions, why, and where? The Global Burden of Disease \(GBD\) study based at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \(IHME\) in Seattle quantifies the burden of disease from diseases, injuries and risk factors globally. GBD metrics are years of life lost due to premature mortality \(YLLs\), years lived with disability \(YLDs\), and disability\-adjusted life\-years \(DALYs\). DALYs combine YLLs and YLDs to give the total burden from deaths and disability. 

 Public Health England \(PHE\) and IHME estimated burden of disease for each of the 9 English government regions in 2015, but directors of public health told PHE that more localised estimates of disease burden that documented health inequalities were needed to plan local services. To do this, PHE needed a GBD Fellow with an understanding of United Kingdom \(UK\) health data at local level, local public health teams, changing geographic administrative boundaries, and complex GBD methods, to be based at IHME. Professor Nicholas Steel, Professor of Public Health at UEA, was appointed through a competitive process in 2016. 

 Steel identified Upper Tier Local Authorities \(UTLA\) as the most promising areas to map burden of disease onto. Data on causes of death and disability from mortality statistics, publications, surveys, registries, and surveillance were identified. IHME modelled and rescaled cause of death estimates so that the sum of all cause\-specific deaths equalled the total number of deaths in each age, sex, location, and year category. Bayesian meta\-regression estimated YLDs whilst ensuring consistency between prevalence and death rates for each condition. A global model was passed down through geographical levels to UTLAs. Estimates for locations with few data were generated by borrowing information \(for example on prevalence\) from other locations and using covariates. This was the first time that comparable estimates of burden of disease had been generated for these small geographic areas, where they are needed by policy makers. 

 Steel and the UEA team collaborated with IHME and PHE to understand local health care contexts in order to appropriately apply and present the model outputs in figures, tables and maps. They integrated globally comparable GBD estimates with English indices of deprivation for small areas that were familiar to local policy makers. This was a key innovation that allowed direct meaningful comparison of disease burden with deprivation across 150 UTLAs for the first time. The emerging results were reviewed by the collaborating UK disease experts in an iterative process that led to checking of data sources and rerunning the statistical models as required. 

 Key findings of the research were \[Output 1\]: 

-  Non\-fatal conditions contribute an increasing share of the overall burden of disease, compared to death. The DALY rate was higher for low back and neck pain \(1,820\) than for ischaemic heart disease \(1,139\), and similar for depression \(664\) and lung cancer \(633\). As death rates decrease, people live with long\-term conditions, and the consequent demand for health care rises. Mitigating this rising burden due to non\-fatal conditions will be key to the provision of sustainable services. 

-  More than twice as many years of life were lost in the most deprived local authority \(Blackpool, 14,274 per 100,000 people\) than in the least deprived \(Wokingham, 6,888\). 

-  The top seven risk factors for premature death were smoking, poor diet, high blood pressure, obesity, alcohol and drug use, air pollution and lack of exercise. These risks are preventable, but present significant challenges in areas of multiple deprivation. This research showed for the first time that some UTLAs with high levels of both deprivation and risk factors \(for example in London\) lost fewer lives than expected, whereas others \(for example in the North West\) did worse than expected. This new finding offers direction for preventive services.

 4. Details of the impact 

 **Creating a new evidence base for priority setting in the new NHS Long Term Plan** 

 The chief executive \(CE\) of NHS England \(NHSE\) met the CE of PHE in 2018 about the developing Long Term Plan \(LTP\) for the NHS from 2019\-24. NHSE needed robust evidence on the burden of different conditions across England, and the PHE chief executive recommended the pre\-publication Lancet paper from the UEA/PHE/GBD collaboration as evidence \[Output 1\]. The paper was shared in advance with the NHSE CE \(S1i\) and followed up on release. The PHE Director of Health Improvement emailed that NHSE colleagues were impressed and wanted the NHSE CE and 200 senior NHS executives to be briefed \(S1ii\). The NHSE CE’s senior adviser emailed Steel regarding the pre\-publication of output 1 saying: ‘ *Thank you so much. It’s really excellent work, and timing couldn’t be better’* \(S1iii\). MPs and Peers discussed the LTP and UEA paper in a meeting chaired by The Health and Social Care Committee chair, and the NHSE CE requested further details \(S1iv\). The Chair of NHSE emailed: ‘ *Your data were referred to several times through the day as we worked through the complex strands of the long term plan \- many thanks…’* \(S1v\). The PHE CE wrote in ‘Public Health Matters’ that: ‘… *this GBD data … provides a solid foundation for the forthcoming vision document from Secretary of State Matt Hancock on the importance of prevention, placing good health at the heart of all policy making, and of course the opportunities of the NHS Long Term Plan*’ \(S1vi\). ‘Public Health Matters’ also commented: ‘ *The work is a partnership between PHE, the University of Washington, the University of East Anglia and many colleagues. This study is incredibly timely, providing a detailed and comprehensive picture of the health of people in the UK just at the time when it can be used to shape the forthcoming NHS long term plan*’ \(S1vii\). 

 The resulting NHS LTP \(S2\), published in January 2019, is a landmark policy document. UEA’s Lancet publication \[Output 1\] was the major evidence source underpinning the plan’s priorities \(cited eight times, S2\). This touches the lives of everyone in the UK, but especially in areas of multiple deprivation. The UEA research quantified the top risk factors for deaths in England. The LTP \(citing Output1\), states that: *‘These priorities \[smoking, poor diet, high blood pressure, obesity, and alcohol and drug use\]* *guide our renewed NHS prevention programme*’ \(p33, S2\). 

 The research identified depression as a major contributor to the burden of morbidity and quantified its relationship with deprivation. It clearly identified locations, including Blackpool, as deprived areas with particularly high disease burdens. Citing UEA research \[Output 1\], the LTP states that ‘ *Premature mortality in Blackpool, the most deprived part of the country, is twice as high as in the most affluent areas.’* It goes on to say that *‘NHS England will introduce from April 2019 more accurate assessment of need for community health and mental health services, as well as ensuring the allocations formulae are more responsive to the greatest health inequalities and unmet need in areas such as Blackpool’* \(p.39\-40, S2\). 

 The PHE Director of Health Improvement wrote that: *‘The analysis presented burden of ill health attributable to individual risk factors in each locality and therefore provided very direct evidence of the potential benefit of addressing those problems in those areas.* *The paper was therefore an ideal input to the planning and implementation of the NHS Long Term Plan, and it was recognised as such by Simon Stevens the Chief Executive of NHS England… It is probably the clearest example I have ever seen of a single paper directly influencing a planning process, leading to substantial change in services and investment in prevention*’\(S3i\). Referring to clinical priorities set out in output 1 such as cancer, mental health and stroke, the Kings Fund commented: ‘ *Perhaps* *the most striking commitments in the plan relate to a group of clinical priorities, chosen for their impact on the population’s health … These commitments will save lives and improve the lives of patients’* \(p4\-5, S3ii\) and referred to the guiding role of Steel’s research in identifying the top five risk factors as a focus for the renewed NHS Prevention programme \(p19, S3ii\). The CE of PHE wrote that ‘ *Professor Steel and the team at UEA were able to develop an analysis of GBD that was innovative and informative … the resulting paper had a considerable impact on public health practice nationally. It also clearly spoke to local audiences because of the nature of the analyses and the bespoke local messages within the data. We are certain it has helped local Councils set their priorities and make the case for spending on prevention*’ \(S3iii\). 

 **Changes to resource allocations and impact on patients and practice** 

 UEA research enabled the NHS, for the first time, to assess health problems across England in a comparable way, thereby enabling more precise targeting of funds and resources. The Chief Medical Officer \(CMO\) wrote that: ‘ *The research into burden of disease led by Professor Steel and colleagues at UEA and the associated Lancet publication played a vital and unique role in the development of the NHS Long Term Plan by Sir Simon Stevens and NHS England. It provided the evidence base for the overall strategic priorities and the redistribution of resources to areas identified as being in high need, such as mental health in inner cities. The LTP is a key living policy document for the NHS, and as Chief Medical Officer at the time I saw how the priorities that it set out, informed by this burden of disease research, have had and continue to have a lasting impact across the NHS. Examples of the impact range from reducing inequalities in funding for mental health, to raising the profile of musculoskeletal conditions, to renewing the focus on prevention of heart disease and cancer, which remain the biggest causes of death in England*’ \(S4\). 

 Financial allocations for Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) changed in 2019 to support the LTP implementation in line with the findings from UEA research, particularly around mental health and health inequalities \(S5i\). For example, to target funding to small areas with extreme inequality, The Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation \(ACRA\) changed how the standardised mortality ratio is aggregated to an overall CCG weighting. For example, this increased Blackpool CCG’s allocation by 5.13%, or GBP16,000,000 \(S5i\). To tackle needs relating to mental health, in January 2019 the NHS England Board agreed to meet the LTP commitment to increase mental health spending to GBP2,300,000,000 a year by 2023/24 \(S5ii\). ACRA improved its estimation of need, leading to increased CCG mental health resource allocations from 2019 in some coastal areas and urban centres with younger deprived populations. This additional resource has already started to increase capacity in practices and benefit patients.  For example, in Kent, the NHS used the additional funding to provide new mother and infant mental health care and launch two new street triage services in Thanet and Medway \(S6i\). Oxfordshire has implemented third sector partnerships to support young people who are hard to engage with traditional services. One family commented: ‘ *since we have had the help from RAW \[the new service\], \[name of son\] has changed for the better and it’s a pleasure to see him smiling and chatting about his sessions*’ \(S6ii\). 

 UEA research also identified cancer as a leading cause of premature mortality, and the LTP directly referenced Steel’s finding that that the slower improvement since 2010 in years\-of\-life\-lost is *‘mainly driven by distinct condition\-specific trends, predominantly in cardiovascular diseases and some cancers’* \(p56, S2\). The LTP stated that ‘ *We have therefore used these GBD findings to help frame the improvement priorities in the Long Term Plan’* \(p56, S2\). For cancer, the LTP committed to diagnosing 75% of cancers at stage 1 or 2 by 2028, and to rolling out Rapid Diagnostic Centres \(RDCs\). In response the York RDC launched in 2020 and has assessed patients through the COVID\-19 pandemic. Cancer Nurse Specialist Jo Clark said: ‘ *The RDC pathway is personalised, reduces unnecessary appointments and tests and improves delays in diagnosis. I have seen the effects that waiting for tests and results can have on patients so improving this part of the patient’s journey is such a positive step’* \(S7i\).  The new GBP70,000,000 ‘Targeted Lung Health Checks’ programme will fund 10 projects in the areas with the highest death rates from lung cancer \(S7ii\). 

 The LTP stated that its improvement priorities for the *‘biggest killers and disablers of our population*’ used ‘ *the latest epidemiological evidence’*, citing Steel *et al*. It estimated the following impacts: 

-  preventing 150,000 more heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases \(p63, S2\) 

-  55,000 more people each year will survive their cancer for at least five years \(p57, S2\). 

 **Policy impact beyond the NHS Long Term Plan:** 

 UEA research has fed directly into healthcare policy beyond the NHS LTP. For example, changes to strategy and indicators relating to musculoskeletal and mental health have been called for. In a report that cited Steel *et al* \[Output 1\] several times, the Kings Fund called for ‘ *a new strategy on health inequalities …. to reflect evidence about the growing importance of morbidity as well as mortality – especially musculoskeletal morbidity and mental health*’ \(p51, S8i\). The Public Health Outcomes Framework \(PHOF\) is used to monitor the effects of NHS and public health services on population health. Public Health England’s consultation \(p21, S8ii\) cited Steel *et al* showing that back and neck pain was the leading cause of disability, and therefore proposed a new indicator of the ‘ *Percentage reporting a long\-term musculoskeletal \(MSK\) problem’* to increase recognition and treatment. This indicator is now in PHOF 2019\-2022 \(C27, S8iii\). The CMO wrote that: ‘ *The methodological approach of combining robust comparable burden of disease estimates based on UK data, with England\-specific measures of deprivation in small geographic areas is likely to remain central to future NHS Planning, and to be a key tool in providing an evidence base for the recovery from the COVID\-19 pandemic’* \(S4\). 

 **Developing international impact** 

 Professor Steel was invited to describe this UEA research as an example of national policy impact at the World Health Organisation European Burden of Disease Network and also at workshops organised by the European Commission Joint Action on Health Information, which streamlines health information across Europe, where 40 partners in 28 countries have collaborated to share learning from this UEA research.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Despite significant advances in mobile and broadband technologies, the broadcasting of uninterrupted, high\-quality video content to thousands of smartphone or tablet devices simultaneously is constrained by limited bandwidth, capped data allowances and poor coverage. A decade of research by the Optical Networks Research Group at the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) resulted in the commercialisation of a patented video streaming technology, co\-developed with world\-leading satellite communications provider Global Invacom and the BBC. The Broadcast Wi\-Fi service, marketed as Bx\-WiFi, has delivered new commercial opportunities to Global Invacom, enabling the company to access more than half a million pounds of R&D funding, sign a licensing agreement with Italy’s national broadcaster Rai Radiotelevisione Italiana and pursue a ‘ *significant shift*’ in its strategic business direction. Both the BBC and Rai have used Bx\-WiFi to offer people an enhanced visitor experience at major arts and culture events that had not previously been possible, and the technology informed the development of new global standards for wireless broadcast services.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The UK Government’s Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review in 2018 highlighted the need to ‘deliver faster and better mobile broadband services to consumers and businesses, and to enable innovative new services for industry’. Research since 2003 by the Optical Networks Research Group has focused on the design and implementation of novel network architectures capable of processing very high volumes of data with minimal latency in order to unlock the potential of new broadband and 5G services. Led by Kourtessis, the work’s overarching aim was to develop new ways to transfer video data more efficiently and dynamically to improve the user experience. 

 In initial studies, researchers developed novel medium access control \(MAC\) protocols and algorithms for optical access networks, which allow users to access a common optical fibre communications channel. These MAC protocols delivered a significant increase in transmission bandwidth, providing users with dynamic access to very high data rates and quality of service \[ **3.1**\]. As a key partner of the EU FP7 ACCORDANCE project \[ **G1**\], UH researchers developed new protocols and dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms to support the successful integration of wireless mobile technologies within a fixed optical communications network, again expanding bandwidth \[ **3.2**\]. Within **G1**, the Group worked with leading universities and telecommunications providers, including Deutsche Telecom and Telefonica, to develop protocols for orthogonal frequency division multiple access passive optical networks \(OFDMA\-PONs\), delivering the highest data rates recorded at the time to optical and fixed and mobile wireless users \[ **3.3**\]. 

 In 2013, responding to industry demand for network technologies that could unlock opportunities afforded by 5G, the Group expanded its laboratory infrastructure to place emphasis on the application of, and further research into, their existing data transfer protocols and algorithms within a software defined networking \(SDN\) architecture. SDN is a system that moves the intelligence from the underlying network \(e.g. routers, switches\), into a central system \(the cloud\), allowing network\-wide decisions to be applied to the infrastructure dynamically, based on a global topology. Using OpenFlow, a protocol that facilitates communication between the SDN controller and the network hardware, the group initially integrated the SDN principles of centralised control into a millimetre\-wave radio\-over\-fibre topology, enabling virtualised 5G service providers to lease and manage network capacity from 5G hardware owners \[ **3.4, 3.5**\], and subsequently flexible cell association within multiple\-input and multiple\-output \(MIMO\) Heterogeneous Cooperative Networks \[ **3.6**\]. 

 Kourtessis began collaborating with Global Invacom, a leading satellite communications equipment provider, in 2013. This led to a sponsored PhD and a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) in 2015 through which the Group explored, for the first time, whether their SDN solutions could facilitate the integration of a satellite TV\-based video platform and a terrestrial video broadcast system \(mobile broadband or Wi\-Fi\) \[ **G2**\]. They demonstrated how Wi\-Fi, long\-term evolution \(LTE\) and optical networks could be integrated and controlled using an SDN framework, and described how intelligent orchestration can allow multiple competing network services to coexist while sharing the same physical hardware. 

 A grant from the European Space Agency \(ESA\) followed, for UH to collaborate with Global Invacom and the BBC to develop a commercial technology that delivers live, high\-quality video over a Wi\-Fi network to thousands of people simultaneously \[ **G3**\]. This would allow providers to offer a virtual ‘big screen’ experience at large\-scale events \(e.g. music or arts festivals\) to phones and tablets, without buffering or service charges. The UH group developed the Sat>IP Wi\-Fi Hotspot, a device that can transcode video content and add Forward Error Correction \(FEC\) to video streams before multicasting it out over a wireless network to thousands of mobile devices via a dedicated app. The FEC is added so that any data lost during transmission over the multicast wireless network can be recovered for a high\-quality user experience. This resulted in two patents, one for Europe published in 2019 and one for the US published in 2020 \[ **3.7**\]. 

 UH, GIL and the BBC secured ESA follow\-on funding \[ **G4**\] to further develop the technology, now called Broadcast Wi\-Fi, or Bx\-WiFi. Based on the SDN framework, they developed novel SDN applications and algorithms, and integrated SDN functionality into the Wi\-Fi access points themselves. This allowed the Bx\-WiFi system to self\-optimise in real time for any given installation, environment and usage level, based on live feedback.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 People can watch live audio\-visual content on their mobile devices in public spaces using internet\-streaming applications, either over a mobile data connection or via a free Wi\-Fi access point. However, there are several drawbacks that Bx\-WiFi is designed to address. Users risk exceeding their monthly mobile data allowance, potentially incurring costly bills, and the user experience is typically poor due to limited available bandwidth. Video streaming of content in areas with a high density of users, such as a sporting event or music festival, is often impossible; 43% of mobile users globally have connectivity issues in crowded areas, according to a 2019 report by Ericsson. 

  

 Through KTP and ESA funding \[ **G2**\- **G4**\], UH researchers worked closely with Global Invacom and the BBC to translate the patented technology from a hardware device into a PC\-based software platform, so its functionality could be tailored to each service provider’s specific requirements. The Forward Error Correction and multicast streaming technology allows multiple users to receive broadcast quality TV and radio simultaneously, via satellite, without buffering or loss of signal. A key advantage is its ability to enhance the audience experience at large\-scale live events. In a sports stadium scenario, close\-ups or replays can be delivered to the personal handheld devices of those in the crowd. At music and arts festivals, audiences can access exclusive ‘backstage’ content via their smartphones or tablets to complement the live experience. Event operators can use the technology to sell new services and develop alternative revenue streams. 

 **Delivering commercial benefits to the** **satellite communications and broadcasting industries** 

 Global Invacom, which is listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore and the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market, has long been known as a satellite equipment provider; it has six manufacturing plants around the world, generates annual revenues of $30m \(£22.3m\) and has around 2,500 employees. In recent years the company has increasingly turned its attention to the delivery of live audio\-visual content to mobile devices in recognition that the size of the global video streaming market is expected to reach $184bn \(£136bn\) by 2025, according to a 2020 report by US consultancy Grand View Research. Kourtessis introduced GIL to the concept of Software Defined Networking and how, through further research, it could be applied to the development of a video streaming platform by creating a SAT>IP WiFi hotspot and adapting an existing GIL wireless transmitter product. The subsequent development of the Bx\-WiFi technology represents a ‘ *significant shift in the strategic direction of Global Invacom’s busines*s’, according to Global Invacom’s business development director \[ **5.1**\] 

 Through the research collaboration with UH since 2015, Global Invacom has been able to access £556,000 in combined funding from Innovate UK and ESA to bring the technology to market \[ **5.2**\]. This allowed the company to pursue a new R&D direction, drawing on the research expertise of the Optical Networks Research Group. The company said: ‘ *It would have been very difficult to justify the R&D spend internally as fundamental research was required, which we knew wouldn’t yield a commercial product for several years. The external funding allowed us to keep the R&D investment separate from the company’s core resources* \[ **5.1**\].’ The initial developmental work gave Global Invacom confidence to invest £843,000 of its own budget in progressing the technology \[ **5.1**\]. The development of Bx\-WiFi has also enabled the company to form a strong relationship with the BBC. 

 On August 23, 2017 Global Invacom announced to investors the successful launch of Bx\-Wifi at the Edinburgh Festival \[ **5.2**\]; the company’s share price rose to a near 18\-month high \[ **5.3**\]. Global Invacom described it as a ‘ *breakthrough in streaming technology that is set to redefine video broadcast for large\-scale events*’, also saying that ‘ *its scalability and flexibility ensure it can be deployed in diverse venues, including coffee shops, stadiums and even aboard aircraft’* \[ **5.2**\]. The BBC saw it as an opportunity ‘ *to offer a virtual big screen experience at an event to people on their existing phones and tablets’*. ESA said the Bx\-WiFi project was ‘ *an excellent example of … collaboration between industry and university communities in developing innovative technology and products for satellite communications’* \[ **5.2**\]. 

 After further development and optimisation of the technology, in June 2019 Rai Radiotelevisione italiana \(Rai\), the Italian national public broadcasting company, commissioned Global Invacom to provide the Bx\-WiFi service at the Feast of St John celebrations in Turin \[ **5.1**\]. This resulted in Rai purchasing a perpetual R&D licence for the technology \[ **5.1**\]. In July 2019 the BBC used Bx\-WiFi to offer visitors to the SummerTyne Americana Festival in Gateshead access to two streams of exclusive content on their mobile devices \[ **5.1**, **5.5**\]. At this point, Global Invacom prioritised entering the conference, exhibitions and events sector, where dedicated venue content and advertising can be streamed to the mobile devices of visitors/delegates \[ **5.1**, **5.6**\]. The company was in advanced talks with the World Retail Congress in Rome \(originally scheduled for April 2020\) and had been invited by world\-leading production company NEP Group \(the Olympics, the Oscars\) to showcase Bx\-WiFi to its customers in London at the end of March 2020 \[ **5.1**\]. However, the Covid\-19 pandemic decimated the events sector and plans were postponed \[ **5.1**\]. 

 Another industry beneficiary is Canada\-based Edgewater Wireless Systems, an industry leader in Wi\-Fi hardware technology that can support high\-density applications. The UH\-GIL\-BBC research collaboration led to Edgewater being selected in 2019 as a partner in the development of Bx\-WiFi. The company said the partnership allowed it ‘ *to push the boundaries of our hardware*’, enhancing the capabilities of their technology to ‘ *further drive market demand*’ \[ **5.7**\]. The company referenced this agreement as a ‘ *third quarter financial highlight*’ in 2019 \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Enabling the BBC and Italy’s national broadcaster to enhance the live audience experience** 

 The BBC has benefitted directly from ESA funding, through the UH\-GIL collaboration, to co\-develop Bx\-WiFi; it has received funding as one of the three partners in the ESA\-funded projects \[ **G3**, **G4**\], which includes the BBC making its own matching financial contribution \[ **5.8**\]. The BBC believes Bx\-WiFi offers new ways of improving the live audience experience, offering a more flexible and personalised alternative to the ‘big screen’ format and helping set the national broadcaster apart from competitors like Netflix and Amazon \[ **5.8**\]. 

 At the 2017 Edinburgh Festival, the BBC offered Bx\-WiFi to the public for the first time. For three evenings, visitors to the Big Blue Tent, the BBC’s broadcasting hub for the festival duration, were given access, through a dedicated app, to two content streams, including a special Edinburgh comedy highlights package. They watched the content via the Bx\-WiFi network, without encroaching upon their mobile data allowances or experiencing buffering. The BBC said, ‘ *the system worked well across the wide range and number of different devices we saw* \[ **5.8**\].’ Several thousand people visited the tent each day \[ **5.8**\]. The Bx\-WiFi offering was scaled up in July 2019 for the three\-day SummerTyne Americana Festival, a popular annual music festival organised by Sage Gateshead \(a music and cultural centre\). The Bx\-WiFi app, accessed through the dedicated Wi\-Fi network ‘nomorebufferface’, offered two content streams: exclusive footage from SummerTyne Secret Garden Sessions and backstage podcasts \[ **5.5**\]. A BBC development producer said they were ‘ *really excited to bring Broadcast Wi\-Fi to the public*’ as it gave them the opportunity to ‘ *enhance live events with extra content*’ via ‘ *a virtual screen*’ \[ **5.8**\]. 

 The Bx\-WiFi development process has prompted the BBC to consider new programming and event ideas \[ **5.8**\]. BBC R&D’s lead research engineer said: ‘ *Working on developing the technology has given us the opportunity to propose completely new entertainment ideas that would otherwise be unfeasible, from virtual drive\-in movies at festivals, to screenings of premieres in disused cinemas, to pop\-up film events on village greens* \[ **5.8**\] *.*’ He said the BBC is exploring the use of the technology to provide pre\-show mobile content to keep live audiences entertained. The BBC was in advanced talks with an artistic director to use Bx\-WiFi at a number of unique live events; the streaming of performances directly to multiple mobile devices would overcome potential licensing and noise pollution barriers. Covid\-19 postponed these plans; under the terms of the ESA grant, the BBC was due to use Bx\-WiFi at two further large\-scale events in Q2 of 2020 \[ **5.8**\]. 

 In June 2019, Rai, working with the Ministry of Economic Development and city authorities, offered the public access to the Bx\-WiFi platform during the Feast of St John celebrations, an annual public holiday in Turin \[ **5.4**\]. Live content of the festivities, using 360° cameras in the central city square and on drones, was captured and transmitted through HD 5G technology from the main television transmitter towards the city of Turin. The received signal was then fed through the Bx\-WiFi system at the Rai Museum of Radio and Television in order to stream exclusive live content to multiple mobile devices belonging to members of the public attending the festivities. This marked Italy’s first mobile TV broadcast over 5G in Italy \[ **5.1**, **5.4**\]. 

 **Influencing industry standards for new wireless broadcast technologies** 

 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\) is a leading developer of industry standards for a broad range of technologies. Its Broadcast Services Study Group was set up in 2018 to initiate a new amendment to IEEE 802.11, the global standard that sets the rules for wireless local area networks, in order to improve the user experience through enhanced broadcasting services. The Group requested a presentation from the BBC on Bx\-WiFi as part of its goal to significantly reduce the number of access points required to stream audio\-visual content \(something that Bx\-WiFi has succeeded in doing\). As a consequence, the capabilities of the Bx\-WiFi technology have influenced the ongoing development of the new standards \[ **5.8**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Sophie Page co\-curated the exhibition *Spellbound: Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft* \(31 August 2018\-6 January 2019\), which drew upon her research into the history of magic and attracted 45,585 visitors to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Visitors gained a better understanding of the changing roles of magic in the past and examined their own habits of “magical thinking.” The exhibition attracted a new audience of 25–34\-year\-olds to the Ashmolean. A wall hanging created for the exhibition by Fine Cell Work improved the wellbeing of the prisoners who made it, and creative collaborations with artists Ackroyd & Harvey, cartoonist Hannah Sackett, musician Hayden Chisholm and storyteller Olivia Armstrong engaged audiences in emotional and artistic ways, and influenced the artists’ own creative practices.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The history of magic emerged in the 1990s as an increasingly important field of medieval history. Magic was practised at every level of medieval society and engaged the greatest minds of the time; contrary to a previous historiographical focus on crude superstitions, magic texts reveal medieval people’s syncretic, sophisticated and morally ambiguous understanding of their universe. Page’s ground\-breaking and innovative work has been formative and central to a new conceptualisation of late medieval attitudes to magic. Specifically, it demonstrates that some types of magic were viewed positively by monastic and ecclesiastical authorities \( **R1, R2, R3**\). This narrative of the “positivization” of magic has moved contemporary research in new directions and continues to suggest new fertile grounds for historical inquiry. 

 Until recently, scholars engaged only intermittently with the visual and material culture of magic to explore these questions. Page’s publications — and particularly her use of visual sources \(rather than texts\) to address key questions about belief systems — opened up new methodologies and areas of inquiry \( **R2, R4**\). She was one of the first scholars to investigate magic’s relationship with the natural world, demonstrating that the boundaries between God, animals and demons were relatively firm in medieval culture but that the border between animals and humans was more fluid \( **R5**\). Most importantly, Page’s publications have aimed to change our understanding of medieval attitudes to learned magic by showing that it was tolerated or even valued by diverse people and institutions, including religious insiders—though intermittently, and in complex, sometimes ambiguous ways. 

 Page initiated and co\-edited with Dr Catherine Rider \(Exeter University\) the *Routledge History of Medieval Magic* \( **R1**\). This important book has 34 contributions by academics from 11 different countries and includes methodological reflections and “future directions” sections in all thematic chapters. Page’s chapter demonstrates how magical figures are useful to exploring the relationship between image and text in learned magic and for explaining why some medieval critics identified magic texts as deviant. 

 As Co\-I on the Leverhulme funded project “Inner Lives: Emotions, Identity, and the Supernatural, 1300\-1900” \(2015\-2018\), Page collaborated with Malcolm Gaskill \(UEA\) and Owen Davies \(University of Hertfordshire\). Page led research in three significant areas: recovering and interpreting the visual and material culture of magic \( **R4**\); identifying how interactions with the supernatural revealed the emotional experiences and interior lives of medieval people \( **R4**\); and assessing the diverse ways in which cosmological ideas circulated in the late Middle Ages and stimulated the creation of new models to address questions about the nature of evil \( **R4, R6**\). 

 Co\-curating \(with professional curator Marina Wallace\) the major exhibition *Spellbound: Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft* at the Ashmolean Museum in 2018 enabled Page to expand her research beyond the Middle Ages to the modern eras. Page used contemporary ideas about magical thinking \(the belief that our thoughts or wishes may influence the world around us or that one event happens as a result of another with no plausible link of causation\) to make significant connections between ideas, emotions, practices and experiences of magic in the past and present in her contributions to the accompanying exhibition catalogue \( **R4**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The exhibition *Spellbound: Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft* \(Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 31 August 2018 – 6 January 2019\) enriched public understanding of the history of magic and the place of magical thinking in all our lives and pursued ways of using that knowledge for its psychological, social and creative benefits. Page led on creating the exhibition proposal, finding a professional curator to collaborate with \(Marina Wallace, Artakt\) and successfully pitching the idea of *Spellbound* to the Ashmolean. She had additional curatorial assistance from Malcolm Gaskill \(UEA\), Owen Davies and Ceri Houlbrook \(University of Hertfordshire\). The exhibition brought together more than 200 exhibits from the twelfth century to 2016 in an antechamber on magical thinking and three rooms focused on the medieval cosmos, the modern home and the early modern community. The medieval room, in particular, engaged visitors with Page’s research, demonstrating that medieval people had rich and diverse cosmological views \( **R6**\), positive approaches to magic \( **R3**\), and linked magical practices to their inner lives and emotional experiences \( **R4**\). 

 **Attracting a New Audience to the Ashmolean and Enhancing Museum Practice** 

 *Spellbound* stands out among all recent Ashmolean exhibitions for “ **reaching a wider, different audience**, a younger audience,” according to the Ashmolean Exhibitions manager and Co\-ordinator film \( **A**\). It attracted 45,585 visitors, surpassing the Ashmolean target of 30,000 by more than 50% \( **A**\). The Ashmolean is one of Arts Council England’s \( **ACE**\) National Portfolio Organisations. ACE stress the importance of museums attracting and engaging young and diverse visitors in their 2010\-20 strategic goals, which include: “Everyone has the opportunity to experience and to be inspired by the arts, museums and libraries” \( **B**\). Responses to the Ashmolean’s survey showed that the number of respondents who had never visited the Ashmolean before was higher for *Spellbound* than for any other exhibition for which data had been analysed. The data also showed a large increase in the proportion of respondents in the 25–34 age bracket, accounting for about 35% of the total \(roughly double the Ashmolean exhibition norm\) \( **C**\). 

 ACE’s strategic framework highlights the essential role of museums in “fuel\[ing\] children’s curiosity and critical capacity” and supporting their learning and creativity \( **B**\). *Spellbound* helped the Ashmolean to meet this strategic goal. *Spellbound* was seen by 497 school pupils on educational visits, and visitors included an additional 1,137 under\-12s \(more than any of the four preceding exhibitions\) and 3,610 12–17\-year\-olds \( **C**\). To facilitate engagement, Page produced a *Spellbound* Top 10 Trail teachers’ resource for secondary schools, advised on the exhibition family trail and ran a Saturday morning workshop for A\-level art students with artist Katharine Dowson. The Ashmolean’s Learning Officer called this “A fantastic workshop. The young people clearly enjoyed it, got a lot out of the session and made some really interesting work” \( **C**\). 

 Page and Wallace’s collaboration with the Ashmolean also **enhanced cultural heritage preservation and interpretation**. *Spellbound* involved more objects, private lenders and small local museums than the exhibition team normally deploys \( **A**\). The **benefit to local museums** included an “extra level of support” provided by the Ashmolean team of technicians, registrars and conservators “to enable them to lend” \( **A**\). Page’s new research findings on several objects \( **R4**\) enhanced their interpretation: notable examples included a seventeenth\-century ceremonial sword at the Ashmolean \(now recognised as a betrothal gift\), magic square talismans at the Pitt Rivers, a seal matrix at the Museum of the History of Science Oxford and an extremely rare magic mirror loaned by the Mathematisch\-Physikalischer Salon, Dresden. 

 **Enriching public, critical and cultural understanding of the significance of magical thinking** 

 Over half of visitors surveyed between 24 September and 22 November 2018 felt that *Spellbound* changed their understanding of the role of magic in the past. Page designed an antechamber to the exhibition with questions linked to her research on magical thinking \( **R4**\) that helped visitors to reflect on how, as a visitor put it, “we still use ritual and superstition as coping mechanisms for living in a complex world” \( **D**\). A key example linking modern and medieval magical thinking was love. Page collaborated with Ceri Houlbrook to create a display of medieval inscribed love tokens and modern love locks \(padlocks affixed to bridges\) based on their research \( **R4**\). One review \(on the website of the marketing company culturecalling.com\) termed this display “the most overwhelming evidence that we’re still magically minded” \( **E**\). 

 In the medieval room, Page showed how the creation of medieval images and objects was driven by emotions and by different ways of relating to the cosmos, as well as by creative choices \( **R1, R2, R6**\). One visitor acknowledged this, tweeting: “\[It made\] me think about our relationship with objects and the meaning with which we invest them” \( **F**\). Another responded with self\-conscious magical thinking: “John Dee’s crystal ball is something that I would touch alone but with people around me I would not touch just in case something did happen” \( **D**\) and others explicitly **reflected on the continued presence of magical thinking today**: “The presence of enchanted mirrors gave me a feeling of dread… and curiosity… Coming out of this exhibition, I reflected and asked myself: despite my apparent rationality, do I really think that differently from them?” \( **F**\). 

 68.5% of survey respondents felt that *Spellbound* made them more aware of magical thinking in their own lives; **visitors’ knowledge and understanding of human behaviour in the twenty\-first century were enhanced by their knowledge of its historical precedents**. The exhibition enabled visitors to understand the complexity of ritual actions: one commented that it was “important to realise that magic is not simply spells but is emotional” \( **D**\). In a *Times* review \(31.8.18\), Rachel Campbell\-Johnson wrote, “this history of magic is surprisingly moving… \[T\]he hidden presence of magic as it permeates our history and our human psyche is revealed” \( **E**\). 

 *Spellbound* attracted more than 98 reviews, features, interviews and blog posts in UK and European media outlets, **recognising the significance of magical thinking today and in the past** and extending the reach of the exhibition. In *The* *Times Literary Supplement* \(26.10.18\), Jane Jakeman declared that it was “an exhibition more intelligent and thought\-provoking than any big metropolitan collection has managed” \( **E**\). Sir Philip Pullman, the Carnegie\-Medal winning children’s author, wrote in *The Guardian* \(01.09.2018\), “I think this exhibition is full of illuminating things, and the mental world it illustrates is an important – no, an essential part of the life we live” \(4,910,000 hits and 3,933 shares in the first months\) \( **E**\). 

 **Enhancing prisoners’ wellbeing through craft in partnership with a UK\-based charity** 

 In collaboration with the prisoner rehabilitation charity Fine Cell Work \( **FCW**\), *Spellbound* displayed a specially commissioned wall hanging titled “Magical Thinking.” This piece was hand\-stitched in four British prisons by 12 individuals, based on Page’s research into medieval and modern understandings of human fate constrained by powerful environmental pressures \( **R4, R6**\). This had a positive impact on participant wellbeing in line with FCW’s objective to train prisoners in needlework “to enable them to build fulfilling and crime\-free lives” \( **G**\). FCW emphasises the therapeutic aspect of sewing: “Needlework provides a sense of calm and relieves stress as the needle becomes a tool to channel the inner – and outer – turmoil of prisoners” \( **G**\). 

 The FCW Design and Commissions manager reported that the most rewarding part of interpreting Page’s research was “seeing designs by prisoners who responded creatively, personally, with thought\-provoking images to the brief” \( **G**\). In a piece for the Fine Cell Newsletter \(Winter 2018\), “Remembering my grandfather through magical thinking,” one participant explains how his design featured a talisman made by his grandfather from an empty artillery shell in France, 1915 \( **G**\). Another stitcher wrote, “Within my Fine Cell piece is my journey… I’m more accepting of magical thinking in others \[after completing the stitching\]” \( **G**\). 

 **Inspiring and informing artistic practice leading to the production of new cultural artefacts** 

 *Spellbound* included major new works of contemporary art which were commissioned for the exhibition. Page and Wallace selected the artists and directed their collaborations with Gaskill and Davies between September 2016 and August 2018. These collaborations informed and enriched artistic practice, leading to the creation of several new artworks for *Spellbound*. Page’s own collaborations with artists resulted in **the co\-production of new art works which enriched artistic practice**: a sculpture tableau \(Ackroyd & Harvey\), an interactive music piece \(Hayden Chisholm\), a modern wall hanging \(FCW\), a comic book \(Hannah Sackett\) and a story\-telling workshop \(Olivia Armstrong\) **.** 

 Ackroyd and Harvey’s work *From Aether to Air* consists of an elevated crystalline human figure, a backdrop of angels and two small demons, which was influenced by Page’s research demonstrating how medieval cosmic models emphasised human agency in response to environmental pressures \( **R6**\). The **artists drew inspiration** from “our conversations about microcosmic man and this sense of being under siege from planetary forces.” Working on *Spellbound* with Page **influenced their choice and use of materials**: it “has pushed us to use different materials and to look at materials in a different way … we work intuitively so some of the things we’ve touched on with the knowledge from Sophie – it will remain there and influence work to come” \( **A**\). 

 Page worked closely with Armstrong \(five performances attended by 123 children and 140 adults\). Armstrong explains that “medieval magic… was something that I knew a little bit about, but not in great depth… \[Page\] had a real ability to disseminate that knowledge and make it very clear so I could understand it” \( **A**\). Writing about his interactive music piece, “The Medieval Jukebox,” Chisholm said, “Sophie’s work and research \[i.e. **R4** and **R6**\]… **informed my whole work, inspiring me** to create the soundscape and the composition… the jukebox itself really set some things alight for me as a composer and performer and I hope to use some of the ideas again” \( **G**\). Hannah Sackett’s comic, *The Magician’s Lament*, was inspired by the idea that magicians sought, and sometimes achieved, respectability, drawing upon Page’s research \( **R1, R2, R3**\). She notes, “I’ve benefitted artistically… I’ve worked with new images, new ways of drawing and creating page designs… it’s also leading me into other comics I want to make in the future” \( **A**\). 

 Page’s collaborations with artists continue to generate new ways of thinking and making. In 2019 and 2020, Page worked with the artist Annie Cattrell on a film, *Then in Now*, that is “intended to reappraise the continuity and timelessness of medieval thinking in the here and now” \( **I**\). The film compiles Cattrell’s “thoughts, imaginings and responses” to Page’s research on the cosmos \( **R3, R4**\) alongside Cattrell’s observation of Page’s “interpretations of medieval manuscripts at the Wellcome Library, London” \( **I**\). Cattrell documented the collaboration on her Instagram account, which has 1980 followers. In 2020, Page also collaborated with the artist Katharine Dowson on a sculpture in the form of a mirrored, glass heart, titled *Bewitched* that draws upon Page’s research on the multiple meanings associated with the medieval heart \( **R4**\) and the *Spellbound* exhibition \( **I**\). The planned physical display of the two works was prevented by COVID\-19 restrictions. However, Cattrell’s film and photos of Dowson’s sculpture, along with the artists’ descriptions of collaborating with Page, have been exhibited online since 26 November 2020 and were viewed 248 times in the first month, engaging a public audience with new ways of considering contemporary resonances of medieval magical thinking through creative practice.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Children who become involved with child protection, care and adoption systems are among the poorest in society. Research conducted at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) has been ground breaking in placing poverty and inequality on policy and practice agendas across the UK in order to reduce the financial and human costs of children living apart from their birth families.The costs to local authorities in England are around £9bn per year, and there are significant ethical and human rights concerns about the rising numbers of children being removed from their birth families. In Scotland the research has led to a reduction of children in care by 33%, and a 70% reduction in placement moves for looked after children. As a result of this work, The Office for Standards in Education \(OFSTED\) changed the assessment criteria for performance of local authorities in relation to child protection. The research has also been used to inform campaigning and training by the Association of Directors of Children’s Services \(ADCS\) and the British Association of Social Workers \(BASW\). The work conducted at UoH has led to a new understanding of child protection \- the social model. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ensuring that children are protected from abuse and neglect is a significant social concern, costing local authorities in England around £9bn per year \(House of Commons 2019\).The number of children in care has risen by 28% in the last decade and the Local Government Association warned in January 2020 that the system had reached “breaking point” as a result of increased pressures on families and a decrease in support and prevention. 

 Historically, child protection policies and practices have been casework orientated, focusing on the risk to a specific child within its family and on engaging parents to change their parenting practices. Research and scholarship from UoH has challenged this by highlighting the broader social and economic determinants of risk; the inequalities in children’s chances of being able to live with their birth families and the human rights concern around the promotion of a closed model of adoption \(not allowing direct contact with birth families\). This research has argued the need for a paradigm shift towards a social model of protecting children. Key contributions to this new understanding have been conducted at UoH by Professor Nigel Parton, \(1994 onwards\) and Professors Brid Featherstone \(2015 onwards\) and Paul Bywaters \(2017 onwards\). 

 This case study builds on the extensive research on child welfare, child protection and social work by Parton \[3.1\]. This earlier body of work provided the theoretical underpinning for the practical application described below in two seminal research projects \- the Child Welfare Inequalities Project \(CWIP\), involving a collaboration with seven universities across the UK, and The Adoption Enquiry, which was a collaboration with Professor Anna Gupta of Royal Holloway, University of London.  In these projects, Featherstone and Bywaters investigated the relationship between deprivation and children’s chances of becoming involved with child protection and care systems in the UK \(3.2\), prompting similar projects in New Zealand and Norway \[3.3\]. Featherstone then drew from this research to investigate ethical and human rights concerns around the use of adoption in the UK. The findings of these research projects argued for changes in policy and practice towards a social model of child protection \[3.4\]. 

 Funded by the Nuffield Foundation, The Child Welfare Inequalities Project \(CWIP\) ran from 2014 to 2019 and aimed to investigate inequalities relating to deprivation in children’s chances of being subject to interventions from Children’s Social Care. Key elements were: i\). Datasets on 24,000 children who were being looked after \(in care\) and 12,000 children on child protection plans or registers \(from 55 local authorities or trusts in the four UK countries\) were collected and analysed by a multi\-site research team; ii\). Qualitative research with conceptual and data gathering input from Bywaters and Featherstone with social work teams and departments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Eight sites were chosen to carry out intensive data gathering on demography, social work decision making and understandings of poverty to appreciate how the systems, processes and practice affected the subsequent outcomes for the children and their parents \[3.2\-4\]; and, iii\). Featherstone led the impact strand of the whole project \- activities included convening a high\-level advisory group, organising over 100 briefings across the UK, and presenting to Parliament, Directors of Children’s Services and frontline workers. 

 The data analysis found that children in the most deprived 10% of small neighbourhoods in England are more than 10 times more likely to be in care \(or on child protection plans\) than those in the least deprived 10%. This association with deprivation was found to be consistent across the UK, operating along a social gradient. The qualitative research found that social workers and managers did not consider poverty as their ‘core business’ when assessing or devising responses to families’ difficulties. 

 Building on these findings, UoH was commissioned by the British Association of Social Workers \(BASW\) to conduct The Adoption Enquiry \(2016–2018\) *\(“The role of the social worker in adoption: ethics and human rights”*\), led by Featherstone. The Enquiry was a response to the promotion of adoption by the Coalition government post\-2010 in the context of widespread cuts to family incomes and support services. Linked to the issues highlighted in the CWIP research, increasing poverty rates among birth families had raised concerns about the prioritization of adoption in contexts where birth families were not receiving what was needed to care for their children safely \[3.4; 3.5\]. 

  

 For this commission, interviews, workshops and focus groups were used to gather evidence across the UK, engaging 300 respondents in all.  A particular feature was bringing together adopted people, birth parents, adoptive parents and professionals in small group dialogues \(n=7\). This approach was innovative; due to the contentious and emotive aspect of adoption, this methodology has rarely been used. The Enquiry found that adoption needs to be located within an understanding of the socioeconomic circumstances of birth families, and that the closed model of adoption causes considerable distress to adopted people particularly. A more open model of adoption, in which direct contact between birth families and adoptive parents occurs, was recommended, alongside the need to tackle poverty and inequality among birth families \[3.6\]. 

 The groundbreaking work conducted at UoH has led to a new understanding of child protection \-the social model \[3.4\]. This demonstrates the need for locating the protection of children within a social framework that provides all families with the means and opportunities to care safely. It highlights the importance of anti\-poverty policies and practices, and a shift away from individual casework towards community\-based approaches.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has influenced policy and practices for child protection and adoption in the UK in the following ways: 

1.  Influencing policy to alleviate the impacts of poverty on families involved in child protection 

1.  Changing social work practice in relation to poverty 

1.  Influencing social work practice around adoption 

 **Influencing policy to alleviate the impacts of poverty on families involved in child protection** 

 In 2016, Glasgow City Council used the research findings \[3.2, 3.3\] to inform a programme of work to tackle “ *long\-standing and complex challenges”* in social care. Following seminars delivered jointly by UoH and the University of Sheffield, the Assistant Chief Officer declared: “ *Re\-focussing on child poverty and structural inequality has enabled the city to address and concentrate our intervention much more effectively on prevention and earlier help and support. The work of the Professors and the Nuffield study has been inspirational and transformational for the children and young people of Glasgow*”. Highlighting the subsequent impacts on the lives of young people, he added, “ *Children looked after from home and in formal care have reduced by 33% from 1,404 in April 2016 to 936 today \(minus 468\). This has also resulted in a significant reduction in rates per 10,000 from 188 in April 2016 to 82 per 10,000 today. Furthermore, as a consequence of our approach, placement moves for children and young people looked after have reduced from 355 in the year 2016/17 to 108 for this year; a reduction of 247 and 70%”* \[5.1\]. 

 In Northern Ireland, the findings of CWIP were used to inform the funding of an expansion of coverage of Family Support Hubs. The Chief Social Worker described two specific initiatives: “ *Firstly it inspired a project between the Department of Health and the Department of Communities to focus an initiative to maximise uptake of eligible benefits on families who had recently had a child placed on the child protection register. Secondly it led to the publication by the Department of Health NI of the Anti\-Poverty Practice Framework for Social Workers in Northern Ireland in July 2018*” \[5.2\]. 

 Following invited consultations by the National Audit Office with Bywaters, the research \[3.3\] was also directly quoted in their 2016 report *Children in Need of Help or Protection* \[5.3\]. Further meetings between Bywaters and the OFSTED senior management team resulted in the agency changing its assessment criteria for performance of local authorities in relation to child protection, moving from this statement in the 2016 report: *“Inadequacy is not a function of size, deprivation or funding, but of the quality of leadership”*, to this in 2017: *“It is clear that highly deprived LAs that have high demand and that are facing further reductions to funding will have the greatest challenges to either achieve or maintain good services”* \[5.4\]. 

 Further evidence of change to national policy is seen in The Association of Directors of Children’s Services \(ADCS\) Safeguarding Pressures Reports 5 and 6, with both directly quoting the research \[3.2\]. As a result, the ADCS Presidents’ inaugural speeches for 2016–19 inclusive have all featured poverty as a major issue.  The President of ADCS from 2019\-2020 confirms this influence: *‘I \(as ADCS presidents had done before me\) drew on the evidence of the research led by Bywaters and Featherstone. This important work has informed the policy work of ADCS and was a key foundation of the paper ‘A country that works for all children’ published in 2017*” \[5.5\]. 

  

 **Changing social work practice in relation to poverty** 

 Following a number of sessions presenting the research findings \[3.2\] to 50 managers and frontline practitioners of Barnsley Local Authority in 2019 \(which ranks 38<sup>th</sup> out of 317 in terms of the Index of Multiple Deprivation\), their neglect strategy has been reviewed. Barnsley are now “poverty\-proofing” their assessments to ensure they are focused on the hardships and inequalities families face when living in poverty. “ *The sessions presented to our social work forum, and to groups of frontline social worker and managers, \[have\] led social workers and their managers to reflect and really think about the impact of families living in work and out of work poverty*” \[5.6\]. 

 Featherstone and Morris \(University of Sheffield\), have also worked with 70 children’s social care senior managers in a series of workshops organised by Research in Practice \(2018/2019\), a charity specialising in research dissemination. The CEO stated: “ *By focusing specifically on the interface between poverty, inequality and neglect, Featherstone and Morris were able to design learning workshops that spoke directly to the priorities of children’s social care.”* \[5.7\]. As a result of this work, Research in Practice have commissioned Featherstone and Morris to lead a Change Project \(2019–2021\) on domestic abuse. This project builds upon the findings of the CWIP research in highlighting the role played by poverty in both the causation of and the consequences of domestic abuse \[3.4\]. Working with 30 local authority partners, they are examining how they can change practice in the area of domestic abuse and child protection \[5.7\]. Local authorities have been extremely keen to be involved in projects to develop a social model incorporating strategies for their particular needs and circumstances. Since 2019, Featherstone has been advising the Assistant Chief Officer, Public Protection and Complex Needs on transforming approaches to domestic abuse policy and practice in Glasgow. He wrote that she had been *“very influential in deciding what is needed for our planning and programme of work”* \[5.8\]. 

 **Influencing social work practice around adoption** 

 BASW accepted all of the recommendations of the commissioned Adoption Enquiry \(2018\), and has been working with the research team on how to embed the findings \[3.6\] with its 20,000 members. The CEO of BASW stated: “ *The Enquiry’s findings in relation to the need to address wider social policies relating to poverty and inequality has influenced BASW’s national campaign on anti\-poverty and anti\-austerity, which included developing an Anti\-Poverty Practice Guide for Social Work launched in September 2019. The Enquiry’s findings in relation to ethics and human rights have also been incorporated into the work of BASW, including the development of Social Work and Human Rights: A Practice Guide …and has facilitated critical debates in the profession about ethics and human rights in relation to adoption, and influenced a changing narrative about…  the current primarily ‘closed’ model of adoption*” \[5.9\]. 

  

 The current President of the Family Division of the High Court, Lord Justice Macfarlane, described the final report of The Adoption Enquiry as a *“an important and interesting document”* \[5.10a\]. Lord Macfarlane extensively quoted its conclusions calling for greater openness and involvement of birth families in adoption in a speech at the NAGALRO \(Professional Association for Children’s Guardians\) annual conference in 2018. The Adoption Enquiry has also been quoted in a Court of Appeal judgment on considerations for post\-adoption contact \[5.10b\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Professor Harwood has resulted in a critical case that demonstrates digital transformation leading to commercial development of a diversity\-led performing arts business. The business has been able to devise and monetise new digital products and services that exploit its unique archive of creative assets. It has transformed from its primarily charitable focus to increase its ability to be self\-sustaining by generating value and income from what it previously would have offered free of charge. It has grown by increasing its business activity, changing the way in which it operates by using digital platforms, devising a new business model and developing its market. This, in turn, has also made it more resilient in responding to funding opportunities and, most recently, the Covid\-19 crisis in the art sector. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research reflects three core themes of investigation published in journals and a book since 2008, broadly relating to the context, product and process of business development. The themes are \(1\) how arts and culture add value to business \(context\); \(2\) the development of digital products and markets \(product\); and \(3\) how business and customer relationships may be supported to develop increased business benefit \(process\). 

 In Harwood and Smith \[R1\], **the value of arts and culture** was examined in a case study to understand how business value may be derived from performance to support change management. A performance arts \(music composition\) intervention was commissioned by Transported Art, enabling a unique project to be explored. This research identified the benefits of a reflexive process between artists and firm employees for supporting development of a firm’s brand. Empirical findings highlighted how benefits of the process impacted and transcended the whole business and its operations, including its external stakeholders such as customers and suppliers. The research contributed not only to outcomes such as how a business may benefit from working with artists but also resulted in a methodology for understanding how arts can enhance the business operations to derive new types of value for its markets. Earlier work by Harwood and Garry \[R2, R3\] took a gestalt perspective of how value is co\-created, transformed, transferred and consumed when roles of consumers and producers become ‘blurred’, focusing on the issue of legal ambiguity of ownership in creative practices. Findings from two different studies found that the nature of ownership informs creative endeavour from both an organisational and a community perspective which in turn provides an ongoing environment for value creation processes that are beneficial to all parties, for example through product, brand and market development, through customer interactions, and by developing new methods and employing new technologies in business practices. The themes and practices related to approaches to co\-production of value are pertinent to the critical case context highlighted in the development of Serendipity. 

 Building on this further, Harwood and Garry \[R4\] focused on the **development of digital products and marketing** practices, examining new forms of virtual digital service customer engagement practices using the concept of ‘gamification’ as an experience environment. The award\-winning paper explored the processes for developing digital, virtual and gamified products and services, and how customer behaviour in markets is influenced by their use, highlighting both positive and negative strategies. The research identified beneficial and divergent behavioural intent as well as business\-customer relational considerations for market development as possible outcomes of using gamified products and services. This work was further extended in Buhalis et al. \[R5\], which looked at impacts of emerging technologies such as location\-based services on service disruptions in the experience economy \(tourism sector\). These foci are aspects that have been embedded within the digital products and services at Serendipity. 

 In an earlier authored book, Harwood, Garry and Broderick \[R6\] **explored business and customer relationship development**. The text summarised and extended extant research, which had emerged from an earlier paper published in 2006. Of relevance to the current REF case are aspects of how relationships are developed and maintained, the different organisational perspectives on theories discussed and the contemporary examples illustrating their application in different business contexts. The text demonstrates that relationship marketing is a business philosophy which is essential in a digital age where co\-production and co\-creation with stakeholders, customer retention and positive word\-of\-mouth marketing are key to long\-term success in service and experience\-based businesses. The text examined the characteristics and determinants of client sophistication within credence \(professional\) services markets to explore their effect on business relationships. Conclusions highlighted the level of client sophistication that moderates service evaluation and the interdependencies between organisations, as well the nature of the atmosphere in which interactions take place and relationships develop and may be sustained. This ultimately impacts levels of trust between and extent of commitment by parties. The tenets of this work have underpinned how contracts for suppliers of Serendipity have been shaped.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Serendipity is a Leicester\-based diversity\-led arts organisation formed in 2010 which became part of Arts Council England’s \(ACE\) National Portfolio in 2018 \(awarded June 2017\). As the only diversity\-led performing arts organisation in the National Portfolio, Serendipity has become a recognised leader of innovation in this sector of the UK creative economy. Without the ability to exploit its increased activity, stakeholders would have no, or very limited, access to Serendipity’s unique proposition, which would result in a reduction in audience size and income as a consequence. This has built confidence in the business and enabled it to advance its corporate vision. As the Director of Diversity at ACE comments: ‘Serendipity is internationally recognised for its diversity\-led practice and reach which has benefitted significantly from its partnership and collaborations with Professor Harwood.’ \[C2\] 

 A series of interventions undertaken over three years \(2016–2019\) have developed Serendipity and its business environment for African/​\-Caribbean diaspora performing arts, leading to business growth and increased demand for arts and cultural products. Linking to underpinning research, Harwood worked with the CEO to explore how to develop new digital products \(virtual performances, shop, e\-learning materials, digital texts such as e\-books\) \[using findings from R1 to R5\], markets \(new audiences\) and a business model \(subscription tiers and strategy for income generation\) \[drawing on findings from R6\]. This led to the development of an Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Partnership awarded in 2018 \(GBP109,948; KTP010965, delivered between April 2018 and September 2019\) which supported development of Serendipity’s commercial proposition \[aligning with findings in R1, R2, R4\]. The focus was on how Serendipity’s programme could be exploited, resulting in a new strategy for digitisation that is now central to its business model. This led to five FTE jobs \(in marketing and business development, product and project development and support, and administration\); structural changes in the business’s operation that resulted in changes to all existing job descriptions which now incorporate a broader range of commercial activities; and new products that support its activities and programme, including income targets for new product lines, consultancy and sponsorship. Furthermore, faced with Covid\-19 challenges which prevented many cultural organisations from offering a programme at all during 2020 because of venue closures, Serendipity was immediately in a position to move its programme and strategy fully online. As the Director of Tourism, Culture & Investment at Leicester City Council, comments in his supporting statement: 

 The value of this work has been obvious during the recent COVID pandemic. Some organisations who run programmes supported by the council had to cancel their activities entirely and subsequently did not receive our financial support this year. Serendipity were very quickly able to generate alternative on\-line formats for both their key programmes and therefore we were able to fund them. Without the investment and support being referred to here they would also have lost out. \[C3\] 

 A key challenge faced was exploiting cultural assets for business sustainability by developing new products, services and markets that maximise income from assets. To address this, and building on research findings \[in R1, R2 and R3\], it has devised a new supplier contract for its international performing artists whereby digitisation \(recorded images, voice, text and associated data\) and related intellectual property rights are now exploitable through a range of new resources such as books \(including audio and e\-books\) and merchandise such as posters, prints and postcards, clothing and bags, as well as reused in new ways related to ongoing development of digital engagement platforms including social media promotion \(related to R4 and R5\), streaming services and paywalls \(mobile apps, e\-learning, digital membership schemes, audience experience opportunities\) and product licensing deals \[reflecting findings in R6\]. This draws on its extensive print\-based archive representing a back catalogue of Black culture that had never before been commercially exploited by the business. It has also developed a new website incorporating a shop platform with analytics and links to its financial accounting processes. As a consequence of the increased visibility, which has resulted from extended digitalised activities and clarity arising from the revised contractual arrangements which sets out intellectual property agreements, supplier\-artists now have improved and enhanced opportunities to benefit from Serendipity’s income\-generating and business\-related activities. In her supporting statement, the CEO of Serendipity states: ‘Contracts with our artists have been developed to enable us to provide a breadth of digital services and appropriately exploit intellectual property rights’ \[C1\]. 

 The outcome has been a new business model; reduced reliance on grant funding resulting in a more independent and sustainable business arising from increased income from event ticket sales and new digital products \(e.g. e\-books, subscriptions, online events\); increased visibility through marketing activities building new audiences and extending audience reach, which in turn has led to development of new programmes and growth in demand for diversity\-led events. For example, its grant income funded a primarily East Midlands–based events programme focused on two core activities: Let’s Dance International Frontiers \(LDIF\) and Black History Month \(BHM\), both highlighting African/​\-Caribbean diaspora stories and Black history in local communities. Both now contribute to an extended, year\-round programme. Its recent launch of Temperature on the Streets, a podcast and news bulletin programme reflecting a wider range of diversity\-led activities within the region, and an annual magazine, Black Ink, including stories of cultural activities, have already achieved high levels of recognition in the national and international media \(e.g. *Guardian* newspaper, *British Theatre Guide*, among numerous others\). This has increased the scope and scale of its business ecology, increasing the number of its stakeholders and suppliers of professional services, technical and venue provision, as stated by the Artistic Director of Tabanka Dance Ensemble: 

 As a result of Serendipity’s work with Professor Harwood, Serendipity is internationally recognised for its diversity\-led reach. Dance companies, including Tabanka Dance Ensemble, see the value in being part of Serendipity’s programmes for the connections, collaborations and future developments that can be achieved as a result. Including reaching new audiences, future work opportunities and the chance to work across formats \(conferences and workshop residencies, publications and digital platforms\). \[C4\] 

 Serendipity also now has a range of online platform\-based assets that have enabled it to grow its remote audiences, including in the Americas, Africa and Europe. Its digital developments meant it was immediately able to switch to an online programme for its events as the Covid\-19 virus closed venues. Impact on its business has therefore been manageable rather than catastrophic. Moving offices in October 2019 to accommodate its growth as a consequence of business developments, it has built a new library targeting community and research audiences, a meeting space and a box office for ticket sales, and has developed a state\-of\-the\-art training facility seating up to 24 people through which it runs courses and events, and which it hires to other businesses. Serendipity’s CEO comments in her supporting statement: 

 With new facilities, Serendipity now has the physical space and capacity for the increase in its activities, including an in\-house box office \(which had previously been managed by a third party\), a bespoke state\-of\-the art training and room hire facility, and an archive library that now provides access to the extensive resources and black history back catalogue. \[C1\] 

 Research and knowledge exchange contributed towards Serendipity’s successful application to become an ACE NPO \(2018–2022, GBP840,000\), as well as develop its programme of events and activities, by providing a robust commercial footing for its audience engagement strategy. Online, Serendipity reached 50,000 impressions in 2019 \(53% increase from 2018 – impressions are the visibility of social media posts in follower timelines\). It has also developed performance artists and creative businesses who are suppliers, collaborators and partners by improving their access to resources and income\-generating opportunities, even when the pandemic has meant international artists have been unable to travel to the UK to complete their contracts. With increased emphasis on paid\-for consultancy, the CEO has developed an international audience extending beyond performers as suppliers, to include an international corporate client\-base for whom she advises on African/​\-Caribbean performing arts diaspora, archiving and curating Black history.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted by Swansea University has established the global historical significance of the South Wales copper industry and has helped to preserve and develop what is left of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks, one of the last remaining substantial built heritage assets in the lower Swansea Valley. The research has had an effect on the Swansea council development plan and the targeted regional investment programme for the lower Swansea valley. It has changed the awareness and understanding of the copper industry heritage in the communities and schools of the lower Swansea Valley, as well as bringing visitor and broadcaster interest.  It has had an effect on the GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package Copr Bay, SME location on the Hafod Morfa site and copper branding of firms in the area. Overall, the research has helped Swansea to develop a holistic historically aware approach to economic regeneration and place\-making to benefit the capacity of the community and economy in the lower Swansea Valley.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the REF2014 Copperopolis case study was all about establishing the global significance of Swansea as a centre for copper smelting. Since then, Swansea historians have uncovered much more detail about the products made from Swansea copper and the markets supplied by them worldwide. This is part of a new ‘turn’ in writing about the history of Welsh industry which goes beyond understanding places and processes of production, to examining the supply of goods and the demands of customers buying Welsh products \(R1\). By using a range of business and commercial records, Miskell and Bowen have discovered more about the importance of copper in the production of key goods used in textile manufacture, maritime, transport and food and drink industries, and about product diversification over time. This new innovative research has moved the narrative away from conventional themes of mineral supply, processing and investment, towards global markets and patterns of consumption. In doing so, it has established the centrality of Swansea copper to global processes of industrialisation and modernisation. In particular, the research has shown that: 

 In the early eighteenth century, the success of Swansea firms in establishing themselves at the centre of the new British copper industry, was their ability to meet East India Company orders to supply Asian markets with a range of products for domestic and decorative use. \(R3\) 

 The production of small, portable barter items like manillas and guinea rods for West African slave traders via Bristol merchants was also part of the output of the early Swansea firms, but occupied a smaller and diminishing part of their product base. \(R4\) 

 By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the willingness of Swansea firms like Vivian & Sons to invest in new rolling mills and steam engine technology meant that they could respond to growing demand for copper sheathing for naval and merchant sailing vessels, supplying shipbuilders and repairers with customized sheathing of different sizes and weights. \(R2\) 

 By the 1820s Swansea copper was also embedded in the growth of the mechanised textile trade with the firm of Williams & Grenfell dominating the supply of copper cylinders for printing on fabric, to Lancashire cotton manufacturers. \(R.2\) 

 The supply of copper vessels including boiling pans, stills and brewing vats to the food and drink industries provided another important source of demand for copper and saw Swansea firms supplying customers as diverse as London copper smiths who made boiling pans destined for the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, to Irish brewers and whisky distillers. \(R2\) 

 By the early twentieth century, a loss of competitiveness as a location for copper smelting saw the surviving Swansea firms focus more on manufacturing, particularly of copper components for locomotives destined for domestic and overseas railway customers. \(R2\) 

 Throughout their history, Swansea copper firms were well\-informed of — and responsive to — the fluctuating demands of global markets and tailored their products accordingly in order to retain their overseas customers and remain competitive. 

 These key research insights have helped the story of Swansea copper to reach a new range of audiences in the public, private and third sector and have provided a stimulus to the next phase of grant capture and development planning for the Hafod Morfa Copperworks site. This is one of the last remaining built heritage legacies of the copper industry in the lower Swansea Valley, an area once popularly known as Copperopolis.  Bowen and Langlands have worked to preserve the site in conjunction with Swansea Council.  Since 2014 their grant capture has sought to focus on continued site restoration as well as initiating the regeneration potential of this built heritage to the redevelopment of the lower Swansea Valley. \(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The uncovering of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s industrial copperworking heritage continues to inform publicly funded programmes resulting in a profound change in attitude across public, private and third sector institutions. Not only has the research been matched to community and enterprise need in the drawing down of over GBP3,600,000 of grant funding **\[G1 – G5\]**, it has impacted upon planning and regeneration policies **\[C1\]**, attracted SME investment **\[C7\]**, and enriched the cultural life **\[C4, 5, 6, 8, 9\]** of wards in the lowest two quintiles of the Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation. 

 <ins> **Influence on public planning and regeneration policy**</ins> 

 The period between 2008 and 2020, has witnessed a sea change in the approach to economic regeneration in the city **\[C1\]**. In the **Swansea Bay City Region Economic Strategy 2013\-2030 \(2013\)**, not a single reference to heritage nor the historic environment was made. The City and Council of Swansea’s own **Unitary Development Plan \(2008\)** made only a passing reference to the role industrial heritage can play in the tourist economy. Even in the **Swansea Local Development Plan Topic Paper: Culture and Heritage \(2013\)**, ‘heritage\-led’ regeneration consisted of limited opportunities within the tourism and built heritage construction sectors. However, the statutory heritage body of Welsh Government, Cadw, sought the help of the university to provide the underpinning historical research for its 2016 Urban Characterisation report on the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C3\]**. This study identified and set out the significance, distinctiveness and unique historic character of the local region. Concurrently, research undertaken by Swansea University historians heavily influenced the production of the ‘master plan’ produced by heritage consultants Purcell for a ‘copperworks’ enterprise and mixed\-use park **\[C1\]**. 

 The City and Council of Swansea’s **Local Development Plan 2010\-2025 \(Deposit Plan, July 2016\)** drew directly on both of these documents in setting out its ambitions for the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks site and its links to the ‘River Tawe Corridor’, listing a ‘heritage\-led project’ to include ‘restoration of historic buildings’ and a ‘heritage visitor centre’ **\[C1\]**. The renewed historic significance of the surviving monuments created the case for World Heritage Site status, and this impacted greatly on policy and decision makers in the region **\[C1\]**. Listed buildings that had been subjected to neglect for decades, despite many attempts to rescue them, now ‘represent a significant regeneration opportunity’ with proposals for the heritage led regeneration of the site being driven by ‘The Hafod/Morfa Copperworks Project’, a partnership project between the Council and Swansea University **\[C2, C10\]**. This regeneration is now being realised publicly by the **Targeted Regeneration Investment Programme \(TRIP\) 2018**, through which the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks is set to receive over GBP2,000,000 of investment from a total of GBP27,000,000 for the south\-west region **\[C1\]**. Head of Economic Development and External Funding at Swansea Council says: ‘ *This is a major turnaround from 10 years ago when the site was covered in vegetation, forgotten and decaying. It can now look forward to a bright, collaborative future, part of a regional investment campaign, understood by key national and regional investment partners, and a place to live, work and play, celebrating the extensive heritage both of the works itself, and the wider legacy in the Lower Swansea Valley*’ **\[C2\]**. From 2015 through to the present day, Swansea University research staff have sat on the project boards for regeneration projects in the area and attended key decision\-making meetings on a range of issues relevant to redevelopment, restoration and public engagement in the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C10\]**. This has served as a key corollary through which the historic significance and heritage potential of the surviving assets has been communicated, in turn supporting the case for TRIP funding. These funds, traditionally reserved for investment in commercial and economic zones \(such as town centres/high streets\), have been targeted at ‘shell and core’ restorations of the physical heritage assets, in a plan to attract high\-end commercial ‘anchor tenants’ to further stimulate economic growth in the region. 

 In a climate where even in Cadw’s own report on **Valuing the Welsh Historic Environment \(2010\)**, primacy was given to the direct ‘economic value’ of the historic environment, the Lower Swansea Valley is experiencing a shift in approach to one that identifies the route to true sustainable economic growth lying first and foremost in the recognition of the historic significance and sense of place. The significance of Miskell and Bowen’s research has been identified by Cadw and the National Lottery Heritage Fund **\[C3\]**. The historical research that has established the importance to Britain of Swansea’s copperworking industries underpins place\-making policies now being advocated at regional and national governmental levels **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins> **The Cultural Impacts of Historic Significance**</ins> 

 Swansea historians led a sustained collaborative engagement campaign ranging from national events with 6,000 visitors \(The Man Engine Cymru, April 2018\), to National Lottery Heritage Fund\-supported renovation work. This has resulted in far greater public appreciation of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s copperworking industries **\[C4, C9\]**. Not only have these enriched the social and cultural life of a deprived area, but they have served to sharpen a sense of distinctive identity shaped by copper heritage, which has drawn the attention of a number of national broadcasters **\[C5\].** This is also evident from the large number of volunteers and visitors to the site over the past 5 years **\[C4\]**, which includes a group of committed people who have formed the Friends of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks group who take care of the site and offer guided tours **\[C9\]**. One of the group’s founders and current Chair, engineer Tom Henderson outlines the long\-term value of Swansea University’s instigation of the regeneration process: ‘ *the awareness of Swansea's past industrial process that Huw Bowen helped kickstart, \[…\] the archaeology, \[…\] archives searches and the oral histories \[…\] that the friends group have carried out have all helped clear the path to tangible progress in regenerating the former copperworks sites in the lower Swansea valley*’ **\[C4\]**. The success of this research\-informed University and volunteer partnership is set out by the Economic Development Officer, Swansea Council stating: ‘ *The collaboration between the council, university, friends and volunteers has shown that the model works well and can achieve excellent results and prove good value for money. We believe that this model can be used in the future for further phases of restoration*’ **\[C2\]**. 

 Research into the investment of Swansea copper firms in the latest plant and machinery has given impetus to the Musgrave Engine restoration project **\[G3\]**. The Musgrave Engine – the last surviving remnant of the advanced steam\-powered rolling technology in use on the Hafod Morfa site – is now being refurbished and rehoused as a visitor attraction. Involving primary school children in this process has done much to enrich local awareness of this vital cultural asset. As one teacher from Hafod primary says, **‘** *We have also learned a lot from our involvement in the Musgrave restoration project. Outreach workshops, creative sessions and trips are very beneficial to us in our learning*.’ **\[C8\]** 

 <ins> **An Attraction for Regional and SME Investment**</ins> 

 Swansea University’s research on the historical significance of the copper working industries to the Lower Swansea Valley has led ultimately to the iconic metal itself playing a major role in the construction, branding and public communication of a GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package for a new district in Swansea: **Copr Bay.** The landmark construction of the new district will be a copper bridge, and artist and designer Marc Rees notes that it, *‘represents the transition from the past to the future. It symbolizes Swansea’s aspiration to evolve, grow, flourish and become even more exciting but still very much rooted in a sense of place’* **\[C7\]**. The process of public consultation for this project is set to be informed by technologies developed through EPSRC funds allocated by CherishDE to the Hafod Morfa Copperworks as a ‘Resource Constrained Community’ **\[G2\] \[C7\].** 

 The historic significance of the copperworks, and the role the metal played in the emergence of a global distilling industry **\[R2\]**, is a key attraction for **Penderyn**’s desire to build a new distillery and visitor centre on the site **\[C7\]**. Research carried out at Swansea University has established the historic importance of whisky distilling firms as customers of Swansea copper firms, and is set to inform the content, interpretation and display within that visitor centre, creating a new narrative around how the copper goods produced in Swansea went on to have a global impact **\[R2\]**. Drawing on GBP3,500,000 of NLHF investment and an additional GBP4,000,000 of private sector investment, the future of the Power House, one of the site’s most important heritage assets, has been secured for at least another 100 years **\[C6\].** Within, copper equipment and technology will be utilized as part of an industrial process, 15 FTE jobs will be created and a 50,000 visitors will be attracted per annum. 

 An increased affinity for the copper ‘brand’ was exemplified by Swansea City FC’s adoption a copper heritage theme \(2015\) within the hospitality part of their Liberty Stadium \(located on part of the Hafod\-Morfa site\), a process informed by our researchers. A new white and copper playing kit for season 2015\-16 was also launched accompanied by a promotional video drawing directly on research by Swansea historians. Indeed the region is now furnished with a range of SMEs trading on the copper brand, including Copper Bar, Copperfish, Copper Bay Digital, Coppergate and the Copper Jack \- an illustration of how the historic and global significance of copper to the region, a narrative largely promoted by research at Swansea University, has created a brand identity that local businesses take pride in trading on **\[C7\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There are large health inequalities between social groups, neighbourhoods and regions. Newcastle University research found that higher rates of ill health in the North of England accounted for £13.2 billion in lost productivity, and also that social policies in England reduced heath inequalities between 2000 and 2010. These two main findings informed six Parliamentary Questions, five House of Commons debates and national policy discourse. Newcastle research also found that differences in health inequalities between European countries were influenced by health care and welfare state factors. Internationally, this informed European World Health Organization policy, which is mandatory for member states, to reduce inequalities. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Unmet need</ins> 

 There are large health inequalities in England, with life expectancy gaps of up to nine years between the most and least deprived local authorities**Footnote:**

 Iacobucci 2019, DOI:  [https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l1492](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l1492) 
. There is also a two\-year life expectancy gap between the northern and southern English regions, and health inequalities by socio\-economic status \(e.g. in terms of income, education and occupation\) are higher in the north. Across Europe, people of higher socio\-economic status have better health outcomes than those of lower socio\-economic status. Reducing these health inequalities is a policy priority for the NHS, Public Health England and international agencies such as the World Health Organization \(WHO\). 

 <ins>Newcastle research into health inequalities</ins> 

 Newcastle researchers have an extensive track record of investigating health inequalities. Over the last five years, they have studied: \(i\) the impact of regional health inequalities on economic productivity \(R1\); \(ii\) the impact of social policies and austerity on local health inequalities \(R2, R3, R4\); and \(iii\) variation in health inequalities across European welfare states \(R5, R6\). 

 As a result of their research into health inequalities, in 2018 CB and HB were commissioned by the Northern Health Science Alliance \(NHSA\)**Footnote:**

 Confirmed in a letter from the NHSA, available on request. 
to lead a report analysing the economic impact of health inequalities \(R1\). This provided the first econometric analysis of the impact of regional health inequalities on economic and productivity inequalities in the “Northern Powerhouse” \(North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber\). This Newcastle\-led report found that around a third of the £4 per person\-per hour productivity gap between the Northern Powerhouse and the rest of England is accounted for by the higher rates of ill health in the Northern Powerhouse. Newcastle University researchers also found that reducing the North\-South health divide could generate an additional £13.2 billion in UK gross value added. The report made recommendations on how the health and productivity gaps could be reduced, such as increasing NHS funding for prevention services and health science research by 10% in the Northern Powerhouse. 

 As part of a Leverhulme Trust\-funded £1 million Research Leadership Award to CB, she and colleagues TR and HB longitudinally analysed the impact of changing government policies on local health inequalities. Specifically, they examined the contrasting effects of the English Health Inequalities Strategy \(2000\-2010\) and the austerity policies \(since 2010\) on inequalities in infant mortality rates \(R2\-R4\). They found that inequalities in infant mortality rates between the top 20% most deprived local authorities and the rest of England decreased at an annual rate of \-0.116 during the period of the inequalities strategy \(R2\), and then increased again by 0.042 annually following the abandonment of the strategy in 2010 and the imposition of austerity \(R2, R3\). 

 CB led a NORFACE\-ESRC\-funded €1 million international project \(with collaborators from Norway, Germany and the USA\) which examined why health inequalities persist in European welfare states and methods to reduce them \(R5\). They found that the variation of health inequalities between and within different European countries was influenced by health care systems and welfare state institutional arrangements. With KT, this project also identified a range of policies with the potential to reduce health inequalities \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Creating Parliamentary debate</ins> 

 A crucial part of policy change is stimulating debate at Government level, to make decision\-makers aware of issues and to allow MPs to scrutinise and challenge policies before they are introduced. 

 In response to R1, six Parliamentary Questions on health inequalities and productivity were tabled by MPs, including Sir Alan Campbell \(Lab\), Sir George Howarth \(Lab\) and Andrea Jenkyns \(Con\), between February and July 2019 \(IMP1\). These questions received prompt written responses from Government, including the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Under\-Secretary of the Department for Health and Social Care \(H&SC\), whose responses indicated that they now understood the importance of this issue. Answers included: “Future decisions on the allocation of funding for local authority public health functions will take account of the impact on areas with the poorest health outcomes” \(IMP1f\); and “NHS England has committed to ensuring a higher share of funding goes towards geographies with high health inequalities” \(IMP1a\). 

 In addition, R1 created debate directly between Government and Opposition MPs in the House of Commons. The Shadow Public Health Minister mentioned R1 in a May 2019 debate \(IMP2\): “I recommend that every Member reads \[R1\]… Improving health in the north of England would… lead to substantial economic gains.” The Under\-Secretary of State for H&SC replied: “I share \[her\] passion for improved health outcomes in the north.” Further, Chi Onwurah \(Lab\) mentioned R1 in a July 2019 session on H&SC \(IMP3\): “In the north\-east, we die on average two years younger than in the south. The \[NHSA\] estimates that that costs our economy £13 billion a year, on top of the emotional and personal costs.” Matt Hancock replied, “Health inequalities is an underpinning part of the long\-term plan for the NHS; it is absolutely critical…”. Mary Robinson \(Con\) cited R1 in her speech on the economy in October 2019 \(IMP4\): “\[The\] Health for Wealth report indicated a strong link between health spending and the boost in productivity that we can expect.” 

 Wider Newcastle research on social policy and local health inequalities \(R2, R3, R4\) has also informed House of Commons debates. Dr Paul Williams \(Lab\) stated in March 2019 \(IMP5\): “Has the Secretary of State seen Professor Clare Bambra’s research…showing that inequalities… between deprived and more affluent areas fell between 1999 and 2010 when there was a Labour Government, and then increased from 2011 to 2017?” The Rt Hon. Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for H&SC, replied: “The best thing we can do to reduce health inequalities is ensure that more people are in work…” 

 Mary Kelly Foy \(Lab\) chose Health Inequalities as the subject of her March 2020 House of Commons maiden speech \(IMP6\). Informed by R2 and R3, she stated: “Even more shockingly, a recent report… \[R3\] showed that between the most deprived local authorities…and the rest, inequalities in infant deaths, which decreased sharply under the Labour Government \[R2\], have now started to increase under Conservative austerity \[R2, R3\].” 

 <ins>Informing national policy discourse</ins> 

 In April 2019, Matt Hancock used figures from R1 in a speech \(IMP7\): “Health inequality costs the North more than £13 billion a year... Preventing ill health can transform lives, transform our society, and reduce inequalities.” The Chief Executive Officer of the NHS, Simon Stevens, also referred to figures from R1 in a May 2019 lecture \(IMP8\): “About 30% of the productivity gap between the Northern Powerhouse and the rest of England is the consequence of higher rates of ill health.” This was significant as it showed that the report had provided the basis for national policy discourse by influential figures. 

 <ins>Informing</ins> <ins>WHO European Health Inequalities Policy</ins> 

 Newcastle research has also underpinned recent European WHO policy. In 2017, on the basis of her expertise on health inequalities in Europe \(R5, R6\), CB was appointed to the Scientific Expert Working Group to the Health Equity Status Report initiative \(HESRi\)**Footnote:**
, and her ‘substantial contribution’ is acknowledged in the summary documentation**Footnote:**

 [http://www.euro.who.int/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0016/412333/Hesri\-executive\-summary.pdf?ua=1](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/412333/Hesri-executive-summary.pdf?ua=1), page 8. 
. The Working Group, who provide scientific guidance to the WHO on monitoring health status, policy progress and governance practices, oversaw the development of the first ever HESRi. CB and KT wrote one of the key HESRi Policy Guidance products \(IMP9\), which fed in to the main HESRi \(IMP10\). 

 The HESRi resulted in a new policy resolution on reducing health inequalities in Europe \(IMP11\) being passed in September 2019, which committed the WHO, Member States and partners to note, implement and monitor the findings and recommendations of the HESRi. This means that all 53 countries covered by the WHO Europe region \(encompassing 900 million people\)**Footnote:**

 [https://www.euro.who.int/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0020/215660/The\-World\-Health\-Organization\-in\-the\-European\-Region\-Eng.pdf?ua=1\#:\~:text=WHO%2FEurope%20is%20made%20up,Member%20States%20across%20the%20Region](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/215660/The-World-Health-Organization-in-the-European-Region-Eng.pdf?ua=1) 
are committed to implementing policies to reduce inequalities and to monitor the impacts. 

 <ins>In summary</ins>, Newcastle research has stimulated debate at national level, which is a crucial part of the decision\-making process, as well as informing policy at European level.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Offences involving online Child Sexual Exploitation Material \(CSEM\) increasingly challenge the capacities of law enforcement, child protection, and clinical services. Research led by the University of Lincoln \(“onlinePROTECT”\) contributed to better understanding of pathways to CSEM offending, and the development of a new treatment planning tool. Professionals using the tool report increased competence working with CSEM offences. OnlinePROTECT’s research has been integrated into staff training within Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Services, which has been rolled out across England and Wales Probation Services. It has also underpinned treatment developments in the UK, USA, and Belgium, and influenced national and international public debate. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Every five minutes, the Internet Watch Foundation \(2018 Annual Report\) flags a webpage containing Child Sexual Exploitation Material \(CSEM\). As internet access has greatly expanded, so too has the number of individuals being arrested and managed by law enforcement and probation agencies for CSEM\-related offences. Initially conceptualised as an ‘old crime, new technology’ phenomenon, the unique characteristics of these individuals were poorly understood, precluding evidence\-based decision\-making about effective interventions and the optimal allocation of scarce agency resources. This knowledge gap gave rise to the onlinePROTECT research programme at the University of Lincoln, led by Dr Hannah Merdian \(University of Lincoln\) and Prof Derek Perkins \(Royal Holloway University of London, West London NHS Trust\). 

 Our initial research aimed to establish whether those who commit CSEM offences are psychologically and behaviourally distinct from those who commit direct, contact sexual offences against children. Findings from an anonymous survey of individuals enrolled in sex offender treatment **\[3.1\]** provided the first empirical differentiation of individuals who reported accessing CSEM material solely to facilitate inappropriate sexual fantasies \(fantasy\-driven offenders\) from those who reported accessing CSEM because of a motivation to have direct sexual contact with a child \(contact\-driven offenders\). This is a key distinction for practitioners formulating robust risk management plans and intervention strategies. 

 Our research also highlighted poor understanding of the fantasy\-driven subtype, making it difficult for professionals to comprehensively assess the individual factors that have contributed to, and may prevent, future offending behaviour. In response, we conducted a detailed case study analysis **\[3.2\]** to identify the pathways to fantasy\-driven offending, the potential risks posed, and the treatment needs of this population. This research identified commonalities in the histories, thinking styles, behavioural patterns, and environmental triggers that appeared to uniquely contribute to this form of offending behaviour. 

 Drawing on the research in **\[3.1\]** and **\[3.2\],** we developed a new etiological assessment tool, the onlinePROTECT CSEM Pathways Tool \(CPT; see Figure 1\). This tool identifies typical pathways to CSEM offending behaviour and supports professionals’ assessment of offender behaviour and treatment needs through systematic guidance. Importantly, the tool can also facilitate the client’s understanding of their own offence\-specific pathway, enabling them to co\-develop solutions for relapse prevention, desistance, and social reintegration. 



 **Figure 1: The OnlinePROTECT CSEM Pathways Tool** 

 In recognition of the need to ensure the tool’s usability in practice, we subsequently established the feasibility of integrating the CPT as part of group community treatment **\[3.3\].** Further research **\[3.4\]** confirmed that non\-contact CSEM offenders’ thinking patterns \(‘permission\-giving thoughts’\) differed from those of contact sex offenders. This led to the first conceptualization of implicit theories held by CSEM offenders **\[3.5\],** including ‘Unhappy World’, ‘Children as Sexual Objects’, ‘Nature of Harm \(CSEM variant\)’, ‘Self as Uncontrollable’, and ‘Self as Collector’. A cross\-cultural study **\[3.6\]** confirmed the presence of these in CSEM offenders in both the UK and Spain. 

 Overall, OnlinePROTECT research has provided insights into the trajectories of CSEM offending behaviour and psychological factors that underpin it. This information is of critical importance for professionals who need to understand the behaviour in order to develop prevention and intervention strategies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Online PROTECT research and the CPT has changed CSEM client treatment and case formulation practice and improved staff training and awareness across the offender management sector in the UK and internationally. 

 **Improving CSEM practitioner knowledge, treatment confidence and professional practice** 

 Between August 2013 and February 2020, 20 Online PROTECT workshops were delivered to community treatment providers, social work teams, prisons and probation services both in the UK and internationally \(Belgium, Canada, Hungary, New Zealand, Russia, USA\). The workshops aimed to fill knowledge gaps around CSEM offending behaviour and professional practice response and were attended by clinical psychologists, therapists, police, youth workers, and legal professions. Of those, 10 were fully evaluated \( *n* = 384; pre\-post training data\). Evaluation data \(collated and demonstrated through multiple figures in **\[5.1\]**\) demonstrates a clear and consistent pattern that the CPT training significantly increased attendees’ knowledge about the topic, psychological approach and risk, and confidence to conduct treatment \(e.g., 92.4% of respondents reported increased knowledge about CSEMos, **\[5.1** pdf *p.23* **\]** . Qualitative comments endorse the benefit of the CPT for practitioners \(e.g. “ *I believe the CPT has great potential to improve the ways in which we work with CSEM offenders.” and “Really helpful tool that I can envisage using a great deal.”*\) **\[5.1,** *p. 60* **\].** These benefits to knowledge are evidenced further by evaluations of a new CPT\-based training within Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service **\[5.2\].** 

 Online PROTECT research has also been integrated into staff training and treatment programmes internationally. The University Forensic Centre Antwerp, a provider of specialised out\-patient treatment for sexual offenders in Belgium, have used the *contact\-driven vs fantasy\-driven offending behaviour* distinction to improve client assessments **\[5.3\].** Counselling and Psychotherapy Centers Inc., a national provider of Sex Offender treatment programmes in the U.S.A, have revised their treatment curriculum to align with the domains identified in the CPT **\[5.4\].** The research has also influenced training content and professional practice in the assessment and treatment of CSEM offenders in Canada **\[5.5\].** 

 **Shaping HMPPS Response to CSEM Offending** 

 OnlinePROTECT has enhanced HMPPS staff practice in the management of CSEM offenders. Over 800 offender managers and probation staff have been trained to use the CPT in the North East and Midlands division of HMPPS alone and the CPT has now been integrated into the National Training Programme for staff working with individuals who have committed sexual offences, with training evaluations showing a “ *highly significant increase in all domains*”, particularly *“improved understanding of internet based offending”* and *“development of a comprehensive understanding of a service user’s risks and needs*” **\[5.6\].** The research was further integrated into the HMPPS’ training workshop for all staff working with perpetrators convicted of CSEM offending, is featured in training videos on the CPT and implicit theories on the HMPPS Staff Learning & Development Platform **\[5.2\]** and influenced the development of iHorizons, an HMPPS’ treatment programme for men convicted of internet related sexual offences **\[5.7\].** 

 **Influencing offender support practice in the Non\-statutory/ Charitable Sector** 

 OnlinePROTECT has also improved practice in the non\-statutory and charitable sectors. The Lucy Faithfull Foundation, one of the UK’s leading charities working with offenders to prevent child sexual abuse, report that the CSEM Pathways *Tool “assisted clients in their understanding of their offending”* and crucially *“helped structure individual intervention plans by providing a collaborative formulation between the facilitator and the client”* **\[5.8\].** In 2020, Circles UK, a national charitable provider who work with sex offenders to support reintegration back into the community, launched *Circles Reboot,* for individuals who have committed CSEM offences. Circles UK cite the importance of OnlinePROTECT in the conceptualisation of the programme design and enabling self\-assessment to be placed at the core of the programme **\[5.9\].** 

 **Informing Public Debate and Prevention** 

 OnlinePROTECT researchers helped develop a joint campaign by the Home Office, Internet Watch Foundation and Marie Collins Foundation to reduce child sexual exploitation by improving young men’s knowledge of the law around Indecent Images. Now in its fourth delivery phase, evaluation results have shown a year on year increase in young men’s understanding of the law in this area **\[5.10a\].** OnlinePROTECT researchers were also commissioned by the Centre for Expertise in Child Sexual Abuse \(https://www.csacentre.org.uk/\) to conduct an analysis of interventions for CSEM offenders.  Key findings from the report were included in the Centre for Expertise’s submission to the Independent Inquiry on Child Sexual Abuse’s Investigation into Child Sexual Exploitation by Organised Networks. The report, published on the CECSA’s website between Feb 2018 and July 2019 had 6,263\-page views from 3,965 users **\[5.10b\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

###  Participatory and arts\-based methods have been used to amplify marginal voices. The research has changed the way knowledge is produced, shared and used. *Partispace* led to a Greater Manchester\-wide Youth Charter. *Loneliness Connects Us* influenced the focus of the Co\-op Foundation and helped it to attract over GBP6,500,000 of funding, distributed to 343 organisations, engaging 18,734 young people across the UK in projects that counter loneliness. Post\-industrial communities in England and South Wales have shaped regeneration schemes and support services through our ‘Ghost Lab’ model. Our evidence has strengthened relationships between arts organisations and local communities, and informed Arts Council England’s approach to diversity. It has also informed national guidance on relationship education in Wales. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our innovative participatory research programme has developed through long\-standing relationships with communities and organisations in specific post\-industrial places where issues of social justice are acute. Batsleer, Rowley and Duggan’s work derives from youth\-work praxis, while Bright, Ivinson and McNicol develop arts\-informed methods to work in ex\-mining and socially\-marginal communities. Forging creative and ethical ways of working with a deep commitment to co\-production, the research investigates informal and inter\-generational learning to challenge dominant ways, in which knowledge is recognised, produced and valued, supporting people’s potential to become agentive. 

 Batsleer’s participatory action research project \(2008\-2010\) evaluated a combined arts and social work pedagogic space \( **The Blue Room** *\-* now the Men’s Room\) using methods that underpin many of the projects in this case study. It informed further investigations into how arts\-based strategies might open up advocacy, recognition and compassionate witnessing, rather than the tokenistic ‘giving voice’, so common in formal education and youth\-based projects **\[1\].** The research fed into the EU\-funded **Partispace** project \(2015\-18, EUR2,575,965\): a study of young people’s social and political participation across eight major European cities \(G1\). Batsleer co\-ordinated the Manchester team and led the comparative ethnographic work with 15 to 30 years\-olds, alongside Pais, Bright, Rowley and The Men’s Room’s Chris Charles. Rowley and Charles also conducted research with homeless men, using a garden design project with Grow Wild and Hulme Community Garden Centre as a vehicle. Project findings highlighted the ideological and discursive limitations of what is recognised as ‘participation’. They concluded that public policies and pedagogical practice should learn from young people’s activist practices and their role in building local democracy **\[2\].** The research informed a further Erasmus\+ project \- **Partibridges** to develop cooperation between higher education, youth workers and young people in the UK, France, Turkey and Portugal \(G2\). 

 **Loneliness Connects Us** \(2016\-18\) responded to Co\-op/Red Cross research, which found young people feel loneliness more than any other age group. The Co\-op Foundation wanted to support work in this area, but they also wanted to include the knowledge and experience of young people in discussions to ensure that their perspectives informed the decision\-making process. The Co\-op funded Batsleer, Duggan, McNicol and the charity, 42<sup>nd</sup> Street, to deliver a peer research project on youth loneliness \(G3\).Together, the team trained a group of young co\-researchers to investigate how loneliness affects young people using arts\-informed methods. Engaging 133 young people UK\-wide in conversations about loneliness through innovative approaches including scenario\-building and storytelling, it drew out new insights, which revealed that medicalised discourses of loneliness do not capture young people’s lived experiences **\[3\]** 

 Former steel and rail worker, Bright‘s research investigates how the fallout of large scale de\-industrialisation ‘haunts’ the present. Bright created the innovative **‘Ghost Labs’** model to surface ‘unspeakable’ intergenerational trauma. He expanded Avery Gordon’s concept of ‘ **social haunting**’ through **four interconnected projects** \(2015\-18, AHRC GBP115,865\) with community partners, including Unite the Community; The Co\-operative College; AMARC \(World Association of Community Broadcasters\); New Vic Theatre Borderlines; Jubilee Project; East Durham Arts Network \(EDAN\); Sheffield Live\! and Young Minds Rochdale \(G4\). The labs used ‘mosaic’ mixed methods approach to engage participants in memory work and storytelling, ‘attuning’ with artists to develop playful devices, such as ‘community tarot readings’; ‘instant playback theatre’ and ‘co\-operative poetry.’ These processes elicited the living knowledge rooted in post\-industrial communities, helping communities to express painful issues, and to move on to imagine possible futures **\[4\].** McNicol’s use of participant\-created comics, as a research method, played a key role, allowing members of Unite the Community in Barnsley to reflect upon their experiences. She combined this methodology with the Ghost Labs model to support British–Bangladeshi women in the **Graphic Lives** project \(Feb 2017 – Jan 2018, HLF\) to tell their life stories, expressing emotional truths that they had otherwise found difficult to convey **\[5\]\(**G5\). 

 **Productive Margins** \(ESRC/AHRC, 2013\- 2018\) comprised seven interlinked research projects, which asked young people to investigate important issues in their community \(G6\). Ivinson co\-led two in ex\-mining communities in South Wales with Renold \(Cardiff\) and artists Heloise Godfrey\-Talbot, Seth Oliver and Rowan Talbot. They devised arts\-based workshops to carefully attune to the lingering trouble induced by pathologising representations of community circulating in the media \(e.g. Channel 4’s SKINT\). Creative events enabled young people and youth workers at Forsythia Youth to express their concerns through films, art\-books, artefacts and dance, shared in community festivals, revitalising local traditions of activism **\[6\]**. 

 Ivinson and Batsleer secured GBP24,203 \(AHRC, Feb 2018 \- June 2019\) for a follow\-on project, **Creative Margins: Building capacity to widen participation in arts spaces and practices** \(G7\), which responded to the Culture White Paper’s \(2016\) expectation that ‘all museums, theatres, galleries, opera houses or arts groups that receive government money should reach out to everyone, regardless of their background.’ Manchester Metropolitan, 42nd Street, Tate, National Museum Wales, Arts Council England and the Federation for Detached Youth Work organised five ‘Barcamp’\-style workshop spaces across England and Wales to develop new models for effective partnerships between hitherto siloed fields. The new models draw on the strengths and creative resources of marginalised groups. Outputs were curated in a ‘ [scrapbook](https://issuu.com/mmuenglish/docs/cm_scrapbook_draft4),’ which offered insights and recommendations for the field.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has brokered active communication between grassroots and powerful institutional players, bringing marginalised voices and different types of knowledge to the fore in decision\-making processes. This has led to more representative **policymaking**, shaping the distribution of funding and making **public services** more responsive. It has benefitted those directly involved and generated wider **societal** **gain**. 

 <ins> **Partispace**</ins> participants represented Manchester, the UK and Europe as delegates to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. In 2018, Batsleer was seconded to Youth Focus North West \(YFNW\) to develop a European Living Charter of Human Rights with Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\). They worked with European and regional networks to create a Greater Manchester\-wide Youth Charter. Working in partnership with Sick\! Festival, 30 young people also produced a two\-day ‘takeover’ at NIAMOS arts centre \(2019\), which confronted a YouGov statistic that 18% of young people in the UK believe ‘life is not really worth living’. They delivered their response to the question: ‘For the lives of young people to be valued what needs to change?’ to 150 key stakeholders through commissioned artworks and live events. Supporting a 2018 report on cohesion that GMCA produced in response to the Manchester Arena bombing, the projects created “ *opportunities for young people to discuss difficult topics and have safe places to go and socialise with peers”*. The researchers were “ *absolutely vital”* in “ *ensuring that the process was rooted in meaningful and sensitive engagement with young people*” and the project “ *continues to inform \[Sick\! Festival’s\] commitment to working with young people across Greater Manchester, and the approaches that \[they\] take to doing this”*. **\[A\]** 

 YFNW also co\-created a  [Masters level unit in Youth Participation and Youth Work](https://europa.eu/youth/node/70542_hr) at Manchester Metropolitan through **Partibridges**, embedding workplace knowledge to resolve a gap between student skills and sector needs. The CEO stated: *“I felt disempowered in an academic setting but this project has helped break those barriers down”.* **\[B\].** Project partners are now developing a transnational module for European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System \(ECTS\) certification. Similarly, **Lost and Found** led to *“collaboration \- a shift in relational power dynamics towards a collective of artists rather than a project and creative lead and those being supported”*. Participants used it as an expressive vehicle, creating a series of art installations and four walking tours, which foregrounded their voices and experiences, and engaged over 100 people with their lived experiences of homelessness **\[C\]**. 

 <ins> **Loneliness Connects Us**</ins> shaped the Co\-op Foundation brand, which re\-launched in 2016 and “ *has been woven through everything \[it\] has done since”*. The Head of the Foundation states, “ *In the beginning we didn’t fully appreciate the complexity of youth loneliness or have a precise end goal we wanted to achieve. It was only through our further qualitative and quantitative research that we were able to define the problems we want to address”*. The research identified core themes and the reasons young people might be lonely. The researchers’ focus on societal context also re\-connected the Foundation with its co\-operative values. Combined with quantitative research conducted by ICM, the findings underpinned the Foundation’s report  [<ins> *All Our Emotions are Important – Breaking the Silence about Youth Loneliness*</ins>](https://assets.ctfassets.net/eua7b5q6or8q/1pcX29wfVuOoouCGWkyqoc/4cce48d22c4a9ce7d7ef69318f90a91a/Co-op_foundation_youth_loneliness_report.pdf), allowing it to communicate the full scale of the problem to the government and funders, including its parent company **\[D\].** 

 When Loneliness Connects Us started, the Foundation had 2.5 full\-time staff and five projects; it now has nine staff and hundreds of projects. Loneliness Connects Us was ‘ *a huge part of that growth’*. It underpinned successful bids to the DCMS/National Lottery Community Fund’s \#iwill scheme for youth social action \(GBP1,000,000\) and helped the Foundation to ring\-fence GBP2,400,000 of the government’s Building Connections Fund \(set up in response to the Jo Cox commission\) for young people. The findings also supported applications to the Co\-op for match\-funding, bringing the total to GBP5,400,000. The research shaped the focus of Co\-op Foundation’s overarching *Belong* programme, which distributed the funding, and guidance referred all applicants to the research. In total, *Belong* awarded GBP6,500,000 to 343 organisations across the UK, engaging 18,734 young people. It is on target to deliver measurable outcomes for 7,500 young people by 2021. In the assessment period, 5,033 young people have gained skills, 5,327 have improved confidence, 2,648 feel more valued and 3,130 have more trusting relationships. The young co\-researchers also highlighted the plight of under\-served towns, helping the Foundation to define the places it wants to benefit from its community\-focused Spaces to Connect funding \(GBP1,600,000\) **\[D\].** 

 42nd Street made isolation and loneliness a key theme in its business plan due to the research. It also helped it to secure Arts Council funding \(GBP49,101\) for a year’s worth of work on isolation and loneliness with young people. The CEO explained: *“The creative approach to the peer research enabled the real experiences of young people to be voiced and complexity of the issues and emotions surrounding youth loneliness to be captured. …we have made \[these insights\] the basis of discussions, social actions and change”*. **\[E\]** 

 <ins> **Social Haunting:</ins>** Judges awarded Bright the Working\-Class Studies Association’s Russo & Linkon Award in 2015. They reported that his research “ *breaks new paths… for comprehending the impact of the horrors and suffering caused by class society over generations*” \[ **F**\]. 350 people participated in the 14 Ghost Labs, which formed outlets to articulate this collective trauma. *The UnQuiet*, a piece of theatre produced by partner, New Vic Borderlines and members of Unite Community, was seen by over 100 people. A two\-part radio documentary, ‘ *Song Lines and Social Haunting*’ was broadcast to an estimated 150,000 listeners via stations in the UK, Malawi, Hungary, Slovenia, the USA and Indonesia, where ‘listening clubs,’ and phone\-ins served as catalysts to discuss local issues **\[F\].** The British Council in Bangladesh also used the *Graphic Lives* comics in public programmes as, “ *a powerful element to showcase our connection with UK and the Bangladeshi community living there*”. The UN Women’s Champion described them as “ *a new way to empower migrant women from the UK”*, whilst other attendees spoke of the hope the stories gave them. They also informed Hyde Community Action’s successful proposal for a Healthy Minds group support service **\[G\]**. 

 The Ghost Labs enabled Unite Community *“to reflect upon the difficulties that \[they\] face representing marginal, often very vulnerable members of society”*. Bright also briefed the Orgreave Truth & Justice Campaign on the projects, providing “ *useful contextual material in support of the legal argument for a public inquiry into the policing of the 1984 mass picket presented to the Home Secretary in Autumn 2015”*. The New Vic continues to use project tools in the UK and internationally. The Director states that Bright’s work “ *had a significant effect”* on the way it “ *designs work in communities where loss and absence \(in all its forms including loss of industry and identity\) is very much present”.* This has helped her to build ‘ *authentic relationships*’ with local partners, such as Unite, ACORN and Women Against Pit Closures, “ *all who are in their own words continuing the fight for their communities which was started decades ago”*. **\[H\].** 

 East Durham Artists’ Network \(EDAN\) produced an exhibition based on their Ghost Labs experience \(September 2018\) and, when Community Development Officers at The Auckland Project saw it, they realised they could adapt the methodology, “ *to tentatively build trust with participants respectfully, over time, affording them dignity and acknowledgement of their experiences and memories”.*  They used social haunting as a ‘conversation tool, for a pilot project that gave them “ *an emotional understanding of how everyone was feeling \[and\] how best to use funds to fill the gap left by government cuts in areas such as youth centres”*. The methodology has informed spending and led to new community\-driven projects, including a long\-term partnership to secure the future of the Woodhouse Close Community Centre and ‘Ghost Lines’ – a project to transform disused railway lines into ‘ *future\-facing spaces*’ through art trails and geocached ‘ *haunted objects’*. **\[l\]** 

 <ins> **Productive Margins:**</ins> In 2017, the Welsh Government’s Cabinet Secretary for Education formed a Relationships and Sexuality Education \(RSE\) Expert Panel. The panel invited Ivinson to present research evidence, and included her insights and examples from the Life Support project in the report it submitted to government. The resultant national guidance *Relationships and Sexuality Education in Schools* \(2019\), advocates for ‘ *relevant, engaging and coproduced*’ approaches and creative design, drawing heavily on the models foregrounded in Ivinson’s presentation. The guidance advocates youth\-led arts\-based pedagogies that focus on the concerns of young people instead of imposing topics drawn up by adults **\[J\].** 

 The films ‘Light Moves’, ‘Graphic Moves’ and ‘Life Support’ were shown in festivals in Cardiff, Newport and Merthyr Tydfil, each attracting over 200 people and speaking back to pathologising media images of the place where the participant\-producers live. They also used ‘Life Support’ to lobby against the threatened closure of Forsythia Youth, voicing their objections. Collaborator CEO of Artis Community argues that: “ *because \[Gabrielle\] doesn’t present as ‘other’, her curiosity encourages curiosity and her research becomes embedded in the creative process, enabling creativity to reveal the very best in people”*. She contends that her subsequent projects, including a Big Dance film that brought together over 400 children and young people, would not have achieved its ‘ *transformational outcomes*’ without Ivinson’s research methods. Addressing the ‘ *persistent and widespread lack of diversity*’, Arts Council England highlighted in its ten\-year strategy \(2020\-2030\), **Creative Margins** “ *influenced the way in which ACE will encourage the organisations we invest in to support and adopt new and emerging talent, to drive artist collaboration and to encourage learning at all levels”*. It also informed a developing partnership between Tate and Brighton Youth Centre, and has *“already impacted on some of \[BYC’s\] own work in broadening participation in our Arts Festival”*. **\[K\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 PANGU is a software package that generates realistic, synthetic images of planetary surfaces, asteroids, spacecraft and surface rovers to test and develop autonomous navigation, guidance, approach and landing technologies. PANGU was developed with European Space Agency \(ESA\) funding and is an essential, officially validated tool for core work performed in the Guidance Navigation and Control Section of ESA for current and future space missions. PANGU has enabled the validation and benchmarking of new technical solutions for autonomous guidance systems through simulating new and complex scenarios that are difficult or impossible to simulate in other ways. PANGU is a cost\-effective tool widely used by space agencies and industry in Europe, Asia, and the USA as a flexible software alternative to physical generation of test images with expensive laboratory robotic camera systems or flight tests on Earth. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 PANGU was conceived in 2002 as a tool to generate realistic, simulated images of rocky, airless, planetary bodies such as the Moon or Mercury to test vision\-based spacecraft as an alternative to expensive and less\-flexible physical mock\-ups. The most significant research concepts underpinning PANGU are a novel age\-degraded, overlapping crater model **\[R1\]**, novel techniques developed to generate asteroid models **\[R2\]** and a comprehensive camera model implemented in a Graphics Processor Unit \(GPU\) **\[R3, R4\]**. 

 The novel crater model simulates the geological process of impact cratering over time and has been demonstrated to enable the simulation of airless, rocky, planetary surfaces like the Moon or Mercury with sufficient realism to test and evaluate image processing and vision algorithms for spacecraft navigation, guidance and hazard avoidance. The initial research concepts were implemented in PANGU and extended to enhance the resolution of existing Digital Elevation Models \(DEMs\) of planetary surfaces to create hybrid real/synthetic multi\-resolution models. This extension enabled PANGU to generate simulated images of spacecraft landers from the start of the landing phase to touchdown on the surface **\[R1\]** at sufficiently fast frame rates to support real\-time testing, with image resolution requirements varying from kilometres at the start of the descent to centimetres at touchdown. 

 The impact of the original PANGU tool led to further funding from ESA to research and develop an extended range of mission scenarios on different solar bodies. This included synthetic asteroids for spacecraft navigation and approach simulations **\[R2\]**, LIDAR images to simulate laser ranging sensors, Mars surface models with dunes and multi\-resolution boulders to simulate Mars exploration and surface rover missions, atmosphere models, spacecraft, satellite and surface rover CAD models, stars, whole planet models, and a client\-server interface to enable PANGU to be integrated with other simulation environments. 

 The importance of PANGU to ESA was shown with the ESA\-funded, €600k PANGU v4 contract \(2014 to 2017\) to enhance the core features of PANGU to support the challenging simulation demands for future ESA missions. These included asteroid approach and landings **\[R2\]**, multiple high\-resolution landing sites, combining whole planet and enhanced elevation surface models to simulate full descent sequences from orbit to landing **\[R3\]**. They also included a novel Graphics Processing Unit \(GPU\)\-based camera model **\[R4\]** which enables real\-world camera noise and distortion effects to be applied to the simulations at high speeds to generate and render large models \(>80GB\) in closed loop simulations in real\-time to match the image processing capabilities of space\-qualified computing systems \(currently around 10 images per second\). PANGU outputs were verified for realism through image analysis comparisons with real images and by independent planetary scientists who verified the realism of PANGU images of the Moon, Mars and asteroids **\[R5\]**. 

 PANGU is continuing to be enhanced with a recent, further €400k funding from ESA which has supported research into improved realism of asteroids and boulders for testing missions to unknown small\-bodies, a web\-portal \( [https://pangu.software/](https://pangu.software/)\), and new research into realistically simulating infra\-red cameras for spacecraft landers and orbital rendezvous. PANGU has been supported by approximately €1.5M total funding.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 PANGU supports the testing and benchmarking of guidance systems for space exploration by providing a real\-time, virtual test environment for spacecraft lander navigation and guidance that is cost\-effective and flexible **\[E1\]**. 

 **Major missions** 

 ESA have provided a letter of support **\[E2\]** that highlights recent and current major space missions and projects where PANGU is being used. For example, ExoMars is a major ESA/Roscosmos space programme with an initial budget of over €1.3 billion. PANGU was used by Airbus Defence and Space \(UK\) to test the critical ExoMars rover perception system with simulated PANGU images and corresponding disparity maps, enabling the accuracy of the perception system to be quantified **\[E3\]**. 

 PANGU is cited by a senior ESA Engineer as “…, *an instrumental tool in robotic exploration for ESA, being used in different areas such as object recognition to perform early analysis in Mars Sample Return*"" **\[E4\]**. 

 ESA highlighted the impact of PANGU in April 2018, by selecting PANGU as one of the technologies that are ""Shaping the Future"", promoting the most successful and interesting activities within the ESA Technology Research and General Support Technology programmes **\[E5\]**. This is further corroborated by the section head of the ESA Guidance Navigation and Control Section at ESTEC \(TEC\-SAG\), “ *PANGU has been an essential tool throughout the years for a number of tasks at the core of the work performed in the Guidance Navigation and Control Section of ESA. Both in developing new technologies in the area of vision\-based navigation and in supporting project developments relying on this technology \(notable examples in the last few years are ExoMars, Mars Sample Return, Hera, PILOT, Heracles/EL3, the CleanSpace initiative\), the image rendering capability of PANGU has been used to design, develop and test the image processing algorithms enabling vision\-based navigation application.” **\[E6\]**.* 

 **Cost\-effective solution** 

 PANGU can simulate a wider variety of scenarios and terrain types than is possible with alternative physical testing such as laboratory cameras mounted on robotic arms taking images of physical mock\-ups, or drone/helicopter flight\-testing \(which is limited to Earth terrain, lighting and atmospheric conditions\). By increasing the range of possible testing scenarios to verify navigation and landing technologies required for future space missions, PANGU significantly reduces the cost of generating test images and can be integrated with other spacecraft test systems. According to the ESTEC TEC\-SAG section head “ *Space images of celestial objects, especially those with the right resolution and radiometric properties to allow their use in spacecraft navigation and those of little\-known objects, are a rare resource, hence the flexibility of PANGU to artificially generate high\-fidelity images provides a key benefit in reducing the cost of generating test images and enabling rapid prototyping of vision\-based navigation solutions in real\-time closed\-loop test facilities*.” **\[E6\]**. 

 **Benchmarking and validation** 

 PANGU is an officially validated tool \(by ESA\) and is being used to benchmark and validate new technical solutions for autonomous guidance “ *The availability of a validated tool such as PANGU allowed, on one hand, ESA contractors to focus their efforts on algorithm development, rather than on image generation, and, on the other hand, allowed ESA to have common benchmark to evaluate and compare technical solutions developed by different contractors”* **\[E6\]**. 

 According to a senior ESA engineer on the ESA Lunar Resource Lander Team \(HRE\-PL\): “ *PANGU is used extensively in the frame of the PILOT project \(Precise and Intelligent Landing using Onboard Technologies\)…* *PANGU is used for the generation of realistic landing images and 3D models, which are used, in simulation and in test on representative HW, to validate the PILOT functions*” **\[E7\]**. 

 PANGU is also being used to prove test and develop guidance systems. A unique, resolution\-enhanced model of Phobos, a moon of Mars, was created with PANGU to support the ESA Phootprint activity \(Phobos Sample Return\) to prove the technologies for a Phobos sample\-return mission by generating higher resolution, representative images of Phobos than would otherwise be possible. GMV Innovating Solutions \(a large, private, international technology company\) then used PANGU with this model to generate simulated images of Phobos for their high\-fidelity simulator to validate their feature tracking navigation algorithms by emulating the behaviour of the spacecraft sensors **\[E8\]**. 

 **Proving and validating future space technology** 

 PANGU is having significant impact in developing and verifying future generic space navigation technologies. For example, GMV \(UK\) have also integrated PANGU within their Harwell Robotics and Autonomy Facility \(HRAF\), which supports the integration, validation, and verification of autonomy components for Entry, Descent and Landing Systems \(EDLS\) and surface rover mission scenarios. According to a Space Segment & Robotics Engineer from GMV \(UK\): “ *In the UK, PANGU is being used in the frame of an ambitious ESA activity called Harwell Robotics and Autonomy Facility \(HRAF\). In HRAF, PANGU is an integral component in the architecture of a large, multi\-site distributed simulation environment which includes multiple GMV and ESA sites.” and “PANGU is a core component in HRAF which provides synthetic images of the given scenario to the simulator. … in the context of Verification & Validation of the complex autonomy and GNC systems required in ambitious Space Missions, such as Mars Sample Return and HERA*” **\[E9\]**. 

 **International Impact** 

 PANGU is freely available to any institution working on ESA\-funded projects, thus benefitting companies and institutions involved in the development and evaluation of ESA missions. It is also having an increasing impact outside Europe though PANGU licenses sold by STAR\-Dundee Ltd for non\-ESA missions. 

 STAR\-Dundee is a University of Dundee spin\-out company that specialises in spacecraft on\-board data\-handling and processing technologies. \[text removed for publication\]. 

 MathWorks \(a USA corporation specialising in mathematical software\) recently developed a MATLAB workshop to showcase their powerful MATLAB Vision and Deep\-learning Toolboxes by running MATLAB algorithms on a PANGU image sequence of descent to the challenging lunar South Pole region. PANGU was attractive for MathWorks because PANGU “ *provided realistic simulated images of simulated descent on challenging terrain that would otherwise be difficult for us to obtain*” and “ *we see growing interest from our customers to use MATLAB and Simulink together with PANGU to develop and validate space navigation algorithms*. *”* This is corroborated by a letter of support **\[E12\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Oxford Wildlife Conservation Research Unit \(WildCRU\) developed and applied a suite of analytical techniques in landscape conservation ecology, based on innovative field methodologies using animal tracking and survey techniques, to understand the distribution, ecology, population biology and vulnerability of the majority of the world’s cat species. The research has directly shaped land\-use and conservation policies and practice across at least 15 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. New conservation measures based on this research have helped to protect endangered and vulnerable felids including clouded leopard species, the Indochinese leopard, African lion and Scottish wildcat, and entire ecosystems important for biodiversity and local populations have had improved protection. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Felid species play outsized roles in ecosystems as top\-down regulators of community structure, but 27 of the approximately 37 species of wild Felidae are classified as threatened, and all are impacted by human activities, habitat loss and conflict. Since the 1980s, research by the University of Oxford’s WildCRU, led by David Macdonald, has addressed the conservation status and threats facing 28 felid species. Since 2000, WildCRU has made major advances through developing field technologies and methods of analysis, and applying these in an integrated, policy\-relevant manner. 

####  Camera\-trapping & GPS\-tracking 

 Since 2012, WildCRU have developed methods and deployed camera\-traps across a broad range of biomes, amassing more than 12,000,000 images of more than 300 terrestrial vertebrate species from 11 countries and covering more than 40,100km<sup>2</sup>. This has provided the world’s largest and most extensive remote camera database for felids. They have GPS\-tracked more than 200 big cats, providing the largest lion movement tracking database, and the only GPS data on clouded leopards. These field technologies are exemplified by a study of 50 GPS\-tracked African lions over 10 years in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area \(KAZA\) in Southern Africa \[1\], and systematic camera trap surveys in Laos between 2013 and 2017, at approximately 300 locations \[2\]. 

####  Animal movement and population connectivity 

 University of Oxford WildCRU research made several important contributions to developing methods of modelling animal movement and predicting population connectivity. For example, using GPS\-tracking data, they used a resistance surfaces approach to model patterns of connectivity of different lion demographic groups \[1\]. These methods provide empirically\-based knowledge of factors that drive animal habitat use and movement, which is essential for accurate assessment of impacts of landscape change. Also using GPS data, they developed two of the most powerful methods of connectivity analysis: resistant kernel and the factorial least cost path analysis \(e.g. \[3\]\), which improve assessment and mapping of population connectivity, corridors and barriers, and enable assessment of connectivity at multiple scales. 

####  Multiple\-scale species distribution modelling 

 With empirical data from camera\-traps, the researchers used machine learning methods to optimise multivariate, multiscale habitat relationships, improving the accuracy and utility of species distribution modelling for rare carnivores \[2, 4\]. The novel analytical approaches used by WildCRU improved prediction of habitat selection and species distributions, and these methods and analyses – exemplified by the research on tigers and leopards in Laos \[2\] and felids including Sunda clouded leopards in Sabah \(Borneo\) \[4\] provide essential information for ecological assessment and conservation planning. In Sabah, the camera\-trap survey \[4\] was a collaboration with the director of the field station \(B. Goossens, University of Cardiff\). 

####  Habitat and Scenario Analysis 

 WildCRU researchers have integrated several major branches of ecological research – multi\-scale modelling, connectivity modelling and individual\-based genetic and population simulation approaches – to evaluate spatially explicit scenarios, such as infrastructure developments or conservation interventions \(e.g. \[5, 6\]\). This research enables identification of solutions that meet economic objectives while maximizing the efficacy of biodiversity protection. For example, directly with government officials in countries including Borneo \[5\] and Myanmar \[6\] they developed and applied data\-driven ‘tool kits’ to evaluate large numbers of realistic alternative future scenarios, to support decision making.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The integrated techniques developed by WildCRU for modelling ecological processes and assessing their impacts on wild felids have had widespread impact on decisions and implementation by policy\-makers, conservation practitioners, and planners worldwide. 

####  Influencing policy to protect essential habitats 

 **Ulu Muda, Malaysia** 

 In **Malaysia**, WildCRU research had a crucial role in delivering protection of Ulu Muda Forest, which is one of the most critical pristine forests remaining in the region, rich in biodiversity and providing essential habitat for vulnerable clouded leopards and many other species. Ulu Muda covers approximately 160,000ha and is also the source of water for 4,200,000 people and at least 40% of the country’s rice production. WildCRU studies of rare leopards in Ulu Muda in 2015 and integration of data into Malaysian national planning for clouded leopards in 2017 \(using tools exemplified in \[2, 4, 5\]\) attracted significant interest from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia \(PERHILITAN\) \[A\]. Their camera\-traps documented illegal logging and poaching at Ulu Muda, which WildCRU and a local conservation group communicated in 2017 in a video “Saving Ulu Muda” \[Bi\] that was broadcast on national television as well as online \[A\], and WildCRU work was extensively highlighted in press coverage \[Bii\]. These videos were coupled with a petition that gained over 102,000 signatures \[A, Biii\]; one month after the petition was sent the government, all logging permits at Ulu Muda were revoked in September 2018 \[A, Biv\]. 

 **Myanmar** 

 In 2018 in **Myanmar**, the results of WildCRU analyses \(including \[6\]\) of the impact of many major past, ongoing and potential future developments on clouded leopard populations were presented to senior government officials including the Director General of the Myanmar Forest Department, and international non\-governmental organisations \[C\]. After meeting D. Macdonald, Aung San Suu Kyi \(State Counsellor of Myanmar and Minister of Foreign Affairs\) assigned people from her personal charity to facilitate application of the WildCRU methods in Myanmar \[C\]. Based on this research and using the WildCRU ‘toolkit’, the Forest Department modelled important wildlife corridors for felids at the country\-scale and applied this information to assess the environmental feasibility for all development projects in the country \[C\]. These development assessments included proposed mining exploration in northern Myanmar and proposed highway development project in central Myanmar. 

 **Wider South\-East Asia** 

 Similarly, in **Borneo** from 2017, WildCRU used their multispecies modelling tools \(e.g. \[5, 6\]\) to assess the likely impact of 59 components of the infrastructure and land\-use plans in Sabah state \(the Sabah Structure Plan 2033\) on the vulnerable Sunda clouded leopard; notably, Sabah has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. This analysis influenced senior government officials, exemplified by a meeting with the Sabah Deputy Chief Minister in 2018 \[A, Di\].  WildCRU multi\-species and multi\-scale analyses \(exemplified by \[5, 6\]\) have also helped several other governments in South\-East Asia to identify important areas for conservation, such as core habitats and corridors. For example, in **Thailand**, a key breeding area for tigers was identified as threatened by a proposed major roadway and dam project, contributing to UNESCO strongly advising against the development in 2017 \[Dii\]. In **Bhutan**, WildCRU has worked closely with the government to develop a toolkit identifying key areas for conservation \[Diii\]. In **Sumatra, Indonesia**, in 2020 the government planned designation of high conservation value areas based on WildCRU methods, and adopted the framework for identifying core areas and corridor networks between protected areas \[Div\]. 

####  Shaping landscape\-level land use strategies 

 **KAZA Transfrontier Conservation Area** 

 The WildCRU landscape conservation planning toolkits and analyses \(based on research including \[1, 3\]\), including approximately 6,000,000 camera\-trap images, have directly guided development and conservation decisions in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area \(KAZA TFCA, spanning **Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, Angola**\), an area of approximately 520,000km<sup>2</sup> with exceptionally high global biodiversity value. WildCRU has worked closely with KAZA officials \[E\] and led workshops in Botswana and Zimbabwe in October 2018, attended by senior government and conservation officials \[E, F\]. Through these close interactions, WildCRU research has directly influenced incorporation of wildlife corridors and landscape connectivity into large\-scale development and conservation strategies including: Master Integrated Development Plan for KAZA TFCA \(2015\-2020\); Wildlife Dispersal Areas for KAZA TFCA \(2013\-2015\); and KAZA Carnivore Conservation Coalition Strategy \(2018\-2022\) \[E, F\]. The Executive Director of the KAZA Secretariat stated that the impact of the WildCRU research has been “ *hugely significant and at a landscape\-level scale*” \[E\]. Within KAZA, the research has also shaped national policies, including in **Zimbabwe**. The Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority National Coordinator for Transfrontier Conservation Areas stated that WildCRU research was important for landscape\-level scale integrated land\-use planning that evaluated the compatibility of activities such as mining, tourism, conservation around Hwange National Park, directly influencing the Authority’s thinking on lion conservation, and providing “ *pivotal*” information for policies including the Hwange National Park General Management Plan \(2016\-2026\) and Lion Conservation Strategy for Zimbabwe \(2020\-2025\) \[F\]. 

 **Kenya** 

 Similarly, in **Kenya**, WildCRU modelling \(based on research including \[1, 3\]\) supported the government and the Kenya Wildlife Service \(KWS\) to develop the national Recovery and Action Plan for Lion and Spotted Hyena 2020\-2030 \[G, Hi\], for these two species with important ecological roles in savannah ecosystems and major population declines. Launched in August 2020, the action plan takes landscape\-level approaches towards conservation and includes utilisation of the WildCRU decision support toolkit methods \[Hi\]. The Minister for Tourism and Wildlife acknowledged the key role of WildCRU in the action plan \[G, Hi\]. The Chief Executive of a landowner membership organisation \(The Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association\), also representing Maasai communities, commented that “ *the National Strategy, and the consultations and research that underpinned it…have already changed things here, both on the ground and at a policy level*” and that the work is “ *a beacon of how conservation should interact with local people and with local decision makers to deliver impact on the ground*” \[Hii\]. 

####  Enhancing species protection 

 **International species status** 

 WildCRU research has informed international decision\-making on the status of several felid species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Red List of Threatened Species is used globally as a basis for conservation and policy changes, and WildCRU data has been essential for assessments that have determined the status of felids in South\-East Asia \(confirmed by \[A\]\): Sunda clouded leopard \(vulnerable, 2015\) \[Ii\]; Borneo bay cat \(endangered, 2016\) \[Iii\]; marbled cat \(near threatened, 2015\) \[Iiii\]; leopard cat \(least concern, 2015\) \[Iiv\]; and, crucially, the up\-listing of the Indochinese leopard to critically endangered in 2019 \[Iv\], based almost entirely on WildCRU work \[J\]. In 2017, lions were added to the UN Convention on Migratory Species \(CMS\), and the Head of the Terrestrial Species Team for CMS confirmed that evidence from WildCRU research on lions \(\[1, 3\], as examples of a large body of work\) was pivotal in this decision \[Ki\]. Furthermore, the Chief of the UN CITES \(Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora\) Science Unit stated that WildCRU work on lions has been *“extremely influential”* on decision making, including on measures for conserving lions and other big cats that the 183 Parties to CITES agreed to in 2016 and 2019 \[Kii\]. 

 **National action to protect rare leopards** 

 The work by WildCRU and their collaborators on Sunda clouded leopards in Sabah, **Borneo** \(Malaysia\) \(e.g. \[4, 5\]\), underpinned an international workshop on conservation of this species in June 2017 and the drafting of the first state\-level action plan for the species \[A\]. This ‘Sunda Clouded Leopard Action Plan for Sabah’ was endorsed by the state government in June 2019 \[A\], and was instrumental in securing a donation of approximately GBP700,000 \(MYR4,000,000, 06\-2019\) from the Sime Darby Foundation to support anti\-poaching work, in June 2019 \[A\]. 

 In **Cambodia**, camera\-trap work by WildCRU \(exemplified by \[2\]\) since 2012 showed an alarming population decline in one of last remaining populations of Indochinese leopards. From 2014, this resulted in WWF\-Cambodia and local authorities changing their patrolling regime to focus on hotspots of remaining leopards and hiring 6 new WWF staff in 2016 to improve efficacy of patrols \[J\]. The WildCRU data also led to implementation of snare\-removal teams \(which have removed 5,000 snares between 2016 and 2020\), and identification of poacher movements, leading to arrests \[J\]. As an emergency measure to protect the last leopards, WWF implemented fencing of areas where the leopards occur, identified from the camera\-trap data. WWF\-Cambodia stated that the WildCRU research “ *has led to vast improvements and increased efficiency of our law enforcement activities, approved by the Cambodian government”* \[J\]. 

 In **Iran**, WildCRU used species distribution models \(e.g. based on \[2, 4\]\) to map potentially suitable habitats for the Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah. In 2019, these data influenced the inclusion of the Persian leopard in the Central Asian Mammals Initiative \(CAMI\) and the Iranian Department of Environment’s submission for future inclusion in the UN CMS \[Li\]. The WildCRU work directly resulted in the development of a tool kit for managing conflict between human and large carnivores, including Persian leopards, which was distributed to more than 3,000 Iranian rangers, and formally adopted and published in 2019 by the Iranian Department of Environment \[Lii\]. 

 **Shaping conservation actions for the Scottish wildcat** 

 WildCRU applied their camera\-trap and GPS collar approaches \(exemplified by \[1, 2\]\) to survey wildcats in **Scotland** from 2010 and 2015, respectively \[M\]. The camera\-trap data and WildCRU researchers made important contributions to the 2015 Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan, including identifying 6 priority areas for conservation efforts \[M\]. These data, and WildCRU work on wildcat genetics, led to the IUCN concluding in 2018 that the wildcat was at risk of immediate extinction in Scotland without population reinforcement \[M\]. In response, the European Union funded the Saving Wildcats project \(2019\-2015\) to re\-introduce and reinforce wildcat populations, with WildCRU GPS data contributing to choices of re\-introduction sites \[M\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 JournalTOCs helps researchers to timely access ‘personalised’ new research by alerting them when new articles are published in their selected journals and, by providing them with full\-text links when the articles are Open Access \(OA\). These OA links were the result of JEMO, a technology developed by JournalTOCs in 2014 to resolve the problem of OA articles published in hybrid journals being erroneously kept behind pay\-walls. Since 2015, JEMO has been adopted by over 20,000 scholarly journals and publishing platforms including Atypon. This has led to JournalTOCs being used extensively worldwide by multiple research centres, libraries and multinationals. JournalTOCs also works with over 3,770 scholarly publishers and its effect reaches 78 licensed research centres in 19 countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 JournalTOCs is a university spin\-off from research undertaken at the ICBL \(Institute for Computer Based Learning\) of Heriot\-Watt University. JournalTOCs technology includes real\-time data\-mining software to discover latest content published in scholarly journals. The software first aggregates, normalises and enriches metadata and then makes it freely available for reuse. JournalTOCs uses JEMO to identify OA content in the metadata extracted from hybrid journals. 

 To further develop JournalTOCs JEMO was the result of a project funded by the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account \(IAA\) \(2015\). The project had twofold objectives: 

1.  to help publishers make their journal metadata readily available for systematic identification of OA articles and, 

1.  to prevent OA articles from being labelled as non\-OA across the production, 

 discovery, and delivery chain of e\-journals. 

 The JEMO project was a partnership formed by the ICBL with five publishers \(Oxford University Press, Libertas Academica, Edinburgh University Press, IGI Global and Thieme\), INASP \(the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications\) and a consortium of six NHS\-England hospital libraries. JEMO includes a metadata schema adapted from the Dublin Core, PRISM and Creative Commons \(CC\) metadata schemas. JEMO showed publishers how it was possible to make their OA content discoverable, using a cost\-effective and relatively technically easy process. At that time, NISO produced its own specifications \(the NISO RP\-22\-2015 recommendation\) and disseminated its usage among publishers. However, JEMO has proved to be much more effective than the NISO RP\-22\-2015 metadata specification and has been widely adopted by publishers and hosting platforms. The results produced by the JEMO project was expanded with the MOOD Knowledge Transfer Project to cover online\-first articles. 

 The application of these technologies developed by the ICBL for JournalTOCs resulted in a free service for hundreds of thousands of individual users. In addition, a Premium service, created to ensure the sustainability of the spin\-off, has been licensed to more than 70 large and small research centres and libraries worldwide at very economic licence rates. Of special relevance to Open Access, and crucial to the Plan S initiative of the European Science Foundation, is the tagging of journals in the JournalTOCs database as OA or hybrid. In 2018, JournalTOCs included more selected OA journals than other services, and was unique in having identified and included individual OA articles from more than 12,000 hybrid journals. A coherent subject indexing further enhances the value of JournalTOCs.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

  

 Licensed research centres and libraries from hospitals, universities, governmental agencies, global organisations, banks as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies use JournalTOCs. They use JournalTOCs to discover critical research results for their researchers. The usefulness of JournalTOCs was enhanced when the results of the JEMO \(2015\) and MOOD projects were integrated within JournalTOCs, enabling it to provide users with full\-text links for individual OA articles. JEMO has been adopted by over 20,000 scholarly journals and publishing platforms such as Atypon, leading to JournalTOCs now working with over 3,770 scholarly publishers and its effect reaches 78 licensed research centres in 19 countries. 

 Research\-driven biopharmaceutical companies such as NovoNordisk Pharma, Roche and Ferring Pharmaceuticals as well as hospitals from the NHS, The Australian Health Service \[5.1\] and the New Zealand Police are using JournalTOCs, thus saving considerable time and resources. The Information Resource Manager from Ferring Pharmaceuticals described how his company uses JournalTOCs, ""The service is used as a one\-stop\-shop for signing up for TOC alerts. As knowledge workers in commercial organisations \(based on R & D activities\) we are in a combined situation of being extremely dependant on having exhaustive knowledge of new developments within our research field and having very little time to identify all relevant sources of information. A service that allows you to quickly and conveniently sign up for TOCs from any journal of potential relevance is a highly valuable tool."" \(5.2\) 

 The Knowledge & Information Coordinator \(New Zealand Police Library\) confirmed that, 

 ”Having an institutional licence to JournalTOCS over the last five years……has enabled us to provide a one\-stop\-shop approach to providing table of contents alerting to all our subscribed journals. If we did not have an affordable product like JournalTOCs, it would be a logistical nightmare trying to provide a table of contents service to our customers” \[5.3\]. 

 The European University Institute, Library describing the, “unified interface and the alerts’ service”...as…”particularly valuable” \[5.4\]. 

 Over 70 companies and organisations bought licences for JournalTOCs Premium services and thousands of researchers and librarians use the free version of the technology every day. In addition, many research organisations from the UK, USA, France, Denmark, Canada, Australia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Italy, Norway, Germany, Brazil and Spain, are accessing information tagged with JEMO elements through JournalTOCs web services \(API\) to integrate new research with OA identification in their own applications. In addition, important worldwide organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization \(FAO\), the International Monetary Fund's \(IMF\) Library Network, the International Labour Organization \(ILO\), and the European Commission are Premium partners of JournalTOCs. 

 The largest consortium was signed with the Indian Space Research Organisation \(ISRO\) to provide premium access to new research, identified as Open Access or non\-OA regardless of their provenance. The ISRO consortium includes 17 large aerospace research centres located in different parts of India \( [https://www.isro.gov.in/about\-isro/isro\-centres](https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/isro-centres)\). The leading research centre of ISRO is the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre \(VSSC\). This consortium has been running since June 2017. Since the formation of the consortium JournalTOCs has been introduced to all libraries under ISRO. Currently 17 libraries are using this service and total number of users is about 8,000. In the VSSC library there are about 2,000 users and some of them following approximately 100 journals \[5.5\]. 

 In addition, JournalTOCS established a partnership with the Quality Open Access Market \(QOAM\) service. QOAM was created by the CWTS \(Centre for Science and Technology Studies\) of Leiden University from The Netherlands. QOAM is a marketplace for scientific and scholarly journals which publish articles in Open Access. JournalTOCs has become critical to QOAM operation in matching author experiences with a journal against its publishing fees \[5.6\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2015, research by Bath Spa University’s Hazard, Risk and Disaster Group \(HRD\) in countries on the Development Assistance Committee’s \(DAC\) list has increased resilience to climate change and disaster risk challenges; conditions which otherwise disproportionally afflict exposed and vulnerable communities. Focusing on Kiribati \(Micronesia\) and the Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh \(Indian Himalayan Region\), research contributed to: the improvement of local community understanding, voice, and action with regard to environmental and disaster risk reduction management challenges; the reframing of climate change as a cultural challenge, achieving empathetic reach internationally through film screenings and public dialogue; the development of disaster risk policy at local and regional levels; and the generation of enterprise and client gain by seeding a film production house in India and a children’s literature authorial career in the UK. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Climate change, sustainable development and disaster risk are interrelated global challenges which are particularly acute and less well understood in sensitive/remote high\-mountain and low\-elevation island settings. Here the most vulnerable communities are often doubly disadvantaged, possessing the least agency in decision\-making processes. The underpinning research led by Johnson and Penrhyn Jones with international collaborators, over a period of more than 5 years in such locations has generated and responded to this. The India and Kiribati portfolios share thematic foci and methodological approaches, with film serving as a method of research, engagement and impact. Combined, this approach promoted understanding and agency within and between local communities and government, in relation to global debates. 

 **India** 

 Since 2013, Johnson and Edwards’ research focused on the Kullu District, which is experiencing a high frequency of hazard events and increasing disaster risk. This stems from multiple stressors associated with climate change/variability, population change, expanding resource utilisation and rapid infrastructure development. The research has developed and connected understanding of flood disaster impacts and community responses; historical flood chronologies in the Kullu District, 1846 onwards, via UGC\-UKIERI funded project  [<ins>HiFlo</ins><ins>\-DAT</ins>](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/projects/hiflo-dat-hazard-database/) \(2018\-2020\); and disaster risk reduction strategies to enhance community resilience. 

 Early empirical research \(2013\-2018\), including with the University of Manitoba \[redacted text\] and the University of Winnipeg \[redacted text\], focused on field\-based reconstruction of flash floods, exploration of existing post\-disaster community vulnerability and resilience through concepts of heritage and capital \(R1\), and also piloted film production \(2013\-2014, section 4\). These enabled a more detailed understanding of the causation, impact cascade and responses to an August 1994 Kullu District flood disaster, than had previously been reported. It also highlighted that the availability and use of both formal and local knowledge is pivotal to mountain community disaster risk reduction and resilience in the region, which is heavily affected by prevailing government policy. 

 Building on and consolidating these foundations, in partnership with the GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment \(GBPNIHE\) and Kraft Films, the 2018\-2020 ‘Pathways to Resilience’ research used film in conjunction with public engagement activities. It has deepened analysis of local knowledge of hazard events and approaches to disaster risk governance \(R2\). This has culminated in research\-led policy\-practice change recommendations to Indian government and NGO stakeholders \(R3\). The portfolio of underpinning research has revealed a pressing need to question the significant under\-utilisation of informal local knowledge of hazard events and adaptation by current disaster risk governance models in India. It also demonstrated the need to both address poor understanding amongst indigenous and refugee communities of existing disaster management policy, and capture their substantial desire to become involved in new Disaster Risk Reduction \(DRR\) efforts. These findings reveal the value and opportunity afforded by film to enhance DRR knowledge exchange. 

 **Kiribati** 

 Penrhyn Jones also uses film to shape interdisciplinary research agendas \(R4\-6\). As Co\-investigator on the UK research project 'Towards Hydrocitizenship' \(AHRC, 2014\-2017\), Penrhyn Jones found that environmental communication should develop a community’s own capacity for storytelling and action \(R6\). There was also value in exploring climate change in exploratory, authentic ways, through local attachments; findings later embodied in her film *TIMELINE* \(R5, 2017\). The emergence of this insight both underpinned and was reinforced by Penrhyn Jones' work in Kiribati \(supported by initial UK coastal case studies\), developed through two AHRC\-funded research projects which she led from 2015 to 2018. Exploring climate change and heritage through documentary film \( *Troubled Waters*, R4, 2015\), three key findings emerged \(2015\-2016\). Firstly, understanding climate change and displacement in Kiribati requires engagement with a very specific indigenous relationship to land and water. Secondly, there was local researcher fatigue and frustration with global media representation. Thirdly, although climate change poses an existential threat, other environmental issues are also important to communities. In response to these findings, Penrhyn Jones’ further research in Kiribati \(2016\-2018\) adapted, taking a participatory turn. The project involved collaboration with a local artist and heritage expert to celebrate indigenous knowledge in a film and worked with a local environmental organisation \(KiriCAN\) to address local environmental priorities.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Climate change and hazard processes are key stressors in driving the exposure, vulnerability, and disaster losses of remote communities, especially those located in sensitive high mountains and coastal lowlands. Evidence for the positive difference made to these communities in India and Kiribati encompass 4 areas: firstly, engaging local community understanding, voice and action; secondly, enhanced understanding of the cultural impacts of climate change via international advocacy; thirdly, DRR policy development pathways; and finally, enterprise generation/ client gain. The first, second and third areas of impact are fundamentally interconnected; understanding drives policy \(and vice versa\), and international advocacy highlights issues focussing policy evolution and resourcing to address global challenges. 

###  Local Community Understanding, Voice and Action 

 In India, Johnson and Edwards, in partnership with GBPNIHE and Kraft Films, produced participatory bilingual documentary films \(R2, underpinned by R1\). These provided a platform for the voices of indigenous villagers and Tibetan refugees to articulate community knowledge of past disaster impacts and adaptation. Film screenings developed understanding across the wider community, Kullu District government and NGOs. For example, in June 2018, following film screenings, 10 local community members and officials expressed their changed understanding, motivating them to enhance DRR efforts \(E2, p5; E3, p2\). This impact is demonstrated in the following comments: a local villager – “You have told us about natural disaster, a calamity, flood, which came. I want to tell that when we’re young we don’t remember anything and today when you told us we felt that we should increase… information so that we can save ourselves from disaster and increase awareness amongst people on how to save themselves” \(E3, p2\); and an official from the Central Tibetan Authority – “We learnt a lot about disaster risk and their respective managements. It triggered a sense of responsibility towards climate change; it gave us \[knowledge of\] how to approach the \[District government\] management committee” \(E2, p5; E3, p2\). More broadly, the leading Himachal Pradesh State and Kullu District disaster management authorities report that the research has benefited them, providing access to new community knowledge and influencing their DRR management \(E2, p5 and E3, p2\). These forms of impact contrast with the longitudinal survey evidence \(E2, p2\-3\) collected in April 2018, prior to the film screenings. Based on 50 respondents in 10 key villages in the study area, this evidence revealed a low level of hazard/ disaster education \(18%\) and awareness \(44%\). Encouragingly, 75% who interacted with Johnson and Edwards \(2012\-2018\) then spoke about their experience with family/ friends, demonstrating a successful mechanism to extend understanding, realised by the films \(R2\). 

 There was extensive local reach with films engaging 630 people, including 210 local community members, at 5 mountain village events in the Phojal Nalla study area \(E2, p4\), with an average attendance of 12.5% of each village population, based on 2011 census data. In total, there were 19 film screenings and allied discussion workshops \(E1, p2\), including at the famous Kullu International Dussehra festival. Further public reach of the films was achieved using print and broadcast media \(E1, p3\). In October 2018 this included 4 leading Hindi newspaper articles \( *Aapka Faisla*, *Amar Ujala*, *Danik Jagram* and *Punjab Kesari*, comprising a daily issue readership of 800,000\-17,500,000\) and TV broadcasts \(Zee News, across the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, with a population of approximately 60,000,000\). Social media and the Kullu District government  [<ins>webpage</ins>](https://hpkullu.nic.in/pathways-to-resilience/) hosting also resulted in 1,446 Vimeo and 2,095 YouTube plays \(to 31 December 2020, E1, p4\). 

 Despite the global focus on Kiribati as a ‘drowning nation’, KiriCAN, a local environmental organisation, argues that they will drown in rubbish before they drown in water \(E7, p5\). Resourced by projects led by Penrhyn Jones, KiriCAN consulted with 3 communities in South Tarawa, identifying waste as the most urgent issue. Endemic communicable diseases are connected to poor waste management and Kiribati's high infant mortality rate. KiriCAN decided to buy 2 trucks that could collect rubbish, and to train volunteers to use them. They reported: “\[this\] will impact people on a community level... it will have a lot of positive impact on children, you know, clean water... because the rubbish will end up in our drinking source, the spread of mosquitoes, and with the recent outbreak of dengue fever, diarrhoea, so it will all connect to health. It won't solve the issue altogether but help minimise it”\(E7, p5\). Local cooperation successes can also lead to greater community engagement on a range of challenges, seeding longer term impact: “When we talk about waste \[the villagers\] really want to… solve it, but they are losing hope, because their rubbish doesn't get picked up. So what is the point of picking up our rubbish if at the end there is no collection? ... the trucks will give them hope… we can clean up our village” \(E7, p5\-6\). Similarly, amplifying local voices and valuing local knowledge, an indigenous artist appreciated being facilitated to drive the artistic filmmaking process: “As far as I know you are the first filmmakers or researchers that are working… almost full time with a person like me. This is very new and it's unusual. I think it's very effective and you're... following the eye of the informant...to the places where the information is located... it's like the information that I have, and my eyes, is in the frame of your camera” \(E7, p7\). 

###  Enhanced Understanding of Cultural Impacts of Climate Change via International Advocacy 

 The *Troubled Waters* film \(R4\) and associated resources have achieved significant international reach. The International National Trust Organisation \(INTO\), a project partner, reported that the film is an incredibly useful advocacy tool, with enormous impact internationally for getting the message across about the dire effects of climate change on cultural heritage \(E8, p2\-3\). Before it was shown at their conference \(Bali, 2017\), “some... members from industrialised nations... had not, until then, appreciated the effects that their country was having on small island states.” INTO screened the film at United Nations Climate Change conferences in Marrakech, Bonn and Katowice \(2016, 2017, 2018\), reaching approximately 300 people in their booth and 2,000 through side events \(E8, p2\-3\). Further screenings by the project team included events in the UK, Montreal, Gothenburg, Munich and Rhode Island, 2016\-2017 \(E9, p2\-7\). 

 The National Trust \(NT\), also project partners, used the film to communicate connections “between climate change, heritage, and people's lives... equipping the next generation of... cultural heritage professionals to better understand the issues.” Research findings \(2015\-2016, including UK and Kiribati case studies\) informed their coastal work. Penrhyn Jones' piece on the research for the NT's internal magazine, *Views* \(October 2017\), reached thousands of Trust staff and volunteers, making “an important contribution \[to\] the conversation around the impacts of climate change at our coastal places.” Research collaboration led to further impacts, contributing in part to the NT's confidence to engage in a partnership project with Gwynedd County Council looking at enhancing community resilience in 2020 \(E8, p4\-5\). 

 After attending the event 'Drowning in Art' \(Bala, 2015\), a prominent Welsh author wrote in her column, “Sara Penrhyn Jones \[made the theme\] painfully contemporary... the anguish \[in Kiribati\] was conveyed... everyone became sombre” \( *Herald*, *Daily Post*, 2015\). She notes that this experience has motivated her since 2016; her local cooperative group has been increasingly active, instigating a sustainable food project, and a climate action facilitator in 2020 \(E8, p6\-7\). *Planet* magazine note that perspectives from Kiribati enriched the heritage loss debate and Penrhyn Jones’ photography generated pathos and empathy \(E8, p8\). 

###  Disaster Risk Reduction Policy Development Pathways 

 A June 2020 policy briefing \(R3\), substantially led by Johnson, delivered recommendations for new disaster risk reduction interventions to government disaster management authorities across the Indian Himalayan Region. Significantly, this has influenced their thinking about community\-based disaster risk reduction approaches, resulting in a public commitment to future policy revision. For example, in reference to the key policy document \(i.e. the State Disaster Management Plan,  [2017 version](https://hpsdma.nic.in/admnis/admin/showimg.aspx?ID=3351)\) in August 2020, \[redacted text\] the Himachal Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority \(HPSDMA, the key responsible agency\) \(E4, p1\),  stated: “Next year \[2021\] onwards we will be undertaking \[a\] comprehensive revision of the \[2017\] plans. It is \[a\] very good suggestion on \[Johnson’s\] part that there has to be a specific chapter and focus on community\-based disaster management, on village disaster management committees – their roles/ structure/ guiding principles… we will implement it, that’s one commitment I can give from my side.” The government agencies’ implementation of this policy has been delayed by Covid\-19, as detailed in the affected case study statement. 

 Multiple platforms were used to promote and discuss this policy brief, bringing wide reach. Web\-hosting included  [<ins>BSU data repository</ins>](https://doi.org/10.17870/bathspa.c.5036990.v1),  [<ins>GBPNIHE</ins>](http://www.gbpihed.gov.in/index.php), the  [<ins>All India Disaster Mitigation Institute</ins>](http://www.aidmi.org/whatsnew.aspx),  [<ins>United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction</ins>](https://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/72456?&a=email&utm_source=pw_email) and  [<ins>Zurich Flood Resilience Portal</ins>](https://floodresilience.net/resources/item/accelerating-change-engaging-local-communities-in-disaster-risk-reduction-in-the-indian-himalayan-region/),  supplemented by articles in leading Indian newspapers including  [<ins> *The Tribune*</ins>](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/empower-locals-to-deal-with-natural-disasters-scientists-112555) \(1,487 e\-version views\),  [<ins> *Times of India*</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TMCcCX9Q_x4qanxcIDqeL0Ni4dlekDUu/view?usp=sharing) and *Punjab Kesari*. A webinar \(August 2020, 59 attendees\) brought direct engagement with 14 NGOs, 4 \(of 12\) State governments across the Indian Himalayan Region, and 7 \(of 12\) District governments in Himachal Pradesh. As a consequence of these engagements, in the period June to December 2020, the science policy brief received 640 views and 92 downloads from 19 nations, via the BSU data repository \(E4, p2\). 

###  Enterprise Generation and Client Gain 

 The first interdisciplinary film pilot \(2013\-2014\) included 2 creative writing appointees, whose research roles catalysed their entrepreneurial careers, delivering economic impacts and wider client gains. In April 2014 appointee 1, now a children’s author, expressed a renewed desire to write a children’s book set in the Himalayas \(E5, p1\). More recently \(2020\) they stated, “I participated in Bath Spa University’s India research project… which had a direct impact on the emergence and growth of my publishing career \[and\] on my self\-confidence and ability to carry out this \[novel\] research, by improving my knowledge and skills.” Their first 2 novels set in the Indian Himalayas achieved notable reach and significance \(E5, p2\-8\). *Running on the Roof of the World* \(2017\) was chosen as a “future classic” by Booktrust, sending \[redact\] copies to UK schools, and selling a total of \[redact\] copies by June 2019. In August 2020, Amazon’s children’s book bestsellers top 100 list ranked this book 8<sup>th</sup> in the emigration/ immigration category. *When the Mountains Roared* \(2018\) was chosen by Booktrust’s Bookbuzz reading programme reaching approximately \[redacted\] UK students, selling \[redacted       \] in the first year. The author’s first 3 novels generated approximately \[redacted text\] in UK revenue and the reviews attest to their societal value: “A cracking adventure and survival novel set in the Himalayas which really makes you think about the plight of the Tibetan people” \( *Irish Independent*\); “\[it\] taught me… the importance of friendship and family, love, kindness, protecting animals and the planet” \( *National Geographic Kids*\). 

 In 2015, appointee 2, now a film director reflected on the connection between Johnson’s Kullu research and their career aspirations: “At some point in the near future, I will start developing this idea… I like cameras and I like writing, why not combine both to tell meaningful and impactful stories” \(E6, p2\-15\). Shortly afterwards, in August 2016, they founded their film company. Successes up to 2020 include the production of \[rd\] films for \[rd\] Indian and globally recognised clients \(eg Cisco, Expedia Group and Indian Railways\). This created a total revenue of \[redacted text\] \(approximately \[redacted   \]\), with annual revenue growth from approximately \[redacted  \] \(in 2016\) to approximately \[redacted.  \] \(in 2020\), and employment for \[rd\] freelance staff. The appointee reflected in 2020 that “What began in 2013 \[with Kullu research\]… has yielded fantastic results… \[It\] has been a success.” Reviews convey the added value for clients: “Their style of storytelling is… unique and different. A lot of people can shoot, but they tell stories” \(Juniper Networks\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Governance in sport has become increasingly important over the last ten years, with a number of high\-profile sport organisations facing media and governmental scrutiny after allegations of doping, bullying, abuse, and mismanagement. Since 2011, a programme of research led by Dr Richard Tacon and Dr Geoff Walters at Birkbeck, University of London, has worked to understand and improve board\-level governance in sport organisations throughout the UK and to improve diversity and inclusion on boards. Through sector\-wide reports, in\-depth case studies, workshops and training, they have facilitated major policy changes, raised the level of public debate, improved organisational practice and contributed to greater diversity and inclusion across many different sports. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2011, the Birkbeck Sport Business Centre published the first national survey of board\-level governance in the UK non\-profit sport sector \[1\]. The survey examined national sport governing bodies and provided a detailed overview of their board structures and processes. 

 Immediately following the launch of the survey, Dr Tacon and Dr Walters were invited to begin in\-depth case study research into one national governing body, BaseballSoftball UK. Senior members of the organisation wished to improve its governing processes with the help of independent, expert advice. In two waves between November 2011 and June 2014, Dr Tacon and Dr Walters directly observed board and committee meetings, interviewed board members and executive staff, and analysed organisational documents. They wrote reports, made presentations to the board, and published a series of academic articles that drew on the case study findings and wider research into non\-profit sport \(\[2\], \[3\], \[4\]\). Following on from this initial period of research, in 2016 the board of BaseballSoftball UK asked Tacon and Walters back to conduct a formal, independent board evaluation. They carried out another series of observations, interviews, and focus groups, and submitted a final report to the board. 

 The first of the research articles to be published from this project \[2\] showed how macro\-level processes of modernisation in the non\-profit sport sector from the 1990s onwards shaped how board members perceived and enacted their roles. It found board members now emphasise their financial and strategic responsibilities while de\-emphasising their traditional, boundary\-spanning roles, raising important questions about accountability. The second article \[3\] examined this issue of accountability directly and from an explicitly process\-based perspective. It showed how board members across the non\-profit sector are compelled to enact ‘upward accountability’ to funders, and how they struggle to balance this with ‘downward accountability’ to members. The third article \[4\] examined the wider process of ‘codification’ in the non\-profit sport sector. It traced the emergence and institutionalisation of codes of governance and examined how this has influenced governance practices. 

 The 2011 survey also directly informed the development of the *Voluntary Code of Good Governance,* published in the same year by the Sport and Recreation Alliance, the representative body of the voluntary sport sector in the UK. In 2014, Tacon and Walters were asked to examine the specific impact of the *Voluntary Code of Good Governance* on organisations in the non\-profit sport sector. Three years after the *Code* was published, 80 organisations had signed up to it. Tacon and Walters’ report \[5\] examined how these organisations had heard about the *Code*, how and how far they had implemented it, what challenges they had faced, and how they felt it could be improved. A follow\-up report, *The Code for Sports Governance: Evidence from the sport sector,* was published in December 2018. 

 Finally, in 2017 Tacon and Walters conducted joint research with Moore Stephens, the top\-ten accounting and advisory network, into governance among UK\-based non\-profit sport organisations. This was published in 2018 as *The State of Sports Governance* \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The sector survey undertaken by Tacon and Walters in 2011 \[1\] and the impact report, which they completed in 2014 \[5\], have underpinned a series of reforms to the UK sports governance landscape. During the assessment period, major sporting bodies across the country have introduced transformative new governance frameworks, all of which cite Tacon and Walters’ work. Organisations throughout the non\-profit sport sector have responded by making major changes to their organisational governance structures and processes, improving conditions not only internally but for ‘the millions of people who play or give their time to sport every week’ \(SRA annual report, 2017/18\). 

 <ins>Influencing policy</ins> <ins>and practice</ins> 

 Tacon and Walters’s 2011 survey \[1\] was instrumental in the development of the *Voluntary Code for Good Governance* \(Sport and Recreation Alliance, 2011\), a governance code for the UK non\-profit sport and recreation sector \[A\], with the findings feeding into what the principles of the code should be \[B\]. This code was revised in 2014, following Tacon and Walters’s impact report \[5\]. 

 In the 2015 *Sporting Future* strategy, the UK government recommended the introduction of a mandatory governance code for the sport sector, arguing that a stronger governance framework in the UK would deliver better value for money on the public funds put into sport; give the sector greater credibility; and curb illegal activity and corruption both in the UK and internationally \(by giving the country more credibility and a stronger voice when intervening in international debates\). Following this recommendation, the *Code for Sports Governance* was jointly introduced by Sport England and UK Sport in 2016. The Sport and Recreation Alliance’s *Voluntary Code* laid the foundations for this new mandatory code *.* The work Birkbeck did has therefore been integral to shaping the sport governance landscape and the policy work that has been done to improve the governance in the sector \[B\]. 

 The extent of this work has been substantial. As of April 2017, all organisations applying for public funding from UK Sport or Sport England must demonstrate their compliance with the *Code for Sports Governance*. UK Sport funds 44 National Governing Bodies \(NGBs\) in a four\-year cycle which mirrors the Olympic timetable, disbursing a combined £299 million across the current summer and winter Olympic funding rounds \(2016\-2020, 2018\-2022\). Sport England funds 57 National Governing Bodies, also in a four\-year cycle, with a planned investment of £238 million between 2017 and 2021. Each of these National Governing Bodies has made changes to its structure and organisation in order to comply with the code. 

 But Tacon and Walters’s influence extends beyond the funded NGBs. Sport England reports that when ‘charities, local sports clubs and County Sports Partnerships’ are taken into account, ‘More than 600 sporting bodies across England… need to comply with the code’ \[J\]. Elsewhere, voluntary codes continue to cover those parts of the sector to which the mandatory code does not apply. In 2017, the Sport and Recreation Alliance published the *Principles of Good Governance,* a successor to the 2011 & 2014 *Voluntary Code* designed to supplement the mandatory *Code* by providing guidance to smaller, non\-funded National Governing Bodies. By January 2019, an additional 35 National Governing Bodies had signed up to the *Principles*, gaining access to a suite of training tools and programmes intended to support them in improving their governance structures. These training programmes have themselves been directly influenced by Tacon and Walters’ work. The Head of Governance at the Sport and Recreation Alliance reports that Tacon and Walters’ research into the impact and implementation of the *Code* enabled \[them\] to review current work and identify knowledge/training gaps in the sector and therefore aided \[them\] in improving \[their\] support offering to \[their\] members \[D\]. Tacon and Walters have delivered such training directly: funding from UKRI supported a March 2019 training event in partnership with the SRA, which was attended by 38 volunteers from small, grassroots sports organisations \(a traditionally hard\-to\-reach group\). Meanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh regional governing bodies for sport both maintain voluntary governance codes which cite Tacon and Walters’s research and which facilitate the development of good governance at the regional level. 

 Tacon and Walters were able to take a more in\-depth approach to their work with BaseballSoftball UK. This collaboration \(which ran from 2011 until 2014, with follow\-up research in 2016\) has influenced ongoing practice in the organisation. The BaseballSoftball chief executive states that the formative work of the 2014 report prompted him to encourage a focus on strategic, rather than operational, concerns. He also lists a number of concrete governance changes made in response to the Birkbeck researchers’ recommendations; including the routine issue of role outlines to new board members, a regular schedule of evaluations, and extensive changes to the ways in which board meetings were run. \[E\] Many of these alterations were formalised in a set of ‘Articles’ adopted in October 2017. 

 Case study reports from a number of funded and non\-funded National Governing Bodies demonstrate that the voluntary and mandatory *Codes* have had a similar effect across the sector. The board of British Orienteering \(a sport in which over 40% of participants are female\) has now attained gender parity, with a board structure of 2 women and 7 men in 2011 becoming 5 women and 4 men by 2018 \[I\]. The British Kickboxing Council re\-engineered its board structure to separate the board of directors from the executive board, a change ‘which has… increased efficiency and brought new expertise’ \[J\]. In 2015, Skateboard England used guidance from the *Voluntary Code* to establish a brand\-new National Governing Body for what will in 2020 become an Olympic sport \[I\]. And since 2013, the non\-funded British Parachute Association has worked with a specialist sport governance consultant to apply the *Voluntary Code,* the *Principles,* and the results of the Birkbeck impact study to its governance structures, reporting a direct impact on board competence. This is particularly significant in ‘a sector… growing in complexity and size’ \[K\], where sporting organisations are increasingly expected to supplement public funding with private fundraising \(as outlined in the *Sporting Futures* strategy\), and where expectations of the transparency and accountability of their governing structures are accordingly high \[6\]. 

 The reach of these and similar impacts is considerable. The Football Association, one of the largest NGBs funded by Sport England, states that 1.6 million people play affiliated football each week. England Athletics reports 430,000 regular participants in its activities. Even at the smaller end of the scale, British Orienteering had 10,266 members in 2018 and reported approximately 150,000 participants in its registered events. 

 <ins>Increasing diversity</ins> 

 A 2019 report for UK Sport and Sport England \[L\] found that gender diversity in governing bodies across the sector has increased significantly following the *Code*’s introduction *,* with women now accounting for 40% of board members \(up from 32% in 2016\). 

 However, diversity remains limited in other respects. The report found that only 5% of board members identified as BAME \(the ratio is 13% in the UK population as a whole\) and 5% reported that they have a disability \(where the whole\-population ratio is 22%\). Only 43% of board members had attended comprehensive schools \(compared to 88% of the population at large\). These underrepresented groups are also underrepresented amongst sport participants, missing out on the multiple benefits that regular practice of a sport provides. Increasing diversity on governing bodies enables them to better represent and understand the needs of groups not yet engaged with sport. It is not surprising, then, that ‘the need to achieve diversity is one of the highest\-profile requirements of sports governance’ today \[6\]. 

 In 2018, Sport England were allocated £400,000 of government and National Lottery funding to increase diversity in sport governance, through a programme begun in April but formally announced in September 2019. In the period up until June 2021, this initiative will identify and train suitable candidates from marginalised groups into a state of ‘board\-readiness’ and encourage national governing bodies to recruit from this pool. Tacon and Walters were invited to help deliver the programme on the basis of their acknowledged expertise, taking responsibility for the design of four online training modules that will help the participants to understand the importance of good governance to the UK sport sector and the role of the board within this. 

 By July 2020, 163 people had been recruited to the project, of which 60% identify as female, 64% are from a BAME background, 18% declared a disability, 8% identify as LGBTQ, 22% show indicators of a low socio\-economic background, 29% follow a religion or belief other than Christianity and 8% are under the age of 35. Although the objective of the project is to identify and enable a pool of diverse ‘board\-ready’ candidates, rather than have candidates find board positions \(as this is beyond the control/scope of the project\), by July 2020, 24 candidates had in fact been appointed to boards in the sport sector, including to national governing bodies, Active Partnerships, and national sporting organisations. 

 Due to Covid\-19, it was not possible for Tacon and Walters to hold face\-to\-face engagement events for the project, so instead they consulted with colleagues at executive search firm Perrett Laver and developed four online research\-led seminars, with three held in May, June and July. These drew directly on Tacon and Walters’ three academic articles \[2\], \[3\], \[4\] and fostered in\-depth discussions among candidates. 21 candidates attended the three sessions, from a range of backgrounds, including corporate sales, legal, communications, marketing, finance, HR and digital and technology. Some present had experienced non\-executive, committee or advisory roles in their own sectors, or the third sector, and some were newly\-appointed directors within sport through the support of the wider project. 

 <ins>Beyond the sport sector</ins> 

 Tacon and Walters’s work on sport governance has also had an impact beyond the sector itself. A policy officer at the Chartered Governance Institute \(ICSA\) developed an interest in their research after attending the March 2018 launch of their report with Moore Stephens \[6\]. He invited Tacon and Walters to write about their work for the Chartered Governance Institute’s magazine, *Governance and Compliance* \(which has a circulation of c.20,500 readers across diverse sectors\) and to speak at an Chartered Governance Institute workshop in May 2018 \(which was attended by 41 representatives of governing bodies, sport agencies, and charities\). Their research was also subsequently cited in two Chartered Governance Institute reports: *Organisational Culture in Sport* \(2018\) and *The Future of Sports Governance* \(2019\). 

 \[name redacted\] testifies that these contributions benefited the Chartered Governance Institute itself by increasing its perceived authority. \(‘Audiences value both the weight of academic research and hands\-on, practical knowledge gained first\-hand, so it is important for us to be able to present both’.\) He also states that his own practice changed as a result of his interaction with Tacon and Walters’s work, reporting that he has drawn on their case study research \[2\] in his work as a member of the Steering Group for the Charity Governance Code. This is ‘a practical tool designed to help charities and their trustees develop high standards of governance’ \(charitygovernancecode.org\) as they process their share of the £10 billion donated annually to charities in the UK and, per a 2019 report, is currently in use by an estimated 44% of UK charities \( *Decoding the Charity Governance Code,* RSM\). A better understanding of what works in terms of implementation will be essential to ensuring the code’s continued uptake. As \[name redacted\] observes, ‘Cross\-sectoral learnings of how to apply codes… is \[sic\] key for the implementation of improved governance’ \[C\]. 

 Perrett Laver, the executive search firm with whom Tacon and Walters worked on the Diversity in Governance project, has also been influenced by the collaboration in ways that extend beyond the sport sector. A Senior Consultant testifies that the experience of working with Birkbeck on the project made Perrett Laver a more outward\-facing firm \[F\]. She highlights new collaborations in other sectors \(e.g. with \[redacted public sector clients\]\), which have allowed the firm to tackle sectoral issues and bring people together \[F\], increasing their understanding of the sectors in which they work and therefore improving executive and board\-level recruitment and governance across them all.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research into the role of exercise and physical \(in\)activity on human cardiovascular structure and function has fundamentally underpinned understanding of cardiac health and disease in great apes. Since October 2010 Drane and Shave have worked with European zoos, great ape sanctuaries in Congo, Zambia, Cameroon and Indonesia, and national and international veterinary teams and organisations to improve the understanding, diagnosis and management of heart disease in critically endangered great apes. Specifically, they assessed cardiac health in 543 apes, provided professional development for \~200 veterinary professionals from \~80 institutions across \~35 countries, and assisted in the selection of animals for the World’s largest ever chimpanzee re\-introduction programme. The research has led to the generation of Pan African Sanctuary Alliance veterinary guidelines that veterinary professionals can use to identify cardiac disease in these critically endangered species. Collectively the work is contributing to the survival of the species.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 On arrival at Cardiff Met, Shave initiated a programme of research that examined the role of exercise and physical \(in\)activity on cardiovascular structure and function. The specific focus of this research was to understand the acute and chronic influence of exercise upon cardiac structure and function in both healthy individuals and those suffering from heart disease. The research highlighted the importance of left ventricular mechanics in the functional response of the heart to physiological \(e.g., exercise and high\-altitude exposure\) and pathological \(e.g., coronary artery disease and chemotherapy\) stimuli, and characterised the physiological response of cardiac biomarkers \(e.g., cardiac troponin\) to exercise. This research, grounded within the sport and exercise domain, has enabled the group to develop significant expertise in the assessment of cardiac structure and function using cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers. Applying their expertise to the fields of comparative physiology and zoological medicine, the group set up the International Primate Heart Project \(IPHP\- [http://primateheartproject.co.uk/](http://primateheartproject.co.uk/)\) in 2010 to examine the role of physical activity in the evolution of the human cardiovascular system and to simultaneously improve the understanding of cardiac health and disease in great apes \(e.g., Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Bonobos and Orangutans\). 

 Through the IPHP, Drane and Shave have worked with a number of great ape collections in different countries to complete cardiovascular assessments across the four great ape species. This dataset includes the largest wild\-born chimpanzee population ever to undergo cardiovascular assessment, and it is from this population that the majority of research outputs have been derived. As part of routine health checks completed by the specialist veterinary teams caring for these animals, Drane and Shave conducted comprehensive cardiovascular assessments \(12 lead ECG, blood pressure, echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers\) of each animal. In addition to informing the veterinary practitioners caring for individual animals, these data were also used to generate normal reference intervals and practical veterinary guidelines for the assessment of cardiac structure and function \[R3, R5\], electrical conduction \[R1\], and blood pressure responses to different anaesthetic protocols \[R2\] in wild\-born chimpanzees. The data were also used to examine the feasibility of using cardiac troponin as a marker of cardiac disease in non\-domesticated species including great apes \[R4\]. Critically, these studies have defined for the first time the normal cardiac phenotype in healthy wild\-born chimpanzees. The data collected as part of the IPHP have also been used comparatively to examine the influence of physical activity patterns on the evolution of the human heart. Specifically, the data showed marked differences in both cardiac structure and function between humans and chimpanzees \- supporting the hypothesis that the human heart has undergone evolutionary selection for endurance capabilities. A corollary of these findings is that human evolutionary history might explain the increasing incidence of hypertensive heart disease in post\-industrialised populations no longer engaging in a physically active lifestyle \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As part of the IPHP, Drane and Shave have completed 543 cardiovascular assessments across the four great ape species \(Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Bonobos and Orang\-utans\) in 21 different collections across 10 different countries. This includes the World’s largest wild\-born chimpanzee population \(n=339\) in Africa. IPHP research has resulted in immediate, medium and long\-term impact on the survival of individual animals and the ongoing care, management and treatment of individual animals living in zoological collections and great ape sanctuaries. It has also informed the World’s largest ever Chimpanzee re\-introduction programme of animals back into the wild \[E2, E8\]. 

 Immediate Impact: At the point of cardiac assessment, the presence of heart disease in individual animals has been ruled\-in or ruled\-out. For some animals this resulted in changes in treatment plans or care. For example, based on our work, two chimpanzees with suspected cardiac disease had ECG loop recorders surgically implanted to continuously monitor cardiac rhythm. On follow\-up, one animal was found to have malignant arrhythmias and was started on therapy. Ongoing monitoring by the team has subsequently shown that the arrhythmic burden in this animal has been reduced \[E1, E9\]. Similarly, during an IPHP examination in 2015 a female chimpanzee at Tchimpounga sanctuary was found to have cardiac tamponade due to cardiac failure. Her treatment and care to the present day has been guided by Drane and Shave’s work \[E2\]. Based on the knowledge and skills developed since the start of the IPHP project, the team have also consulted in relation to the potential of cardiac involvement in both a viral outbreak in an Orangutan sanctuary \(Nyaru Mentang\) \[E11\] and an unknown disease causing sudden death in chimpanzees \(Tacugama\) **.** In animals, without disease, each cardiac examination creates a reference set of “healthy” cardiac data that has been shared with the relevant care team, which will be of clinical relevance in future assessments of heart disease. 

 From the outset, the collection of data has involved close collaboration with veterinary care teams, and has facilitated significant on\-site professional development related to the assessment of cardiac health for veterinarians in 21 different great ape collections including the Jane Goodall Institute – Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Centre, Zoological Society of London, Chester Zoo, Paignton Zoo \[E10\], Blackpool Zoo, Ape Action Africa, and Limbe Wildlife Sanctuary. This collaborative, multidisciplinary, approach was formally recognised by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquaria \(BIAZA\) in November 2013, when the IPHP received the award for significant advances in zoo and wildlife medicine \[E5\]. 

 Medium\-term Impact: In addition to the education of individual professionals that occurred during the assessment of animals, since 2011, Drane and Shave have also been invited to present their research findings and lead educational and professional development workshops at numerous key and highly prestigious veterinary conferences and meetings \(e.g., The Great Ape Health Masterclass at the Joint American, European and International Veterinary Societies Annual Conference, Zoological Society of London Great Ape Education Days, Pan African Sanctuary Alliance \(PASA\) veterinary meetings, and to the Orangutan Veterinary Advisory Group \(OVAG\) meetings\) \[E3, E4\]. Moreover, veterinary professionals from the UK and overseas have visited Drane and Shave to improve their knowledge, understanding and practical skillset. These formal and informal educational events have provided theoretical and hands\-on teaching activities for \~200 veterinary professionals involved in the care of captive, semi\-captive and wild great apes from across the world \[E3, E4\]. Accordingly, the reach of the research goes beyond captive zoo populations to those animals being cared for in sanctuaries and in the wild. The relevance of Drane and Shave’s work in relation to the training of veterinary professionals and the immediate and long\-term care of animals has been recognised through endorsement from a number of national and international organisations involved in great ape care including BIAZA \[E5\], PASA and OVAG \[E3, E4\]. 

 Long\-term Impact: The generation of standardised cardiac assessment protocols and the development of normal reference data for cardiac health in wild born chimpanzees is of clinical relevance for all chimpanzees being assessed for heart disease. These data have and will continue to facilitate better care, treatment and management of animals in zoos, sanctuaries and the wild **.** They also form the basis of the recent PASA veterinary guidelines for the assessment of cardiac health in great apes written by Drane and Shave \( [https://umnadvet.instructure.com/courses/321/pages/ape\-cardiac\-health](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fumnadvet.instructure.com%2Fcourses%2F321%2Fpages%2Fape-cardiac-health&data=04%7C01%7Cadrane%40cardiffmet.ac.uk%7Ced0aee13750647413db508d8d2b0dab9%7C189dc61c769b40488b0f6de074bba26c%7C0%7C0%7C637491004328068359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2BHZOidjvqdWTlYRlhOUsupEOHrk9aN3ss%2BEyWTKxyS0%3D&reserved=0); 12\). Beyond the initial diagnosis, individual treatment and longitudinal monitoring of animals with disease, the data collected by the IPHP have also informed the largest ever Chimpanzee re\-introduction programme in Africa \[E2, E8\]. Specifically, using the normative reference data the IPHP has helped the Jane Goodall Institute’s veterinary team select healthy animals, free of cardiac disease, to join the group of Chimpanzees being prepared for release. Accordingly, the work has not only had significant impact on individual animals and collections in zoos and sanctuaries but is also contributing to ongoing efforts aimed at ensuring the survival of the species \[E2\]. In addition to zoological advances this work has and will continue to examine the evolutionary origins of cardiovascular disease in humans \[E7\].
