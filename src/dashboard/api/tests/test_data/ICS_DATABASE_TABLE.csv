 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 By providing compelling evidence on the lack of informed choice in India’s approach to menstrual health, Dr Garikipati’s research and subsequent lobbying activities became the basis for policy change in India and influenced practices of key stakeholders across the country. National policy guidelines changed to shift away from disposable pads and include the entire range of menstrual materials. A government rural awareness campaign was instituted to support this change. Advocacy agencies \(WaterAid, UNICEF\) and state and civic organisations adopted informed choice in their menstrual programs across 13 states in India \(\~250 million women of menstruating age\). Collectively, these changes improve awareness and access to menstrual alternatives, promoting resilient, sustainable and inclusive menstrual health in India. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Through extensive fieldwork in India, Dr Garikipati carried out a series of research projects funded by ODA and EPSRC at the University of Liverpool between 2015 and 2018. The research explores how a tangle of social taboos, market failures and government policies have contributed to skewed menstrual health provisions in India. This research and subsequent engagement activities became the basis for changes to India’s menstrual health policy and influenced stakeholder practices across this sector. The three key research insights are: 

 *First*, a culture of silence around menstruation coupled with heavy marketing of disposable pads in India resulted in their complete market dominance \(3.1, 3.3\). Research by Dr Garikipati, carried out in two separate projects across 16 sites in India, identifies that, in popular narrative, disposable pads were considered as ‘the best’ and even ‘the only’ hygienic way to manage menstrual hygiene. Despite a variety of choice in sustainable female hygiene products \(like cloth pads and menstrual cups\), information and availability of these was seriously lacking. The singular focus on disposable pads represented a dual burden for women from low\-income households, both in terms of recurring costs to consumers but also to their eco\-systems where absence of adequate waste disposal systems meant that waterbodies close to slums became the dumping ground for used pads. Dr Garikipati also documented how the recent lockdown in India left young women exposed to extreme supply chain vulnerabilities, when thousands had to go without sanitary products \(3.4\). These findings suggest that there is a need to explore resilient, sustainable and inclusive menstrual solutions. 

 *Second*, India’s menstrual health policy and government initiatives reinforced this dominant discourse by actively promoting disposable pads. This policy\-led push inadvertently denies women information and knowledge of menstrual alternatives, resulting in dependence on state handouts of disposable pads or perverse menstrual choices \(3.2, 3.3\). Surveying a random sample of 277 women from 10 sites, Dr Garikipati finds that none were aware of menstrual products other than disposable pads and traditional cloth \(3.3\). Young girls from low\-income households relied on schools for their supply of disposable pads, but did not know what they would do when this stopped. Lack of knowledge and inadequate access left women from low\-income households with little choice but to ‘perversely’ shift expenditure from household essentials to disposable pads or use traditional cloth to manage their periods without adequate support on how to do this hygienically. 

 *Third*, *informed choice* as a policy tool has the potential to promote more resilient, sustainable and inclusive menstrual choices and help in ending period poverty \(3.5\). Dr Garikipati led a randomised controlled trial in 10 sites in India, which offered women either disposable pads or a reusable alternative or only information on the hygienic use and disposal of the full range of menstrual materials. After 6 months of exposure to these alternatives, the study found that \~40% of women offered a reusable alternative or only information were willing to change to a sustainable menstrual product. Not having to constantly rely on market purchases to manage their menstrual hygiene was one of the top reasons cited for the willingness to make this shift. This suggests that informing women’s menstrual choices may pave the way to more resilient and inclusive menstrual health.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Overview:** Research and dissemination activities by Dr Garikipati resulted in broadening the provisions of India’s menstrual health policy by introducing *informed* *choice* as its core tenet, shifting away from the heavy policy promotion of disposable pads for menstrual hygiene. Engaging with key organisations working in the sector resulted in influencing menstrual awareness and training practices. Reaching across 13 states in India with a population of around 250 million women of menstruating age, significantly these changes further their right to *informed choice*, contributing to resilient, sustainable and inclusive menstrual health. 

 **Engagement:  Using her research and its policy related messages, Dr Garikipati has lobbied stakeholders in the menstrual health sector at various levels: engaging with policy makers at the national \(5.5\) and state levels \(5.6\); collaborating with key organisations working in the sector like WaterAid \(5.7\) and UNICEF \(5.8\); participating in public dissemination activities via TV and press \(5.4\) in partnership with grassroots organisations that work directly with women from low\-income households \(5.9, 5.10\). Dr Garikipati became a founding member of Menstrual Health Alliance of India \(MHAI\) – an alliance of organisations working in this sector to advocate improved menstrual awareness and influence policy. Dr Garikipati was also instrumental in starting new state chapter of this alliance \(5.7\). 

 **Impact and Beneficiaries:** The research resulted in changes to India’s menstrual health policy and has influenced stakeholder activities across the sector. It has also raised awareness and use of menstrual alternatives in the Indian population. Three changes: to policy; women’s awareness and education: and to stakeholder practices are notable impacts resulting from the research. 

 **Policy change:** In November 2019, Dr Garikipati’s research and engagement activities became the basis for changes to the menstrual hygiene management \(MHM\) National Guidelines \(5.1\). Specifically, changes were made to guidelines under Table 3.1 \(5.1, pp.15\-16\) to include information on a range of menstrual materials and to Table 4.2 \(5.1, p.19\) to include their effective waste management strategies. 

 To deliver the policy change, the Ministry also initiated a public awareness wall\-art campaign across rural India. The Director, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, notes that Dr Garikipati’s research on menstrual health has led to the inclusion of ‘informed choice’ in the government’s menstrual awareness campaign. He further notes that: *“Such campaign initiatives have a significant role in influencing menstrual choices made at population levels among the 350\+ million young women of menstruating age in India”* \(5.5\). 

 **Sanitary awareness and education for women**<ins>:</ins> State level engagement resulted in an invitation by one of India’s largest municipal corporations for Dr Garikipati to contribute to their sanitary awareness programme, Safai Karamchari Yojana \(SKY\) \(5.6\). It incentivises domestic workers as agents to improve sanitation and waste management in modern urban dwellings. In collaboration with key implementing partners, Dr Garikipati developed the menstrual choice and waste management component in *SKY’s* training material for domestic workers. An implementing partner for the municipality notes: “… *the components on sanitary choices and their waste management, have been used as part of SKY training in all seven areas of Hyderabad. So far, over 70,000 domestic workers have been trained… and we have good results on their increased engagement to achieve better menstrual waste management in households. Our estimates… suggest that household menstrual waste has dropped between 50% to 90% in these areas”* \(5.6\). 

 **Influencing stakeholder practices:**  Dr Garikipati, in collaboration with WaterAid, developed materials on *informed choice* for advocacy and public engagement \(5.7\). Two key documents were developed: a *policy brief* \(5.2\) on ‘informed choice’ as a policy tool to promote resilient and sustainable menstrual health to share with organisation and policy\-makers; and an *information pamphlet* \(5.3a, 5.3b\) covering the full range of menstrual materials in accessible language to share with end\-users.  Both documents have been widely disseminated via MHAI and also feature on WaterAid’s website \(5.2, 5.7\). Demand from the sector resulted in the information pamphlet being translated into the national language, Hindi \(5.3, 5.7, 5.8\). Evidence suggests that “ *These advocacy materials have proven to be very significant in influencing MHM policy and practices”* \(5.7\). 

 The policy lead at WaterAid, India notes that: “ *We have used…* \[the policy brief *\] to help policy makers appreciate how informed choice has the potential to become an effective policy tool to make MHM practices more resilient and sustainable. These engagements have influenced policy thinking in India and we find a perceptible shift...*” \(5.7\) The policy lead also notes that WaterAid has used the pamphlet to reach over 50,000 girls and women attending their events, but virtual reach is likely to be much higher. A Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  in Institutions Specialist at UNICEF, India notes \(5.8\) that the information pamphlet is used in all their 13 centres in India: “ *so that they can… use it for advocacy purposes with respective nodal departments”.  “The nodal departments can recommend various options for managing menstruation to communities..*.” \(5.8\). 

 Also, Dr Garikipati’s public engagement led two national NGOs working with vulnerable women – Kasturbha Gandhi National Memorial Trust \(5.9\) and Safa India \(5.10\) – to introduce ‘informed choice’ in their MHM initiatives. Dr Garikipati helped develop their informed choice material which reaches around 225,000 women via these NGOs. This has led to an impressive increase in the use of sustainable menstrual materials among their communities \(between 65% to 80%\) \(5.9, 5.10\) and also in significantly reducing the menstrual waste in their centres \(up to 70%\) \(5.10\). As a by\-product of this work, Safa also started a livelihood initiative where they teach women how to make cloth pads and help market these \(5.10\). The Head of Kasturba Trust notes: *“This* \[informed choice\] *has enabled our residents manage their menstrual hygiene without the constant need to spend monthly and has also greatly reduced the menstrual waste generated at our 23 trust centres*”\(5.9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel research has supported a paradigm shift from the provision of EPIOCs as simple mobility aids to tools that facilitate rehabilitation, independence and the participation of severely disabled individuals in society. It has informed public policy, provided resources for wheelchair users and purchasers and enhanced international clinical guidelines impacting 1,200,000 UK, 1,700,000 USA wheelchair users and an estimated 131,800,000 needing wheelchairs worldwide since 2014. These major impacts have improved EPIOC prescription for people growing up and growing old with enduring disability. As a result of this research effective policies have been developed, professional practice has been enhanced and more appropriate assessment and prescription is provided to EPIOC users. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor De Souza and clinical colleagues have a significant record of research into improving services for EPIOC users. This research, led by Prof De Souza, has influenced policy, practice and provision by emphasising that EPIOCs should be prescribed for rehabilitation and social participation purposes and not just as a mobility device. It emphasised that changing needs across the lifespan for those with complex and additional health conditions \(comorbidities\) must be considered alongside individuals’ primary diagnosis. The findings stressed that the impact of not meeting individuals’ needs causes life impoverishing complications, like scoliosis and contractures, which extend hospitalisation and treatments. 

 An estimated 131,500,000 people worldwide need wheelchairs. Services are challenged to achieve best practice and cost effectiveness that matches the current/future health condition of individuals, their requirements and preferences with chair and seating technologies that payers can support. Brunel research \(REF1\) uniquely demonstrated that provision of an EPIOC significantly improved users’ QoL as well as mobility, pain and discomfort. They adapted and developed the EuroQoL \(EQ5D\) to enable people with severe disabilities to report their QoL before and after EPIOC provision \(REF1\). Prior to this there was no existing measure available to determine QoL in that group. The study underlined that QoL was an essential health improvement facilitated by EPIOCs. 

 This research \(REF2\) explored the views of young people using EPIOCs demonstrating that young people with severe disabilities had similar needs and ambitions as their able\-bodied peers. They not only relied on an EPIOC for mobility, but importantly it impacted social inclusion, providing opportunities to build relationships with their peers and to facilitate overall development including enabling entry to the world of work. Users particularly valued the independence and privacy from parents that an EPIOC provided. Until these findings, EPIOCs had only been prescribed as a mobility aid; this research evidenced the equally important benefits derived from enhanced social inclusion through development opportunities afforded to children for whom EPIOCs may enhance independence and facilitate participation in family, school, and community life. 

 Evidencing the clinical therapeutic use of EPIOCs, Frank and DeSouza \(REF3\) examined pain experienced by users. They differentiated pain due to EPIOC inadequacies and pain due to underlying diagnoses and co\-morbidities, concluding that problematic pain required examination, and was manageable through medical interventions, or by enhanced use of EPIOC functions and seating. 

 DeSouza and Frank 2010 \(REF4\) DeSouza and Frank 2017 \(REF5\) and Frank and DeSouza 2016 \(REF6\) focussed on the therapeutic role of EPIOC for users with MS, rare diseases and CP across the age span highlighting issues relevant to ageing with these diagnoses, namely, mobility, pain, fatigue, and comorbidity, exploring deterioration due to diagnoses and inadequate long\-term management. Findings emphasised the occurrence of avoidable complications resulting from inadequate wheelchair provision which had consequences for provision with regard to type of chair and seating. These studies underlined the essential therapeutic role of EPIOCs and how provision is influenced by progressive neuromuscular impairments of the conditions, comorbidities and disorders related to long\-term disability. De Souza and colleagues recommended a holistic model of rehabilitation rather than a disease management orientated approach.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The situation for wheelchair users with complex and changing needs has been called “intolerable”, especially for children. Clinical provision and care has been enhanced as a result of impacts of this research on policy through evidence regarding the value of EPIOCs in enabling employment, education, social integration, health status and improved QoL allowing users to participate more fully in society, and enhancing personal comfort and lowering their risk of serious complications from EPIOC use. 

 Using this research \(REF1\), the NHS warned that wheelchairs poorly matched to users’ needs adversely affected activities, participation, lifestyle goals and health status, adding to cost and/or non\-use or abandonment of the wheelchair \(E1\). Brunel research outputs underpinned the case for growing support, internationally for providing EPIOCs to encourage social and community interaction. They emphasised that driving assessment including functional and cognitive abilities and education on safety were essential for EPIOC users; a recommendation from this research into young EPIOC users.  Brunel research \(REF1, REF2, REF4\) was used to underpin key targets for health service improvements and core service delivery standards for therapists who support people with disabilities, benefiting 1,200,000 potential chair users in the UK and an estimated 72,000 potential users in NSW Australia \(E2\). 

 **Impacts on practitioners and services internationally** 

 **Professional standards, guidelines and evidence\-based sources have been shaped by the research** 

 By transforming understanding of the importance of EPIOCs for children’s development and successful transition to independence in adulthood, this evidence has broadened assessment to include provision based on the social development needs of children and young adults, not just their mobility needs. Internationally, practitioners have improved evidence\-based guidelines and recommendations to enhance the quality of their professional practice. 

 This research has been used internationally to recommend that for children with inefficient mobility, EPIOCs enhance independence and facilitate participation in family, school, and community life. Direct use of study REF3 highlighted that to enhance EPIOC use without contributing to problematic posture and pain, supportive seating, powered seating functions and adequate suspension are important features to consider in prescription \(E3, E8\). Brunel research highlighted widespread debilitating suffering caused by pain \(E3\) and that EPIOC users related their pain to underlying medical conditions and to improperly configured wheelchairs. EPIOC users opined that wheelchair tilt functions can be used to manage pain/discomfort. This research informed influential position statements to support the application of seat functions to assist clinicians in decision\-making and justifying funding \(E4\). 

 Brunel research \(REF2\) underpinned advice on when children should start using power mobility. The evidence was used to recommend that early utilization of EPIOCs for children with mobility limitations enhances independence, improves development in multiple areas, and enables children to grow to become productive and integrated members of society \(E5, E8\). 

 Expert international consensus now endorses the therapeutic use of wheelchairs beyond mobility assistance. Using this research \(REF6\), international recommendations advocate short orthoses for daytime use to prevent ankle deformity and prolong gait ability and emphasise that correctly adapted wheelchairs can prevent skin ulcers and slow scoliosis progression thereby counteracting life\-threatening complications for children with muscular dystrophy \(E6\). Drawing directly on these findings \(REF2\) an international consensus group published clinical practice guidance for powered mobility in children of different ages, needs, and abilities. Recommendations based on these publications highlight the importance of EPIOCs in enhancing independence and facilitating participation in family, school and community life and that enhancing EPIOC use without contributing to problems of posture and pain, supportive seating, powered seating functions, and adequate suspension are essential features to consider in chair prescription \(E7\). 

 The research on children has been utilised by clinicians for the prescription of EPIOCs and to develop and provide hand\-outs for advanced training and safety for different types of child learners and to inform and support their parents \(E8\). One of these hand\-outs has recently been translated into Norwegian \(E9\) further illustrating the need internationally for evidence\-based information to support child EPIOC users and their parents/carers. 

 **Impacts on commercial companies** 

 Material provided by companies for chair prescribers, users, payers and other purchasers has been informed by this Brunel research and used as part of the justification for costs. The research \(REF5\) has provided evidence\-based information to prescribers and purchasers of wheelchairs, demonstrating that appropriate seating interventions, alongside competent assessment, can reduce pain and suffering, but at a financial cost which is justifiable by the enhanced wellbeing of chair users \(E9\). Brunel research \(REF4\) changed funding decisions in Canada from the provision of power tilt and recline chairs for pressure relief to the provision tilt\-in\-space features that give users the ability to autonomously control comfort, rest and pain reduction \(E10\). Brunel research has changed perceptions of the role of EPIOCS from mobility aids to enhancing the engagement of severely disabled adults and children in society. It has contributed to developing the market and international clinical guidelines impacting 1,200,000 UK, 1,700,000 USA wheelchair users and approximately 131,800,000 people needing wheelchairs worldwide.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 More than 100,000 people are diagnosed annually with lymphomas in the UK and US alone, and many more globally. Imaging technology research at King’s College London \(King’s\) using positron emission tomography \(PET\): 

-  has led to new international guidelines using PET\-CT scanning as the primary test for staging and for assessing response in lymphomas using a 5\-point reporting scale developed at King’s; 

-  has resulted in fewer side\-effects and improved cure rates for patients with advanced disease globally; 

-  has rendered bone marrow biopsy an unnecessary test in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma \(HL\) especially in UK, Europe, Australia and US; 

-  has changed practice for the treatment of HL internationally, using an early PET\-CT scan to guide treatment.

 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the establishment of the King's PET Centre embedded in St. Thomas’ Hospital, King's has been at the forefront of the development of positron emission tomography \(PET\) technology, with a particular strength in multi\-modality imaging, combining PET with computed tomography \(PET\-CT\) and with magnetic resonance imaging \(PET\-MR\). Since 2000, Marsden has led pioneering PET imaging technology development at King’s, notably in the areas of image registration, kinetic modelling, motion correction, multi\-modality image acquisition, radiomics assessment and data\-driven PET acquisition \[R1\-R3\]. In 2016 Marsden was awarded the inaugural John Mallard Award from the International Organisation for Medical Physics \(IOMP\) for his contribution to the development of PET\-MR. 

 A strong multidisciplinary approach, combining biomedical engineering research with clinical and scientific expertise, has formed the foundation of the PET imaging technology research carried out by the King's group. This approach, exemplified in the long\-standing collaboration between Marsden and Barrington \[R2,R4\] has fostered a culture of continuous development, a rigorous approach to analysis of clinical trial data, and ongoing detailed assessment of all methodology in the complex PET imaging process. 

 King's research has adapted and comprehensively evaluated major aspects of the complex PET imaging technology for application in patient management, including production of short\-lived radionuclides, tracer synthesis, data acquisition protocols and parameters, and subsequent image reconstruction and processing, facilitated by the synergy with hybrid imaging technology development, as outlined above. In 2008 Marsden was invited to be the technical lead for the National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) PET Research Initiative, established to ensure a coordinated expansion of PET research in the UK \[F1\], which was followed by the establishment of a UK national PET Imaging Core Lab at St Thomas’ Hospital, co\-led by Marsden and Barrington \[F2\]. Based on their combined expertise in performance assessment and quality control of PET\-CT scanner systems \[R5\], the group at King’s devised detailed technical standards for scanner performance and quality control for the conduct of multicentre trials, which have then been implemented throughout the UK for cancer trial imaging. Barrington subsequently received the flagship award of Research Professorship from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) in 2017 \[F3\]. 

 The multidisciplinary engineering and clinical research at King’s has led to significant advances in the role of PET imaging technology in the diagnosis, staging and treatment of lymphomas, which are cancers of the lymphatic system \[R6\]. Prior to the King’s\-led research, lymphoma disease mapping at diagnosis and response assessment at the end of treatment were carried out using CT scans \(which only serve to monitor the size of lymph nodes and tumour masses\), as well as invasive, often painful bone marrow biopsies \(which only show the presence or absence of lymphoma in a small sample acquired from the pelvic bone\). 

 The underpinning PET imaging research at King’s led by Marsden, with Barrington as clinical imaging lead, has resulted in new international guidelines for imaging and management of patients with lymphoma. Specifically, King’s research has shown that PET scans using the tracer 18F\-fluorodeoxyglucose \(FDG\) that images glucose metabolism, which is increased in lymphomas, can more reliably assess the majority of lymphoma subtypes in the body than CT scans, including in the bone marrow, and can predict treatment response much earlier than CT does.

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research at King’s on the standardised use of FDG\-PET scans to inform lymphoma treatment has led to the development of new international guidelines, shaped professional practice and treatment and helped improve patient diagnosis, management and outcomes internationally. Over 100,000 people are diagnosed annually with lymphomas in the UK and US alone, and many more globally. 

 Background: PET\-Directed Therapy for Lymphoma 

 Hodgkin lymphoma \(HL\) is the commonest cancer in teenagers and young adults, but also affects older patients, with 2,000 new diagnoses in the UK and over 8,000 new diagnoses in the US annually. Non\-Hodgkin lymphomas mainly affect patients over 60, with 14,000 patients diagnosed annually in the UK and 77,240 in the US with many more affected globally. 

 The PET imaging quality assurance and standardisation procedures established by the UK PET Core Lab \(http://www.ncri\-pet.org.uk\) co\-led by Marsden and Barrington \[F2\], and the preceding work on which they are based \[R1\-R4\], ensure that accurate radiotracer uptake values are obtained, which is critical for conducting multicentre trials where quantitative data from all sites need to be pooled in combined analysis to maximise the statistical power of the study. Barrington led the clinical imaging working group that developed the international guidance on imaging stage and response assessment for patient management \[R6\] and led the use of quality\-assured PET imaging scans to guide treatment in the clinical trials RAPID \[S1\] and RATHL \[S2,S3\]. The quality assurance and standardisation procedures developed at King’s and documented \[R5\] contributed to obtaining statistically significant results of these studies, and their high clinical impact. 

 The ‘RAPID’ trial, funded by Blood Cancer UK, recruited patients from 2003 to 2010, involved 602 patients from the UK and the ‘RATHL’ trial, funded by Cancer Research UK \(Grant reference: CRUK/07/033\), which recruited from 2008 to 2012, involved 1,204 international patients. These trials demonstrated that it was safe to reduce treatment when patients have a satisfactory \(complete metabolic\) response on PET after two or three months of planned 4\-6 months treatment, with fewer side\-effects for patients with advanced disease, while patients with inadequate early response lived longer if more intensive chemotherapy was given. This approach also reduces the need for high\-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant in non\-responding patients \[S1,S2,S3\]. 

 Changes to international guidelines and influence on professional practice 

 The methods developed in the King’s\-led trials for performing and reporting quality\-assured, standardised PET imaging \[S1,S2,S3\] have contributed to harmonisation of practices across PET imaging centres worldwide. Specifically, King's research led to changes to international guidelines for management of lymphoma \[S4,S5\] and contributed to European guidelines for performing quality\-assured PET imaging \[S6\]. The 5\-point scale developed at King’s has become the international standard also known as the ‘Deauville criteria’ and was adopted on 20 September 2014 \[R6\]. Previously, there was no agreed common method to perform and report PET scans in lymphoma. Barrington has continued to influence professional practice amongst haematologists and radiologists as a member of the European Lymphoma Institute’s scientific committee for international workshops on PET and lymphoma \(September 2014 till October 2018\) \[S7\]. 

 Impact on diagnosis, patient management and outcome 

 Research from the PET Core lab, applied to the RATHL trial \[S2\], directly contributed to PET\-CT imaging effectively replacing CT and bone marrow biopsy as the standard\-of\-care for diagnosis and staging of HL \[S3\]. Guidelines resulting from King's research indicate PET\-CT is now the standard imaging test at diagnosis of HL since 2017 \[S4,S5\], allowing patients to avoid painful and invasive bone marrow biopsies, as documented in patient material \[S8\]. 

 The research and associated trials effected a change of practice for the treatment of HL since 2017 using early PET scans to guide current treatment, with fewer side\-effects and improved survival for patients with advanced disease. In the RATHL trial \[S2\], early PET scans were used for treatment adjustments. Furthermore, PET\-CT has also become the standard\-of\-care for monitoring response in patients with follicular lymphoma \(FL\), the second most common type of non\-Hodgkin lymphoma, receiving chemoimmunotherapy after research conducted in the international collaborative study ‘GALLIUM’ \[S9,S10\]. In this study \(funded by Hofman la Roche Pharmaceuticals\) involving 533 patients, Barrington and colleagues in Europe and Australia showed PET to be superior to CT for response adopting the 5\-point scale previously developed for HL, and, importantly, a surrogate for overall survival \(which is typically more than 10 years\) for testing of novel agents in this disease \[S10\]. 

 Patient outcome has been positively impacted since 2016. 

 Quality assured PET reporting led to improved outcomes for HL patients with inadequate early response in the RATHL trial. These patients received more intensive treatment and 67% of them were alive and free of lymphoma 3 years after treatment \[S2,S3\]. This is in contrast to previous reports where only 20% of patients with adverse early PET scan findings survived using the then standard\-of\-care. More than 85% of patients in the RAPID and RATHL \[S1, S2, S3\] trials who received less toxic treatment as a consequence of the quality\-assured PET reporting were alive without lymphoma three years after treatment. The approaches tested in these trials using PET have become a new standard\-of\-care amongst the haematology and oncology community and are widely used in the UK, USA, and parts of Europe and Australia. This is evidenced by inclusion in international guidance \[S4,S5\], professional material \[S11\], and patient booklets \[S7,S12\]. Bleomycin is a drug that was previously given to patients for six months with advanced HL. Since RATHL, over 80% of patients with advanced HL need only take this drug for two months \[S4,S5,S11\]. 

 As Dr. Graham Collins, Chair of the **UK** National Cancer Research Institute’s Hodgkin Lymphoma Research Group, says, “Professor Barrington has led the core PET laboratory at King’s which has resulted in practice changing research that has directly improved the care for patients with lymphoma. PET adapted therapy is \[now\] routinely practised worldwide for Hodgkin lymphoma and Professor Barrington pioneered this approach by leading the PET component of the RAPID and RATHL international studies. The resulting practice change has limited acute and late toxicities of treatments for patients and improved the cure rate for advanced stage disease” \[S13\]. 

 In the words of Professor Judith Trotman, Head of Department of Haematology at Concord Hospital, the University of Sydney \( **Australia**\) and as past Lymphoma Chair of the Australian Lymphoma and Leukaemia Group, ""The PET guided approaches tested in RATHL and RAPID have shaped the management of patients treated in Australia, which is reflected in guidelines that will be published in Feb 2021” \[S14\]. 

 As Professor Bruce Cheson, Scientific Advisor at Lymphoma Research Foundation \( **USA**\), says, “Dr. Barrington’s practice changing research now allows physicians to alter treatment in high risk patients resulting in improved outcomes, and reduce the amount of therapy for those at low risk, with a reduction in toxicities” \[S15\]. 

 Informing the work of Lymphoma Action and Blood Cancer UK 

 Lymphoma Action is the UK's only charity dedicated to lymphoma \(5th most common cancer\) and have been providing in\-depth, expert information for over 30 years, helping thousands of people affected by lymphoma. In 2016, their website reported on the RATHL trial conducted on HL at King’s \[S16\], and in 2018, in a Lymphoma Action Meeting at their National patient and carer conference, the benefits of using PET to guide treatment demonstrated in RAPID and RATHL was highlighted \[S17, p.17\-23\]. Blood Cancer UK, a charity dedicated to beating blood cancer since 1960 reported how findings from the RAPID trial conducted on HL at King’s were changing practice worldwide “making Hodgkin lymphoma treatment kinder” by offering less intensive treatment to patients with fewer side\-effects which can include secondary cancer and heart disease \[S18\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 An award\-winning fleet planning company began exploiting Heriot\-Watt University optimization research in 2014, leading to the following impacts: 

1.  Economic: GBP11,650,000 investment and B2B income, plus GBP9,600,000 estimated gains for end\-users, four jobs created \(15 person\-years in the period\). 

1.  Environmental: the associated cloud service was launched August 2018 and by end 2020 had reduced CO2 emissions by approx. 3,000 tonnes and started recruiting nationwide home delivery fleets. 

1.  Policy: founded on results of an associated project, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development now recommend asset\-sharing platforms in their guidelines for freight procurement. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Commercial users of optimisation almost invariably use standard single\-objective tools, which treat optimisation as the requirement to minimise a single objective, such as ‘cost’. However, this is increasingly regarded as suboptimal, since the ‘single objective’ formalisation distorts the underlying problem, and the optimizer will often miss solutions that would have been preferable. Rather than a cost\-minimizing solution, for example, a vehicle fleet manager may prefer a plan using fewer vehicles, or providing a fairer balance between drivers’ working hours, better utilization of electric vehicles, and so forth. 

 Much of our research has been on algorithms for multi\-objective optimization, which avoid distorting the underlying task, and deliver solutions that straddle the inherent trade\-offs, providing more value and insight to the decision\-maker. Early algorithms in this area were slower than their single\-objective counterparts, however we are responsible for some of the more widely cited, faster and effective algorithms. In particular, they explore theoretical issues and algorithm design in the context of *many\-objective* optimization \[3.1,3.2\]. While research in this area tends to focus on problems with typically 2 or 3 ‘headline’ objectives \(e.g. cost and risk\), the Many\-Objective Optimization \(MOO\) area recognizes that \(arguably\) most optimization tasks involve 4\-10, or even more, conflicting objectives. 

 Our MOO research has included theoretical work, to build an understanding of the consequent algorithm design challenges \[3.1\], and algorithm design work, in particular reference \[3.2\], which presents an effective algorithm for problems with 5\-20 objectives. The technical challenge in many\-objective optimization relates largely to the difficulty in assigning relative quality among groups of candidate solutions, since they will often be ‘mutually non\-dominated’. The work in \[3.2\] published in 2007 at the primary conference in evolutionary computation, GECCO found an approach to assigning quality in such circumstances that was relatively efficient and outperformed rival methods. The paper was awarded the “2017 ACM SIGEVO Impact award”; which recognises “…papers published in the GECCO conference 10 years earlier, which are both highly cited and deemed to be seminal” \( [https://tinyurl.com/ds4xnvp4](https://tinyurl.com/ds4xnvp4)\). 

 During our collaboration with Route Monkey Ltd \(RML\) \[3.3\], we developed further refinements of \[3.2\] for real\-world vehicle fleet planning tasks \(broadly known as Vehicle Routing Problems \(VRPs\). Real\-world VRPs are inherently many\-objective, \(e.g. cost, mileage, emissions, time, CO2, resources\-used, etc.\), and we found that our approach reliably outperformed leading commercial software, even in terms of the standard single\-objective targets of mileage or cost. 

 Finally, from late 2015, we worked with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \(WBCSD\) on horizontal collaboration between freight operators. Such collaboration has the potential for substantial savings in CO2 emissions, however is hard to achieve in a business context. With WBCSD, we exploited the aforementioned research, with adaptations for business collaboration models. The findings \[5.1\] were the basis of an innovate UK project \[3.4\] which went on to co\-develop algorithms for multi\-fleet asset sharing and an associated business model which could cope effectively with the often disproportionate utilisation of assets that arises in optimised multi\-fleet solutions \[3.5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2014, Route Monkey Ltd \(RML\), was establishing a reputation for innovation in fleet software, developing business plans around the vision of a fast/flexible ‘online scheduler’, and radically simplifying fleets’ access to optimisation capability. RML adopted Corne’s research to help realise these plans, and a series of associated Innovate UK, EU and B2B projects began in October 2014 \[3.5\]. One project in this HWU/RML partnership explored multi\-fleet collaboration, leading ultimately to policy impact; meanwhile, others transformed RML’s technology portfolio, setting the stage for RML’s acquisition in 2015/16 by Trakm8 PLC, who sustained the HWU partnership, and launched ‘Vortex’ \(incorporating Corne’s algorithms\) in August 2018. Associated impacts are outlined below. 

  

 **Environmental:** Trakm8 released the ‘Vortex’ API in August 2018, incorporating the research and underpinning their optimization service \( [https://www.trakm8.com/optimisation](https://www.trakm8.com/optimisation)\). Vortex is used for new clients since August 2018, while gradually migrating pre\-existing clients. Daily emissions savings accumulate, which can be estimated as follows: Before Vortex, we can estimate that fleets would have used, on average, 10% additional mileage. This is more conservative than the 12.5% estimated gains from top\-tier optimization across diverse fleets \[3.1\], which takes into account that some may previously have used optimization services. This translates into reduced CO2 emissions, mitigating pollution and climate change, and contributing to the UK’s CO2 targets. Meanwhile in 2017 RML commissioned an estimate revealing savings of c. 2,200 tonnes per month \(from 3,240,000 miles saved per month\) across its customer base \( [https://tinyurl.com/rmlest](https://tinyurl.com/rmlest)\). Since August 2018, around 5% of pre\-existing RML customers have migrated to Vortex, suggesting further reduced emissions of 110 tonnes per month, accumulating to c. 3,000 tonnes by end 2020. Meanwhile some very significant fleets will adopt vortex in 2021 on the basis of proven benefits beyond their current service \[5.1\]. These include two top\-10 supermarkets accounting for over 90,000,000 home\-delivery miles p.a. The latter projects and associated product confidence contribute to pre\-2021 Trakm8\-based economic impact, as presented below. 

###  Economic Impacts 

 <ins>Route Monkey Ltd / The Algorithm People Ltd \(TAP\):</ins> In 2015, Trakm8 PLC acquired RML for GBP7,100,000 \(for a consideration of up to GBP9,100,000\); this investment was driven in large part by the distinctive and novel algorithm capabilities, and associated development roadmap, afforded by engagement with Corne’s group, which also enabled RML to leverage further R&D and private funding summing to approx. GBP3,000,000, and enabling \~15 additional person years of employment in technical positions. RML’s CEO went on to found TAP, which raised GBP1,300,000 to develop its novel pay\-as\-you\-go online scheduling platform ‘My Transport Planner’, which makes use of vortex \[5.2\]. 

 <ins>Trakm8 PLC:</ins> associated economic impacts for Trakm8 can be quantified in terms of jobs created in connection with the Vortex API service, and associated project income from a number of IUK and B2B projects, on topics ranging from integration/deployment of Vortex through to specific consultancy tasks that exploit Vortex.

 **Policy Impacts** 

 The WBCSD is an organization in Geneva, funded by businesses globally and by the World Bank, advising businesses and influencing policy globally around sustainable practices. Corne’s research on asset\-sharing was central to two reports from the WBCSD’s Low\-Carbon Freight working group, and also underpins \(via the FSL project\), procurement guidelines for freight operators published by the WBCSD’s ‘Transforming Heavy Transport’ project. 

 The first WBCSD report \[5.5\] was built around Corne’s research as part of the Low Carbon Freight working group, and co\-authored by the consortium, including Nestle, UPS, and Scania, promoting non\-trivial horizontal asset sharing among fleets \(i.e. beyond simply ‘backhaul’\) as one of the more significant measures to be recommended for reducing emissions. Meanwhile, the freight procurement guidelines \(WBCSD report 2\) is a deliverable of the WBCSD’s ‘Transforming Heavy Transport’ initiative, which brings together 20 global transport organizations to guide the sector towards zero emissions by 2050 \[5.6\]. 

 Additionally the WBCSD report from the World Business Council’s ‘Transforming Heavy Transport’ project, Sep 2019; “ *provides professionals engaged in logistics procurement, supply chain and logistics management, and logistics emissions management with action\-based guidance on how to reduce greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions and air pollutants from their freight transport and logistics procurement practices*”; the report describes the ‘Freightshare Lab Asset sharing platform”, an outcome of the Innovate UK project \[3.4\], as an exemplar and a signpost to best practice that is “ *applicable to all companies*” \[5.6\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Africa in Motion \(AiM\) film festival was founded by Lizelle Bisschoff to counter lack of knowledge of African cinema and cultures in Scotland. Using her subsequent research identifying ‘lost’ African films unknown in Europe, since 2013 Bisschoff has expanded audiences in Scotland and London, reaching 35,000 people between 2014–2020, and enhancing their understanding of African cultures. Festivals and cinemas in Australia, Africa and the US now screen films promoted through AiM, and Bisschoff is training aspiring African film curators to put on film events in Africa. Bisschoff’s research, recognising films by marginalised African women directors, has raised their profile in the UK and beyond and, finally, AiM has supported UK film organisations to enact diversity policies, especially attracting minority ethnic audiences who are often difficult to engage. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The body of research builds on Bisschoff’s doctoral thesis, which found that although African cinema has been hugely marginalised in filmgoing culture in the UK, film could be used to enhance cross\-cultural understanding. This foundational insight has been further developed since Bisschoff’s original appointment as a research fellow at UofG in 2012. This development is in two main areas: the recovery of ‘lost’ African films, and highlighting the work of female directors. Being concerned with countering cultural marginalisation, the research contributes significantly to discussions around decolonisation and equalities, diversity and inclusivity \(EDI\) in both academic and public spheres. It is conducted through numerous field trips to African countries, attendance at African film festivals, interviews with African filmmakers, and visits to film archives. 

 Bisschoff’s archival research on the *Africa’s Lost Classics* project in collaboration with Professor David Murphy, then of University of Stirling, culminated in an edited volume \[3.4\]. This work covered over 30 classic African films – largely unknown, marginalised or forgotten – and revealed many parallel filmmaking pioneers working contemporaneously with canonised filmmakers such as Egyptian director Youssef Chahine and Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene. The research revealed the geographical range and historical depth of African cinema, offering more complex genealogies and revised histories of African cinema. The volume presents an activist intervention intended to urge scholars, curators and film festival organisers to look beyond the most obvious and available histories of African cinema. For example, it uncovers the work of early African animators, including Nigerien director Moustapha Alassane. Alassane made his first film before Ousmane Sembene \(who became known as the ‘father of African cinema’\) directed his first film, thus challenging accepted genealogies of African cinema. 

 Some of the *Lost Classics* project’s most significant discoveries are the work of female African directors, perennially disregarded within canonised film histories that favour Euro\-American male directors. Bisschoff’s research, including as PI on the follow\-on AHRC\-funded *Lost Classics* project with co\-I Stefanie Van De Peer of Queen Margaret University, on women in African cinema \(historiographies of female African directors and analyses of the representations of African women on\-screen\) is extensive. She has published widely on the topic \[e.g. 3.2, 3.3, 3.6\], and has also contributed to a report on the roles of African women in the creative industries, commissioned by UNESCO \[3.5\]. This research shows how the ‘canon’ systematically oppresses and suppresses the histories of African women and their contributions to historiography; something that is also addressed in films by African women. History has written African women out of politically, culturally and socially significant moments in the past, even though female directors reveal in their films that important freedom fighters, entrepreneurs and cultural instigators in Africa were very often female. This ongoing strand of research has been consolidated in a monograph \(co\-authored with Stefanie Van de Peer\) \[3.1\], covering the work of, for example, the first female\-directed Tunisian documentary, *Fatma 75* by Selma Baccar; and many recent films by a growing number of female directors from all over the continent. 

 Significantly, *Africa’s Lost Classics* restored three classic women’s films which have generated ongoing screening requests for the films in the UK and internationally. This work is not only about uncovering films, but about how they help us rethink dominant patriarchal histories and Western\-centric, nationalist and postcolonial master narratives that often ignore the contributions and roles of women. *Fatma 75*, for example, is a feminist film essay made in 1976 – at the height of second\-wave feminism in the Western world – which offers new cultural insights into the development of feminist theory in the Arab and ‘third’ world, revealing that non\-Western women made hugely important, and under\-appreciated, contributions to the advancement of women’s rights. This research is therefore significant both in highlighting marginalised film industries, and, through sociological and contextual analyses of the films, enhancing understandings of African cultures through film.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 There have historically been low levels of understanding in the UK and Europe of the variety of African cultures, and inequalities persist for BAME \(Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic\) people. Seeing cinema as a means to counter problems such as social inequality, marginalisation, and lack of intercultural understanding, Dr Bisschoff founded the Africa in Motion \(AiM\) film festival in Scotland in 2006. This case study details the impacts of her subsequent research, generated through her ongoing leadership of AiM. 

 **Using AiM to showcase marginalised African films and filmmakers to diverse audiences** 

 The AiM Film Festival consistently attracts diverse audiences across Scotland, and over 5,000 people yearly \[5.1\]. Between 2014–2019, the festival drew \~35,000 people to its events, including a much higher proportion of BAME people than the 4% national average \(c.29% in 2016 and 26% in 2018 \[5.2\]\). In 2018, 64% of audiences were female, 31% male, and 5% other; 64% were aged between 20\-34. Film Hub’s Scotland Manager commented: ‘ *\[AiM\] introduces new filmmaking voices and significantly broadens the audience’s engagement and understanding of African cinema. The festival brings vital diversity to on\-screen representations and to audiences*’ \[5.2\]. 

 AiM has regularly introduced audiences to films about marginalised, misremembered or misrepresented women. This is well illustrated by the thoughtful audience responses to the AiM showing of a 2017 film about Winnie Mandela: ‘ *I've always had issues with the way Winnie Mandela has been negatively portrayed in \[South African\] and international media ...Her story is rarely given proper context. I have never seen such a fair reflection of Winnie Mandela and the role she played’* \[5.2\]. 

 As part of the *Africa’s Lost Classics* project and organised through AiM, 20 ‘lost’ African films were screened in 35 events across the UK in October–November 2017. The featured films had disappeared from public consciousness, often because only a single master existed, or from never having been subtitled in English and therefore remaining unseen by Anglophone audiences. Three were classic female\-directed films from Zimbabwe, Tunisia and Senegal respectively, restored, digitised and subtitled for UK audiences for the first time, including the first Tunisian documentary feature film directed by a woman \(Selma Baccar\). These ‘lost classics’ \[3.4\] attracted interest from other film festivals and a great deal of press coverage. Filmmaker Mark Cousins wrote in the British Film Institute’s official magazine,  [*Sight & Sound*](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/africa-lost-classics-uk-tour-open-your-eyes) \(November 2017\): ‘ *for decades I and many others have been angry at the amnesia about African cinema. I’ve sometimes called it racism by omission. Reading the Africa’s Lost Classics list I felt less anger than relief...It’ll be a long time before African directors achieve parity of recognition, support and esteem, but what a lot can be achieved by \[UofG\] researchers’* \[5.3\]. 

 In July 2018, AiM partnered with the Ladima Foundation at the Zanzibar International Film Festival to screen some of the rediscovered African classics. The Foundation’s Founder/Director commented that this ‘ *most certainly had a significant impact on the event’*, and stimulated a great deal of discussion about the lack of recognition of female African directors \[5.4\]. Since their debut in 2017, the *Lost Classics* films have been screened at film festivals and cinemas around the world, including in Tanzania, Morocco, South Africa, the US and Australia. Bisschoff’s work has therefore influenced film selections, raised the profile of African films by women directors, and helped to introduce new films and a new awareness of African film and culture to audiences in these countries *.* 

 **Impacts on the UK and African film industries** 

 By shining an unprecedented light on African cinema in the UK and elsewhere, Dr Bisschoff’s work has supported cultural organisations to reach people from minority ethnic communities. The programme co\-ordinator of the Centre for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow, commented that AiM has for years been *‘helping us connect more broadly with the African diaspora both here in Scotland and further afield’*. The AiM project officer for Creative Scotland stated: ‘ *\[AiM\] offers a year\-round programme to engage audiences from BAME communities in programming, watching and discussing films. It also creates volunteering opportunities for people from BAME, and non\-BAME, communities.’* \[5.5\] AiM has thus supported the efforts of creative organisations in the UK to improve equality, diversity and inclusion. As female South African filmmaker Firdoze Bulbulia commented in 2018, AiM ‘ *manages to bring innovation, excitement, cross media platforms and participatory events across many barriers of race, class, culture, ag*e…’ \[quoted in 2018 report, 5.1\]. 

 In 2016, the British Film Institute conducted a nationwide survey across their Film Audience Network \[5.6\]. Of 172 participating film hubs, cinemas and venues, AiM ranked highest in responses stating the organisation: 

-  ‘*shows films that broaden my horizons’* \(62% strongly agree\) 

-  ‘*shows films that enhance my understanding of the world’* \(54% strongly agree\) 

-  ‘*offers unique film events/screenings I couldn't access anywhere else’* \(70% strongly agree\). 

 Several African filmmakers have attended AiM, and the benefits of AiM are also being delivered directly to African filmmakers through Bisschoff’s current GCRF project which has trained 12 aspiring film curators from four East African countries through a workshop in Kigali, Rwanda, in January 2019. Some are now using this knowledge to implement African film events in their respective countries. The founder of the Kwetu Film Institute, Kigali \[5.7\], described the work as a ‘ *unique and special program that had inspired our institute to continue on this path of film sharing or curating’* adding that *‘with the reaction we received’* the *‘need to have this continued’* was clear. 

 **Educational impacts: Educational workshops and resources** 

 Bisschoff’s work has led to educational resources being used in 60 schools in Scotland and London. The *Lost Classics* project collaborated with educational support organisation Into Film \[5.9\] and London’s Royal African Society to develop bespoke resources aligned to the national curriculum. Screenings and workshops held in schools were well\-received, and one teacher commented: ‘a *ll participants said they learned something and everyone was in agreement that being able to access authentic African film gave them \[…\] a better understandin*g’ \[5.8\]. Animating Africa was launched in September 2018, and Into Film commented that working with AiM ‘ *resulted in us producing a brilliant resource that was able to showcase and celebrate animation talent from across the African continent*…’ \[5.9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Trace Element Speciation Laboratory \(TESLA\), led by Professor Feldmann at the University of Aberdeen, have developed pioneering analytical chemistry techniques to quantify inorganic arsenic in rice and rice\-based food. Feldmann’s research has been key to raising awareness of the high levels of inorganic arsenic \(iA\) contained in rice, with his research forming the basis of a recommendation by the European Commission \(EC\) to formally establish a maximum permissible level of the class I carcinogen inorganic arsenic \(in rice\). Based on this recommendation, a maximum legal limit of 0.2 mg/kg \(for adults\) has since been identified by the Food and Agricultural Organisation \(FAO\) of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation \(WHO\). This was implemented into EU law in 2016. 

 Feldmann’s research and technical expertise has also been key to facilitating low\-cost methods for iA testing in the United States \(U.S.\) food industry and supporting reference material for baby food products in Canada. In order to help potential rice producers meet the 2016 EU standards, Feldmann developed two new affordable methods to low/medium income countries to detect levels of iA in their rice products. As a way to open up market opportunities he has worked closely with partners in Malawi to build capacity for iA testing while raising awareness of best practice amongst rice farmers in the country. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the 1990s, the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), the European Union \(EU\), and the relevant authorities in the USA had established a maximum permissible level of inorganic arsenic in drinking water of 0.01 mg/l, however there was no such limit in foodstuffs. This is because arsenic in foodstuffs exhibits molecular forms with different toxicities: in its inorganic form, arsenic is highly toxic, whereas organoarsenicals are benign. Hence, introducing a legal limit was more complex than stating a simple arsenic concentration level permissible in food commodities. 

 This has presented a major challenge to introducing a legal limit in food products and has made it difficult for the EU to state a definitive permissible arsenic concentration level. In 2015, the European Commission \(EC\) recommended that member states provide speciated data on arsenic in food and monitor inorganic arsenic \(iA\), total arsenic \(As\) and other relevant arsenic species \( [Commission Recommendation \(EU\) 2015/1381](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32015H1381)\). This generated a pressing need within the research community to establish a robust analytical method to determine levels of inorganic arsenic in rice and rice\-based products. However, both a conventional method for detection of iA in rice and a universal maximum level \(ML\) for arsenic in foodstuffs had yet to be agreed. 

 Feldmann’s group was the first to draw attention to the fact that in rice, the diversity of arsenic compounds is limited and a large proportion is in fact, iA. Furthermore, they demonstrated that rice represents one of the most highly arsenic\-contaminated food commodities, specifically bran, husk, breakfast cereals and rice crackers \[1\] and as a staple ingredient of baby food products, rice presents a risk to babies and toddlers \(due to their higher food intake per kg body weight\) \[2\]. However, levels of iA had not been established due to a lack of techniques with sufficient sensitivity. By developing a straightforward analytical method combining high\-performance liquid chromatography \(HPLC\) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \(HPLC\-ICP\-MS; a combination of chromatography with element\-specific detection\), the TESLA research lab addressed this challenge, successfully detecting total arsenic, and for the first time iA content \(combined arsenite and arsenate relative to total arsenic\) \[4\]. This method was tested worldwide in a proficiency test organised by the EU \[4\]. Since the last REF period, the TESLA lab have been able to develop rice as reference material \[P1\] in which iA was certified for the first time \( [https://bit.ly/2NB7KeQ](https://bit.ly/2NB7KeQ), see certification report, ERM\-BC211\) 

 In 2016, the European Commission \(EC\) introduced stricter standards for infants, 0.1 mg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food \(0.1 mg/kg\) compared to adults \(0.2 mg/kg\) for rice\-based foods. This standard was not based on risk assessment and to date, EU legislation has had no effect on product violations \(no lower iA concentrations have been measured in food destined for infants and young children than before the legislation was passed\) \(Signes\-Pastor et al. 2017<sup>1</sup>\). 

 The TESLA lab has worked to tackle this challenge by introducing a low\-cost \(and thereby more accessible\) method, which would be suitable for use in the field and in turn ensure uptake of good practice within the wider scientific community. Whilst the established methodology, HPLC\-ICPMS, has increased sample throughput in specialised labs \[5\], it is not suited for monitoring rice in the marketplace or in low\-to\-middle income countries, as it requires highly specialised equipment and relevant training \(fewer than 30 labs worldwide have access to the equipment \- none in Africa\). Hence, Feldmann’s initial research focussed on simplification of the analytical method by developing a technique targeting iA without chromatography by using selective volatilisation reactions \[3\]. This technique is different as it uses hydride generation \(HG\) ICP\-MS \(HG\-ICP\-MS\) and has since been validated through direct comparison to the established methodology \(HPLC\-ICP\-MS\) for rice and rice\-based products. 

 The HG method was confirmed to be sensitive, fast, and cheap and could be performed by any laboratory with an ICPMS or even an atomic absorption spectroscopy \(AAS\) instrument. The method also resulted in a shortening of sample measurement time and easier data treatment opening up the technique to non\-specialists \[5\]. Whilst these developments bolstered the potential for analytical testing of rice to become more widespread \[6\], Feldmann cautioned in 2014 that given the impending EU regulation on iA concentration in rice, it was important that regulators do not prescribe a single standardised method, which would exclude new instrumental developments and potentially limit access to new markets. 

 Whilst the HPLC\-ICP\-MS methodology has expanded the range of researchers able to quantify iA in rice \[4, 5\], it was apparent that low\-income countries still did not have the analytical means to do so.  Marketed rice is not properly controlled due to the lack of affordable, rapid analysis. Moreover, baby food companies have been struggling to resource rice with low iA for their products since their traditional producers \- in the EU \- are located in areas with high arsenic levels. Hence, companies are looking for opportunities to source rice from producers outside of the EU. In order to facilitate sourcing of new rice markets in low\-income countries, Feldmann developed a field\-deployable method \(‘the Arsenator’\) based on a water testing kit, utilising selective volatilisation for iA \(Gutzeit methodology\) \[7\]. Following optimisation of the method, 30 rice commodities from the UK market were tested and compared to the reference method \(HPLC\-ICP\-MS\). In all but three rice samples, iA were determined, with no bias compared to the reference method, confirming its sensitivity \[7\]. This field\-deployable method is projected to cost less than GBP3 per sample to run and has been field tested in Malawi \[P2\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact resulting from the research on arsenic in rice involves: 

1.  Providing an evidence base to inform maximum limits on iA around the world; 

1.  Reducing the cost of iA testing in the U.S. food industry; 

1.  Development of a certified reference material \(CRM\) for infant food matrices in Canada; 

1.  Building capacity for iA monitoring in Malawi; 

1.  Engaging with local rice farmers in Malawi – creating the infrastructure for field\-testing. 

 **1\) Providing an evidence base to inform maximum limits on iA around the world** 

 The large body of evidence \[1\-6\] collated by Feldmann, Meharg and the wider TESLA lab, provided a sufficiently compelling argument for the Codex Committee \(responsible for the preparation of draft standards to the European Commission\) to meet to discuss introducing a maximum permissible limit for iA in rice. As a result, the FAO/WHO committee on contaminants in food hosted a debate in 2015 and the Codex Committee proposed a draft code of practice for the prevention and reduction of arsenic contamination in rice. Since the submission of this draft code \(an advisory report\), the committee has set the maximum permissible level of iA in polished rice at 0.2 mg/kg \(FAO/WHO 2015\). During their discussions, whilst no consensus on a maximum limit \(ML\) was reached for husked rice. Aberdeen research brought to the fore examination of the inextricable links inhibiting a global ML. This is confirmed by supplementary details of the advisory report \(codex report B\), which states that “… *divergent views were expressed as to what the ML for husked rice should be in terms of protection of human health while not having a negative impact on international trade*” \[S1\]. 

 The European Commission introduced a maximum limit for four categories of rice in 2015, recognising that bran and husked rice have generally higher levels of iA \(0.2 mg/kg for polished white rice, 0.25 mg/kg for parboiled and husked rice, and 0.3 mg/kg for rice crackers and waffles\). However, rice used in the production of food for infants and young children was given a lower iA limit \(0.1 mg/kg\) \[S2\]. The setting of different maximum limits acknowledges the Aberdeen group’s work \[1\], which identified and raised awareness of the relatively high levels of iA in bran, husk, breakfast cereals and rice crackers and the problem of babies eating rice\-based products \[2\]. 

 **2\) Reducing the cost of iA testing in the U.S. food industry** 

 Research led by Feldmann and the TESLA lab led to development of cheaper methods for measuring iA in rice, including the HG\-ICP\-MS system. In the U.S., limits on iA in rice products mean that samples must be analysed to ensure compliance. Reported methods tend to use measurement of all species of As present in rice and other foods, which incurs high costs for the supplier, requiring trained staff and expensive equipment, and a high cost per sample \(USD200\). In March 2016, the Senior Research Agronomist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture \(USDA\) invited Feldmann and the TESLA lab to participate in an inter\-laboratory evaluation of a simpler method for measuring  iA \[S3i\]. The aim of this evaluation was to provide industry with a reliable and less expensive method to identify the levels of iA, \(rather than full As speciation\), in order to comply with market limits \[S3ii\]. In their final report, the USDA, as organiser of this trial, concluded that iA in rice can be measured with similar accuracy by the new HG\-ICP\-MS method developed by Feldmann \(Pettursdottir et al. 2014 \[6\]\) as the previously established more expensive HPLC\-ICP\-MS method with only minor differences. The HG\-ICP\-MS method was deemed to be simpler and faster, required less\-expensive instrumentation and was able to be conducted by less\-experienced staff \[S4\]. 

 **3\) Development of a certified reference material \(CRM\) for infant food matrices in Canada** 

 As of June 2019, Health Canada, a federal institution and part of the Health Portfolio \(Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency\), legislated MLs of iA in white and brown rice to 0.2 mg/kg and 0.35 m/kg, respectively. The National Research Council of Canada created a new certified reference material \(CRM\) rapid response approach, to ‘fast track’ the assessment of reference materials. To achieve this Health Canada brought together a team of 4\-5 intentional labs worldwide with expertise in toxicity assessment and As speciation, including Feldmann \[8\]. This resulted in the development of the new CRM \(BARI\-1\), which could be used to assess the accuracy of developed analytical methods for As speciation in infants’ food. Principal Research Officer of the National Resource Council of Canada confirmed the value of Feldmann’s contribution in a testimonial, stating ‘ *BARI\-1 will serve the world\-wide science and regulatory community for decades to come. Your contribution from the early planning stages and the actual provision of measurement data on this CRM has been crucial to the success of this project’* \[S5\]. 

 **4\) Building capacity for iA monitoring in Malawi** 

 With regards to identifying products which meet the low limit of iA required in rice for infants and young children, food companies are searching for new areas from which to secure product, since the traditional regions \(Italy, France, Spain, the US, India and China\) produce rice with iA levels over the maximum limit of 0.1 mg/kg. This project \[P2\] represented the first step towards identifying and enabling a market beyond traditional regions, facilitated by EU regulation and uptake of the “Arsenator” field deployable method, which has enabled surveying of rice in low\-income countries. In order to increase awareness of the value of screening rice in Malawi and to identify potential market opportunities, a workshop was organised for the Malawi regional agricultural advisors for rice schemes in July 2019. The main workshop, convened in Salima was attended by a total of fifty\-five participants, including district development division manager, thirty\-six rice farmers, thirteen field workers \(agriculture extension development officers; AEDOs\) and four area field supervisors \(agriculture extension planning area – EPA – agriculture extension development coordinators – AEDCs\) from various districts across the country. A further two were experts from the Lifuwu Research Institute \[S6\]. 

 **5\) Engaging with local rice farmers in Malawi – creating the infrastructure for field testing** 

 Prior to this workshop, smallholder farmers from Malawi were unaware of the toxic substances in rice. Following a demonstration of the field kit, farmers completed a questionnaire \[S6\], which demonstrated better understanding of what would constitute ‘high quality’ rice by EU buyers and a willingness to screen rice. The workshop provided a forum to discuss the use of a Farmer’s cooperatives rice market where EU buyers could buy high quality rice directly from farmers rather than through venders who may exploit them. Farmers were able to ask the Ministry of Agriculture to speed up availability of screening facilities in the districts allowing farmers to access such screening services without difficulties \[S6, S7\]. Upon receiving training on how the field deployable method works, the majority of the AEDOs showed willingness to work with farmers in screening rice with elevated iA and offered to conduct the analyses on\-site within their stations at their regional or district offices \[S7\]. A total of 87 student trainees \(AEDOs\) from the NRC and 13 academic staff members \(lecturers and technicians\) were trained, embedding good practices. Training modules have been established in ten secondary schools and screening services have been provided through Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources \[S7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The START \(STrAtegies for RelaTives\) intervention is a psychological therapy to reduce anxiety and depression in family carers of people with dementia. It was developed and evaluated by a multidisciplinary team at UCL, including essential contributions from statisticians led by Dr Barber. Statistical modelling showed the START intervention to be cost\-effective and clinically relevant over the short\- and long\-term. The intervention has improved UK policy and guidance on dementia care. The intervention is used in the UK by at least 24 services across 12 NHS Trusts and by charities such as the UK Alzheimer’s Society. It has also been translated and adapted for use in 5 other countries: Australia, Spain, Japan, India and Hong Kong.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The increasing dependence and challenging behaviour of people with dementia strongly affects the mental health of family members, who provide much of their care. Approximately 40% of these carers have clinical depression or anxiety, while others have significant psychological symptoms. Evidence from systematic reviews suggests that psychological interventions individualised to the carer are most effective in preventing breakdown of patient care and delaying care\-home admission. As the number of people with dementia in the UK is projected to increase by 80%, from almost 885,000 in 2019 to around 1,600,000 by 2040, it is critical to develop strategies to decrease the distress of carers. 

 Dr Julie Barber \(UCL Statistical Science\), together with a multi\-disciplinary group of researchers led by Professor Gill Livingston \(Division of Psychiatry, UCL\), developed and evaluated the STrAtegies for RelaTives \(START\) intervention; a programme of therapy and coping strategies for dementia carers. The multi\-disciplinary team comprised clinical psychiatrists specialising in older adults, clinical psychologists, neurologists, qualitative researchers, health economists, and statisticians. Dr Barber led the statistical team and was responsible for all statistical aspects of the evaluation of the START intervention. 

 In 2009, the research team conducted a randomised trial of START. The trial recruited 260 carers, who were randomly allocated to the intervention \(START\) group and to the ‘treatment as usual’ \(TAU\) control group in a 2:1 ratio. Within the intervention group, participants received 8 sessions of manual\-based therapy \(performed according to specific guidelines to maximise consistency\), delivered over 8\-14 weeks by psychology graduates supervised by the research team. This was the first UK randomised trial on the clinical effectiveness \(long\-term reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms\) and cost effectiveness of individual manual\-based therapy for dementia carers. 

 Dr Barber’s research is predominately in design and analysis of randomised trials of new health care interventions. She led all statistical aspects of the START trial, including inputting into the design of the trial; designing the statistical analyses, including identifying and evaluating optimal methods; supervising the data preparation and analysis; and writing peer\-reviewed articles. The effect of the START intervention was evaluated after 4 and 8 months \( **R1, R2**\) **,** 24 months \( **R3**\), and 6 years \( **R4**\). Dr Barber supervised two statisticians, Mark Griffin \(UCL Primary Care and Population Health\) and Dr Aidan O’Keeffe \(UCL Statistical Science\) in analysis of the clinical data and advised the Health Economists on statistical analysis of economic outcomes \( **R2, R3, R4**\). 

 Dr Barber’s underpinning research in design and analysis of trials allowed her to ensure the most appropriate and up\-to\-date methods were used for the START evaluation. Her analysis plans incorporated new statistical methodologies which had not previously been widely used in applied research, but which were essential to address specific complexities of the START trial design, ensuring unbiased and precise estimates of the intervention effect. In particular, she identified that modelling needed to account for the clustering of outcomes for carers receiving the intervention from the same therapists. Typically in previous trials, such clustering had been ignored, but Dr Barber’s research identified that this approach could result in inflation of type 1 errors and in false claims of important intervention effects. The START analysis was therefore carried out using a particular specification for a multilevel mixed\-effects model that allowed for differential clustering in the trial arms \( **R1, R2**\). For the 6\-year evaluation, Dr Barber found that results from analyses of the longitudinal HADS\-T scores could be biased due to “informative censoring” when the person with dementia was admitted to a care\-home or died. Informative censoring is usually ignored in trial analyses, resulting in estimation of potentially incorrect intervention effects. To address this Dr Barber used joint mixed effects models that incorporated time until institutionalisation or death alongside the HADS\-T measurements \( **R4**\). 

 Analysis of HADS\-T over the 8\-month evaluation period showed a significant improvement in anxiety and depression for carers receiving the START intervention. For the depression sub\-score, carers who participated in the TAU group were four times more likely to have clinically significant depression compared with those who received START \( **R1**\) **.** The corresponding economic calculations demonstrated a high probability of cost effectiveness \( **R2**\). 

 The positive clinical effect of the START intervention was sustained after 24 months, as evidenced by improved carer mood and lower anxiety levels \(lower HADS\-T\) \( **R3**\). START was also shown to be cost effective with respect to carer and patient outcomes, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) thresholds. 

 The most recent analysis over a 6\-year period, showed that carers who participated in the START programme were five times less likely to have clinically significant depression than carers in the TAU group \( **R4**\). Costs of care were nearly three times lower among families in the START group \(GBP5,759 per patient\) compared with the TAU group \(GBP16,964 per patient\), likely due to the improvement in family carers’ mental health and quality of life \( **R4**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The number of people living with dementia is rising rapidly owing to increased longevity. Two\-thirds of people with dementia \(approximately 567,000 in the UK\) live at home, with their family providing most of their care \( **S1**\). According to the Alzheimer Society’s estimation, more than 600,000 family members provide GBP13,900,000,000 per year of unpaid dementia care in the UK, however, 40% of the family carers have a clinical depression or anxiety, while others have substantial psychological symptoms \( **S1**\). Family care is pivotal as it exerts a 20\-fold protective effect against the risk of care home admission \( **S1**\). Therefore, the wellbeing of family caregivers and providing them with effective support is crucial. 

 The usefulness of the START psychological intervention for family carers was evaluated in a well\-conducted randomised trial, which relied on use of optimal statistical methodologies to ensure accurate and unbiased estimates of the intervention effect. This trial provided robust evidence of clinical and cost\-effectiveness of the intervention and has subsequently influenced decisions about guidelines, policy and practice for supporting family caregivers. 

 Approximately **66% of trial participants continued to use the techniques** they had been taught after the programme ended \( **S2**\). The manual and associated resources to deliver the intervention are freely available and can be downloaded \(in English, Urdu, Spanish and Japanese\) from the UCL website \( **S3**\). The page has been viewed approximately 30,000 times until the end of 2020 \( **S4**\).

 The evidence of START’s effectiveness has led policy makers to cite it in national guidance and policy documents. The UK Government included START **in The Prime Minister’s Challenge on Dementia 2020** \(published in 2015\), which set actions to improve dementia care, support and research in England \( **S5**\). They noted that “Carers of people with dementia undoubtedly provide a vital role and we know that the availability of appropriate care and support and the quality of services has a significant bearing on whether carers feel able to take a break from their caring responsibilities” \( **S5**\). The government recommended carers of people with dementia should be aware of and be offered the opportunity for respite, education, training, emotional and psychological support, to better enable them to cope with their caring responsibilities. To allow carers to have a life alongside caring, the guidelines recommend that more employers should have carer friendly policies and practice enabling more carers to continue working and caring. The Government also mandated that NHS England \(2016\-2017\) should provide measurable improvements in all areas of the policy, including quality of post\-diagnosis treatment and support for people with dementia and their carers \( **S5**\). 

 The Chief Executive of **Alzheimer’s Research UK** \(the country’s leading dementia research charity\) acknowledged the programme’s importance: “Around 23,000,000 people in the UK – roughly a third of the population – have a close friend or family member with dementia, and it’s these unsung heroes who take on much of the strain of the condition. It’s important to find ways to support carers and protect their health, and these results suggest that the START programme can help reduce anxiety and depression for carers” \( **S6**\). 

 START was evaluated in the **National Institute of Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines on Dementia** \(NG97 Assessment, management and support for people living with dementia and their carers; June 2018\). The NG97 evidence committee noted, “The evidence from the 2014 Livingston HTA report which demonstrated that successful non\-pharmacological interventions for managing non\-cognitive symptoms could be cost saving, due to the reductions in subsequent treatment costs for those receiving early interventions. The committee agreed that this recent HTA report represented the best quality economic evidence available and supported the recommendation for the first line use of non\-pharmacological management” \( **S7**\). Whilst the document recommended a variety of approaches for carer support, such as START or a similar intervention, the committee agreed that “the topics covered by START are a good representation of the topics that should be covered in this type of intervention” for carers \( **S7**\).

 The publication of the START intervention has generated a lot of interest and enthusiasm from NHS trusts for its adoption and it is now being delivered in one third of London memory clinics. 

 The Alzheimer’s Society \(the UK’s leading dementia support charity\) provided funding for dissemination of START, allowing training of 134 clinical psychologists and 39 admiral nurses in 9 UK locations from October 2014 to September 2015. Since then, the UCL team has provided training for 30 staff members in another London trust \(NELFT\) and others are being trained by the members of the dissemination groups. These trained professionals then cascaded training to others in their area, and this resulted in START being delivered locally to 136 carers across 11 service areas in 2016. A survey carried out in July 2018 by the UCL team indicated that **START is being used by at least 24 services over 12 NHS trusts, with approximately 192 carers** having received the intervention in 2017 \( **S8**\) **.** Individuals who completed the training reported better understanding of the condition and how it can cause challenging behaviour. This understanding made it easier for them to cope with psychological distress and improved their wellbeing, with a related improvement in their ability to provide care: “Yesterday I had the feeling of happiness I haven’t had in a long time. I suddenly felt positive and ‘able” \( **S8**\). This is echoed by voices from the dementia support workers, START facilitators and managers at the Alzheimer’s Society:“The work I got to do with START was really meaningful. Personally, I feel that START gave me the opportunity to work closely with carers, building a relationship that I normally wouldn’t get to, helping them to deal with the everyday practical sides of caring”; 

 “I really enjoyed making an actual difference to people’s lives, literally \(…\) the feedback from the carers is that it does work \(…\) it’s nice to know that there is a tool that can help carers that are really struggling”; 

 “That day is hard, seeing the consultant, trying to get ready and it’s a heavy day. Whereas with this, it’s in someone’s comfortable space and it’s at their own time and it’s looking at strategies \(…\) The things that maybe aren’t discussed with GPs or even a support worker on a home visit. This really opens up quite a lot more, it helps with exploring a lot more detail into what’s happening in the home and I think that’s really good”; 

 “I felt like it really highlighted and made my job more meaningful, because often I would come away thinking I’ve not done anything other than sat with a family for an hour and a half and talked about what dementia is \(…\) START actually gave them that one to one, especially for the carer \[to\] actually help the person with dementia in the long run” \( **S8**\). 

 <ins> **Worldwide implement</ins><ins>ation of the START intervention**</ins> 

 The START intervention has also been adopted by the international community. An online video conferencing version of START was developed in **Australia** to enable delivery of the intervention from Melbourne and Perth to people in remote communities **.** By November 2018 **,** 4 therapists had completed extensive training provided by UCL researchers and 28 carers had already completed the 8\-week programme \( **S9**\). Work in 2018\-20 enabled delivery to the **South Asian community** \(Urdu translation\) **.** Translation of the START manual into Japanese \(2019\) enabled 14 people to receive the intervention in an ongoing study in **Japan**, with 27 receiving training by February 2020 \( **S9**\). A START pilot project was conducted in **Hong Kong,** where 13 family carers have received training since the manual was translated into Chinese in 2017. Translations into Tamil and Hindi have been trialled successfully and START is now being delivered remotely in **India** \(Chennai, Mysore and New Dehli\) \( **S10**\) **.** In **Spain** it was trialled in 4 people after consultation about the translation. Unfortunately, plans for the regional authorities to begin implementation in Northern Spain have been delayed by the COVID pandemic \( **S10**\). 

 START has been adapted \(in collaboration with UCL\) for delivery in several different contexts and populations. The UCL Institute of Neurology adapted and trialled START for patients with **Parkinson’s Disease dementia**, and it has been adapted to **Lewy Body Dementia** \(with training already delivered to carers through third sector partners\). Furthermore, the success of the START intervention built a team and a method that led to funding further research programmes focused on dementia. These include the DREAMS\-START intervention involving a similar style of intervention to improve sleep in people with dementia living at home and a project to improve quality of life in people with dementia.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Open University’s research regarding the ‘blue code’ of silence in UK police forces has resulted in a major change in policing policy and practice. Over the years, **Westmarland’s** findings had shown that many officers would not choose to report a colleague’s serious and potentially harmful misbehaviour. Influenced by this research, the first UK police Code of Ethics, published in 2014, states not reporting a colleague is now a statutory offence. Police officers in the UK are now disciplined, and potentially dismissed, if they fail to report colleagues’ unethical or illegal behaviour. Through her membership of the National Crime Agency’s \(NCA\) Ethics Committee, **Westmarland** has also used her research to directly influence police actions in challenging ethical situations at the highest level of UK policing. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since joining The Open University in 2001, **Westmarland** has been researching how and why police officers seem culturally obliged to cover up one another’s corrupt behaviour. Over the years she has demonstrated that the front line, ‘blue code’, is underpinned by an occupational culture which is more influential than regulations imposed by the organisation’s hierarchy, or even the rule of law. She has contributed to the national discourse on ethics and policing **\[O1, O2, O3\]** as well as the international debate **\[O4\]**. Her contribution has been to illuminate the way the ‘blue code’ of silence can inhibit police integrity and accountability. 

 Over the past twenty years, **Westmarland’s** studies have provided empirical evidence that police misbehaviour often goes unreported **\[O5, O6\]**. Her key findings show that, although officers who responded to her scenario\-based questionnaires considered certain behaviours to be ‘serious’, they would not necessarily report them **\[O5\]**. These included a colleague who was involved in a road traffic accident after drink\-driving and officers who punched suspects, even though they were already restrained. Some other offences the respondents considered serious – such as stealing a watch or money – were more likely to be reported **\[O6\]** since the introduction of the *Code of Ethics* in 2014. However, there exists a range of behaviours which officers consider to be less serious offences and which they indicated they were very unlikely to report. These scenarios include receiving gifts from local shopkeepers at Christmas, finding people in a pub drinking after hours, and running a private business on the side **\[O5\]**. These data were gathered using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative data was collected using a series of scenario\-based questionnaires over a period of 15 years. The qualitative data was collected via ethnographic observational studies, some conducted in the USA with homicide detectives **\[O4\]**. 

 **Westmarland** and colleagues have conducted a series of studies aimed at defining and quantifying issues around the code of silence. Her first survey, published in 2005 \(n=276 police officers\), showed that many officers were unwilling to report a colleague who engaged in seriously harmful misdemeanours such as drink\-driving or using excessive force on detained suspects **\[O1\]**. This is important in terms of the ‘blue code’ argument because it is the sort of behaviour that is not only a disciplinary offence, but also an example of the sort of cultural issues – excessive drinking and the use physical force – which are said to typify the cultural norms of policing. 

 A second survey, in 2011, conducted with Michael Rowe at Northumbria University \(n=510 police officers\), surveyed three contrasting police forces. These included a small rural force, a large metropolitan force, and a force struggling to work together with their ethnically diverse population **\[O5\]**. The research forces were geographically spread across England. The findings revealed similar tendencies to her previous study **\[O1\]**, with fewer than half of all officers were willing to report a drink\-driving colleague or colleagues using excessive force. **Westmarland** reported these findings in early 2013 at an international conference organised by the Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee. At the conference she presented her data to more than 300 senior police chiefs and academics. 

 Once the 2014 *Code of Ethics* had been in place for two years, a further survey showed a changing pattern from the previous two surveys. The drink\-driving scenario showed respondents were more willing to report colleagues – around three\-quarters now said they would do this. A willingness to report an officer for the use of excessive force had also risen from around 50% to about 75% **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Key impacts include influencing the College of Policing’s first ever *Code of Ethics* in 2014 \[C1\] **,** which explicitly addresses the ‘blue code’ of silence via legal statute, including the ensuing important changes to police disciplinary procedures, and impact through membership of the NCA Ethics Committee which addresses how complex crime is dealt with by the police. 

 **Westmarland’s** research has influenced ethical practices in policing across the UK. Her work has been used for training and education of officers at all levels from street policing to Chief Constables. This has been achieved by a programme of engagement across policy and practice fora. Her first paper **\[O1\]** is the fourth most popular read article at >9,467 views, of the leading international academic policing journal, *Policing and Society*. This is as it is regarded as a ‘go\-to’ journal for police training courses, police studies, and by officers preparing for internal police exams and promotion processes. She has also contributed to senior officers’ discussions and the Stevens’ Commission, which aimed to investigate how to change policing ‘for a better Britain’. 

 **Influencing Policing Code of Ethics**The College of Policing’s 2014 *Code of Ethics*, is the first ever imposed on policing in England and Wales. It contains standards of professional conduct which in one key aspect is “ *\[…\] influenced by Professor **Westmarland’s** work on the ‘blue code’ of silence, this is an excellent example of Academia having a positive and practical influence on policing \[…\]”* confirmed by former Association of Chief Constables’ Lead for Police Ethics **\[C2\]**. The Code of Ethics sets and defines the exemplary standards of behaviour for everyone who works in policing as well as bolstering trust by the public. **Westmarland’s** work has influenced police policy makers – including the Home Office, via the College of Policing – to introduce this Code of Ethics. This document includes, as its only statutory \(i.e. enforceable by law\) requirement, that officers must report colleagues’ unethical behaviour **\[C1\]**. 

 This change in the law and police practice came about came about through a programme of engagement. At a Select Committee Conference at the House of Commons, **Westmarland** was an invited Keynote Speaker on a panel comprising two Senior Police Officers, the Chair of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, and the Chair of the Association of Chief Police Officers \(ACPO\) and she was the only academic speaker invited. There was an audience of 300 police, academics and press **\[C3a**, p. 2 **\]**. The event was reported in the media on 15 January 2013, including *The* *Daily Telegraph, Independent, The Daily Mail,* and *The Daily Mirror*, with headlines including: “ *Half of officers would not report attack on suspect*”, “ *A blue wall of silence*”, and “ *Half of police would turn a blind eye to punching a suspect*” **\[C4\]**. The problems were then outlined in Parliament by then Home Secretary in a statement to the House on 12 February 2013 **\[C5\]**. These comments mirrored **Westmarland’s** presentation to the Select Committee conference a month earlier. Her shadow MP responded that some research was being commissioned \( **Westmarland’s**\) and noted the contribution, on ethics, with regard to the Stevens’ Commission. **Westmarland** was the only academic who had contributed on ethics to the Stevens’ Commission **\[C6\]**. Her work was also mentioned in a written submission to the Home Affairs Select Committee **\[C3b\]**. 

 In the course of the following year, **Westmarland** gave a large number of talks, public lectures, and conference presentations on the topic of her research **\[C7\]**. These included talks at the National Police Chiefs’ annual conference on ethics, the College of Policing’s national command course, and a conference organized at The Open University where the CEO of the College of Policing presented the opening speech. One of the ways in which research influence was most directly exerted was in the period when the Code was being drafted **Westmarland** was invited to speak to a group of Home Office officials concerned with developing the new code of ethics **\[C2\]**, which directly influenced the new code. The Chief Operating Officer of the College of Policing at the time noted: “ *As part of the process she* \[ **Westmarland**\] *was consulted by the senior team who were devising the code. Her studies of the so\-called ‘blue code of silence’ and the way police cultures have been shown to operate were influential on the code’s development”* **\[C8\]**. 

 Subsequently, in 2014, the first Code of Ethics relating to policing in England and Wales was published. The influence of this document is extensive because it is the formal guidance document issued to all serving police officers regarding their behaviour and actions, particularly in ‘heat of the moment’ situations. It has ten ‘standards’ of professional behaviour, the final being, *“Challenging and reporting improper conduct’ and the first point of which is that ‘According to this standard you must never ignore unethical or unprofessional behaviour by a policing colleague, irrespective of the person’s rank, grade or role”* **\[C1,** p. 15 **\]**. For the first time in the history of this country’s policing, officers are now required to report any colleagues’ misdemeanours that they observe. This is shaped by **Westmarland’s** main finding, that the ‘blue code’ of silence prevents law\-breaking by police being reported, and subsequently either punished or prevented \(as the Chief Constable confirmed **\[C8\]**\). Section 10 of the Code of Ethics now states that Officers are required to report any rule breaking or criminal activity they observe and failure to do so can result in a charge of gross misconduct leading to dismissal **\[C1**, p.15 **\]**. 

 **Effects of the Code of Ethics**Cases of gross misconduct have already been pursued under the new statutory regulation contained in the Code, with officers being disciplined, threatened with dismissal, or required to resign **\[C9a\-d\]**. For example, in 2016 in the north of England, a police sergeant failed to report an allegation of excessive force by a constable he was accompanying to a disturbance in a bar. The misconduct case was taken up in the light of the new enforceable element of the Code of Ethics **\[C1, C9a\]**. Collated statistics on these cases do not currently exist but research on individual forces shows that officers have been disciplined and dismissed for not reporting unethical or illegal actions **\[**for examples see **C9a\-d\]**. The College’s Code of Ethics has concentrated on the ‘blue code’ of silence, in terms of statutory requirements of conduct, which in turn may have influenced the results of **Westmarland** and **Conway’s** **\[O6\]** more recent findings, showing an increased likelihood, by police, to report colleagues’ misdeeds. 

 **Influence on police ethics regionallyWestmarland’s** research process included surveys conducted with police forces across the UK. This also served to raise this important issue in practice. One example of the effect of this is with West Yorkshire Police. The research work with the force resulted in actions around ethics and integrity being changed by the force’s senior management team. For example, changing the anonymous message system where officers can report colleagues, to improve trust in it **\[C10\]**. In addition, **Westmarland** and **Conway’s** research **\[O6\]** was used to influence national questions around the Code of Ethics by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services \(HMICFRS\) **\[C10\]** which assesses how far forces are showing progression on ethical issues. As the Detective Superintendent of West Yorkshire Police stated; “ *Her* \[ **Westmarland’s**\] *work on the Code of Ethics and the ‘blue code’ of ethics has been read and used in our discussions and informed our training and disciplinary processes. It has had a significant impact on the ways in which we think about these issues and have found her research extremely useful in shaping these local, and potentially national, policies”* **\[C10\]**. 

 **Impact through the NCA Ethics Committee** 

 “*Using her experience and research”* **\[C11a\] Westmarland** has influenced the activities of the NCA’s Ethics Committee since her appointment at its formation in 2017. The NCA is the UK equivalent of the USA’s FBI and deals exclusively with high level policing issues of national and international importance. There are only five external members of the Ethics Committee known as the *Independent Advisory Group on Ethics* \(IAGE\) and **Westmarland** is the policing expert on this group. Her role is to advise on and help shape the NCA’s policies and processes, including in ongoing cases where the police are confronted with challenging ethical dilemmas and is tasked with advising on particular courses of action in the light of ethical concerns. The specifics of these issues are highly confidential, but they include child abuse, high value fraud, illegal drugs, and the use of undercover agents, including those who act on behalf of the UK Government to uncover crimes across the world. **Westmarland’s** role as a policing expert has seen her comment on cases where her knowledge of police research is pertinent, including where her own experiences of researching and observing serving police officers is the key information. The NCA Director General Operations noted that, “ *as an independent advisor to the NCA, as a member of the IAGE, **Professor Westmarland** has had an impact on strategies and policies as well as day to day activities where officers find themselves in situations facing ethical dilemmas”  \[C11a\]**. **Westmarland’s** contributions have “ *led to new ways of thinking about these difficult and complex problems*” **\[C11a\]**. 

 The Chair of the Committee outlined, **Westmarland’s** contributions regarding; informing the operations of the group in terms of advising on methods used by police and others in the NCA to carry out work, making the group more effective in terms of assessing ethics, informing them about the effect of the ‘blue code’ of silence and police culture more broadly **\[C11b\]**. However, he also identified specific contribution in terms of the NCA’s own code of ethics, published in September 2020. “ **Professor Westmarland’s** contributions have had a direct impact on the Code in terms of wording and implementation*” **\[C11b\]**, specifically in the way it can take police cultural ideas and behaviours into account. These contributions *“directly impacted upon decisions which are fed back to officers and agents in the front line”* **\[C11b\]**. 

 Overall therefore, as the former Chief Operating Officer of the College of Policing concludes: “ *Her work and the way she has communicated and shared it with policing colleagues has contributed to an important development in policing, a development that has resulted, ultimately, in a more professional, accountable and ethical policing service*” **\[C8\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The offshore wind industry is central to the UK’s energy plans, and this project was directed entirely towards enhancing the economic viability of offshore wind through improved engineering design. The Joint Industry Pile Soil Analysis \(PISA\) research project created new engineering design methods for the “monopile” foundations that support offshore wind turbines. The new methods reduce risk, address design conservatism and reduce associated costs. By optimisation of turbine foundation for specific geographic locations, accounting for the complex offshore ground conditions, the methods developed have contributed to lower overall costs for wind energy, and have influenced standards for the design of offshore wind farms. Applying the method, Ørsted optimised 50% of the foundations for Hornsea 1 \(1.2GW, 174 turbines\), the largest operational windfarm in the world, and Borssele 1&2 \(752MW, 94 turbines\), both constructed, leading to \[text removed for publication\] of savings on steel, and de\-risking the design. The PISA design methods have been applied to RWE’s Triton Knoll windfarm \(0.86GW, 90 foundations\), under construction, Equinor’s operational Dudgeon windfarm \(0.4 GW, 67 foundations\), and Equinor / SSE’s Dogger Bank windfarm \(3.6GW, 300 foundations\) currently in design. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research was completed during the PISA project \(between Aug 2013 and Jul 2018\), funded through the Carbon Trust’s Offshore Wind Accelerator, led by Ørsted, and with a further 10 industry partners comprising the key European wind farm developers \(responsible for over 75% of European installed wind capacity\). The scientific work was led by the University of Oxford \(Byrne as Principal Investigator, Houlsby, Burd, Martin, McAdam\), collaborating with Imperial College London \(Zdravković, Jardine, Potts, Taborda\) and University College Dublin \(Gavin\). Oxford provided the scientific and strategic leadership for the work, collaborating closely with the industrial partners, and took responsibility for the delivery of new design methods, including theoretical developments and all scientific aspects of the extensive field pile\-testing campaign. Imperial College led on the three\-dimensional finite element modelling and site characterisation activities. University College Dublin provided support to the field\-testing activities. The close involvement of industry partners in the research allowed rapid uptake of the results by the industry, even as the research was being developed. 

 During the project, the scientific team developed new design methods to allow optimisation of the monopile foundations that support offshore wind turbines. Monopiles are large diameter steel tubes \(see Figure on next page\), impact driven into the seafloor, typically 8m to 10m in diameter, 30m to 50m long, and weighing up to 1000t. Optimisation is central to wind farm economics and long\-term wind turbine performance. The key research achievement was to capture accurately the detailed monopile soil\-structure interaction for each wind farm site, ensuring site\-specific and turbine\-specific optimisation to save on steel costs. This insight was developed from a range of connected and carefully planned activities: \(a\) site investigation and laboratory element testing, \(b\) numerical modelling, including sophisticated three\-dimensional finite element analysis, \(c\) theoretical developments, including development of simplified design procedures, and \(d\) a comprehensive medium\-scale field pile testing campaign to validate the new design methods. 

 Key outputs of the PISA design method include generic design procedures for wind farm designers, as well as bespoke design equations. These enable simplified calculations to be completed, which have the fidelity of more complex finite element calculations, but computed in a fraction of the time, covering a wide range of design conditions. The procedures specifically address the computational requirements for the engineering design team, where many load cases and design scenarios must be considered in a short period of time during the design phase of a project. 



 The procedures have been developed for a wide range of common soil types found in the offshore environment, and account for layered soil profiles typically encountered. The procedures can be applied at concept design stage or for more detailed design and can be adapted for specific sites, depending on the amount of site investigation data available to the design team. Importantly, the procedures allow the design calculation to be optimised for each individual turbine location, accounting for the wide range of geological profiles found across very large wind farm sites \(often covering hundreds of square kilometres\). The research outputs have been reported in the leading journal *Géotechnique* **\[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\], \[R4\], \[R5\], \[R6\]** \(all Open Access\) and are also embodied in commercially available software \(MoDeTo\) developed collaboratively with the geotechnical software provider PLAXIS. 

 The research has produced a new engineering design method \(the PISA design model\) for offshore wind turbine monopile foundations, described in outputs **\[R1\]** and **\[R2\]** \(led by Oxford\). The research initially explored geological conditions relevant to UK offshore wind farms, and was validated by an ambitious programme of field testing, described in outputs **\[R3\]** and **\[R4\]** \(led by Oxford\). The basis for the numerical modelling that underpins the simplified design calculation procedures \(developed in **\[R1\]** and **\[R2\]**\) is described in outputs **\[R5\]** and **\[R6\]** \(led by Imperial College\). The work was then further developed to include a wider range of soil profiles relevant to offshore UK, as well as across Europe and internationally. The application of the new PISA design model to layered soils routinely encountered offshore \(led by Oxford\) was also addressed. 

 To achieve maximum impact, a comprehensive and planned dissemination programme was central to the project. The dissemination programme was led by Oxford, and included: 

-  10 confidential reports for the industrial sponsors \(between 2013 and 2018\); 

-  8 confidential workshops for the PISA Project Industry Partners \(>50 attendees each time\); 

-  to reach a wider audience, 38 invited lectures / presentations at academic and industry focused conferences, including at the Institution of Civil Engineers, at industry workshops, at universities \(UK, US, Australia\), and at national Geotechnical Societies \(British, Danish, French\), some of which were also recorded for web\-viewing; 

-  7 conference papers, including an invited keynote paper for an international industry conference, all involving oral presentations; 

-  10 journal papers \(9 Open Access\) to provide a permanent record of the scientific work. 

 The excellence of the management of the PISA Project was recognised by the British Geotechnical Association’s Fleming Award, 2017, for “excellence in the practical application of geotechnics in a project”, the only time the award has been made to a research project.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of the work is derived from reducing the direct and indirect costs for the foundations that support offshore wind turbines, leading to improved economic viability generally for offshore wind, and for specific offshore wind farm developments. The industry funding partners for the PISA project consisted of 11 of Europe’s main offshore wind developers, collectively responsible for more than 75% of Europe’s installed offshore wind capacity \(Ørsted, E.ON, EDF, GE Renewable Energy, Iberdrola, Innogy \(now RWE\), SSE, Statkraft, Equinor, Van Oord and Vattenfall\), and also involved in offshore wind development outside Europe \(e.g., USA, Taiwan\). They each had access to the research outputs at an early stage and were therefore able to implement the recommendations through their engineering teams as the results became available **\[S1, S2, S3\]**. This close collaboration, with the work focusing on soil profiles relevant to UK / European wind farm sites, ensured that the new methods were applied rapidly to design of new wind farm developments. Specific impacts include: 

###  *Economic Impact \- savings to design and construction for industry partners* 

 The PISA design method was initially delivered to industry partners between 2014 and 2016. Ørsted have seen **direct savings of** \[text removed for publication\] in reduced steel costs for the monopile foundations now constructed at Hornsea 1 \(1.2GW, PISA applied to 87 of the 174 foundations\) and Borssele 1&2 \(0.7GW, PISA applied to all 94 foundations\). Anticipated savings have been factored into costing of bids to develop future sites, playing an important role in the success of these bids: Ørsted have estimated **further direct savings of** \[text removed for publication\] **over the next 5 years** for wind farms currently in design and construction \(e.g. Hornsea 2 \- 1.4GW, 165 foundations; Skipjack – 0.12GW; Ocean Wind – 1.1GW, Godewind 3 – 0.24GW, Borkum Riffgrund 3 – 0.9GW\). The PISA design method is fully implemented into Ørsted’s design process for these and future wind farms **\[S1\]**. RWE’s Triton Knoll wind farm, currently under construction with foundations now installed \(0.86GW, 90 foundations\), RWE’s Sofia wind farm \(1.4GW, 100 foundations\) and the Dogger Bank wind farm \(3.6GW, 300 foundations\) to be developed jointly by Equinor and SSE, have all adopted the PISA design model **\[S2, S3\]**. PISA was first applied to Equinor’s Dudgeon Wind Farm \(0.4GW, 67 foundations\) in 2015/16, providing confirmation that the original American Petroleum Institute \(API\) design and methods were conservative **\[S3\]**. 

 A paper authored by parties entirely independent from the PISA project, from the consulting engineers Atkins, verifies that 30% savings by mass of the monopile foundation can be delivered in commercial design \(note that *D* below refers to diameter of foundation, which identifies the length of pile reduction achieved\): 

 *“Whilst monopiles have been the dominant foundation type for offshore wind, the soil response which plays such a significant role in their design has historically been modelled using either inadequate or poorly calibrated representations. The recently completed PISA JIP which involved large scale lateral pile load tests at two sites and state of the art finite element analysis offers recommendations to better model the soil response. It considers four components of resistance and recommends that formulations for the non\-linear soil reaction springs be derived from 3\-D numerical models \(calibrated to pile load test results\).* 

 *The PISA JIP recommendations have successfully been implemented for the design of an offshore wind farm in the UK North Sea and some of the practical aspects of the implementation have been presented. The improved soil response modelling has resulted in significant monopile embedment reductions \(1 to 2 D\) and mass reductions \(in excess of 30%\) compared to traditional design approaches.* 

 *The implementation of the PISA JIP improved soil response modelling approach leads to significant CAPEX reductions and also enables monopiles to be considered in deeper waters and for larger turbines than previously considered.”* **\[S4\]**. 

 The paper refers to Triton Knoll wind farm as the subject, for which Atkins were the foundation designer **\[S2, S4\]**. Offshore construction began in Q1 2020, with the 90 monopile foundations installed by August 2020. RWE **\[S2\]** states that “ *The weight of the installed foundations was c.600 tonnes \[600t\] – had they not been designed by PISA they would have been substantially heavier and costlier.*” First power is expected in early 2021. 

###  *Economic Impact – Indirect savings to industry resulting from the PISA project* 

 Industry partners have noted the many indirect savings arising from the use of the new PISA design methods. These are more difficult to quantify without detailed costing analyses for alternative scenarios. However, Ørsted, for example, states that “ *other indirect savings, such as a\) reduction of installation risk due to shorter pile lengths, b\) continuation of use of monopile as the cheapest foundation concept in deeper waters and with bigger turbines* \[text removed for publication\] *c\)  shorter  offshore  installation  time  and  d\) better assessment of foundation fatigue life \(due to better understanding of foundation initial stiffness response\) leading to better quantification of risks have also led to major cost savings for foundation design and construction”* **\[S1\]**. RWE and Atkins also refer to the indirect savings resulting from PISA **\[S2, S4\]**. 

 **New commercial software** “MoDeTo”, produced by PLAXIS, a geotechnical engineering software company, under licence from Oxford, **captured the PISA design method**. This software, released in 2018, allows commercial designers to carry out engineering design calculations incorporating the PISA design method during the design of new offshore wind farms. It is now marketed through Bentley as the “PLAXIS Monopile Designer” **\[S5\]**. 

###  *Economic Impact – reduction to the cost of offshore wind energy* 

 The PISA design method contributes to improved engineering design for offshore wind to **reduce the “levelised cost of energy”,** leading to more rapid deployment of offshore wind, with consequent decarbonisation of the electricity system \(e.g., each installed 8MW offshore wind turbine displaces approximately 12,000tCO<sub>2</sub>/year from fossil fuel generation\). The use of the PISA design model directly influences foundation costs, which are approximately 20% of capital costs. PISA has been adopted for the foundation design underpinning Contract for Difference \(CfD\) bids \(all expressed in 2012 prices, date given is of the successful auction\) for Hornsea 2 \(2017, Ørsted, 1,400 MW, GBP57.50 per MWh\), Dogger Bank \(2019, Equinor/SSE, 3,600MW, GBP39.65 to GBP41.61 per MWh\), Sofia \(2019, Innogy, 1,200MW, GBP39.65 per MWh\). This compares to 2015 figures for nuclear power of GBP92.50 per MWh and offshore wind of GBP114 to GBP120 per MWh. RWE **\[S2\]** states that “ *The strike price reductions have been achieved through multiple technical advances, including very significant contributions on the foundations component from the PISA project led by Oxford University.*” The PISA design model is actively contributing to offshore wind becoming “subsidy\-free” **\[S1, S2, S3\]**. 

###  *Policy Impact – PISA findings being incorporated into international standards* 

 Ørsted **\[S1\]** states that “ *The PISA project has been a **highly successful case of close industry\-academia collaboration** and has led to significant improvements in design methodologies of offshore windfarm foundations.*” The work is being incorporated into the **international standards and guidance** used by engineers designing offshore wind farms, and which, if followed, normally allow design certification to be achieved. CFMS, the French society for soil mechanics, first incorporated the method into French guidance notes for offshore wind design in 2018 **\[S6\]**. Draft guidance is being incorporated into the new revision of ISO 19901\-4, the international standard for offshore geotechnical design, due out shortly. It is expected that similar text would be included within API RP 2GEO, the American Petroleum Institute guidance on offshore geotechnical design, in due course through a process that will continue into 2022 **\[S7\]**.The corroborating letter from Equinor **\[S3\]** concludes “ *In summary, PISA has resulted in a more reliable design with risks better assessed and improved accuracy.*”

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Edinburgh Napier University on home blood pressure \(BP\) telemonitoring in primary care has had significant national and international impact. Findings have improved hypertension management and reduced patients’ risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, whilst also reducing demand on primary care because fewer appointments have been needed. 

 Offering a better method of BP monitoring, telemonitoring has been adopted by over 400 Scottish GP practices, reaching over 14,000 people \(hypertensive patients\) in Scotland, with a Scottish Government target of 20,000 patients by 2021. Internationally the research has influenced clinical guidance and services in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia and Japan. Additionally, an online tool is improving accuracy of screening for hypertension. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 High blood pressure \(BP\) \(hypertension\) is a major cause of death and disability, affecting 

 1.13billion people \(1 in 4 adults\) worldwide and responsible for 50% of heart attacks and strokes. Often without symptoms, it is known as the ‘silent killer’ with as many as 20% of those with hypertension undiagnosed or not treated to target. Hypertension places significant financial pressure on healthcare services, costing the National Health Service \(NHS\) in the UK up to GBP3billion annually. Clinical time is also heavily impacted. In Scotland, blood pressure checks account for 1.2million appointments annually for a population of 5.5million. With an ageing society these numbers will rise, presenting an urgent need for solutions to manage the epidemic of hypertension. 

 Research by Dr Janet Hanley, Associate Professor at Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) 

 has focused on facilitating BP measurement at home using technology to electronically share the readings with a nurse or doctor in primary care \(telemonitoring\). This addresses three key areas. 1\) The need for more accurate and frequent BP readings, with in\-clinic readings often subject to the ‘white coat effect’, 2\) The need to improve patient engagement and understanding of their condition, 3\) The reduced number of and shorter primary care appointments required. Dr Hanley has strong links to the NHS with a background in community nursing and service development. Supported at ENU by Dr Jenny Ure, key collaborators include University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian. 

 <ins> **BP Telemonitoring Trials**</ins> 

 Dr Hanley led the randomised controlled trial and qualitative studies of BP telemonitoring **\[O1 O2, G1\]** which initiated the Telescot research programme, a major collaboration with NHS Lothian and the University of Edinburgh to advance the use of technology in healthcare. Of 401 participants, 200 monitored their BP at home and submitted results by text message to the practice via a secure website. After 6 months, the telemonitoring group showed lower readings of both systolic and diastolic BP, potentially reducing stroke by 15% and myocardial infarction by 10%. This outcome was subsequently replicated in two higher risk groups, those who had previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack \(TIA\) **\[O3\]** and those with type 2 diabetes **\[O4\]**. The embedded qualitative study revealed greater trust in home BP monitoring by both patients and healthcare professionals and demonstrated increased patient empowerment **\[O2\].** A novel finding from this study was that professionals \(mainly practice nurses\) found logging on to the commercially supplied, secure web\-based interface time consuming. 

 <ins> **Health Service Redesign**</ins> 

 In 2015, the Telescot collaboration, including Hanley, developed an initiative to encourage primary care practices and patients to engage in remote BP monitoring \(Scale Up BP\). A novel bridging system was developed to deliver BP telemonitoring reports to practices through their usual document management system. Seventy\-five primary care practices enrolled 3,200 patients. Eight of these practices were evaluated, showing that both clinician and patient engagement were improved and that BP telemonitoring led to better management of High BP **\[O5\]**. 

 <ins> **Screening for hypertension**</ins> 

 Dr Hanley worked as part of an international pooled data collaboration including University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of Warwick and University of Toronto. The study used trial data, office\-based, and ambulatory BP measurements to develop an algorithm to identify those most likely to be misclassified by screening clinic BP measurement. Triage using the Predicting Out of Office Blood Pressure \(PROOF\-BP\) algorithm would have reduced the need for ambulatory BP monitoring \(uncomfortable and expensive\) by 49% **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has four key areas of impact: 1\) Improved patient care through national service redevelopment in Scotland with BP telemonitoring now reaching over 14,000 people \(patients\) 2\) supporting remote health care delivery in response to covid\-19, 3\) International influence on clinical guidance and service development in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Japan and 4\) Improved identification of patients who would benefit from remote BP monitoring. 

1.  **National Service Redevelopment in Scotland** 

 The Scale Up BP pilot **\[O5\]** led to 72 GP practices in NHS Lothian adopting the system, offering BP telemonitoring with primary care support. One practice nurse commented “ *it increases patients’ awareness of hypertension and what causes it*” and a GP “ *I think the best part of this is that I don’t have to go anywhere looking for them \[..\] and I can assess them and compare with the previous ones”*. Patients involved in the pilot commented “ *it’s good because it makes you realise \[..\] BP’s a sort of hidden thing normally*” and “ *it was more convenient and also I think more realistic*”. By November 2020 Scale up BP was being used by 14,464 people \(patients\) in 430 GP practices across 11 of the 15 Scottish Health Boards **\[C1\].** The development was awarded the Clinical Improvement Award: Public Health and Prevention at the UK General Practice Awards in December 2019 **\[C2\]** and was shortlisted for the prestigious British Medical Journal \(BMJ\) awards **\[C2\]**. 

 The research findings **\[O1\-O5\]** informed Scottish Healthcare Policy. The Scottish Government’s Digital Health and Care Strategy, published in 2018, referenced the body of research as an influence on its findings, and the future direction of Scottish Healthcare **\[C3**\]. The report states *“A number of successes have been achieved in specific areas, including using technology enabled care \(TEC\) in prevention and early intervention \(for example, in the management of hypertension \[..\] The plan recommends that: Evidence based technology enabled health and care \(TEC, including telehealth\) be more broadly implemented at scale across Scotland \[..\] Initial use cases* *should include care and management of common chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension: Building upon the substantial success of these latter two’* **\[C3\]**. 

 The findings also influenced The Scottish Government’s 2018 Supporting & Empowering Scotland’s Citizens National Action Plan for Technology Enabled Care **\[C4\].** This inquiry researched how best to deal with hypertension across Scotland and cites Scale up BP as an important case study for how BP can be better controlled. It notes “ *This inquiry recommends that high blood pressure task force prioritises the availability and adoption at scale of self\-monitoring and self\-management of high blood pressure supported by telemonitoring* **” \[C4\].** 

 Scale Up BP was adopted by the Digital Health and Care Strategies implementation board in 2018 as a GBP1million service transformation programme. The 2019 – 2021 implementation strategy was launched in May 2019 **\[C5\]** and has a target of being adopted by 50% of GP practices and to reach 20,000 patients by 2021. This is projected to reduce major cardiovascular events by 12% per year and reduce routine primary care visits for BP checks by 24% per year. Dr Hanley has been funded by The British Heart Foundation to lead a study to develop methods to measure this improvement **\[G4\]** with results due in 2023. 

 <ins> **2\) Supporting remote health care delivery in response to covid\-19**</ins> 

 Scale Up BP provides the tools for remote care delivery for people with hypertension. Figures from NHS Lothian show that there was a huge increase in use of this service in the wake of covid\-19 from 86 people \(patients\) in January 2020 to 461 people \(patients\) in October 2020 **\[C1\].** One GP said “ *It’s even more appropriate in light of Covid\-19 and we are pushing on to recruit more people. Knowing that we can prevent more heart attacks and strokes this way is a real plus factor, and our patients like feeling supported without needing lots of trips to the health centre”  \[C6\].** 

1.  **International Influence on Clinical Practice and Guidance** 

 In the United States, **O1** was included in the systematic review underpinning the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association \(AHA\) clinical guideline on hypertension **\[C7\]**. It was also directly cited 4 times in AHA statements recommending the use of mobile health for cardiovascular disease prevention and BP measurement **\[C7\].** **O2** was cited in a policy statement from the AHA about implementing telehealth in cardiovascular and stroke care **\[C7\].** These guidelines, scientific and policy statements have led to the current AHA clinical programme ‘Target BP’ **\[C7\],** which recommends BP self\-monitoring and telemonitoring across the United States. In 2019, these approaches had been adopted by over 1,000 healthcare providers in the country, covering almost 9million patients with hypertension across 44 states **\[C7\].** 

 The trials have also been cited 8 times in other international guidelines. These include the 2016 pan Asian consensus guideline on hypertension management \[ **O1\]**; the 2019 Japanese guideline on Management of Hypertension **\[O1, O3\]** and the 2020 Canadian 2020 comprehensive guideline on the diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment of hypertension **\[C7\].** 

 Additionally, patient level data from **O1, O3** and **O4** \(758 patients\) was shared with a systematic review team from University of Oxford, and the subsequent reviews recommending home BP monitoring and Telemonitoring are cited in the 2018 European Cardiology Society guideline on arterial hypertension, and the 2020 US Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension **\[C8\].** 

 Proof\-BP, the online hypertension screening tool developed in **O6**, which improves the identification of people who may benefit from further assessment of their BP, has been made freely available online. It has very recently been recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force to improve the identification of people with masked hypertension \(a high\-risk group of 3\-5% of the adult population who have low BP when measured in the surgery but have high underlying BP\) **\[C9\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The academic work produced by Professor Nick Bacon, in collaboration with the three other co\-founders of Disability@work \(Kim Hoque \(Warwick Business School\) and Melanie Jones and Vicki Wass \(Cardiff Business School\)\), has helped change government policies relating to the employment of 7.9m working age disabled people in the UK, including 3.7m not currently in employment. Their research has influenced the following: apprenticeship targets for disabled people in the Industrial Strategy White Paper \(2017\); the Disability Confident scheme \(covering 15,000 employers\); government targets for disability employment; disability employment criteria in revising the Public Services \(Social Value\) Act 2012 \(covering £284 billion of public sector contracts\); the government’s framework for Voluntary Reporting on Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing \(2018\) and mandatory employer reporting; a disability\-inclusive response by government to the COVID\-19 pandemic. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Disabled people face severe challenges in the labour market \[3.5\], 81% of non\-disabled people are in employment compared with 52% of disabled people and there is a 15.2% disability pay gap. Bacon and colleagues’ research \[3.1\-3.6\] shows: 

 \[A\] The employment and retention of disabled people may be negatively affected by a range of HR practices \(including selective recruitment and selection, incentive pay systems, teamworking and functional flexibility\), but these effects are mitigated where organisations adopt a range of  disability equality practices \(monitoring and reviewing of recruitment, promotion and pay by disability; specific targeting of disabled people during recruitment and formal assessments of whether the workplace is accessible to disabled employees or job applicants\) \[3.1\]. 

 \[B\] Employers signing up to the government’s ‘Two Ticks’ scheme \(recognition given by Jobcentre Plus to employers in the UK who agreed to take action to meet commitments designed to help disabled employees\) did not adhere to expected commitments and employers who have signed up to the successor Disability Confident scheme \(the government's main policy in encouraging employers to adopt disability equality practices\) are unlikely to employ a higher proportion of disabled people in their workforce, or be more likely to have implemented disability equality practices, than non\-Disability Confident employers \[3.2,3.3\]. 

 \[C\] Trade unions have a sizeable positive influence on employer disability equality practices, particularly where negotiation or consultation takes place with unions over equality \[3.4\]. 

 \[D\] The government's 2015 manifesto commitment to halve the disability employment gap by 2020 will, on current trends, not be met until 2065 \[3.5\], but this will be assisted via government schemes to encourage employers to adopt disability equality practices such as: leveraging public procurement \(via an emphasis on disability employment outcomes in social value criteria\); better support for unions; better and more comprehensive reporting of disability employment outcomes at both national and organisational level; a review and revision of flagship schemes such as Disability Confident; better training and development provision for disabled people \[3.5\]. 

 \[E\] During economic downturns disabled employees are more likely than non\-disabled employees to experience a wage freeze or cut, reduced access to paid overtime, reductions to training, reorganisation of work roles and an increase in workload \[6\]. 

 The academic research in \[A\]–\[C\] \[3.1\-3.4\], along with primary evidence collected during a Parliamentary inquiry conducted by the report’s authors, provided much of the basis for the ‘Ahead of the Arc’ report \(\[D\]; \[3.5\]\). This report was produced for and endorsed by the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for Disability and forms the basis of much of the subsequent prolonged collaboration between Disability@work and the APPG.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Lisa Cameron MP, Chair of the APPG for Disability, raised the ‘Ahead of the Arc’ report \[D\] in Prime Minister’s Questions in January 2017 \[5.1\], asking whether the Prime Minister would ensure that ministers engage with the report and its recommendations. The Prime Minister responded that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions would consider the recommendations \[5.1\]. Since then, Nick Bacon and colleagues have held over 80 meetings across Westminster and Whitehall with politicians \(including with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions\), senior civil servants \(e.g. Head of Policy for Work and Pensions and Chief Executive of Infrastructure and Major Projects\) and government officials \(e.g. the Prime Minister’s Special Advisor for Disability\) to seek the implementation of the recommendations in ‘Ahead of the Arc’ \[D\] and their wider research \[A\-C, E\]. The result of this engagement drive had substantial policy and practical impacts: 

 **Achieved the inclusion of apprenticeship targets in the Industrial Strategy White Paper 2017**. Bacon and colleagues brought evidence in ‘Ahead of the Arc’ \[D\] regarding the under\-representation of disabled people in apprenticeships to the attention of the BEIS industrial Strategy team. \[text removed for publication\] \[5.2\]. This led to the introduction of apprenticeship targets for disabled people \(to increase the proportion of apprenticeships going to disabled people by 20% by 2020\) in the Industrial Strategy White Paper 2017 \[5.3\]. Disability Rights UK note: *“I doubt very much that the white paper would have included a commitment to increase the proportion of apprenticeships started by disabled people in the absence of our \[Bacon and colleagues’\] representations to the BEIS Industrial Strategy team*” \[5.4\]. The House of Commons recognised “the invaluable contribution” of Bacon and colleagues’ research in “ensuring the inclusion of disabled people’s employment in the Industrial Strategy” \[5.5\]. 

 **Prompted the review and reform of Disability Confident** This is the government’s flagship scheme to encourage employers to recruit and retain more disabled people and adopt disability equality practices to achieve this. Disability Rights UK explain Bacon and colleagues’ research \[B, D\] has established “ *the view across government that Disability Confident is not fit for purpose and requires revision*” \[d\]. In November 2019, the government announced Disability Confident would be reformed to require Disability Confident level 3 employers to employ at least one disabled individual, and to report on their disability employment using the government’s framework for Voluntary Reporting on Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing. The Prime Minister’s special advisor for disability and DWP’s Head of Employer Engagement have both stated \(in conversation with Bacon and colleagues\) this was in part due to the concerns raised by their research \[B, D\]. Lord Shinkwin similarly stated “ *I have no doubt that the research conducted on Disability Confident was instrumental in encouraging the government to introduce the reforms to the scheme that it announced in November 2019*” \[5.6\]. The House of Commons also recognised Bacon and colleagues’ “ *invaluable contribution … evaluating the impact and required reform of Disability Confident*” \[5.5\], and the government also acknowledged their “ *useful contribution to the debate about the future policy development of Disability Confident* “\[5.7\]. 

 **Revised disability employment targets for government and the Conservative Party 2017 and 2019 manifestos**: Only approximately 50% of disabled people are in work in the UK in comparison with 80% of non\-disabled people. In response to Bacon and colleagues’ research showing it would take until 2065 to halve this disability employment gap \[D\], the Minister for Disabled People in late 2016 distanced the government from its 2015 manifesto commitment to halve the gap by 2020, and in 2017 the government changed its manifesto commitment to a target of getting 1 million more disabled people into employment by 2027. In meetings with senior civil servants, Bacon and colleagues argued successfully that this is a less ambitious target, given increases in the number of people in employment coupled with rising levels of recorded disability prevalence meant the government would likely meet its 1 million target without substantively reducing the disability employment gap. Supporting this, Lisa Cameron MP highlights Bacon and colleagues’ success in securing “ *acceptance of the weaknesses of the government’s current commitment on disability employment which aims to get 1 million more disabled people into work by 2027*” \[5.8\]. The 2019 Conservative election manifesto subsequently acknowledged this argument by reinstating a commitment to reduce the disability employment gap, rather than just to increase the number of disabled people in employment. The government has since confirmed it will explore “ *the case for a target as part of our work on the new National Disability Strategy which we have committed to publish by the end of 2020*” \[5.3\]. A House of Commons motion in 2019 commended the impact of Bacon and colleague’s “ *critical reflection on,and evaluation of, government disability employment commitments*” \[5.5\]. 

 **Successfully led to the revision of the Public Services \(Social Value\) Act 2012** The government has consulted on reforming the Public Services \(Social Value\) Act 2012 to require all public sector commissioning to factor in economic, social and environmental well\-being in allocating £284 billion of public contracts. Bacon and colleagues’ research \[B, D\] on organisational reporting of disability employment, and the ineffectiveness of Disability Confident, was presented in meetings at the Cabinet Office \(including with the government’s Chief Commercial Officer\). As a result, the initial proposal to include Disability Confident as the main disability employment measure in the revised social value delivery model was replaced by a measure of workforce disability prevalence. As Lisa Cameron MP states, Bacon and colleagues ensured “ *the inclusion of the employment of disabled people \(and the exclusion of Disability Confident\) within the Cabinet Office’s definition of Social Value in procurement*” \[5.8\]. The House of Commons recognises the “ *invaluable contribution” of Bacon and colleagues’ research*” on the potential for public sector procurement to improve disabled people’s employment outcomes” \[5.5\]. 

 **Reconvened the Voluntary Reporting Framework for Employers and increased pressure for mandatory reporting.** The government’s framework for Voluntary Reporting on Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing 2018 encourages employers to report the proportion of disabled people in their workforce and the disability employment practices adopted to support them. In line with research in \[D\] concerning the need for accurate employer reporting and measurement of disability employment, Bacon and colleagues have successfully persuaded the DWP that the framework \(particularly the question employers are recommended to use to measure disability prevalence; the method by which employers are required to collect data; and the lack of a requirement for employers engaging with the framework to report the number of disabled people they employ\) requires revision, and they have convinced the DWP to reconvene the Voluntary Reporting Framework Working Group to “ *look at the case for alignment with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010*” \[5.7\] on the basis that \[text removed for publication\] \[5.9\]. Bacon and colleagues have been invited to join the group and nominate others. 

 Bacon and colleagues have also helped build consensus for their recommendation based on research in \[D\] for disability employment reporting to be placed on a mandatory footing, in order to encourage increased employer adoption of the disability equality practices identified as important in improving workplace\-level outcomes for disabled people \[A\]. They have assisted Lord Shinkwin in writing a Workforce Information Bill \[HL Bill 82\] introduced in the House of Lords to extend gender pay gap reporting provisions to disability and require employers to report the disability prevalence in their workforce \[f\]. In addition, Bacon conceived and played a pivotal role in organising an APPG for Disability event in February 2020 on mandatory reporting at which Parliamentarians \(including Sir Iain Duncan Smith\) and the Cabinet Office, DWP, Government Equalities Office, Business Disability Forum, CIPD, ONS and TUC were present. The meeting demonstrated for the first time the widespread consensus for the introduction of mandatory reporting. Lord Shinkwin, vice\-Chair of the APPG, said the meeting provided “ *the APPG and myself a solid platform from which to press our case with Ministers. This is an important and substantial step forward, and if we finally see the extension of mandatory pay gap reporting, this meeting will have been a landmark moment in bringing it about. I would like to thank Professor Bacon for the central role he played in organising the meeting…*” \[5.6\]. Via their research on unions and disability \[C\], Bacon and colleagues have facilitated support from the TUC’s disability policy lead for Lord Shinkwin’s Bill, with Lord Shinkwin commenting Disability@work has facilitated dialogue between myself and the Trades Union Congress’s disability policy lead, to further establish a shared agenda on mandatory disability employment and pay gap reporting. This seeks to incorporate the valuable role of unions in supporting disabled people in the workplace identified in the research conducted by Disability@work. \[5.6\] 

 **Impacted on the government’s response to COVID\-19.** Bacon and colleagues’ research on the effects of the economic cycle on disabled people \[E\] has significantly influenced the APPG for Disability’s approach to protecting disabled people in the pandemic\-induced economic downturn. A Disability@work briefing paper authored by Bacon and colleagues based on \[3.6\] has been officially endorsed by the APPG for Disability and forwarded to the Minister for Disabled People. The APPG awaits a response to the brief from the government. Bacon and colleagues have presented the research \[E\] and policy proposals \[3.6\] to the Cabinet Office’s Disability Unit, trade union national equality officers at the TUC and the Prime Minister’s special adviser for disability. 

 Summarising the above, Disability Rights UK describe Bacon and colleagues as “ *key influencers*”, whose research \[A\-E\] has resulted in “far greater policy focus within government on disabled people, and greater awareness across government, Parliamentarians, and senior civil servants of the scale of the disadvantage disabled people suffer, the limitations of existing government policy, and the potential policy levers needed to address this disadvantage.” \[5.4\]. 

 Similarly, Lisa Cameron MP \(Chair of the APPG for Disability\) commented on the research \[A\-E\] and highlights Bacon and colleagues’ success in helping “ *shift the narrative within government circles and with key government officials away from viewing disabled people as passive benefit recipients towards viewing them as an important resource within the economy that has the potential to make a significant contribution to productivity and economic growth*”. She added that the APPG’s collaboration with Bacon and colleagues has “ *massively enhanced the influence of the APPG and, in doing so, has pushed issues relating to disability inequality in the labour market far higher up the political agenda in the UK than otherwise have been the case … In my opinion, the quality of the research … has had a profound impact on the political agenda*”. \[5.8\] 

 Confirming this, Lord Shinkwin stated “ *The insights from the group’s research have proved highly valuable in engendering positive change to government policy. In supporting disabled people to gain work and achieve financial independence, Disability@work will have had a significant and lasting impact on the wellbeing and social inclusion of disabled people in the UK*”. \[5.6\]

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Healthcare technologies developed in Liverpool and incorporated into commercially\-available instruments have made an impact on the diagnosis and treatment of two vision threatening conditions, glaucoma and keratoconus. Innovative research on ocular deformation under an air jet has allowed simultaneous characterisation of eye pressure and corneal biomechanical behaviour, in two novel biomechanical parameters: biomechanically corrected intraocular pressure \(bIOP\) and stress\-strain index \(SSI\) for the material of the cornea. The accurate determination of bIOP and SSI is now possible using the non\-contact instrument, CorVis ST produced by Oculus and sold worldwide since 2016.  The sensitivity of the instrument supports early detection while its accuracy improves the quality of diagnoses. The technology is benefitting hundreds of thousands of patients per year including 30,000 in China alone. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

###  2.1 Background and context 

 The research at the University of Liverpool addressed two long\-standing problems with significant ocular health implications, namely the measurement of the eye’s internal pressure and the estimation of the cornea’s biomechanical behaviour. The inability to measure eye pressure accurately resulted in poor outcomes of glaucoma management, a prevalent, severe and asymptomatic disease, where eye pressure is the main modifiable risk factor. Ineffective management meant that 15% of glaucoma patients lose their eyesight despite treatment. The further inability to estimate the cornea’s biomechanical behaviour, made it difficult to diagnose keratoconus \(a genetic disease, causing loss of corneal stiffness and progressive ocular distortion\) at an early stage, before serious loss of clear sight takes place. 

 Collaboration with Oculus Optikgeraete GmbH started in 2013 to address these two needs. The development in Liverpool of two new biomechanical parameters, namely biomechanically corrected intraocular pressure \(bIOP\) and corneal material stiffness estimates using a Stress\-Strain Index \(SSI\), presented the opportunity to use non\-contact technology to produce a more accurate and sensitive instrument and therefore to turn the CorVis ST into a powerful diagnostic and management tool for serious vision\-threatening conditions. 

###  2.2 Underpinning research 

 The research was led by Professor Ahmed Elsheikh, and carried out by Liverpool’s Biomechanical Engineering Group, from 2010, and benefitted from funding by the National Institute of Health Research, the EPSRC and, from 2013, Oculus. It was based on a combination of representative numerical simulations, experimental validation \(using ex\-vivo human donor eyes\) and clinical validation. The main outcomes were innovative methods that use the profile of ocular deformation under the action of an external air jet to produce estimations of both eye pressure \[3.1, 3.2\] and corneal biomechanical behaviour \[3.3\]. The methods developed in Liverpool were validated comprehensively by a group of clinicians from the USA, Italy, Brazil, South Korea and China \(in 2015\-2016\), and later implemented in the CorVis ST operating software in August 2016 by Oculus, Figure 1 \[3.3 – 3.5\]. 



 Figure 1 A CorVis ST instrument \(left\) sold worldwide by Oculus and a typical set of results from the instrument \(right\) showing non\-contact estimations of biomechanically\-corrected IntraOcular Pressure \(bIOP\) and a Stress\-Strain Index \(SSI\) describing the material behaviour of the cornea 

 The success of these methods allowed the Liverpool group in 2017, with collaborators in Brazil, Italy and the USA, to develop, using statistical analyses, two new clinical parameters \(Corneal Biomechanical Index, CBI \[3.4\], and Topography\-Biomechanics Index, TBI \[3.5, 3.6\]\) for detection and risk profiling of keratoconus in its early stages. With these parameters, it has been possible to detect and treat the disease \(by cross\-linking the cornea\) to prevent its progression and most subsequent corneal distortion and loss of clear vision.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The new technologies developed in Liverpool and incorporated into the CorVis ST non\-contact tonometer have made impact on the diagnosis and treatment of two vision\-threatening conditions; glaucoma and keratoconus. 

###  Greater accuracy of glaucoma treatment 

 Glaucoma affects 79m people worldwide \(480,000 in England\) and if not treated, can lead to irreversible blindness. The disease is associated with elevated intraocular pressure \(IOP\), causing pressure on the optic nerve head and damaging the nerves linking the light\-sensitive cells of the retina to the brain. The main modifiable risk factor for glaucoma is IOP and therefore the accurate measurement of IOP is essential for adequate treatment of the disease. Until recently, all IOP measurement techniques were influenced by the stiffness of the cornea, and the resulting inaccuracies have led to both false negatives and false positives in glaucoma risk profiling. Poor measurement has also meant that 15% of glaucoma patients eventually lose their eyesight within 15 years whilst under treatment. The new bIOP measurement developed in Liverpool \[3.2\] became available with the CorVis ST produced by Oculus in 2016 and is being used in clinical centres in many countries including Brazil, China, Germany, Iran, Italy and South Korea. Follow\-up studies have confirmed the stability and repeatability of the bIOP readings and encouraged more clinicians to rely on them in glaucoma management instead of the reference standard – the Goldmann Applanation Tonometer \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

###  Earlier diagnosis of keratoconus 

 Keratoconus is a genetic disease associated with deterioration of corneal stiffness. It affects more than 1% of the population – mainly adults within the 18\-25 age group, and therefore has serious long\-term effects on their quality of life. The disease is known to start with tissue softening long before corneal distortion takes place, and if it was to be diagnosed during this period, the cornea can be stiffened artificially \(through various cross\-linking techniques\) to prevent distortion and loss of clear vision. The new biomechanical parameter, the stress\-strain index \(SSI\) was developed in Liverpool specifically for the diagnosis and treatment of keratoconus and incorporated into the CorVis ST instrument sold world\-wide by Oculus. It has been validated in several large multi\-centre studies, where the high accuracy of the parameters to identify eyes with keratoconus \(in clinical and sub\-clinical stages\) was proven in 98% of cases \[5.3 – 5.5\]. Through availability in the CorVis software, several clinical centres \(including centres in Brazil, India, Italy, China and Germany\) have been using these parameters to diagnose sub\-clinical keratoconus and in taking decisions on when to intervene with a cross\-linking treatment. 

###  Clinical impact 

 With the new methods from Liverpool incorporated in the operating software of the CorVis ST from August 2016, clinical application of the methods is widespread, benefiting “ *hundreds of thousands of patients per year globally, including approximately 30,000 in China alone*” \[5.6\]. The subsequent growth in clinical publications on the effectiveness of the methods \(from 3 in 2013, to 40 in 2017, and 70 in 2019 on PubMed\) indicates an increase in implementation in clinical practice. The parallel growth in the use of the CorVis ST, especially in China and the EU, as confirmed by senior clinicians in major hospitals in Wenzhou and Milan, presents further evidence of the increase in implementation. 

 A senior consultant at Wenzhou Eye Hospital noted \[5.7\]: 

 “*we have used the biomechanically\-corrected intraocular pressure* \( *bIOP\) measurements provided by the CorVis ST and found it to be the least affected estimates of IOP \(among outputs of all tonometry devices\) by refractive surgeries, and as a result CorVis became a successful tonometer with clinical centres in China using it in glaucoma management. The Stress\-Strain Index \(SSI\) was also less influenced by the central corneal thickness \(CCT\) and IOP, and provides much needed information on corneal stiffness that can help following up progression of keratoconus and could enable optimisation of CXL \(Collagen Cross Linking\) in the future*.” 

 While, a senior consultant in Milan’s Humanitas San PioX Hospital wrote \[5.8\]: 

 “*bIOP has dramatically improved the management of my glaucoma patients*” and “ *SSI can surely improve our understanding of normal corneas and diseased ones such as keratoconus which have a decrease in corneal stiffness; hence can be very useful in customizing treatments*”. 

 Further, in India where the new technologies are being increasingly used, a senior consultant at Sankara Nethralaya Hospital \(with 1500 patients per day\), commented \[5.9\]: 

 “*A clinical study done in our centre confirmed that bIOP did not correlate with corneal thickness, making it a reliable measure of IOP, suitable for all eyes irrespective of corneal geometry*.” And *SSI was “… a reliable indicator of corneal stiffness.”* She added *:” We have found numerous clinical applications of the SSI: early detection of keratoconus, assessment of success of collagen crosslinking in arresting the progression of keratoconus, monitoring patients after refractive surgery to detect any biomechanical destabilization*.”

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Gavin Davidson has collaborated with a number of colleagues to develop a body of research on the effective facilitation of supported decision making. Davidson et al.’s research played a key role in informing the development of the Mental Capacity Act \(Northern Ireland\) 2016, a world\-leading piece of legislation which, for the first time, combined both mental health and mental capacity provisions into a single legislative act. The research also provided significant data which assisted the Northern Ireland Department of Health in developing its plans for implementation of the legislation, including workforce planning and the production of a code of practice. Finally, the research played a central role in developing the knowledge, awareness and understanding of a significant proportion of the health and social care workforce in Northern Ireland with regard to the implementation of the legislation. The beneficiaries of the Act are the estimated 120,000 people in Northern Ireland who have impaired decision\-making ability and so, ultimately, the research has contributed to a significant positive impact on this group of people. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2012, Davidson led a research team which carried out a comprehensive review of the international literature on the development and effectiveness of supported decision making \(Ref 1\). His colleagues, Professor Berni Kelly \(Queen’s University Belfast\) and Professor Geraldine Macdonald \(then Queen’s University Belfast\), were part of this team. Supported decision making refers to approaches to support people whose decision\-making ability is impaired to make their own decisions. This review included an analysis of the available international evidence on and approaches to supported decision making. Davidson et al. concluded that it was very difficult to ensure that supported decision making was effectively facilitated in all settings without a clear statutory requirement to this effect. This review of the evidence was the first time that international research findings had been analysed to inform the legislative framework in Northern Ireland. 

 Subsequently, in 2013 Davidson teamed up with collaborators at universities in Ireland, Australia and Canada to carry out an international comparison of legal frameworks facilitating supported decision making \(Ref 2\). This study, which was also led by Davidson, compared developments in four jurisdictions: Ontario, Canada; Victoria, Australia; England and Wales; and Northern Ireland. This comparative analysis, covering both mental health and mental capacity law, had not been completed before and provided further direction for how a new approach could work in Northern Ireland. 

 Reference 3 was co\-authored with Dr Colin Harper, an Honorary Lecturer at Queen’s and also with Professor Roy McClelland, an Emeritus Professor at Queen’s. Professor McClleland was the former Chair of the Bamford Review which had recommended this new approach. The article comprised an overview and analysis of the new Act which identified the potential effects of the Act and some of the key issues to be considered for implementation. A central aspect of the information needed for implementation was the estimated prevalence of impaired decision making in Northern Ireland across causes of impairment which included: physical health; dementia; mental health; intellectual disabilities and brain injury. 

 In 2015, Davidson was commissioned by the Law Centre NI, to complete a report \(Ref 4\) to help identify the scope of the new legal framework in Northern Ireland. The study drew on the available research on impaired decision\-making across causes and settings to develop estimates on the scale of the population likely to benefit from the legislation. The study found that an estimated 120,000 people in Northern Ireland had some level of impairment and so would come under the scope of the Act. It also concluded that those receiving inpatient treatment for their physical health and who lacked the relevant capacity were the largest single group \(61,000/120,000\). 

 In 2017\-18 Davidson also led the Queen’s contribution to an inter\-agency qualitative research project on supported decision making in Northern Ireland. This study was funded by Disability Research for Independent Living and Learning, a UK\-wide programme supported by the Big Lottery. This project used a co\-production methodology to explore people with mental health problems and/or intellectual disabilities' experiences of decision making and needs for support \(Ref 5\). Davidson and his QUB colleagues, Dr Aisling McLaughlin and Dr Lorna Montgomery, were involved in all aspects of this project. Shea Irvine contributed to the literature review and Kelly contributed to the design and participatory approach. The findings reinforced the potential benefits of supported decision making and highlighted the central importance of time in these processes. 

 The Northern Ireland Department of Health’s Offiice of Social Services also commissioned Davidson and his Queen’s University colleague, Dr Claire McCartan, to conduct further research to inform workforce planning which was completed in June 2020 \(Ref 6\). This built on previous research on the operation of the Mental Health \(Northern Ireland\) Order 1986 and work on the prevalence of impaired decision making, to enable estimates of the additional staff needed to fully implement the Act.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Informing the development of the Act** 

 The Mental Capacity Act \(Northern Ireland\) 2016 has been described by the Northern Ireland Department of Health as “… a ground\-breaking piece of legislation that, when fully commenced, will fuse together mental capacity and mental health law for those aged 16 years old and over within a single piece of legislation …” \(A\). The Head of the Department’s Mental Health and Mental Capacity Unit has described it as “…a world first fusing mental health and mental capacity legislation into one” and as “…an innovative and progressive approach which promotes the rights and autonomy of everyone in Northern Ireland whose decision making ability may be impaired.” \(B\) 

 Davidson drew on his international research on supported decision\-making to contribute to the development of this unique Act in two ways. Firstly, Davidson sat, as the professional representative for social work, on a Reference Group which was convened by the Department to inform the development of the legislation. Davidson was originally appointed to this Group in 2009, due to his relevant experience, expertise and research \(B, D\). This Group held 16 meetings up to June 2015 when the Mental Capacity Bill was tabled in the Northern Ireland Assembly \(C\). 

 A pivotal aspect of this process was when the Northern Ireland Departments of Health and Justice were considering the specific content of the draft legislation in 2014 and 2015; Davidson was one of three members of the Reference Group who were asked to attend a series of meetings with the Departments involved \(B\). The Group’s Chair, who is also Director of Law Centre NI, confirms Davidson’s contribution to the work of the Group: 

 Gavin was fully involved in all the discussions of the Reference Group and was able to draw extensively on his research, especially on legal frameworks in other jurisdictions, to inform the deliberations of the work of the Reference Group and the process. \(D\). 

 Secondly, from 2009 to 2015, Davidson was a key contributor to the Northern Ireland Mental Health and Learning Disability Alliance \(D\). This group was an alliance of health professionals, users of services and not for profit organisations which was led by Law Centre NI and which worked alongside the Reference Group to contribute ideas for progressive legislative development. His contribution to this parallel process is described thus by the Law Centre’s Director: 

 Gavin generously shared and drew on his research to inform a number of critical Chatham House Roundtables with key decision makers during the law reform process … \(D\). 

 In short, Law Centre NI’s Director believes that, through both these avenues, “Gavin’s research work and academic expertise made an important contribution to the development of this new legislative framework…” \(D\). 

 **Informing the implementation of the Act** 

 The Department’s Reference Group has also played a major role in advising on the implementation of the Act. The Head of the Department’s Mental Health and Mental Capacity Unit states: 

 As part of that \[Reference Group\] process he \[Davidson\] was able to present findings from his research about the operation of mental health law in Northern Ireland, his analysis of legal frameworks in other jurisdictions and research on supported decision making to directly inform implementation of the new Act. \(B\) 

 In particular, Davidson was appointed to a small group of relevant individuals who were commissioned by the Department of Health in April 2019 to develop key training resources to enable all health and social care staff in Northern Ireland to fully implement the Act \(B, E\). Davidson was asked to be part of this group specifically because of his research in the area of mental health and mental capacity law \(E\). He was directly involved in drafting the training resources and in training the trainers who delivered the resources. He also worked with the co\-lead, and with QUB colleagues who specialise respectively in drama and in medical education, to develop a series of video case studies and other resources to support implementation. His research on mental health and mental capacity law was “… used and referred to in the development of the training resources, and helped to provide both international and Northern Ireland evidence to support implementation.” \(E\) 

 Through its central contribution to the development of the training resources, the research has had a considerable beneficial impact on the knowledge and understanding of a substantial proportion of the health and social care workforce in Northern Ireland. Up to January 2020, just over a quarter \(15,939 \- 26%\) of all health and social care staff in Northern Ireland had taken part in the face\-to\-face version of the training programme \(F\). A robust evaluation process was put in place to monitor the impact of the face\-to face training. 81% of participants took part in an evaluation survey. Of these, nearly all \(96%\) indicated that the stated learning outcomes were met \(F\). These included the understanding of a number of key concepts including specifically to “Understand and apply the key principle of supporting individuals to make a decision” which was directly informed by the research. 91% of respondents rated the training programmes as good, very good or excellent \(F\). Moreover, the online version of the training resources had been accessed 54,000 times by January 2020 \(E\). 

 More recently, in March 2020, Davidson was commissioned by the Department of Health’s Office of Social Services to develop and deliver training on the temporary modifications to the Mental Capacity Act made by the UK Government’s Coronavirus Act 2020. This training, which has been delivered to all relevant social work staff across Northern Ireland, has drawn on Davidson’s research. \(G\) 

 The research also played a key role, in the lead\-up to the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act in 2019, in helping the Department of Health to secure the funding needed to properly implement the Act and to help plan that process \(D\). This occurred through the use that the Department made of Davidson’s research \(Ref 4\) on the prevalence of impaired decision\-making in Northern Ireland and on the the implications of implementing the Act \(D, G\). 

 As mentioned previously, Davidson was also commissioned by the Office of Social Services to undertake research estimating the number of social workers who would be needed to fully implement the Act. This research, which was completed in June 2020, was used by the Office to inform its workforce planning for the implementation of the Act \(G\). 

 **Impact of the Act outside Northern Ireland** 

 Northern Ireland’s Mental Capacity Act has attracted much attention from policymakers and relevant professionals around the world. In England, the most recent review of mental health law, in 2018, identified the impact of the Mental Capacity Act in Northern Ireland as one of the key developments to inform future reform in England. It has also been formally considered as part of current process of mental health law reform in Scotland, and Davidson was invited to provide evidence to the Scottish Review process. Internationally it is also being considered in the Australian State of Victoria, and in other jurisdictions across the world \(H\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Critical Autism and Disability Research Group, led by Professor Martin, works with autistic scholars on developing research\-informed, inclusive practice across the age range in education and academia. The research has yielded beneficial changes, including: improving teaching practice and staff training for working with autistic students; developing the Sensory Schools concept; founding the Participatory Autism Research Collective; creating guidance for the COVID\-19 lock\-downs on *Learning from Home* for parents of autistic children; *Studying Remotely* for autistic university students; and, contributing to the establishment and work of the Westminster Commission on Autism. Key impacts include: 

-  Creating with the National Association for Disability Practitioners \(NADP\) a nationally accredited CPD course on working effectively with autistic university students and delivering four courses for NADP to 190 UK university disability practitioners. 

-  Involving five schools in the Sensory Schools Project \(2016\-18\) with c.1860 pupils in any year, supported by c.60 members of staff, all of whom have benefitted: staff have improved their understanding of “ *the way autistic pupils may experience the sensory environment*”, with autistic pupils appearing more motivated and eager to take part in classroom sessions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Original research conducted by academic staff in the Critical Autism and Disability Research Group at London South Bank University \(LSBU\) since September 2013 has considered how educational practice can be transformed through new, autistic people\-informed understandings of autism as a different way of thinking. It includes: 1\) an analysis of the sensory experience of pupils in the school environment **\[R1\]**; 2\) a two\-year study which developed, trialled and evaluated a mentoring scheme co\-created with autistic people, families and supporters **\[R2\]**; and, 3\) a body of work on autistic scholarship and the barriers and enablers to participation in higher education and academia of autistic students and scholars **\[R3 to R6\]**. 

 **A. An analysis of the sensory experience of pupils in the school environment** 

 A longitudinal study from Ulster University looking at annual school census data, identified an increase in prevalence rates of autistic pupils from 2010\-2019 in the UK. The sensory environment of the school can overwhelm autistic pupils, causing reactions such as becoming withdrawn \(shut down\), or agitated \(meltdown\). 

 In 2016, representatives of special and mainstream schools in Merton and Sutton and researchers \(including an autistic researcher\) led by Professor Martin formed a collaborative community of practice to: 1\) understand and improve the sensory school environment for autistic pupils; and, 2\) incorporate the findings into school improvement planning **\[R1, G3\]**. The collaborators met regularly over 18 months to iterate a process aiming to improve the sensory environment of the schools. Sensory audits were conducted in five schools, along with pupil observations, parent meetings with researchers and two conferences to share findings. The project enhanced understanding of the impact of the physical and visual design of the classroom on sensory distress. It also reframed the idea of ‘challenging behaviour’, leading to a new emphasis on minimising ‘indicators of distress’. Outcomes focussed on creating calm and predictability. Practical outcomes included: utilising pupil special interests positively; removing ambiguity from the lunch menu; developing visual timetables; facilitating quiet playtimes; avoiding over busy displays; and parents talking to an autistic adult about their experiences. 

 **B. The Cygnet Mentoring Project** 

 The number of Autistic Students in UK Higher Education almost doubled between 2014/15 and 2018/19, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Autistic students report significant challenges and higher rates of mental health difficulties than non\-autistic students. Evidence\-based, autism\-informed specialist mentoring schemes for autistic people are rare, with few subjected to stringent evaluation. 

 The Cygnet Mentoring Project \(2014\-16\) **\[R2, G1\]** developed, trialled and evaluated a mentoring scheme co\-created with autistic people that involved matched pairs \(mentor/mentee\) meeting every week for one hour for a six\-month period. This was based on the Reliable Empathic Anticipatory and Logical \(REAL\) Model for service delivery, developed over several years. *Reliability* is required for effective services, so students trust in the level and consistency of support offered to them. *Empathy* requires peers and staff to try to embrace the worldview of autistic individuals. *Anticipatory* relates to an awareness of the diverse needs of the students and plan ahead to mitigate distress or anxiety. *Logical* refers to practice that is clear and has tangible expectations. Autistic and non\-autistic mentors received autistic\-led training informed by Personal Construct Theory, which privileges the worldview of the mentee and allows them to take control of their goals. Findings highlighted benefits of time\-limited, goal\-orientated mentoring with trained, formally supervised mentors. Autistic participants said their mentoring experience enabled them to progress towards self\-identified goals and reported feeling empowered by the person\-centred ethos and participatory methods designed into the project. 

 **C. Analysis of a longitudinal look at the university experience of autistic students** 

 University can be a challenging social environment for autistic students. As aspect of an ongoing longitudinal project started in 2009, drew on the perspectives of autistic Cambridge University students participating in a social group **\[R3\]**. Students set the direction of activities, choosing to focus, for example, on addressing their challenges with organisation and prioritising, making sense of non\-autistic people, and organising social activities relevant to their in depth interests. Challenges with social interactions could be exacerbated by anxiety\-provoking, unclear communication of expectations and recall of prior similar negative experiences. Deviating unexpectedly from reliable, empathic, anticipatory and logical \(REAL\) arrangements is also likely to cause social stress. Feedback from participants included: *‘I often need to take time to calm myself so tasks can take longer.’ ‘having to cope on your own with everyday tasks e.g. eating, travelling etc.’* 

 **D. Autistic scholarship and the barriers to participation of autistic scholars in academia** 

 Even Autistic scholars with doctorates, peer\-reviewed publications and research skills report difficulties in securing and maintaining UK University employment. A long\-standing body of work by Professor Martin has identified key themes within autistic scholarship and barriers to participation of autistic scholars in academia. A thematic analysis of first\-hand testimony from autistic doctoral students and academics revealed overarching themes **\[R4\]**, which point to obstacles to securing employment in higher education at every stage, from financing doctoral study, to recruitment practices, to navigating bureaucracy. Structures that are notionally designed to help can appear somewhat impenetrable. Attitudinal barriers compound practical difficulties, whereas supportive cultures and practices reduce obstacles. Raising the profile of autistic scholarship has been a catalyst for developing autistic\-led networks such as the Participatory Autism Research Collective \(PARC\). 

 As part of research funded by the Leadership Foundation in Higher Education **\[R5, G2\]**, with networks and organisations aimed at higher education staff, including the Equality Challenge Unit \(ECU\), National Association for Disability Practitioners \(NADP\), the Disability Equality Research Network \(DERN\) and National Association of Disabled Staff Networks \(NADSN\), focus groups, interviews and anonymous questionnaires reached around 100 disabled leaders, who responded to open\-ended questions on topics such as: impairment effects; societal barriers, values, influences, strengths, leadership style; strategies, resources and advice. Key emerging themes were: discriminatory recruitment and progression practices, ableist attitudes and assumptions, disconnected infrastructure, insufficient administrative support and an absence of role models. Participants valued supportive colleagues and expressed uncertainty about the portability of effective, hard\-won support, which limited their career progression. 

 Reflecting on autistic scholarship, an overarching review **\[R6\]** looked at barriers and enablers to participation in academia and identified the importance of grass\-roots networks such as the National Association for Disability Practitioners \(NADP\) and PARC, which have proven their worth as vehicles to promote the inclusion and contribution of autistic scholars in academia.

###  4. Details of the impact \[indicative maximum 750 words\] 

 The impact of this research since 2014 has been realised through working with NADP, the Department for Education \(DfE\), PARC, local authorities and other stakeholders such as Universities, Schools and practitioners involved in autism education. As evidenced below, the impacts include improving: understanding of autism; knowledge and confidence in working with autistic pupils and students; teaching practice, with benefits extending beyond autistic learners. 

 **A. Development of Resources and Training in Higher Education \[HE\]** 

 Dealing with sensory overload, social challenges and adapting to leaving home can become overwhelming for autistic students without adequate support so all university staff need to understand the challenges autistic students face and how to support them through their degrees. The *Cygnet* Mentoring Project provided the evidence base for a new nationally accredited CPD course: ‘ *Working Effectively with Autistic University Students’*. Professor Martin both produced the content for the course and delivered it in partnership with NADP \(the professional association for staff working with disabled university and college students\). NADP has around 1500 members, in various professional services, academic and research roles across the UK and internationally. NADP first encountered the Cygnet project through journal articles and presentations by Professor Martin at their annual Conferences **\[S1\]**. 

 The Department of Education \(DfE\) regularly consider the most appropriate training for staff supporting Autistic students and judged the Cygnet training to be a tangible example of research\-informed and evidence\-based practice. The training is accredited by the CPD Standards office. Thus, the DfE accepted this course as part of the registration process for both Specialist one\-to\-one Study Skills and Strategy Support \(Autism\) and Specialist Autism Mentors **\[S1\-S2\]**. Each mentor taking the Cygnet training will support multiple autistic mentees. Professor Martin has delivered four courses for NADP since 2019 to 190 UK university disability practitioners **\[S1\],** including Specific Learning Difficulty \(SpLD\) Tutors, Study Needs Assessors and Disability Advisors **\[S2\]**. 100\+ further delegates have signed up for courses in 2021 **\[S1\]**. Feedback highlights how the training has improved knowledge and understanding: “ *A very interactive and engaging workshop that helped me to understand the complexities of autism and how to assist students with SpLDs in Higher Education \(HE\)*” **\[S2\]**. A SpLD Tutor noted: “ *Yes – already used in meeting with ASC/dyslexic student – allowed me to understand and empathise with his issues about time management \(impact of irregular sleep patterns and difficulty with transitioning between sleep/wakefulness\)*” **\[S3\]**. Learning from the training has been implemented to support Autistic Students. A UK Higher Education Institution that hosted one of the sessions in October 2019, which made significant recourse to the REAL framework, noted: “ *The training was timely and invaluable as our service has seen a rise in the number of autistic students accessing SpLD tuition and mentoring. Two practical aspects which we took away were: 1. The use of the REAL framework to help identify best practice in 1\-1 sessions, and the experience of the Cambridge project which helped inform our understanding and build confidence to launch an online support group for autistic students. In the first term of the 2020/2021 year, the mentor/disability team trialled this remote group for autistic students. Those who developed the workshop fed back that the REAL model was helpful.”* **\[S3\].** 

 **B. Development of Resources and Training for Teachers** 

 Understanding autistic sensory challenges is essential in order to support learners. Labelling a behaviour as challenging without getting to the route cause can lead to unhelpful practices **\[S4\]**. Together, the five schools involved in the Sensory Schools Project \(2017\-18\) have c.1,860 pupils in any year, supported by c.60 members of staff, who have benefited from this project. It has improved staff understanding of “ *the way autistic pupils may experience the sensory environment*” **\[S4\]**. Helping staff to develop a greater awareness of why autistic pupils might be doing certain things is useful because any sort of “ *intervention, without understanding, is likely to be ineffective.*” Following the completion of the project, “ *The team produced a resource file for school to use, which was in the form of a coffee table book as well as an electronic resource. This was extremely useful…..It is used as part of staff induction, as well as for staff to dip into when they feel the need for further guidance*.” **\[S4\]** 

 For parents, the project improved understanding and knowledge on how to practically address concerns with their autistic children: “ *The feedback received from mums and dads was overwhelmingly positive, many commenting that they had not actually spoken to an autistic, articulate, well\-informed adult before. The insights arising from such an insider perspective were felt to be extremely useful and illuminating by parents who also commented that they felt able to ask all sorts of questions and receive very honest answers*.” **\[S4\]** 

 There have also been direct impacts for the pupils at the Schools. For example, the practical introduction of “ *brain breaks*” at one special School was reported to have “ *improved the teacher–pupil relationship, where they can take part in “fun” exercise together, and observed that children appeared more motivated and eager to take part in classroom sessions, knowing that there would be a movement break at the end.*” **\[S4\]** 

 **C. Development of Resources to Support Remote Learning During COVID\-19** 

 The COVID\-19 crisis, and the sudden requirement for remote learning, has been challenging for autistic learners, educators and families. “ *Parents struggled to provide professional support that is normally provided in a school/college setting. Autistic children were gripped with fear for a longer period because they could not properly understand the concept of the coronavirus: some parents reported their children were constantly anxious and having behaviour issues because of the shock of the March lockdown. Many parents struggled with lack of resources to support their children at home.*” **\[S8\]**. 

 Using knowledge gained from a body of autism research **\[R1\-R3\]**, Professor Martin led on developing two sets of guidance. One was as part of an on\-going collaboration with Surrey County Council to create an Autism\-friendly authority **\[G4\]**, Professor Martin and collaborators developed some guidance for parents to on ‘ *Learning from Home’* during COVID\-19 **\[S5, S6\]**. In April 2020, the guidance was shared by Surrey County Council. This has been positively received, for example from a Steering Committee of parent volunteers in Surrey, *“They thought it was ‘brilliant’ and immediately issued it via their connections & newsletter….Many parents were feeling conflicted between knowing what their child and they themselves were capable of doing and external pressures, as they perceived them. Having such clear, accessible and useable guidance by an expert they found so positive.”* **\[S6\]**. 

 The guidance has also been shared on the Autism Education Trust website \(a not\-for\-profit programme led by two national autism charities: the National Autistic Society and Ambitious about Autism, established and supported by the Department for Education\) **\[S7\]**. The guidance was also shared by the charity Autism Voice with over 200 people and 4 different organisations; it: “ *helped parents map a way out under incredibly challenging circumstances.*” **\[S8\]**. 

 Professor Martin also led on developing the *Studying Remotely* guidance, designed to help Autistic University Students studying from home during COVID\-19. This was published by NADP in December 2020 and included in their COVID Resource Hub. Feedback from NADP members highlighted that “ *Universities were desperate for advice to support autistic students who have struggled with mental health concerns during the lockdowns and have problems accessing webinars when lecturers use multiple formats*.” **\[S1\]**. 

 **D. Raising Awareness of the Importance of Inclusive Practice** 

 In 2015, the Westminster Commission on Autism was launched “ *in recognition of the need to do more to work in strategic partnerships to improve quality of life for autistic people*.” Professor Martin was targeted “ *because of her strong record of inclusive practice, collaboration and high\-quality research in this field*” **\[S9\]**. The Commission published two reports: *A Spectrum of Obstacles – an Inquiry into Access to Healthcare for Autistic People* \(2016\) and *A Spectrum of Harmful Interventions for Autism* \(2018\) **\[S9\]**. *A Spectrum of Obstacles* has received ministerial praise and influenced policy developments via NHS England **\[S9\]**. Professor Martin has been significantly involved with all inquiries conducted by the Commission, “ *shaping the terms of reference, emphasising and facilitating engagement with diverse communities and autistic individuals, and bringing in relevant research to inform the reports’ focus*” **\[S9\]**. 

 **E. Participatory Autism Research Collective \[PARC\]** 

 Given that autistic scholars face barriers to employment in academia **\[R4\-R6\]**, in 2015 Professor Martin co\-founded PARC with an autistic colleague, Dr Damian Milton. The aim of PARC is to facilitate collaborative, autistic\-led research and researcher development **\[R4\]**. PARC was the first autistic\-led venture of its kind in the UK and now operates through regional hubs in several UK universities and attracts international interest including visiting speakers from Australia and USA and invitations to speak in Europe and USA. Almost 500 people are engaged with PARC, who have put on over 30 inclusive events, such as training workshops and conferences, across the UK **\[S10\]**. Events provide space for autistic people to actively engage in research. PARC has helped to increase collaboration and communication between autistic people and the research community, as well as leading to publications, dissemination and sharing of research and providing peer support **\[S11\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Techniques for dating environmental records in natural archives such as lake sediments using mathematical models of the fallout radionuclide <sup>210</sup>Pb have been pioneered and refined at the Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre \(ERRC\), Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Liverpool. These techniques have become essential tools for international decision\-makers studying the effects of pollution and climate change. Recent impacts on policy, environment and commerce include: 

 Climate change mitigation strategy incorporating first\-of\-its\-kind localised carbon budget \(Canada, 2020\); 

 Government guidelines for classifying the ecological status of water bodies \(Norway, 2018\); 

 Re\-allocation of industry resources tackling oil sands pollution \(Canada, 2017\).

##  2. Underpinning research 

 The Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre \(ERRC\), led by Dr Piliposyan and Prof Appleby from the University of Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences is a world leading centre for excellence in <sup>210</sup>Pb dating. The current <sup>210</sup>Pb dating methodology is underpinned by a substantial body of ongoing mathematical research conducted by Prof Appleby and Dr Piliposyan on <sup>21</sup><sup>0</sup>Pb in the environment, and also on radiometric techniques for determining fallout **\[3.1\-6\]**. 

 <sup>210</sup>Pb is a naturally occurring fallout radionuclide created in the atmosphere by the decay of radon \(<sup>222</sup>Rn\) gas. <sup>210</sup>Pb atoms are quickly attached to fine atmospheric aerosols and deposited on the landscape, principally during rain. A fraction of this fallout <sup>210</sup>Pb is incorporated in sediments accumulating for example on the bed of a lake. Over time each new layer is buried by later deposits and its initial concentration reduced by radioactive decay. By comparing present\-day concentrations with estimates of the original concentrations made using mathematical models pioneered and refined by the research group of Prof Appleby and Dr Piliposyan, including PhD student P. Semertzidou **\[3.3, 3.4\]**, it is possible to calculate the age of each sediment layer and hence of the environmental records contained within it. The 22\-year half\-life of <sup>210</sup>Pb makes it ideal for studying sediment records spanning the past 150 years, the period of greatest impact of human activity on the environment. 

 The Constant Rate of Supply \(CRS\) model developed by Prof Appleby is the most widely used <sup>210</sup>Pb dating method **\[3.1\]**. Recent modelling of the atmospheric **\[3.3\]** and terrestrial **\[3.4\]** pathways by which <sup>210</sup>Pb reaches the bed of a lake have led to a much better quantitative understanding of the processes governing the supply of fallout <sup>210</sup>Pb to the sediment record. This has been coupled with work on testing and validating the models using dates determined independently from records of <sup>137</sup>Cs fallout **\[3.5, 3.6\]**. <sup>137</sup>Cs is an artificial radionuclide originating from the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, and nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl. 

 The ERRC also pioneered the use of gamma spectrometry for determining radionuclides in environmental samples. Mathematical models developed for improving the accuracy of the technique **\[3.2\]** have been incorporated into a sophisticated software package for analysing <sup>210</sup>Pb and <sup>137</sup>Cs data from the University of Liverpool Environmental Radiometric Laboratory, established by Prof Appleby. This package has been used to develop and manage a database of radiometric records from the many hundreds of cores from around the world analysed by the ERRC. The combination of state\-of\-the\-art analytical techniques, highly developed environmental models, and associated software and database have been key in the widespread uptake of the technique and involvement of the ERRC in numerous projects with significant environmental impacts such as those described in section 4. All rely on the capability of the ERRC to mathematically model and date analyse records of environmental change stored in a range of different natural archives including salt\-marshes and peat bogs as well as lake and marine sediments.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Environmental policy globally is crucially dependent on good evidence of the past and present status of the environment, and the extent to which changes are driven by human activity. Cores retrieved from natural archives such as accumulating sediments and peat bogs contain a wealth of information on environmental pollution, climate and their changes through time. Radiometric dating methods developed by Prof Appleby and Dr Piliposyan at Liverpool’s Environmental Radioactivity Research Centre \(ERRC\) **\[3.1\-4\]** are key to putting a reliable timescale on these changes. Three recent examples of where these dating techniques have generated important policy, environmental and commercial impacts across Canada and Norway are given below, in chronological order **\[4.1\-3\]**. 

###  4.1 First\-of\-its\-kind carbon budget \(Canada\) 

 The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority \(LSRCA\) NGO initiated research designed to inform a pioneering Climate Change Mitigation Strategy for the Lake Simcoe watershed in 2016. This is a recreational area near Toronto with one of the most rapidly expanding populations in Canada. An important part of the investigation was the critical role natural features \(forests and wetlands\) play in offsetting carbon emissions. Since historical rates were also important, the ERRC was asked to provide a chronological framework by dating wetland soil cores using <sup>210</sup>Pb **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. An analysis of <sup>210</sup>Pb and <sup>137</sup>Cs records in these cores showed that they contained a true chronological sequence that could be dated using the methods outlined in **\[3.1\]**. Results of this project enabled the LSRCA to model possible future carbon budgets taking account of both sequestration and emissions **\[5.2\]**, and develop the Climate Change Mitigation Strategy published in September 2020 **\[5.1\]**. The LSRCA’s General Manager of Integrated Watershed Management explains how Prof Appleby’s “ *isotope analysis was essential for us to understand what the multidecadal sequestration rates are…*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 The strategy and associated carbon budget are the first of their kind in tackling climate change across a geographical rather than political boundary **\[5.1\]**. This is at the forefront of a shifting paradigm in Canada to prioritise climate change, which is mainly addressed at a provincial level. The policy applies to all industry in the area, covering more than 3,400km<sup>2</sup> and approximately 600,000 residents **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4.2 Government guidelines on the classification of ecological water status \(Norway\) 

 Sediment cores were <sup>210</sup>Pb dated by the ERRC between 2016 and 2018 for a project funded by the Norwegian Environmental Agency **\[5.3\]**. This provided the first environmental data on water bodies for the period prior to industrial fish farming, important for making judgements as to the current ecological status. As part of this study, results based on the ERRC’s dating led to development of a fossil foraminifera\-based index for determining baseline conditions that has been incorporated into national government recommendations **\[5.3\]**. These guidelines, published by the Norwegian government in 2018 for classifying the ecological status of water bodies across Norway, are used to manage the impact of industry on the environment **\[5.4a\]** and are needed in order to comply with the EU Water Framework Directive **\[5.3, 5.4a\]**. 

 The guidelines are mandatory, enabling the government to monitor ecological status as temperatures and pollutants increase. Our collaborator at the University of Oslo explains how Prof Appleby’s modelling, using techniques in **\[3.1\]** that are cited directly in the government guidelines and appendix **\[5.4a\-c\]**, “… *played a significant role in the results generated by our research and subsequent impact. Your dating was essential and without it this work could not have been carried out. The dating was instrumental in the development and testing of a foraminifera\-based multimetric index that was used for governmental environment recommendations…Dating of these sediments is essential for this method to work.”* **\[5.3\]**. 

###  4.3 Redirecting industry resources \(Canada\) 

 The Alberta oil sands industry, which produces the majority of Canada’s oil, is benefitting from a more efficient use of resources as a result of Prof Appleby’s research on <sup>210</sup>Pb dating **\[3.1, 3.6\]**. The oil sands cover a land mass larger than England and are Canada’s biggest export earner.  The 120 extraction projects are licensed to major oil companies in Canada, the U.S. and China. Since the early 2000s there has been much controversy over the extent of environmental contamination caused by the extraction processes. A major concern was trace metal pollution.  Calculations carried out by Prof Appleby were essential to a study carried out between 2013 and 2017 on Alberta peat cores showing that atmospheric deposition of these substances has in fact declined in recent decades, concluding this longstanding debate **\[5.5a, 5.5b** and **5.6\]**. 

 The study lead at the University of Alberta explains Liverpool’s contribution: “… *Your work on <sup>210</sup>Pb age dating was key to all of that…we needed the best person on the planet to help us date those cores…our work has been a game changer* \[to industry\]” **\[5.6\]**.  The findings have enabled the oil sands industry, which spends around USD150,000,000 \(04\-2019\) annually on environmental monitoring **\[5.7\]**, to redirect resources towards more pressing environmental issues **\[5.8\]**. 

 The Director of Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance \(COSIA\) explains why the aerial deposition analysis was so important, including the ‘ *enormous*’ costs saved as a direct result: “ *Prior studies suggested that these* \[trace elements\] *deposits were from coke piles or stack emissions and further, that these* \[trace elements\] *were bioavailable and potentially damaging the environment. If this was true or if key decision makers like government and regulatory bodies thought this was true, the cost to the oil sand for source mitigation could be enormous… The impact on COSIA and COSIA members…is significant simply because we cannot afford to spend time, energy and money on problems that either don’t exist or that are natural rather than anthropogenic* \[caused by industrial activity\]”.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

#  Several programmes of research conducted by the University of Oxford have led to major changes to improve the safety of maternal services in the UK and internationally: 

# -  The ‘Birthplace in England’ national cohort study showed that expanding the number of midwife\-led births is one of the most effective ways to reduce rising intervention rates, whilst maintaining low levels of adverse outcomes for mother and baby. This led to a new focus on midwifery\-led care in the maternity strategies for all UK nations, as well as internationally. 

-  The MBRRACE\-UK and UKOSS national programmes showed that two thirds of the population attributable risk of maternal death is associated with medical co\-morbidities. This led to the introduction of new maternal medicine networks in England and international initiatives to improve access to specialist care for high\-risk pregnant women. 

-  Rapid research into the impact of COVID\-19 on pregnant women \(conducted through MBRRACE\-UK and UKOSS\) found that black and ethnic minority women were significantly more likely to be hospitalised with SARS\-CoV\-2 infection, and that disruption to wider maternity support services resulted in avoidable deaths, including from suicide. These results were rapidly incorporated into NHS and other clinical guidelines leading to specific actions to increase support for ethnic minority women and safeguard perinatal mental health services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

####  Childbirth safety in different settings for low\-risk pregnant women 

 National policy has supported choice of birth setting for low\-risk pregnant women since the 1990s. However, until recently it was unclear whether outcomes for mothers and babies differed in births planned in different settings.. The Birthplace in England cohort study, led by Professor Peter Brocklehurst at the University of Oxford, collected information about the outcomes of pregnancy among 64,540 low\-risk women planning birth in different settings, both midwife\-led and obstetrician\-led \[1\]. 

 The study found that for low\-risk women, there were no significant differences in adverse perinatal outcomes \(including stillbirth, neonatal brain damage and respiratory distress\) for planned births in freestanding midwifery units \(FMUs\) and alongside midwifery units \(AMUs\) compared with planned birth in an obstetric unit. In addition, women who planned birth at home or in FMUS or AMUs were significantly less likely than those who planned birth in obstetric units to have an instrumental or operative birth or to receive medical interventions. An associated study of the cost effectiveness of alternative planned places of birth in England for low\-risk women \[2\] found that the overall cost of intrapartum and postnatal care for low\-risk women, and associated related complications, was significantly lower for births planned at home, in a FMU or an AMU compared with planned birth in an obstetric unit. 

####  Safer and improved care for high\-risk pregnant women 

 The Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK \(MBRRACE UK\) maternal mortality surveillance and confidential enquiry programme, established in 2012 and led by Professors Marian Knight and Jennifer Kurinczuk at the University of Oxford has consistently shown that most women who die during or after pregnancy in the UK die from indirect causes, i.e. medical and mental health comorbidities. In 2009\-12, 7.2 per 100,000 women died during or in the six weeks after pregnancy from indirect causes compared with 3.5 women per 100,000 from direct \(obstetric\) causes \[3\-4\]. A comparison of women who died with those who survived from the same complications, identified through the UK Obstetric Surveillance System \(UKOSS\), also led by Professor Knight, showed that 66% of the population attributable risk fraction of maternal death can be attributed to medical co\-morbidities \[3\]. 

####  Protecting vulnerable pregnant women during the COVID\-19 pandemic 

 When the COVID\-19 outbreak was declared as a pandemic in March 2020, it was not known whether pregnant women were more susceptible to the disease. To generate conclusive evidence on this, University of Oxford researchers conducted a rapid national observational study using the UKOSS which assessed the outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS\-CoV\-2 throughout the UK \[5\]. Compared with pregnant White women, pregnant Black women were eight times more likely to be admitted to hospital with COVID\-19, while pregnant Asian women were four times as likely. In addition, the MBRRACE UK team at the University of Oxford instituted a rapid responsive review of the impact of the pandemic on wider maternity services, including mental health support and community visits \[6\]. The report concluded that ‘ *It was evident that changes to service provision as a direct consequence of the pandemic meant that women were not able to access appropriate mental health care’*. This led to the new recommendation that triage processes be used *‘to ensure that women with mental health concerns can be appropriately assessed, including face\-to\-face if necessary, and access specialist perinatal mental health services’* even in the context of services disrupted by COVID\-19. The report also highlighted the increased risk to BAME women, since seven of the eight pregnant women who died from SARS\-CoV\-2 infection were of BAME background.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  A. Childbirth safety in different settings for low\-risk pregnant women: 

#####  Facilitating national policy change towards community\-focused care 

 The Birthplace in England study \[1\] has been a key driver towards a stronger focus on midwife\-led birthing services across the UK. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence’s 2014 Guidelines ‘Intrapartum care for healthy women and babies.’ direct practitioners to use the data presented from \[1\] to *‘advise low‑risk multiparous women that planning to give birth at home or in a midwifery‑led unit \(freestanding or alongside\) is particularly suitable for them because the rate of interventions is lower and the outcome for the baby is no different compared with an obstetric unit’* \[A\]. Additional analyses by the University of Oxford researchers who led the Birthplace study \[1\] provided key evidence to the policy document ‘Better Births’, a five\-year forward view for maternity care in England published in February 2016 \[Bi\]. The evidence from the Birthplace study was integral to the conclusions of ‘Better Births’, which included the recommendation that ‘ *The \[University of Oxford\] evidence reports commissioned for this review show that midwifery care results in fewer interventions. If we can increase the proportion of births supported by midwifery care, we will be able to reduce the cost of medical interventions*’ \[Bi\]. The Birthplace study \[1\] was also cited by the maternity strategies for Scotland \[Bii\] \(January 2017\), Wales \[Biii\] \(July 2019\) and Northern Ireland \[Biv\] \(July 2012\), as evidence to support increase in provision of midwifery units for low\-risk women. 

#####  Health and wellbeing outcomes 

 Approximately 750,000 women give birth in the UK each year, 70% of whom are considered ‘low risk’, and 45% are eligible for midwifery\-led birth at the end of pregnancy. The Birthplace study \[1\] has led to substantial improvements in women’s birth experiences and access to midwifery\-led settings for birth. Between 2010 and 2016, the number of midwifery\-led units in England rose by 42% from 111 to 158; during this period, the proportion of births in midwifery\-led settings almost trebled from 5% to 14% \[C\]. Women who plan birth in a midwifery\-led setting have between a two\- and five\-fold increase in the odds of having a normal birth compared with women planning birth in an obstetric unit. In addition, the proportion of women offered birth in a midwife\-led unit/birth centre in England increased from 35% in 2013 to 45% in 2018. Similarly, in Northern Ireland, the number of midwifery\-led units has increased from five in 2012 to nine in 2020. By 2018, over half \(59%\) of UK NHS organisations with alongside maternity units operated an opt\-out policy whereby the midwifery unit is the default planned place of birth for low\-risk women \[D\]. 

#####  Impacts on international policy 

 The Birthplace programme evidence \[1\] helped to drive changes in maternity services in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. For instance, the New Zealand Government’s 2014 Report on Maternity states ‘ *Primary birthing units and home births are recommended for well, healthy women likely to experience normal birth’* \(citing \[1\] and \[A\]\) \[E\]. Similarly, the 2017 American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(ACOG\) guidance on planned home birth specifically notes that the low rates of perinatal mortality reported by the Birthplace study \[1\] reflect ‘ *provision of care by uniformly highly educated and trained certified midwives’* and on this basis *‘supports the provision of care by midwives who are certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board’* for planned home birth \[Fi\]. Prior to this, ACOG had a negative position towards home births, described by the American College of Nurse\-Midwives \[Fii\]. 

####  B. Safer and improved care for high\-risk pregnant women: 

##### 1.  Changes to national policy and service provision 

 The MBRRACE\-UK and UKOSS national programmes of maternal mortality and morbidity surveillance and confidential enquiries showed that two thirds of the population attributable risk of maternal death is associated with medical co\-morbidities, and highlighted maternal suicide as an important cause of death in the year postpartum. This led to the introduction of new maternal medicine networks in England, announced in November 2017 \[G\]. Previously, networked maternal medicine was only available in one of 12 regions of the UK \(8%\) despite the fact that 30% of women who give birth are ‘higher risk’. Networked maternal medicine is now available in the remaining 92% of areas and therefore this model of care is accessible to over 160,000 women for whom it was not previously available. 

 MBRRACE\-UK and UKOSS national programmes were cited as evidence underlying the national maternity strategy, including expanding access to specialist perinatal mental health services in the NHS England Long Term Plan published in January 2019 \[H\], and new funding of GBP50,000,000 for perinatal mental health services in Scotland, announced in March 2019. The work also underpins many of the recommendations in recent NICE guidance on intrapartum care for high\-risk women \[I\]. The MBRRACE\-UK evidence has been used to develop a new Medical Emergencies in Obstetrics \(MEmO\) course which to date has been run over 40 times with 400 total participants. The evidence also helped develop a new Acute Care Toolkit for Obstetric Medicine by the Royal College of Physicians which has been downloaded over 1,400 times. 

#####  Health benefits 

 The measures to prevent maternal deaths in association with medical and mental health co\-morbidities is already having an effect. There was a decrease in the maternal mortality rate from indirect \(medical and mental health\-related\) causes from 7.2 per 100,000 women giving birth in 2009\-11 to 6.0 per 100,000 women giving birth in 2015\-17. This is in spite of an increasing average age at which women give birth and increasing medical complexity of the maternity population overall. 

#####  International policy change in care for high risk pregnant women 

 The work led to new legislation in the United States \(the US Congress Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018 \[Ji\]\) regarding maternal mortality surveillance and review, and in 2019 Knight contributed insights to a workshop that led to recommendations for quality, availability and consistency of surveillance data and review in the United States \[Jii, Jiii\]. The work was cited as evidence driving World Health Organisation initiatives on sepsis and maternal mental health, as well as the health care of pregnant refugee and migrant women and their newborn children \[K\]. 

#####  Cultural impact and contribution to public debate 

 Zena Forster, a local independent playwright, became aware of the research findings on maternal mental health, and, working with the researchers, developed a play, 'Stitch Up'. Steeped in emotion and drama, ‘Stitch Up’ draws directly on key public health messages arising from the research, and women's lived experience of mental illness both during pregnancy and postnatally, to raise awareness, reduce stigma and encourage discussion about maternal mental health. An evaluation on behalf of the Arts Council including feedback from audience members noted that it was a ‘ *brilliant way to initiate discussion on a controversial topic \- approachable and open dialogue’*. 

####  C. Protecting vulnerable pregnant women during the COVID\-19 pandemic 

 The rapid response research studies prompted by the COVID\-19 pandemic \[5,6\] identified key lessons to guide ongoing service provision during the pandemic, including planning for winter and future lockdown scenarios. The increased risk to pregnant women from BAME communities highlighted in \[5\] generated significant media interest including all major UK outlets \(e.g. BBC News, The Times, The Telegraph\) and international distributors \(e.g. CNN\). In response the Chief Midwife in England wrote to all the maternity units in the country calling on them to take specific actions to minimise the additional risk of COVID\-19 for BAME women and their babies \[L\(i\)\]. Both the UKOSS and MBRRACE\-UK studies \[5,6\] were the basis of the joint statement from the Royal College of Midwives and RCOG: ‘Planning for Winter 2020/21: reducing the impact of COVID\-19 on maternity services in the UK’ \[L\(ii\)\]. A key principle of this is that services should show *‘particular attention to those from BAME communities or those living with medical, social or psychological conditions that make them higher risk*. *’* The report recommends ‘ *Services should review the following evidence and recommendations as a matter of priority, and encompass them into their planning: 1. The findings and recommendations of the MBRRACE rapid report’,* citing reference \[6\]. The MBRRACE\-UK report was also cited in the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ guidance: ‘COVID\-19: Working with vulnerable people’, which listed a number of ‘ *key red flags identified from the MBRRACE reports which still need to be acted upon promptly’* \[L\(iii\)\]. Even in non\-pandemic situations, approximately 10% of pregnant women have a mental health problem. Safeguarding mental health provision therefore protects an estimated 75,000 vulnerable women per year from avoidable harm during pregnancy.

 Bespoke algorithms developed at UofG have increased the number of kidney transplants arranged through the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme \(UKLKSS\). Since August 2013, 316 additional transplants have taken place, a 44% increase over the number of transplants that would have been identified using previous algorithms. These algorithms, optimised to the unique requirements of the UKLKSS, allow NHS Blood and Transplant to match recipients requiring a kidney transplant, who have a willing but incompatible donor, with the donor of another recipient in a similar position. The improved functionality of the algorithms has increased transplant numbers and freed many more kidney patients and their families from the burden of long\-term dialysis. This has saved the NHS a minimum of GBP76.2 million between 2013–2030 based on current transplant numbers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2007 NHS Blood and Transplant \(NHSBT\) established what is now called the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme \(UKLKSS\), to increase opportunities for living kidney donation. This scheme identified *paired kidney exchanges* \(PKEs; groups of two or more recipients who can swap their willing but incompatible donors with one another to obtain a compatible kidney\). It has grown to become the largest kidney exchange programme \(KEP\) in Europe in terms of the number of transplants achieved and the proportion of registered patients receiving a transplant through the scheme. It is recognised as an exemplar in terms of innovation and complexity \[5.9\] 

 
         
 

 *Figure 1: Schematics of pairwise and 3\-way exchanges: r=recipient; d=donor for r* 

The original NHSBT matching algorithm identified optimal sets of PKEs, but its computational requirements restricted it to PKEs involving only two donor\-recipient pairs \( *pairwise exchanges*\) with datasets of \~100 potential transplants. 

 In May 2007, UofG researchers, Prof Manlove and Dr Péter Biró, developed a novel approach to enable both pairwise and *three\-way exchanges* \(involving three donor\-recipient pairs; see Figure 1\) to be analysed \[3.1\], using graph\-matching algorithms.  Simulations run by the UofG team in early 2008 demonstrated that this new algorithm could accommodate datasets of up to 3,000 potential transplants and highlighted that the inclusion of three\-way exchanges could increase transplant numbers. 

 From July 2008, NHSBT used the UofG algorithm to find optimal solutions from UKLKSS matching runs, including three\-way exchanges. These quarterly matching runs apply the algorithm to the current pool of donors and recipients to find an optimal set of PKEs. 

 
                       
 

 *Figure 2: Schematics of short and long chains: A=altruistic donor, r=recipient; d=donor for r, DDWL=deceased donor waiting list.* 

Between 2010 and 2013 Prof. Manlove, with Dr O’Malley, developed a novel algorithm   using integer programming techniques to address both scalability issues with the 2007 algorithm and UKLKSS\-specific optimality criteria \[3.2\]. Moreover, this bespoke solution enabled the search for *altruistic donor chains* \(ADCs\) – chains of transplants triggered by altruistic donors. In the case of a *short chain*, an altruistic donor donates a kidney to a recipient who has a willing but incompatible donor, in exchange for that donor donating a kidney to a recipient on the deceased donor waiting list \(DDWL\). *Long chain*s are similar but involve one additional donor\-recipient pair \(see Figure 2\). 

  

 In 2011, NHSBT deployed a version of the software  by Prof Manlove and Dr O'Malley as part of an NHSBT\-funded project \[3.4\], ahead of ADCs being introduced as part of the UKLKSS in January 2012. NHSBT opted to deploy its functionality in stages to ensure that other parts of the transplant system \(e.g. operating theatres, histocompatibility laboratories\) could accommodate the increased number of transplant matches produced by larger datasets containing more altruistic donors. Until January 2015, only short chains were permitted at each matching run, and in April 2015, long chains were introduced. 

 Subsequently Prof Manlove and his team have developed improved algorithms \[3.3,3.5\] capable of both identifying longer ADCs \(in readiness their future introduction to the UKLKSS\) and handling larger datasets \[3.3, 3.5\] such as those arising from transnational European collaboration through the European Network for Collaboration on Kidney Exchange Programmes \(ENCKEP\) chaired by Prof Manlove \[3.6\]. 

 Since April 2018, following a change in policy, more altruistic donors are participating in the UKLKSS. In October 2018, NHSBT deployed a more advanced version of the UofG software to efficiently accommodate larger datasets including increased numbers of altruistic donors \(recent datasets have involved over 6,000 potential transplants and up to 29 altruistic donors\). This code was originally written as part of a previous NHSBT\-funded project \[3.7\]. 

 This UofG algorithm design is thus a prime example of high\-quality fundamental research \[3.1–3.3\] that has advanced the work of NHSBT in matching kidneys to transplant recipients, improving and saving lives, and reducing long\-term treatment costs. The research quality was recognised in the 2019 award of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Lord Kelvin Medal to Prof Manlove “for his outstanding contribution to computing science; his pioneering work in matching algorithms and software has enabled a significant increase in living kidney transplants, thereby improving public health”.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Each year, 64,000 UK patients are treated for end\-stage renal failure, 30,000 of whom are on dialysis, with kidney failure having a devastating impact on patients’ lives. Transplantation is the most effective treatment for end\-stage renal failure; the life expectancy of transplant recipients is doubled or tripled compared to those remaining on dialysis. Globally, the demand for available kidneys has consistently exceeded supply. Increasing kidney availability is critical for improving the outcomes of prospective and current renal transplant candidates. As of 29 February 2020 \[5.1\], 4,960 patients were on the UK’s kidney transplant list. However, only 3,448 kidney transplants took place between April 2019–March 2020, of which 2,466 were from deceased and 982 from living donors. During this period, 246 people died whilst awaiting a kidney transplant. NHSBT estimates the median waiting time on the kidney transplant list at 633 days for adults and 291 days for children. 

 **Increasing the number of potential donor\-recipient kidney matches** 

 UofG researchers have shown how to model a complex, hierarchical set of criteria that define an optimal set of kidney exchanges. Their algorithms have enabled the UKLKSS to optimise the number of potential donor\-recipient matches by including three\-way exchanges from July 2008; short chains from January 2012; and long chains from April 2015. In 2018, a change in NHSBT policy, which lead to chain donation becoming the default option for altruistic donors \[5.2\], resulted in refined algorithms being used \[3.7\] which further increased matching rates. 

 Between 1 August 2013–31 December 2020,1,652 potential transplants have been identified by these algorithms \(1,420 of which stem from three\-way exchanges and ADCs\), from which 1,031 transplants were performed. Had NHSBT continued to use their previous algorithm from 2007, we estimate that only 715 transplants would have taken place \(from a total of 1,146 identified matches, using the same conversion rate\). This represents an increase of 316 transplants \(or 44%\) in this period, compared to the estimated number had the earlier NHBST algorithm continued to be used. 

 The Assistant Director of Statistics and Clinical Studies at NHSBT says: *“The collaboration between NHSBT and the University of Glasgow in developing the UKLKSS has continued to progress over the last seven years. Most recently it has enabled the algorithm for living kidney exchanges to include ‘long altruistic donor chains **’**… an important new development, allowing 273 additional kidney transplants to date \(Dec 2020\), with many more expected in future years. Within the scheme, long chains now represent about 25% of transplant activity and enable many recipients who are very difficult to match \(highly sensitised\) to get a transplant. The possibilities afforded by the scheme are life changing for the many recipients who benefit”* \[5.3\] *.* 

 **Improving recipients’ quality of life** 

 For recipients, the benefits of this research are numerous. Transplanted kidneys obtained from living donors last on average 25% longer than those from deceased donors \(15 years compared to 12\) so increasing the number of these types of exchanges translates into more patients living for longer with a healthy kidney and resuming normal, working lives. By comparison, the life expectancy of patients on dialysis is around 5 years. Such quality\-of\-life benefits for UKLKSS recipients have been described in NHSBT recipient stories \[5.4\] and in three television documentaries \[5.5\]. \[5.6\] is associated with the first of these; the second and third feature Prof. Manlove’s work. A recipient from one 3\-way exchange noted that, post\-transplant, *“You could start to have these moments again… feeling great and being able to do normal family things and going for a meal with family and spending more time*  *because I’m not in hospital 3 nights a week…believing that you’re going to be well in the future”* \[5.7\]. Transplants facilitated by the UofG algorithm also improve the quality of life of those who donate to the UKLKSS. As one grateful donor noted, it enables her family to *“just forget, because it is just normal and life’s great, and I do think that we are happier”* \[5.7\] *.* 

 **Financial benefits for the NHS** 

 In addition to improving donors’ and recipients’ quality of life, the work of Prof. Manlove and colleagues also provides economic benefits to the NHS. Each kidney transplant saves the NHS GBP241,000 over 10 years \(the median graft survival time, compared to the cost of dialysis over that time period, and taking into account the cost of the operation itself\) \[5.8\]. Thus, by enabling 316 more kidney transplants from 2013–2020, the UofG researchers have potentially saved the NHS around GBP76.2 million in total from 2013–2030, with additional savings to come with each new matching run. 

 Overall, as stated in the Living Donor Kidney Transplantation \(LDKT\) Position Paper from August 2017: “ *The UK has developed the largest living kidney sharing scheme \(UKLKSS\) in Europe \[5.2\] in terms of the number of transplants achieved and the proportion of registered recipients receiving a transplant through the scheme. It is recognised as an exemplar in terms of innovation and complexity. The scheme particularly benefits long\-waiting recipients with immunological complexity and recipients from Black and Asian communities. The effectiveness of the UKLKSS is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of non\-directed altruistic kidney donors, who are willing to donate to anyone in need of a transplant and can initiate a chain of up to three transplants by a single donation. The UKLKSS currently contributes up to 20% of total LDKT \(Living Donor Kidney Transplantation\) activity”* \[5.9\]. 

 **Impact on transnational kidney exchange programmes** 

 The ENCKEP project, funded by the EU COST framework, brings together policy\-makers, clinicians, economists, social scientists and optimisation experts from across Europe to share best practice in the establishment of national and transnational KEPs. Chaired by Prof. Manlove, it has resulted in a series of handbooks and strategy papers addressing policy, clinical practice and evidence, and optimisation criteria critical for improving the quality of life of a growing European patient population with end\-stage renal disease. Corroborating details outlining how the outputs of UofG research, contributing to the ENCKEP COST Action, have helped to shape transnational KEPs including STEP \(the ScandiaTransplant Exchange Programme \(STEP\) can be obtained from \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Pupil Premium Toolkit is an evidence\-based resource for schools seeking guidance on improving outcomes for learners, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. It guides the work of the Education Endowment Foundation \(EEF\) and its funding strategy for the GBP200,000,000 being spent over 15 years to reduce inequalities in school outcomes in England. International use is growing with localised online versions for Scotland, Australia, Spain and Latin America \(with Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese translations\). The Toolkit has directly influenced UK Government policy and spending on education and the policy decisions of governments outside England. As the ‘What Works Centre for Educational Achievement’, it has also influenced the development of the ‘What Works’ centres in the UK. It is consulted by two thirds of all the head teachers in England. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Toolkit is a synthesis of research evidence from 200 systematic reviews, meta\-analyses and other quantitative studies \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\]. It aims to support schools in spending their resources, especially their Pupil Premium allocation, more thoughtfully and more effectively. The Pupil Premium will account for an estimated GBP16,000,000,000 of education spending in England between August 2013 and July 2020, representing a significant element of resourcing for disadvantaged pupils. 

 The contribution of the Toolkit is that it provides estimates of the relative benefit of the impact of different approaches on pupils’ attainment, using effect size as a common metric \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\]. It also includes an estimate of the financial costs of adopting each of the different approaches. The resulting findings about the relative cost/benefit of adopting different educational approaches on attainment in schools provides highly valued support to schools \[R4\], \[R5\]. The initial research drew on data from over 60 meta\-analyses and systematic reviews of educational approaches and interventions to improve learning in schools. Clear criteria for selecting the meta\-analyses have been identified by the authors so that comparable studies with quantitative evidence from well\-controlled experimental studies are included \[R3\], which is a further distinctive feature. 

 The research insight provided by this synthesis is that many of the approaches initially chosen by schools to support disadvantaged students are either ineffective, or unrealistic to implement, on the basis of the initial levels of funding made available to schools. It advises that some of the most popular uses of the Pupil Premium, such as appointing additional teachers or the general deployment of teaching assistants, are unlikely, on average, to be cost effective in increasing pupils’ attainment, based on the synthesis of research findings. The Toolkit identifies other approaches, such as providing feedback, or developing pupils’ skills in planning, monitoring and evaluating their own learning \(metacognition and self\-regulation\), and identifies interventions that teaching assistants and others could be trained to carry out, which are all more likely to be successful \[R3\]. It recommends that schools use the information to inform their decision\-making about the most effective support they can provide for disadvantaged learners, and encourages them to evaluate whatever they select. 

 The Toolkit was produced from funding awarded by the Sutton Trust to a team from Durham \(Higgins, Coe & Kokotsaki\) to undertake a new synthesis to create a ‘Pupil Premium Toolkit’. This research was undertaken between November 2010 and May 2011 and the resulting Toolkit was published in July 2011 \[R1\]. 

 The research was adopted by the EEF who subsequently commissioned a team at Durham led by Higgins to extend and update the review annually \[R3\] over three successive three\-year research contracts \(between 2012 and 2021\), and to use it as a basis to develop a methodology for the comparative analysis of EEF’s commissioned projects. The Toolkit is now presented as a public website and called the *Sutton Trust/EEF Teaching and Learning Toolkit*, with an overall synthesis of the findings, detailed information about each of the areas covered, references to the sources used and a summary of the synthesis of quantitative evidence used to estimate overall effects. It is routinely updated with new and emerging evidence. Other links aim to support take\-up and implementation in schools and further publications have explored the theoretical rationale and methodological approach \[R2\], \[R3\], \[R4\]. A detailed manual sets out the procedures and processes for the synthesis. 

 The findings in the Toolkit draw on conceptual work undertaken at Durham for the ESRC\-funded Researcher Development Initiative \(RDI\) ‘ *Training in the Quantitative Synthesis of Intervention Research Findings in Education and Social Sciences’* \(between April 2008 and March 2011\). An extensive database of educational meta\-analyses was produced for this project and enabled the preliminary analysis of effect sizes for the Sutton Trust. 

 Higgins has been a Professor in the School of Education since 2006. Kokotsaki is an Associate Professor. Coe was Director of the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring \(CEM\) and a Professor in the School of Education until 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  4a.\) Impact on Educational Understanding, Funding, and Practice 

 The Toolkit remains central to the work of the EEF who identify it as “transformational in communicating the key messages of educational research to teachers and senior leaders” \[E1\]. The current EEF Toolkit website receives approximately 28,000 unique page views per month, an increase from 6,500 per month in 2012 \[E2\]. The Toolkit also directly informs the work that the EEF funds. Since 2014, it has committed approximately GBP96,000,000 to test the impact of 160 high\-potential programmes, using the evidence in the Toolkit as a guide when commissioning. Its reach has been extensive and has involved approximately 10,000 schools and more than 1,000,000 children and young people in England \[E1\], \[E2\]. The Toolkit has also underpinned an EEF and Northern Rock campaign costing GBP10,000,000 over five years \(between 2016 and 2021\) to improve literacy achievement in primary schools in the North\-East of England \[E1\]. The Toolkit entries on the impact of 1\-to\-1 and small group tuition have been “pivotal” to the design of the National Tutoring Programme \[E2\]. 

 The Toolkit is used directly by schools in England as a source of information for decision\-making on pupil premium spending \(approximately GBP16,000,000,000 of targeted funding between 2014 and 2020\) \[E3\]. It has a direct influence on the spending decisions of schools in England \[E1\], \[E4\]. In 2015, the Toolkit was used by 64% of schools in England \(an increase from 36% in 2012\) according to the National Audit Office \[E4\]. By 2019 this had increased to 67% \[E2\]. Analysis of school websites indicates that more than 13,000 schools mention the Toolkit by name, as an influence their allocation of pupil premium resources \[E5\]. 

####  4b.\) Impact on Education Policy 

 UK Government has acknowledged that the Toolkit is a key part of its policy on the education of disadvantaged children, with 4 citations in the March 2016 White Paper \[E6\]. It acknowledged that the Toolkit “is helping teachers to find and use evidence about the most effective teaching methods to improve standards for all children, including the most disadvantaged” and cites the Toolkit an example of the evidence\-base which sets out “what works and what doesn’t, and which develops and evolves over time”. The Government committed to ensuring that the EEF will continue to have a role in improving the education evidence\-base through its role as the designated What Works Centre for education \[E6: 2.54; 2.58; 2.63\]. 

 The Toolkit is identified as a model for other UK ‘What Works’ Centres and has influenced the design of 4 other evidence comparison ‘toolkits’ in the network \[E3\], \[E8\]. The Toolkit is also cited in the media in the UK and US as an authority for education research \[E7\]. 

####  4c.\) International Reach 

 The EEF has established partnerships with a number of global organisations \[E8\] based around the Toolkit and its potential development in different parts of the world. In 2014, they began working with school systems in Australia to develop a localised version of the Teaching & Learning Toolkit, taking the global evidence base that underpins the Toolkit and contextualising it with recent examples of local research to enhance its relevance for Australian teachers \[E8\], \[E9\]. In 2016, CommBank supported this work with AUS50,000,000 \(GBP28,000,000 \(09\-2020\)\) and is working in partnership with Social Ventures Australia to commission three large\-scale randomised controlled trials, which will provide further evidence of impact that will be added to the Toolkit analysis \[E10\]. 

 The Australian work was extended in February 2017 by Education **Scotland**, with the development of a Scottish version of the Toolkit \[E8\] to strengthen the use of evidence underpinning the Scottish Attainment Challenge. In July 2017, the EEF entered into a new partnership in **Latin America and the Caribbean** with SUMMA \(the Laboratory of Education Research and Innovation for Latin America and the Caribbean\). This partnership has seen the translation of the Toolkit into Spanish and Portuguese, along with the integration of more than 250 recent local studies that help contextualise the evidence for Latin American and Caribbean teachers, and contribute to the global knowledge about the Toolkit strands \[E8\]. 

 In June 2018, EEF, in partnership with BHP Billiton Foundation, announced a 5\-year GBP9,800,000 fund aiming to improve learning outcomes for disadvantaged pupils across the world by building a global evidence network with the development of the Toolkit as a central aim \[E1\]. As a result of this development, the EEF entered into partnership with EduCaixa \(Fundación Bancaria “la Caixa”\) to develop a Spanish version of the Teaching & Learning Toolkit. This partnership has seen the translation of the global evidence base into Spanish and Catalan, providing teachers across Spain with access to robust evidence about effective educational approaches \[E2\], \[E8\]. 

 In 2019 the EEF established a partnership with the Queen Rania Foundation which will see the translation and contextualisation of the Teaching and Learning Toolkit into Arabic for teachers and policymakers in the Middle East and North Africa region. A similar agreement with Effective Basic Services Africa \(eBASE\) will see the adaptation of the Teaching and Learning Toolkit for teachers in Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad, and Niger and will include a French translation \[E2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 


 Vaping and smoking simulator at the University of St Andrews 

Globally some 1,300,000,000 people smoke tobacco and about half will die from inhaling its combusted products \(about 7,000,000 people per year\). Though not risk free, vaping is considered a much less harmful means of acquiring nicotine and vaper numbers worldwide are estimated at about 50,000,000. A few countries, including the UK, have actively encouraged vaping as an aid to smoking cessation and the majority of the UK's 3,200,000 people \(vapers\) are ex\-smokers. Public misperception of the health risks of vaping is a significant obstacle on the pathway to smoking cessation. Dr Ed Stephens' disease potency toxicological modelling has investigated the long\-term implications of vaping for cancer with results that address two contrasting areas: \(1\) in public health, where the research has contributed to shaping policy and informing regulators, practitioners and users on the cancer risks; and \(2\) by providing key evidence which has led to radical shifts in “Big Tobacco” strategies that phase out cigarettes entirely and replace them with smoke\-free products. Four of these companies, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco, exceeded USD120,000,000,000 in combined sales in 2019.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2010, Dr Ed Stephens established a laboratory, with EU support, in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences to investigate the role that tobacco plays in transferring environmental toxicants, notably ""heavy metals"", from the cultivation environment to the smoke aerosol created when tobacco is combusted. Evidence was found that variations in geology, soils and atmospheric pollution are reflected in the tobacco crop and, subsequently, the smoke emissions to which users are exposed \( **R1**\). For example, combustion creates conditions to ensure that the oxidised form of arsenic, As\(V\), that is typical of fresh tobacco leaf, is reduced during combustion to As\(III\), a much more toxic valence state \( **R2**\). 

 By 2014, electronic nicotine delivery systems \(ENDS\), including e\-cigarettes, had gained wide acceptance with users of combustible cigarettes \(CC\) in some economically developed countries for their perceived health benefits. Stephens modified his lab to facilitate the analysis of ENDS products and provided evidence that the burden of several toxicants and carcinogens is lower than in CC smoke for the same volume of emissions \( **R3**\). 

 
While this relationship mostly held for individual toxicants, there was no clarity on how health risks compared between smoking, vaping and abstinence. To address this knowledge gap, the chemical compositions of emissions from CC and ENDS under standard laboratory conditions were collated in a database from all known peer\-reviewed publications that met a particular standard. Because CC and ENDS emissions data were not directly comparable, a parameterisation was devised to enable like\-with\-like comparison. The cancer potency of the emission from each experiment was then computed from the emissions concentrations and carcinogenic \(unit\) risks for each com\-pound. The aggregate potency results provided a useful proxy for cancer risk \( **R4**\) which was further refined for a subset of products using the more complete benchmark dose toxicological model \( **R5**\). 

 Figure 1. Normalised relative cancer potencies of uncontaminated air and emissions from various forms of nicotine delivery compared with average tobacco smoke \(set to 1\). Each circle/ellipse is an individual experiment. \(from R4\). 

This synthesis led Stephens to create a *cancer potency spectrum* reflecting relative risks \(Figure 1, reproduced from **R4**\), the only published example to compare quantitatively the risks of disease due to various forms of inhaling nicotine \(i.e. smoking, vaping, etc.\). It shows that relative risk spans nearly six orders of magnitude from the extremely low cancer risk of ambient air to the very high risk of tobacco smoke. Stephens also identified the individual compounds that contribute most to carcinogenicity \( **R4**\) thereby providing guidance and focus for future research on further reduction of risk. The unexpected finding was that, unlike combustible tobacco, e\-cigarettes do not occupy a narrow, well\-defined region of the risk spectrum but span almost the whole range: from a risk equivalent to that of a medically\-prescribed nicotine inhaler up to the risk of tobacco smoke, although most values fall below 1% of smoking risks. Further research indicated that high\-risk e\-cigarette emissions were associated with experiments in which the heating coil was run at unusually high power \( **R6**\). Devices that deliver nicotine aerosols from heating tobacco without combustion \(HTP, see below\) have risks of 1\-10% those of aerosols from combusting tobacco \( **R4, R5**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 On current trends 12,000,000,000 avoidable deaths will be attributable to smoking\-related causes over this century and the emissions from combusting tobacco leaf are identified as the main culprits. Current consensus, supported by the underpinning research in section 2, is that ENDS help users to quit combustibles while protecting both users and bystanders from the highly toxic emissions of combusted tobacco. Population\-scale  [modelling for the US](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/27/1/18) estimates that replacing combustibles with ENDS would prevent up to 6,600,000 premature deaths over a 10\-year period. 

 Stephens' research \(exemplified by **R1**\- **R3**\) as described in section 2 culminated with **R4**, where he was sole contributor of the data compilation and its interpretation. **R5** was based on **R4** and was a collaboration on further methodological development while other authors provided new toxicological analyses. This research comparing the cancer potencies of emissions from ENDS with tobacco smoke led to proxies for the relative risks of cancer from a range of devices used to aerosolise nicotine \(cigarettes, heated tobacco products \(HTP\), e\-cigarettes, nicotine inhalators etc.\). The scientific evidence has helped bring about necessary strategic changes on several fronts in the ongoing battle to prevent deaths as a result of inhaling the highly toxic aerosols of combustible tobacco products. His research has: 

1.  provided key corroborative evidence on relative risks for Public Health England \(PHE\) to implement UK Government policy in radically revising its tobacco control policy to promote ENDS as aids in smoking cessation; informed the WHO expert panel on the relative risks of ENDS; and widely informed people \(users\) via social media routes on the relative risks of the various methods of nicotine delivery; 

1.  contributed to profound changes in the long\-term business strategies of the leading tobacco companies Philip Morris International \(PMI\), Japan Tobacco International \(JTI\) and Imperial to replace their combustible cigarette product ranges with smoke\-free, non\-combustible products. This follows the 2020 formal approval of PMI's flagship HTP by US regulators \(FDA\) for which **R4** was cited among the key evidence for reducing health risks. 

1.  **Influencing Public Health Policy for Smoking Cessation through government, WHO, NGOs and the public. 

 The UK Government's  [Tobacco Control Plan](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/714365/tobacco-control-delivery-plan-2017-to-2022.pdf) addressed ENDS in 2017 and in the associated Parliamentary debate the research at the University of St Andrews regarding the relative risks of cancer was explicitly cited \( **S1, p. 29**\). In the report commissioned from PHE to implement the associated legislation, ‘ [Evidence review of e\-cigarettes and heated tobacco products 2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-tobacco-products-evidence-review)’ \( **S2**\), the harm\-reduction potential of e\-cigarettes was adopted as its centrepiece policy for smoking cessation, citing directly data from **R4,** "" *EC cancer potencies were largely found to be only a small fraction of those of smoking \(0.4%\)*"" \( **S2, p. 155**\), and emphasising as the first Key Finding that "" *cancer potencies of e\-cigarettes were largely under 0.5% of the risk of smoking*"" \( **S2, p. 174**\). PHE has led the world \(often controversially\) in its proactive adoption of e\-cigarettes as the most effective means of reducing the considerable health burden of smoking combustibles. The Tobacco Control lead within PHE with responsibility for grounding UK tobacco policy in scientific evidence has stated, "" *While the data on the role of non tobacco nicotine products in cardiovascular and respiratory disease remains highly contested, the work of Dr Stephens has, to a very great degree, helped to settle the issue on the risk of cancer. … \(his\) work helped to establish that risk, not simply in the context of recreational nicotine products, such as cigarettes but also pharmaceutical products for the treatment of tobacco dependency. … In short, I consider that the work \[of Dr Stephens\] has had a material impact on UK tobacco control policy and greatly improved the international policy debate*"" \( **S3, p. 1**\). When addressing the health risks of ENDS PHE's Tobacco Control Lead summarises **R4** in his regular presentation \( **S3, p. 19, slide 17**\) and *""\[he\] always spend\[s\] some time explaining the paper’s significance""* \( **S3, p. 1**\). UK policy was derived from The WHO's 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control \(FCTC\), signed by 168 nations, that recognises tobacco as an epidemic requiring global action. Since ENDS became popular in the 2010s, the WHO has sought to provide authoritative advice on the safety of these products through TobReg, its expert science advisory panel. TobReg's report in 2017 highlighted Stephens' research on risk by reproducing text and a diagram from **R4** verbatim \( **S4, pp. 58 & 59\).** Nicotine users were directly engaged through the NGO, Cancer Research UK, which hosted a Science blog interview with Dr Stephens on heat\-not\-burn products  [to explain the concept and relative risks](https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2018/02/07/misconceptions-about-e-cigarette-safety-might-be-stopping-smokers-using-them-to-quit/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cancerresearchuk%2FSHhE+%28Cancer+Research+UK+-+Science+Update%29) of HTPs \( **S5, pp. 1\-4**\). In the US, a complementary story covered by the  [Tobacco Control blog](https://blogs.bmj.com/tc/2019/09/25/responding-to-public-health-emergencies-in-an-age-of-distrust-the-current-lung-damage-epidemic-in-the-united-states/) which directly references Stephens’ research \( **R4**\) received over 21,000 site visits \( **S5, p. 9**\). The findings on risk were also reported in newspapers including The Guardian \(monthly average multiplatform readership: 24,165,000 \( **S5, p. 14**\)\) and Irish Times \(average daily readership: 390,000 \( **S5, p. 19**\) that led to far wider engagement with the research, **R4**, than solely through an academic audience, ultimately resulting in over 40,000 downloads of **R4** from the BMJ website and more than 100,000 downloads of the abstract placing it 24<sup>th</sup> in 2,684 outputs in this BMJ journal \( **S6**\). Altmetric \(score 463\) indicates that 91% of social media 

content occurred through members of the public \( **S6**\). 


 Cancer risk from vaping compared with smoking \(arbitrarily set at 100%\) using cancer potency as a proxy and commercial devices to reflect risk ranges. Note the risk scale is logarithmic – at the low risk end a medically prescribed nicotine inhaler poses about 0.01% the risk of smoking. 


1.  **Impact on Big Tobacco’s long\-term business strategies**.* 

 Pressure from changing public attitudes, international public health policies and the growing popularity of ENDS as means for acquiring nicotine, collectively, pose an existential threat to ""Big Tobacco"". The four largest international tobacco companies, namely Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco \(PMI, BAT, JTI and Imperial\), whose collective annual revenues in 2019 exceeded USD120,000,000,000, responded to public pressure and government policies \(section 4.1\), in part as a result of the Stephens’ research \( **R4**\), now accept that business as usual cannot continue and have changed their business development direction from combustible cigarettes to smoke\-free products. As well as entering the e\-cigarette market, they have consolidated their reliance on tobacco by creating HTP devices that release nicotine and flavours when tobacco is heated below combustion temperatures. Since the launch in Japan in 2014 of iQOS, PMI's flagship ""smoke\-free"" HTP product, the company has pursued, for global commercial reasons, regulatory approval in the US in order to market iQOS formally as a ""reduced risk"" product. PMI's request submitted to the US Food & Drug Administration \(FDA\) in 2017 was eventually approved in July 2020 after three years of detailed scrutiny. FDA's scientific reviewers found seven peer\-reviewed publications on the chemical toxicology of the iQOS aerosol, with **R4** being the only one to quantify the health risks compared with combustible cigarettes \( **S7, p. 22\)**. This study was thus an important factor in the FDA's approval of iQOS as a ""<ins> *modified</ins> risk tobacco product"".* This was the first time that tobacco products received this approval, which permits the marketing of a product where the issuance of the order “ *is expected* *to benefit the health of the \[US\] population as a whole*"" \( **S8**\). In a press release welcoming the FDA's approval of iQOS, PMI announced a stunning change to their strategic vision, stating, “ *To date, we have invested USD 7.2 billion \[USD7,200,000,000\] in the research and development of our smoke\-free products. Furthermore, we have committed to stop selling cigarettes as soon as possible. Our ambition is to secure a smoke\-free future for all*” \( **S9**\). BAT, JTI and Imperial are currently on similar journeys to replace their combustible products and the methodology of Stephens \( **R4**\) is playing a similar role \(being directly quoted\) in demonstrating the risk differential with combustibles \( **S10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Mealey’s research demonstrates that the concept of faith needs both love and justice at its centre, which in turn necessitates Christians to campaign for social justice and to show how the desire to love is lived out in society and in institutions. This research has influenced public debate and action in Leeds and beyond on employers paying all employees a living wage. This was achieved through Mealey’s campaigning work through Leeds Citizens \(a subsidiary organisation of Citizens UK\) and impacts include significant private and public sector employers and Anchor Institutions changing their policy and committing to pay the living wage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research that underpins the impacts began in 2000 with Ann Marie Mealey’s doctoral thesis which subsequently shaped the monograph on the *Identity of Christian Morality*. This work has been further developed in **R1** and **R2**. Mealey’s central claim is that those who hold a Christian faith must move away from claims that moral demands are specific to their tradition and therefore not accessible universally through reason and natural law. In particular, the concept that Christian faith requires both love and justice at its centre demands that Christians have to campaign for social justice and show how the desire to love is lived out in society and in institutions. 

 This argument is summarised in **R2** as: ‘Belief in God is not simply a private affair…it requires a sense of action for social justice and an application of the love commandment that is coupled with a sense of justice’ \(p. 22\). Inspired by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Mealey’s research argues that love and justice must continue to interpret and re\-interpret each other so that believers are sensitive to the plight of others and the need to care about this \(love\) but also to combine this with the need for principles of justice that can improve the contexts and circumstances that individuals find themselves in. It is not enough to simply love those who suffer; campaigning for justice for them is also a requirement. 

 Mealey’s work demonstrates that the love commandment, which is so central to the Christian tradition, cannot operate in its fullest sense without being considered in a constant dialectic with justice. Anticipating the argument that religious traditions bring unique sets of norms and principles to bear, or that religious traditions have no place in campaigning on political matters pertaining to social justice, in **R1** Mealey argues that since the content of morality is identical for the believer and the non\-believer, individuals can discuss the search for truth together. Although their personal identity \(and in consequence how they arrive at moral norms\) may well be different, the moral norms and principles that are followed can be accessed by all through human reason. 

 On the basis of this research, Mealey was able to discuss how faith should contribute to social justice and campaign work without suggesting that Christians, for example, have a monopoly on truth or that the command is love is enough to improve the contexts that keep individuals in inferior, unjust or inadequate conditions. Love and justice exist in a dialectical relationship where they are always interpreting and re\-interpreting each other in the quest for truth. 

 These perspectives came to the attention of Leeds Citizens and Mealey was invited to become Co\-Chair. Her scholarly perspectives have formed the basis of her own campaigning contributions as Co\-Chair of Leeds Citizens, resulting in the impacts described in Section 4.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> *Summary of impact*</ins> 

 Mealey’s research has contributed to public debate and action in Leeds and beyond on The Living Wage campaign. 

 Influenced by Leeds Citizens campaigning: 

-  Public sector Anchor Institutions in Leeds have committed to pay their employees the living wage \(including a promise from Leeds City Council and implementation at Leeds Trinity University\). 

-  Significant private sector employers \(e.g., Leeds Building Society\) have committed to pay the living wage. 

-  Leeds Law Society helped to convince members to commit to pay the living wage to employees. 

-  Public debate in the city \(including amongst influential opinion formers\) has been persuaded by Mealey’s presentations at events, which have been reported through local media outlets. 

 <ins> *Details of the impacts*</ins> 

 *Public Sector Anchor Institution and third sector employers and The Living Wage* 

-  In 2019, as Vice\-Chancellor, Professor Margaret House committed Leeds Trinity University to pay the living wage to all directly employed staff: ‘Dr Mealey’s research, which argues that people have a moral imperative to take action to fight social injustice whether from a faith background or not, led to a commitment within the University to campaign as an Anchor Institution in Leeds to support the Living Wage campaign by Leeds Citizens, and to only work with third party suppliers of services \(such as catering, car parking and security\) who pay their staff the Living Wage.’ \( **S1**\) 

-  Cllr. Judith Blake, Leader of Leeds City Council \(LCC\), made the first public commitment to secure Living Wage accreditation for Leeds City Council at the Leeds Citizens Founding Assembly 2015 \(Chaired by Mealey\). \( **S2**\) 

-  Since then, LCC has progressively increased the pay for directly employed staff to above the real Living Wage, through meetings and events organised by Leeds Citizens with Council officers, the Living Wage Foundation and trade unions. 

-  The total investment made by LCC in top\-up pay awards to uplift wages for directly employed staff is £13.2million. 

-  \~ 5000 council staff on the lowest pay bands, 80% of whom are women, have benefited. 

-  LCC has also committed to pursuing Living Wage City status for Leeds. 

-  St. Luke’s Cares \(a small place\-based charity supporting young people in S. Leeds through fundraising including house clearing\) and The Poverty Truth Network received Living Wage accreditation in 2020 following engagement with Leeds Citizens campaigning. 

 *Private sector employers and the living wage* 

 The following private sector employers received Living Wage accreditation following engagement with Leeds Citizens campaigns: 

-  Leeds Building Society, the UK’s fifth largest with an annual turnover in excess of £10bn \(2019\) 

-  Leeds Law Society, representing more than 1,000 legal services organisations in the UK’s second largest legal services centre \(2018\) 

-  Barton Legal, a specialist construction and engineering law firm \(2018\) \( **S1**\). 

 <ins> *Pathways to impact*</ins> 

 The above impacts were achieved through Mealey’s work with Leeds Citizens \(a subsidiary organisation that is governed by Citizens UK\). Leeds Citizens is a non\-faith\-based body although it includes faith\-based organisations. Mealey was approached to be Co\-Chair of Leeds Citizens by the Rt. Hon. John Battle. Battle approached Mealey because he was aware of ‘her emphasis on the need to translate faith into practical action personally and socially’ **\(S1\)**. Her work with Leeds Citizens has drawn together faith and non\-faith\-based organisations in campaigning ‘according to well established principles of community organising’ \( **S1**\). It involves helping to shape the nature and approach to campaign work carried out by Leeds Citizens across the city of Leeds, and to encourage businesses in particular to commit to making Leeds a Living Wage City. 

 Under the leadership of Mealey and informed by her research, Leeds Citizens has made a decisive intervention in raising moral significance in public debate around The Living Wage.  This has been done through direct engagement with organisations and public events including the major Living Wage Foundation event \(11 November 2019\). Participants included legal firms and local businesses who ultimately pledged to campaign for the Living Wage throughout the city. Mealey helped organise and spoke of the need for all to seek justice for those who provide essential services but yet live in contexts that are often substandard. She referred explicitly to **R1** and **R2** in order to underline the significance of what her research is trying to achieve: convincing others that the call to justice is not simply an intellectual endeavour, but is also a call to become involved in campaigning, really living out the call to ‘love neighbour’ and to strive for ‘just institutions’ in which people can live and flourish. 

 This was reported in the media \(e.g. *The Telegraph and Argus* and the *North Leeds Life*\), on Twitter and Facebook pages of various organisations – including the Living Wage Foundation itself. 

  

 Since then Mealey has gone on to write a blog on the importance of a ‘just wage’ for Citizens UK which has now also impacted on discussions in the work of Leeds Church Institute and they have shared the blog on their website:  [<ins>https://www.leedsjp.org.uk/views/a\-just\-wage\-courage\-is\-what\-is\-needed/</ins>](https://www.leedsjp.org.uk/views/a-just-wage-courage-is-what-is-needed/) \(May 2020\). 

  

 Mealey’s research on social ethics has also led to a further impact on the Leeds Church Institute and for Citizens UK, for which she wrote a paper on “Faith Based Universities and COVID\-19: A Time to Dig Deep for our Moral Compass?” \(April 2020\):  [<ins>https://lcileeds.org/wp\-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog\-on\-COVID\-19\-and\-faith\-based\-universities.pdf</ins>](https://lcileeds.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-on-COVID-19-and-faith-based-universities.pdf)

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Working with major policy institutions such as the Big Innovation Centre, Innovate UK, the UK Intellectual Property Office, and the European Commission, Andersen, Rossi and De Silva have reshaped national and international approaches to the ways in which businesses and universities can best work together. Their research on knowledge co\-creation has been a catalyst for major policy reform in the UK and EU, shaping the delivery framework for the EU’s €80 billion Horizon 2020 programme, supporting changes to the Lambert Toolkit and reform to the UK impact landscape, and underpinning the development of the UK’s Catapult Centres \(and the distribution of over £1 billion in government funding\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research underpinning this case study focuses on knowledge co\-creation, defined as the development of close working relationships between individuals associated with organisations across the innovation ecosystem \(universities, businesses, government and civil society, knowledge intermediaries\) and the exploitation of these relationships to simultaneously generate commercial and societal value. Co\-creation is a multivalent approach to innovation and is often used to exploit opportunities or address strategies that a single organisation cannot encompass within its organisational boundaries or through a more linear structure of knowledge transfer or exchange. 

 The work discussed here was initiated by Andersen’s role co\-ordinating workstreams in two major EU Framework Programmes: DIME \(Dynamics of Markets and Institutions in Europe, 2005\-11\) and U\-KNOW \(Understanding the Relationship between Knowledge and Competitiveness in the Enlarging European Union, 2006\-09\). Both programmes focused on the influence of rules, norms and standards on knowledge exchange, and the research they generated highlighted the significance of co\-creation as a pathway for simultaneously generating social and business value. This led to key stakeholders identifying the need to further our knowledge in this area, facilitating the collaborative research listed in Section 3. 

 As an important milestone of associated further research, Andersen was recruited in 2012 by the European Commission into a high\-level expert group convened to inform the development of a new European innovation strategy. The work of this group, which sat until 2014, was communicated to policymakers via meetings and discussions throughout its lifespan but is summarised in its final report \[6\], which explicitly recommended an approach that ‘moves from bilateral transactions and collaborations towards networked, multi\-collaborative innovation ecosystems’; that is to say, a ‘co\-creation’ approach known as ‘Open Innovation 2.0’ \[p.5\]. 

 In addition to this work for the European Commission, Andersen, De Silva and Rossi have worked with Innovate UK, the UK Intellectual Property Office, and the OECD \(amongst others\), carrying out research with and for these key policymaking organisations. Practising the strategies that they describe, the researchers closely worked with academic, policy and practitioner stakeholders throughout the research process, which had led to scaling up of the impacts of their research. Research output were initially represented in the forms of policy briefs and practice\-based reports, before being developed, refined and theoretically contextualised for publication in academic journals. In the meantime, the team continued to engage with stakeholders through roundtables, meetings, and other collaborative means to influence policy and institutional strategies conducive to co\-creation. This strategy, which facilitated maximum policy, practice and academic impact, is evinced in the exemplar publications listed in Section 3. 

 De Silva, Andersen and Rossi’s research particularly contributes to furthering our understanding of unique dimensions of co\-creation, its success criteria and the role of policy and practice on successful co\-creation. Research for the Intellectual Property Office on the ways that businesses and universities work together in the UK \[1\] fed into academic papers on the role of relational practices in facilitating co\-creation \[2\] and the impact of different entrepreneurial styles on the value generated by co\-creation \[3\]. Another focus has been the role of technology and innovation centres in co\-creation. In 2009, Andersen was involved in an international evaluation of the Danish GTS institutes \( [*A Step Beyond: International Evaluation of the GTS Institute System in Denmark*](https://en.gts-net.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AStepBeyond_web_1.pdf)\); this work was followed by a report for Innovate UK *\(Catapult to Success,* 2013; see discussion in section 5\) which informed the implementation of the UK Catapult Centres and was itself supported by further research \[4\], in which Andersen and De Silva collected interview and survey data from directors of technology and innovation centres across Europe to understand how the UK centres could learn from their long\-established European counterparts as to how best to co\-create value. This work produced an academic paper on the ways that intermediary organisations generate value through collaborative work \[5\] as well as contributing to a comparative study of ‘Triple Helix’ organisations across four European countries \(Meyer et al., ‘Towards New Triple Helix Organisations?’, 2018\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Andersen, De Silva and Rossi’s work has acted as a catalyst in effecting a science and innovation policy change towards co\-creation, which has in turn affected the innovation ecosystem at every level in both the UK and the EU: how budgets are written, how grants are delivered, how universities and businesses work together, and how the impact of university and public research and development is assessed. 

 Since 2011, both EU and UK governments have sought to reform university\-business interactions, working to create a joined\-up approach that works from technology readiness level 1 \(basic research\) to 9 \(system launch and operations\). In the UK particularly there has been a concerted effort to address a perceived gap in the innovation pipeline from academia: universities were seen as strong up to tech readiness level 3 but struggled to bridge the gap to market. Addressing this deficiency has meant a significant overhaul of the United Kingdom’s research and innovation infrastructure, with a move away from a linear model of research \(first\) <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF0AE;</span>development \(second\) <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF0AE;</span>market \(third\), to a more unified model that sees all the stages happening simultaneously; or to put it another way, a move from a technology transfer to a co\-creation model, supported and informed by Andersen, De Silva, and Rossi’s research. 

 An important factor in ensuring Birkbeck researchers’ access to policymakers has been Andersen’s position of CEO at the Big Innovation Centre, an innovation hub to which she was recruited in 2011 and which became a fully independent entity \(with Andersen as CEO\) in July 2014. The government’s Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth was launched at the Centre in 2011, and Andersen and her colleagues have maintained a close relationship with both Innovate UK \(the UK government’s arms\-length innovation agency\) and with members of government. Vince Cable, then Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, stated in 2015 that the Big Innovation Centre had made ‘a really important contribution to our thinking’; Jo Johnson, then Minister for Universities and Science, asserted the following year that 'The work \[the Big Innovation Centre is\] doing is really important to our ability to succeed in many of the things we're doing as a government'; and Innovate UK CEO Ruth McKernan paid tribute at the same 2016 event to ‘the contribution that Birgitte and her colleagues \[had\] made in developing and celebrating the culture of innovation' in the UK \[A\]. 

 This connection has given Birkbeck researchers a clear path of access to UK policy stakeholders. Andersen has maintained a part\-time position at Birkbeck throughout her time at the Big Innovation Centre and a strong collaborative relationship between the two bodies has been established. Notably, Big Innovation Centre funding underpinned De Silva’s initial research leader position at Birkbeck \(2013\-15\). Ongoing research collaborations \(with contracts in place until July 2023\) have been established between Andersen, Rossi, De Silva, and the government agencies who routinely commission research from the Centre, including both Innovate UK and UKRI \(Research Councils UK, which became UK Research & Innovation in 2018\). Since UKRI covers research from technology readiness levels 0\-3 and Innovate UK from levels 3\-9, Birkbeck researchers have been able to influence UK innovation policy at every level. 

 <ins> **Boosting</ins> <ins>Co\-creation</ins> <ins></ins><ins>Approach</ins> <ins>in the EU**</ins>: Andersen was rapporteur to a high\-level expert group appointed by the European Commission in 2012 to provide advice on policies then being developed around open innovation and knowledge transfer in light of the ‘Innovation Union’ element of the Europe 2020 strategy. This work shaped the implementation of Horizon 2020, the world’s largest research and innovation programme. 

 As rapporteur, Andersen had significant input into the work of this group, summarised in its final report \[6\]. Advocating the adoption of a ‘co\-creation’ approach, the report outlined four steps towards making this possible: 1\) putting open innovation and knowledge transfer in the spotlight; 2\) embracing innovative businesses and growing new networks and hubs; 3\) making universities more entrepreneurial; and 4\) introducing smarter funding for innovation. These recommendations have been reflected in the implementation of the Open Innovation 2.0 policy introduced by the European Commission in 2013. The white paper launching the policy, which has governed research and innovation strategy within Europe since its introduction, highlights ‘integrated collaboration’ and ‘co\-created shared value’ as key principles \[B\]. 

 Notably, recommendations made within the report informed the criteria under which Horizon 2020 funding was allocated. Horizon 2020, which was launched at the Big Innovation Centre in London in June 2013, ran between 2014 and 2020 and was the world’s largest ever research and innovation programme, underwriting the ‘Innovation Union’ initiative with a total of €80 billion over this period. The expert report \[6\] was commissioned specifically to inform the implementation of this programme and fed directly into the eligibility criteria established by the EU for the allocation of this funding: most notably, to the centrality of impact as a criterion for success. Under the new recommendations, one\-third of the evaluation score for funding proposals was based on impact criteria, with applicants required to show both how they would achieve specific impacts but also how they would maximise its impact more generally. 

 Andersen’s work has therefore influenced the allocation of all funding distributed under Horizon 2020. It is difficult to overstate the scale of this scheme. A five\-year review published in 2019 found that Horizon 2020\-funded projects had produced 62,000 peer\-reviewed publications, more than 1,600 patent applications, and over 1.5 million one\-to\-one collaborations. \[C\] 

 The report \[6\]’s influence on research funding under Open Innovation 2.0 continues. A recommendation that the European Commission address the ‘liquidity gap’ in the European innovation infrastructure by developing new public\-private funding partnerships \(p.12\) was realised in 2020 with the launch of the European Innovation Council Fund \(EIC Fund\), which provides grants of between €0.5 million and €15 million to ‘breakthrough innovation companies’ Europe\-wide. ‘This is the first time the European Commission will make such direct equity investments in companies.’ \[D\] Initial investments total €680 million, but the EIC also partners with the SMEs in which it invests to seek further co\-investment from the private sector. 

 <ins> **Leading policy change for University\-industry co\-creation in the UK</ins>:** Report \[1\] was jointly funded by Innovate UK and the UK Intellectual Property Office in order to provide information on how UK universities could most successfully collaborate with business in order to generate innovation. It was launched in July 2013 at the Triple Helix Conference, which was jointly hosted by Birkbeck, UCL Enterprise and the Big Innovation Centre, co\-sponsored by the UK research councils, and attracted 350 attendees from 22 countries across 7 continents, including the then universities minister, David Willetts. At the conference, De Silva presented the report to stakeholders across all three sectors and in the immediate aftermath, the IPO ran a public consultation collecting feedback on the research, which ran for three months. 

 Since this date, the report’s recommendations have been reflected most notably in revisions to the Lambert Toolkit, which is provided by the Intellectual Property Office in order to facilitate the contract formation of emerging university\-industry co\-creation mechanisms; in the introduction of mechanisms to facilitate university\-SME co\-creation; and in changes to the role of university Technology Transfer Offices to reflect the characteristics that the research demonstrates to be most effective. 

 One key recommendation made in the report was that the IPO should review and update the Lambert toolkit. This provides universities and businesses with a series of example contracts that can be used to facilitate co\-creation arrangements, and Andersen and De Silva argued that the toolkit required updating 'to facilitate negotiations related to new knowledge co\-creation practices’, creating contracts which allowed for greater flexibility and taking account of ‘in\-kind’ contributions made by industrial partners \(\[1\] *,* p.45\). The IPO followed this recommendation and in 2016 released Lambert 2.0, which has resulted in ‘an increase in visitors’ to the toolkit site \[E\]. De Silva was on the expert panel which advised on the details of this update. The revised agreements are now routinely used by universities across the UK to set the terms of their engagement with industrial and commercial partners. A small\-scale IPO survey conducted in 2019 found that 83% of respondents \(who came from universities, research institutions, and businesses\) were aware of the toolkit and of those, 71% had used it. The most widely used element was agreement 4a, which gives both the institution and the collaborating body the right to use IP generated during the research for their purposes. This agreement was introduced in the 2016 update. \[E\] 

 The impact of this work has extended beyond the UK. Lambert Toolkit agreements are also used as the basis for co\-creation agreements in projects which involve collaboration between institutions in the UK and those in China and Korea. In March 2018, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office announced the introduction of its own Lambert Toolkit,  [‘translated and adapted’ from the British example](http://www.tavaresoffice.com.br/blog/en/bpto-and-ukipo-launch-lambert-toolkit/), as part of a cooperation agreement with the UK Intellectual Property Office. And in December 2019, De Silva was part of a UK trade mission to India, where policymakers are using the revised Lambert toolkit as the basis to develop a similar tool. 

 Report \[1\] was also cited in Sir Andrew Witty’s 2013 review of universities and growth \[F\], with reference to the difficulties encountered by SMEs in collaborating with universities. One of the recommendations made in \[1\] was that more consideration should be given to the benefit that SMEs could derive from the use of e.g. specialist facilities, an aspect of university\-business collaboration that had previously been largely overlooked. In December 2013, the government invested £15 million in piloting University Enterprise Zones, which amongst their other purposes provided office and laboratory space to small businesses, ‘ [to stimulate development of incubator or “grow\-on” space for small businesses in locations that encourage businesses to interact with universities and to innovate’](https://re.ukri.org/knowledge-exchange/university-enterprise-zones/). The University Enterprise Zones are still operational, having received an additional £10 million of funding in 2019 \(half of which came from the government and half from Research England\) to fund up to 10 new Zones alongside the 5 initial pilots. 

 Witty \[F\] further recommended increasing HEIF funding to £250m a year: ‘Otherwise we risk failing to provide some of our innovative SMEs – a vital engine of jobs and growth – with the knowledge exchange and support they need.’ The importance of HEIF funding was both discussed in report \[1\] and showcased in Big Innovation Centre meetings and events, including a roundtable hosted by Andersen at the Centre in 2012 and attended by stakeholders including the Director General of Science and Research for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills \[G\]. Based on Witty’s recommendation, HEIF funding has been gradually increased by the government since 2017 to reach £250m in 2020/21. This represents a direct financial impact on universities:  [a 2014 report](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/20090197.pdf) found that a £1 increase in HEFCE income allowed universities to generate an additional £6.30 through knowledge exchange activities. 

 A further impact from report \[1\], via both the Witty review and activities at the Big Innovation Centre can be seen in the weight given to impact in the REF. HEFCE supported the Big Innovation Centre with £40,000 a year of funding in 2012\-13 and their Director of Research, Innovation and Skills – who led the development of the first REF, including its impact elements \- participated in numerous debates and workshops at the Centre during this period. \[1\] discussed the ways in which universities could be encouraged to support academics in business engagement activity, identifying that this activity needed to be afforded institutional value in the same way as teaching and research; it further identified the inclusion of impact criteria in the 2014 REF as presenting a ‘relatively low\-cost opportunity’ to provide this incentive and recommended ‘increasing \[its\] remit’. In line with this suggestion, Witty recommended in his report that the weighting given to impact be increased to 25% in the next REF, a change that has been implemented for REF 2021. 

 <ins> **Building</ins> <ins>the first key performance indicators</ins> <ins>for the Catapult Centres</ins>:** Responding to the 2010 Hauser report, the UK government in 2011 announced its intention to create what would eventually become known as Catapult Centres, a range of high\-tech centres intended to stimulate co\-creation and to encourage innovation in key areas of technology. Andersen was approached by Innovate UK to undertake a major study that would establish key performance indicators for the British centres. Co\-sponsored by the Institute of Engineering and Technology and published as *Catapult to Success* in 2013, Andersen’s research project reviewed examples from similar initiatives across Europe to explore best practice and to define a set of targets against which the Centres’ performance could be measured. 

 The recommendations made in this report were subsequently adopted by Innovate UK in establishing both the funding model and the evaluation framework for Catapult Centres nationwide \[H, p.33\]. The successful implementation of this framework played a key part in the government’s subsequent decision to add an additional £1 billion to their original £200 million investment in the scheme, cementing its place at the heart of the country’s industrial strategy. \(This amount was further augmented by a £500 million investment from the private sector.\) The impact of these centres has been significant. Figures on the Catapult website for the period 2013\-2020 identify 14,750 industry collaborations, 5,108 academic collaborations, 8,332 SMEs supported, over £1.3 billion of research and demonstration facilities under management, and a total of 4,713 people employed at Catapult Centres across the country \[I\]. Further research, also directly commissioned by Innovate UK, on opportunities for Catapult Centres in Europe \[4\] shaped the network’s ongoing investment in and support for European collaborations \[H\]; the success of which is evinced in the 1,218 international projects cited by the Catapult site above.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lubaina Himid, CBE, the 2017 Turner Prize winner and her Making Histories Visible archive of work by Black artists, has significantly transformed the landscape of modern art in Britain and internationally. Himid has supported and mentored young Black female artists and grass\-roots artistic organisations, such as Root\-Ed Zine. She has worked extensively with renowned international and national galleries, such as the Tate, London and the Walker Gallery, Liverpool to influence changes in curatorial practice, identifying the lack of representation of Black artists in their collections and changing gallery acquisition strategies through long\-standing engagement with curators. Himid has generated new ways of thinking between artists, institutions and pioneered innovative ways of engaging the public. Himid’s *Five Conversations* show at the High Line, New York, attracted 8,000,000 people and informed their elementary schools after\-school programme. Himid’s *Our Kisses are Petals* exhibition at the BALTIC Centre of Contemporary Arts, Gateshead featured an extensive public engagement programme, attracting visitors who would not normally engage with gallery spaces and events. Himid’s research has transcended beyond artistic and curatorial circles to engage in wider societal debates on the representation of Black lives in the media, through her residency with *The Guardian* newspaper. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 All the key research that underpins this impact has been developed by Lubaina Himid, artist and curator and others including curator Christine Eyene in Making Histories Visible \(MHV\) over the past twenty years. Throughout her years of practice as an artist and a curator Himid has utilised a network of Black Women Artists who have contributed to the dynamism of MHV and built a unique cultural space that has promoted social inclusion and literally changed the landscape of how Black women’s art is viewed nationally and internationally by curators and opinion formers. As Maria Balshaw, Director of Tate says, this work has given **“visibility to the intersectional contributions of Black women artists to the development of Black art, on the one hand, and British feminist art on the other.”** \[A\] She often works with emerging artists while nurturing diverse, curious and interested audiences. The underpinning research consists of a range of exhibitions of her work and curatorial interventions. The research can usefully be divided into two themes with various research outputs linked to them. 

 <ins> **Making Visible and Challenging Stereotypes**</ins> 

 Himid’s research seeks to explore and address the lack of visibility of the work of Black women visual artists in museum collections and temporary displays of contemporary art in Britain. 

 Crucial to this intervention was her curation of the 2011 Tate Britain show *Thin Black Line\(s\)* \[5\] that displayed the work of pioneer Black Women Artists placing these hitherto marginalised cultural workers at the heart of the establishment \[6\]. Simultaneously, her work explores the ways ideologies that encourage racial stereotyping are perpetuated even in the most liberal of media and promotes a method through the work of challenging this. As part of her 2017 Turner Prize winning exhibition \[1\] Himid displayed *Negative Positives: The Guardian Archive* \(2007\- 2017\). In this work she showed how the history of caricature still infects the body politics of the depiction of Black People in the 21st Century. Himid’s subsequent residency at *The Guardian* newspaper promoted new ways of thinking about the depiction of racialised bodies. This illustrates the real\-world effect of her praxis which culminated in her commission to make a G2 front page for *The Guardian’s* Race and Equality edition in June 2020. 

 <ins> **Enriching the Art Museum Experience Through Collaborative Engagement**</ins> 

 Himid’s interventions come through the unique way in which her own exhibitions challenge curatorial orthodoxies. Himid’s methodology combines roles as artist/curator, mentor/educator, institutional advisor/archivist to engage multiple local artists, educators and the wider public who want to talk to each other through ‘the exhibition’ or the MHV archive and curatorial project. For instance, in MHV, Christine Eyene has worked in parallel with Himid, focusing on African artists in Europe and in the diaspora, foregrounding hitherto marginal voices in a series of exhibitions in Europe and Africa culminating in her directorship of the Casablanca biennale \(2019\). British examples include Himid’s Turner Prize winning exhibition. This showcased the Prize’s aim to invite people to talk about the effects of Britain’s colonial history and its impact upon the everyday life of citizens of colour. Works such as *Swallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service* revealed hidden histories about slavery. Also of note are her touring Arts Council exhibitions. At Spike Island, Bristol \[1\] she initiated a programme featuring young Black British artists in response to her work and at the BALTIC in Gateshead where her work with flags led to a deep engagement with local communities through live performance, poetry and music \[2\]. International exhibitions such as at Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe \[1,3\] encouraged curators to engage local black artists and publics previously unaccounted for by the institution. Himid brought her unique methodology to North America, engaging new publics with her High Line sculptured pieces accompanying the exhibition at the New Museum \[4\]. Overall, museum directors welcome what Balshaw describes as her **“focus on audiences, to better account for wide\-ranging lived experiences”** \[A\] which museums often find difficult to represent.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Himid has had a significant impact on the visibility of Black women artists, on challenging traditional curatorial practice, on innovative public engagement and in making Black histories visible. The Holberg prize winning art historian Griselda Pollock has outlined the significance of Himid’s impact: **“She \[Himid\] has worked ceaselessly as both an artist and a curator, seeking to ensure the visibility of many other Black women artists of her own generation while also supporting emerging Black artists. … She was awarded the prestigious Turner Prize in 2017, a much\-deserved acknowledgment of her extraordinary range as an artist addressing the complex histories of Europe's relation to Africa and African peoples as well as challenging contemporary racism in both art and the media.”** \[B\] 

 <ins> **Inspiring and Supporting Young Black artists**</ins> 

 Himid’s research has helped to inspire and support new forms of artistic expression with young Black artists in the North West of England and beyond and has supported community\-based and grass\-roots artistic forms of expression. Root\-ed is a zine founded by Amber Akaunu and Fauziya Johnson and aims to promote, support, represent and inspire creative people of colour within the North West of England. Himid has supported the zine since its conception by featuring in their first edition \(March 2018\) and using her research profile to help spread the Root\-ed zine 

 message. In July 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, Himid was commissioned to produce a Guardian newspaper G2 cover for the race and equality issue. Proceeds from this commissioned piece went directly to ROOT\-ed zine to help to support emerging young artists of colour. The founders of ROOT\-Ed zine state that: **“Lubaina’s involvement in ROOT\-ed Zine has had a significant and direct impact on our ability to reach large audiences, including young BIPoC artists in the North West. Her continuous support demonstrated to the arts institutions, to other artists, and most importantly to our generation that hope is not lost when you’re a person of colour in the arts.”** \[C\] They also discuss the significant inspirational impact Himid’s 2017 Turner Prize had. It was **“important for us to see a WoC** \[woman of colour\] **as a nominee. Through her artwork we were awakened to the research…it really inspired us personally in our university art development...we do not see artists of colour in museums and galleries. It’s always something to do with a special event – like a Black History Month exhibition, rather than it being a part of a normal exhibition schedule.”** \[C\] Himid’s work has not only had a significant impact on the zine members as artists but has also led to critical conversations with their families and communities on the issues facing Black artists \[B\]. Emerging Black women artists have been inspired too: Joy Labinjo describes the significant and long\-standing impact of Himid’s research on her: **""The influence of the 1980s Black Arts Movement is apparent; Labinjo cites Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid and Claudette Johnson as artists that ‘similarly provide room for black people to breathe and tell their own story, rather than perform a sensational or** **preconceived narrative.’”** \[D\]  The artist Jade Montserrat has discussed the importance of Himid as exemplar and mentor: **“Lubaina…informs the means and shape of my own generation and will continue to do so for a long time to come. Lubaina Himid’s exemplary work ethic and productivity has a significant influence. … Himid's resolution to memorialise and narrate invisible histories, … influences the way I see, read and prioritise the discussion of the Black Atlantic, and African diaspora.”** \[E\] In January 2020, to celebrate 35 years of Himid’s commitment to communal activism and the promotion of new and young Black women artists she brought together pivotal artists from the 1980s with the younger generation of emerging artists in a unique event to make cross\-generational links that had a significant impact in the field. The two\-day conference, *Creative Conversations: Black Women Artists Making and Doing* investigated the links between African diasporan women’s literary and artistic cultures. It culminated in a public event and an ‘in conversation’ between Himid and the Scottish Makar, Jackie Kay \(175\+ attended\). The event brought together Black women artists \(including Marlene Smith and Ingrid Pollard\) with academics and curators \(80 participants\). The director of the Chisenhale Gallery, Zoe Whitley said it succeeded in **“bringing together a multi\- generational cross\-section of visual artists, poets, filmmakers, musicians and writers from across the UK \(as\) a vital step in de\-centring notions of a London\-based British art world”** \[F\]. 

 <ins> **Changing Curatorial Practice: Collaboration with Public Art Venues**</ins> 

 Himid has had a significant impact on the curatorial and collection processes and practices of numerous high\-profile art galleries and has enabled them to adapt to changing cultural values. Himid has collaborated with museum professionals resulting in enhancements to collection polices, interpretation practices and exhibition programmes. As Dr Maria Balshaw CBE, Director of the Tate indicates, Himid has had a significant long\-standing relationship with the Tate that has led to critical impacts relating to curatorial practice. Balshaw goes onto state: **“Lubaina’s presentation of Thin Black Line\(s\) \[2011\] at Tate Britain initiated a sustained curatorial enquiry into the work of Black British women artists from the 1980s onward, that has now had a deep impact on acquisitions and display strategy in this area. Artists such as Ingrid Pollard, Maud Sulter, Sonya Boyce, Chila Kumari Burman, Claudette Johnson, Barbara Walker are all represented in significant ways in the collection and \[the\] museum aims to continue to collect, exhibit, and share work from artists of their generation and their torchbearers. The impact of their artistic, research and teaching practices is understood more profoundly because of the explorations and debates Lubaina’s work fostered.”** \[A\] Balshaw goes on to highlight the continuing impact that Himid has had on governance and strategy at the Tate: **“Beyond this artistic standing, we are particularly grateful to Lubaina for the support that she gives to Tate in developing its strategy and broadening the impact of its work. For a number of years, she has sat as one of two artists on Tate Britain’s Advisory Council. In this role, she advises on a wide range of important issues and activities at Tate Britain, including curatorial, research, learning, visitor experience, diversity and inclusion, communications and the digital. Lubaina brings unique and influential insights to these discussions, complementing the originality and pertinence of her work in the strategic contribution she makes.”** \[A\] In similar interventions, Himid works with the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool to change curatorial practice. Fine Art Curator Charlotte Keenan highlights that before Himid’s *Meticulous Observations* exhibition in 2017 there were only two art works by Black female artists in the collection, one of which was Himid’s own work. 

 Keenan states: “‘Meticulous Observations’ sought to respond to this chasm in the collection. Curated by Lubaina from the Arts Council Collection, it featured work by several Black British women ‘missing’ from the Walker’s collection. A rich dialogue has unfolded between the Walker and the artist \[Himid\] in the ensuing years, finally taking shape in the present projects to develop our collection and stage a linked exhibition, 666: Black Girl Magic. Critical to these conversations has been the opportunity to reflect with Lubaina on the circumstances that have led to the present situation.” \[G\] Curator Charlotte Kennan indicated: “We have long been aware of the need to diversify the Walker’s collection but our discussions with Lubaina Himid have been instrumental in helping us to identify and formulate a concrete direction for us to pursue. … to address what she has described as the ‘double invisibility’ of Black British women, who face discrimination due to their gender and race.” \[G\] Himid’s ongoing working relationship with the Walker Art Gallery has been instrumental in the establishment of an advisory group of artists and museum professionals to enhance heritage preservation and interpretation, as well as to provide a space for research\-led engagement with under\-engaged audiences. Keenan indicates that Himid’s role has been instrumental in identifying the current problems of representation in gallery acquisitions and collections. This collaborative curatorial process has delivered more inclusive curatorial and collection policies. 

 <ins> **Generating New Ways of Thinking: Collaboration between Artists, Audiences,</ins> <ins>Organisations and Experts to improve inclusivity and visibility**</ins> 

 Himid’s praxis consistently leads to interventions that enable new relationships to be forged between galleries and their communities. For example, The High Line, New York, a former elevated rail line that has now be turned into a park, commissioned Himid’s installation *Five Conversations* as part of their 2019\-2020 programme. This featured five reclaimed wooden doors from traditional Georgian townhouses painted with portraits of everyday stylish women. The doors were installed in Gansevoort Woodlands on the park and were viewed by approximately 8,000,000 people **“sparking dialogue among our visitors, neighbors, and colleagues.”** \[H\]. Art Associate Curator Melanie Kress said: **“In her signature way, Himid brought the two\-dimensional medium of painting into our three\-dimensional world.”** \[G\] The huge success of this open\-air public art installation **“was the inspiration for our elementary after\-school program, who studied Himid’s artworks and then made their own portraits painted on doors, mimicking Himid’s style while learning about portraiture and how artists can cross between sculpture and painting.”** \[H\] Himid’s exhibition, *Work from Underneath,* opened at the New Museum, New York in June 2019, as part of a series of exhibitions that feature the works of artists at their first New York museum presentation. 

 **“Himid's exhibition featured a major new sculpture realized for the 4th floor of the New Museum … along with a series of new paintings presented in a total installation.”** \[I\] Director of the New Museum, Massimiliano Gioni stated: **“The exhibition was visited by approximately 50,000 people and gathered significant press coverage from all over the world.”** \[I\] Gioni went on to outline the significance of this exhibition in America noting that: **“In the many reviews, Himid's role in the British Black Arts Movement was often mentioned, which goes to indicate how much curiosity and receptiveness there has been in America for a fundamental and healthy reassessment of the history of contemporary art in the English speaking world and beyond…, the impact of her exhibition was greatly amplified because her work always acts by constantly expanding and questioning the institution of art history and its accepted categories.”** \[I\] Natalie Bell, former Curator at the New Museum highlights a series of public events that ran parallel to the exhibition. This programme featured an ‘In Conversation’ with Himid, two New Perspective Tours, ‘Outside the Box’ and a family orientated event \(approximately 230 attendees\) \[I\]. Himid’s *Our Kisses are Petals* exhibition \(May\-October 2018\) was commissioned by the BALTIC Centre of Contemporary Art, Gateshead as part of the Great Exhibition of the North. The full project, consisted of an exhibition, an embedded local community events programme, Raising the Flag, plus a publicly sited flagpole atop BALTIC’s building. Katie Hickman, curator at the BALTIC states: **“The exhibition received 145,777 visitors. BALTIC had extremely positive feedback on the installation which encouraged our audiences to move the works themselves, rearranging the positioning of the phrases to create their own poems.”** \[J\] The exhibition led to strong and meaningful interactions between the organisations staff and visitors\[J\]. The community events programme **: “included choirs, drumming circles, school children and professional bands. The happenings began outside on BALTIC Square, and gathered large passing audiences, the performers then led visitors into the exhibition, including those who previously may have found barriers to entering a large arts institution. The strength of the informality, generosity and quality of this events programme within such an inviting installation for our audiences, cannot be overstated…It is a project that remains significant in BALTIC’s history and evidences the importance of accessible local community programming and the impact it has in welcoming non\-art specialist audiences, aligning with BALTIC’s values; placing our artists and our local communities at the heart of our organisation.”** \[J\] 

 <ins> **Making Histories Visible; Raising the Profile of Invisible Histories**</ins> 

 The Making Histories Visible \(MHV\) archive is an interdisciplinary visual\-art research project based in the Centre for Contemporary Art \(School of Art, Design and Fashion\) at the University of Central Lancashire. It collates scarce and ephemeral work by Black British artists and has pioneered making this material accessible to as wide an audience as possible. Significantly, the archive holds documents about historical exhibitions which are key to understanding the 1980s Black British Art movement. The archive includes materials that are often overlooked in collections, such as handwritten notes by artists, curators and gallery owners that give unique insights into the activism of these artists and the challenges they’ve faced. The founders of Root\- ed zine have stressed the impact of MHV, stating that: **“the research that Making histories Visible has undertaken has helped us a lot in understanding … methods for connecting with artists and audiences in more innovative and relevant ways. Even just by the way that the archive is accessed is a very connection focused experience that introduced and formed relationships between a handful of artists of all backgrounds, ages and locations.”** \[C\] The presence of the MHV archive enables and inspires artists to **“see their art as activism, as conservation and archiving, and most notably \- as important to keep as it’s valuable.”** \[C\] In 2018, *The Guardian* newspaper \(print readership 2,932,000 per month\), commissioned Himid as an artist in residence, **“a residency which radically changed their editorial and production practice.”** \[B\]. This was a result of her long\-standing use of *Guardian* images in her artistic practice and resulted in her engaging in dialogue with editorial staff to critique the newspaper’s photographic editorial practices \[K\]. This dialogue explored issues of potential bias in editorial decision making and opened up conversations about representation in the newspaper, highlighting that the printed press had an **“extraordinary habit of placing negative text, about something else entirely, next to images of black people”** \[K\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 A UCL team led by Professor Lyn Chitty has transformed patient care for families at risk of genetic diseases. Building on new molecular genetic techniques, the team has developed: \(1\) safer non\-invasive prenatal diagnosis \(NIPD\) based on analysis of cell\-free DNA in maternal plasma; and \(2\) rapid exome sequencing to diagnose genetic conditions in fetuses with unexpected ultrasound abnormalities. Since 2013, NIPD has allowed more than 1,950 pregnant women to avoid amniocentesis, eliminating the associated risk of miscarriage. Rapid exome sequencing requires amniocentesis, but has increased genetic diagnostic yield by 47% already in the first few months of the service. Sequencing test results, available within two weeks, have informed pregnancy management and parental decision\-making. Every pregnant woman in England can now access these tests via the National Genomic Test Directory. 
","
### 1.  Underpinning research 

 Professor Lyn Chitty’s team at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health \(GOS ICH\) has led development and implementation of \(1\) safe non\-invasive prenatal genetic tests for families at known high risk \(family history or relevant ultrasound findings\) and \(2\) rapid genetic sequencing of parental and fetal DNA to diagnose genetic conditions in fetuses with unexpected abnormalities detected during pregnancy. Together, these tests are improving patient management and decision\-making for parents and healthcare teams. 

###  Developing non\-invasive prenatal diagnostic tests based on analysis of cell free DNA in maternal plasma 

 Chitty’s team at GOS ICH was among the first to develop maternal blood tests to detect genetic abnormalities in the unborn fetus and was the first laboratory worldwide to deliver an accredited non\-invasive prenatal diagnosis \(NIPD\) service for monogenic conditions, 

 The tests exploit cell free fetal DNA that circulates in maternal plasma. At first, tests were limited to detection of genetic abnormalities that arose de novo in the fetus \(not inherited from either parent\) or that were inherited from the father. In these circumstances, the mother does not carry the abnormal gene and if it is detected in the plasma it comes from the fetus. The first test to be developed and accredited was for conditions caused by defects in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 gene \( *FGFR3*\), including achondroplasia, the most common short stature syndrome \( **R1**\) **.** 

 The team subsequently extended NIPD to include recessive conditions where, to be affected, the fetus inherits the abnormal gene from both parents. In these cases, the mother’s abnormal gene circulates in her blood. The team used sensitive counting methods to measure the ratio of mutant to normal allele in the maternal plasma, which is slightly higher if the fetus carries two copies of the mutant gene. In 2016 NIPD for the recessive disorders cystic fibrosis \(CF\) \( **R2\)** was approved for clinical use in the NHS. 

 GOSH was the first laboratory to be accredited to deliver the service and uptake has been much higher than for invasive testing \( **R2\)** demonstrating parents’ preference for the safer non\-invasive test. 

 The team also assessed the costs and acceptability of offering NIPD for genetic conditions such as CF and sickle cell disorder. They found that for de novo and paternally inherited conditions, where NIPD molecular techniques are straightforward, NIPD costs less than invasive testing. NIPD for autosomal recessive and X\-linked conditions is technically more complex and currently costs more than invasive testing \( **R3\).** The team found that safety of NIPD is welcomed by parents and uptake is high \( **R2\)**. Early access to testing was also valued as NIPD can be done from 9 weeks gestation, earlier than amniocentesis, with results available in 5 days or less **\(R4\)**. But safety is not the parents’ only concern and some mothers may feel pressured into getting a diagnostic test. The research showed that to promote informed choice, pre\-test counselling should be balanced, not exclusively focused on test safety and be delivered by fetal medicine or genetic health professionals **\(R5\).** 

###  Rapid fetal genomic sequencing for prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders 

 When a pregnant woman’s ultrasound scan picks up structural abnormalities, amniocentesis may be discussed. The UCL team has developed a rapid sequencing test – rapid trio exome sequencing – that sequences DNA from both parents and the fetus, using an analytical pipeline that can deliver the results in two weeks, such that results can be used to inform parental decisions and pregnancy management. The test was initially developed using a cohort of 16 cases with skeletal anomalies. A diagnosis was made in 80% of cases \(80% diagnostic yield\) \( **R6\)**. Subsequently the team were co\-applicants on a nationwide study that found diagnostic yield varied by the type of anomaly, with the highest yield being in fetuses with multiple anomalies, skeletal anomalies or hydrops \( **R7\)**. These studies informed NHSE’s decisions to implement this test and in the first few months of the NHS service there has been a 47% increase in diagnostic yield over standard tests. 

 These complicated tests have significant implications for parents. Throughout the research programme, the team has sought families’ perspectives to ensure the tests meet their needs \(eg **R4 and R5**\), with parent advocates also included as co\-applicants on key grant applications. The team also conducted mixed\-methods research on the delivery of genome sequencing in the 100,000 Genome Project, evaluating informed decision\-making, experiences of testing and receiving results. The work highlights positive attitudes and experiences for parents, families and professionals, but also raised concerns and misunderstandings that can guide implementation of genome sequencing in the NHS Genomic Medicine Service \( **R8\)**.

### 1.  Details of the impact 

 Invasive testing, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, is offered to women where the fetus is at risk of a genetic disorder. These tests usually involve inserting a needle into the womb and carry a small risk of miscarriage, causing psychological stress to women. Further, fetal anomalies occur in around 2% of all pregnancies and many arise from genetic disorders. The inability to diagnose the underlying cause in fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities results in parental anxiety and difficulties in decision making. Research at UCL, to develop non\-invasive genetic tests and rapid prenatal genome sequencing, is transforming patient care by reducing the psychological stress associated with these high\-risk pregnancies, offering safer diagnosis to high\-risk families and improving the diagnosis of genetic conditions in fetuses with abnormalities. Consequently, since 2013, more than 1,950 pregnant women in England have avoided invasive testing and more are now benefiting from timely prenatal genetic diagnosis that is informing pregnancy management and decision\-making. These tests are now included in the National Genomic Test Directory in England’s new Genomic Medicine Service, enabling access for all women who could benefit from these tests. 

###  Increasing patient access to safer, non\-invasive prenatal tests 

 GOSH, with UCL’s GOS ICH, was the first centre in the world to deliver an accredited NIPD service for monogenic conditions. Since 2013, the UCL team has extended the availability of safer prenatal tests for conditions where the pregnancy is at risk of a monogenic disorder, including many very rare conditions and definitive diagnosis for recessive conditions, even when parents carry the same mutation. In 2018 there were approximately 840,000 conceptions in England and Wales and approximately 640,000 live births \(ONS figures\). The tests developed at UCL, are now available through the NHS, to every at\-risk woman in England \( **S1**\). 

 This earlier, safer analysis of maternal plasma to identify fetuses with these abnormal genes is more acceptable to parents who seek testing, as it removes the anxiety and risk of miscarriage, associated with invasive testing \( **S2**\). Since 2013, in the UK, more than 1,950 women at risk for >160 conditions have benefited from these non\-invasive tests. A third of all prenatal molecular diagnostic tests offered by GOSH are now non\-invasive \( **S3**\). 

 The tests are increasing uptake of prenatal diagnosis; approximately 40% of parents said they would undergo invasive prenatal testing for CF, whereas 94% said they would opt for NIPD, including those who had previously declined invasive testing \( **S4**\). The GOS ICH team receives requests for testing from as far afield as Canada and Australia. 

 Implementation of the prenatal diagnostic tests developed at UCL is allowing parents to receive appropriate care, sooner. The director of Antenatal Results and Choices \(ARC\) said, “For parents who carry single gene disorders, every pregnancy is fraught as they face testing to find out whether their baby has inherited the condition. We have supported many such parents and for them the possibility of having NIPD early in their pregnancy rather than undergo invasive testing is of huge benefit. The work you \[Professor Chitty\] have done to make this a reality for a number of conditions makes a real difference to the parent experience. We know that, for some, availability of such testing actually influences their decision to embark on a pregnancy“\( **S5**\). 

 The UCL team has also created a repository of plasma samples collected from parents with pregnancies at risk of chromosomal defects \(aneuploidy\) or genetic conditions \(RAPID biobank\). Since 2013, RAPID has almost doubled in size and now includes over 20,000 parental blood samples. This provides a valuable resource for service development at GOSH, across the UK, and for quality assurance schemes. The National Laboratory and Scientific Lead \(Genomics Unit\) for NHS England & NHS Improvement said, “The UK National External Quality Assessment Service \(UK NEQAS\) for Molecular Genetics runs an external quality assurance scheme for laboratories worldwide for fetal sexing, common aneuploidies and most recently common microdeletions. The RAPID biobank was instrumental in supporting the development, and now annual delivery of this international programme and has thus played a key role in ensuring the quality of cell free fetal DNA testing globally.” \( **S6**\). 

###  Providing rapid diagnostic testing through rapid fetal exome sequencing 

 Having an accurate diagnosis during pregnancy supports decision making and facilitates improved clinical management. Difficult decisions about continuing or terminating a pregnancy can be made with more certainty and inform pregnancy and early neonatal management to improve long\-term outcomes. 

 One healthcare professional said, “In the last 12 months, you and your team have provided timely diagnostic information in several complex prenatal cases which has been truly transformational.  We can only hope that this standard of care can become standard practice, nationally and internationally in not\-too\-distant future”. Another clinician said, “Being able to offer couples genomic testing to help make a diagnosis empowers them to take a decision about their pregnancy with much clearer information than from scans alone”. Prospective parents who had been given the results of tests felt that testing made “a very difficult decision much easier as they knew the prognosis for the baby would be very poor. Having this information for the decision helped them emotionally deal with it and with their recovery. They were extremely grateful for the service.” \( **S7**\). 

 Rapid fetal exome sequencing was launched in 2020 as an accredited service at GOSH and is increasing the number of families receiving an accurate diagnosis for the abnormality identified in their unborn child. The team’s research has also influenced national guidance for this new service. Approximately 2200 families a year can now access the service, with better information, pregnancy management and improved outcomes \( **S8**\). 

 **Raising public awareness of non\-invasive prenatal diagnosis and the importance of genome sequencing** 

 The UCL team engaged the public through the media, publications and discussion groups to gauge parental and societal opinion. Chitty regularly delivers lectures to lay society annual meetings for organisations such as Antenatal Results and Choices \(ARC\) and the Brittle Bones Society. The team has developed an animation for young people describing whole genome sequencing that was evaluated with 554 school pupils \(11\-15 years\) and shown to increase objective knowledge scores. Interviews with 12 young people and 14 parents offered genome sequencing found positive views and feelings of empowerment to take an active role in decision making \( **S9**\). These animations are widely available on public websites including Genomics England \( **S10**\) and have been translated into Turkish, Chinese and Bengali. The animation has received almost 30,000 views on YouTube and when uploaded on Sina Weibo \(Chinese Twitter\), it received a further 136,800 views in one week. 

 **NHS implementation** 

 Chitty has advised NHS England Rare Disease Working Group on the implementation of these tests and through extensive engagement with patients, the public, health professionals and commissioners this multidisciplinary research programme has led to inclusion of the tests in the new NHS National Genomic Test Directory \( **S1**\). The NHS now funds NIPD and rapid fetal sequencing as part of the new national Genomic Medicine Service, making the tests available to all women across England.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research has had a substantial impact on developing and implementing equine surface testing protocols and terminology for the Fédération Equestre Internationale \(FEI\). These testing protocols have been used to certify Olympic Games surfaces at Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo and are currently being developed into international standards. Our work is being disseminated globally via media outlets, professional governing bodies, pro\-riders and fellow equine educators, which is transforming awareness of equine surfaces and their underlying research evidence base. The impact of our research with multiple collaborators is far reaching, from using Hobbs’ methods to investigate ‘Usan telmen’ gait in Mongolia, through enhancing the breeding industry in Sweden, to educating dressage judges in the USA.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Equestrian sports research at the University of Central Lancashire was initiated in 2001 by Hobbs, who continues to lead this area of research today with support from a Research Associate, a number of other non\-equine staff who have complementary skills and many external collaborators. The team have led 12 bids and supported one funded bid and consultancy projects. The focus of the University of Central Lancashire’s equine research has been in three key areas: advancing knowledge of equestrian surface function and dysfunction, developing robust methods of equine locomotion analysis, and quantifying the functional demands of equine sports’ performance for the horse and rider. 

 Assessment of equestrian sports’ surface performance began at the University of Central Lancashire with studies involving the hoof\-surface interaction. Initial findings suggested that: moisture substitutes, such as wax, alter grip characteristics, surface preparation can alter locomotion patterns, and banking a turn allows the horse to remain more perpendicular to the surface, which reduces the asymmetry between inside and outside limbs at faster gaits \[1\]. Surface functional properties influence gait, but appropriate standard methods of measurement were not available for equestrian arenas in 2010. With this in mind, Hobbs directed a number of projects to validate equipment and procedures for measuring and monitoring equestrian competition surfaces, from initial design through to installation and maintenance \[2, 3\]. Following on from this, Hobbs developed some of the complex objective measures that were compared to existing subjective evaluations \[4\]. This study formed the foundation for the development of appropriate measurements and measurement thresholds for show jumping competition surfaces. 

 In order to quantify the functional demands of equine sports performance for the horse and rider, Hobbs developed a long\-standing collaborative relationship with Prof. Hilary Clayton \(Michigan State University\). Together they have developed three\-dimensional full\-body models of the horse that have allowed them to investigate aspects of locomotion and balance when performing different gaits and movements \[5\]. They have also developed advanced methods of studying multi\-dimensional time continuous data to improve knowledge and understanding of the nuances of equine conformation and motion \[6\].  The methods developed in \[6\] aimed to create simplified visual images of limb function from complex numerical data that veterinarians, farriers and other practitioners could easily interpret. The focus of this body of work has been firstly to quantify the demands of high\-level movements for elite dressage horses \[5\] with complex movement, including *piaffe* which is currently under investigation. Secondly, to observe and measure asymmetric hoof growth and quantify the extent of locomotor asymmetry \[6\]. Asymmetric sports horses and racehorses are commonly found in the population and horses with asymmetric feet are associated with shortened competition careers. Quantifying the consequences of morphological and/or physiological differences, alongside discipline\-specific demands for competitive horses, will likely reduce injury risks as the evidence is more widely disseminated. It will also improve selection criteria for equine athletes, leading to increased welfare and career longevity.

 <ins> **Development of a framework for FEI certification**</ins> 

 Following the London 2012 Olympics, the Fédération Equestre Internationale \(FEI\), the world governing body for equestrian sports, initiated a footing project to continue the scientific work on surfaces that evolved from the games. Soon after, Hobbs was asked to take the lead in writing a white paper \[A\], based on her research \[1\]. For Hobbs this became a two\-year project, as her vision for the paper was to provide a comprehensive resource for the equestrian community by combining current scientific knowledge with a framework from which surface standards could be developed. Together with an extensive review of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence welfare and performance \[1\], the white paper also included a review of existing and new surface testing methods \[2\], engineering definitions applied to surface testing, a certification framework and layman’s surface terminology for a new industry standard. The development of layman’s terms to describe the functional properties of surfaces was an important step towards certification, as scientific \(objective\) measurements could then be directly applied to layman’s terms, which provided a universal language of communication \[B\]. In 2014, the FEI made the white paper freely available to the worldwide equestrian community as a reference and educational source. Examples of its reach and influence can be found globally \(i.e. Canada, USA, Australia\) to include over 40 independent articles that discuss and critique the information, concepts and proposed framework. For example, Norton \(2015\) concluded for *Horse Sport* magazine that: 

 **‘The Equine Surfaces White Paper discussed a great number of aspects that must be considered when discussing optimal footing. However, there are such large gaps in our knowledge that specific recommendations for each discipline can’t be made at this time. The authors hope by educating trainers and riders as to how surface conditions affect the biomechanical performance of our horses, injuries can be prevented.**’ *\[C\]* 

 <ins> **Producing protocols for the certification process**</ins> 

 The FEI began a consultation process with industry following the launch of the white paper, with Hobbs as one of the main scientific advisors \[D\]. To progress the development of protocols, one study focused on defining acceptable thresholds for field based, objective measurements of show jumping competition surfaces \[4\], whilst other studies \[2, 3\] were used to inform the inclusion of laboratory\-based tests and the development of surface maintenance procedures. The scientific work in \[4\] also raised awareness of surface terminology and function in the 198 riders taking part in nine elite competitions at six European venues. In 2016\-17 Hobbs and St George were commissioned by the FEI to develop a complete set of protocols for surface certification. The protocols were underpinned by the scientific work and comprised of 38 separate documents in total. The in\-situ protocols were piloted at the Olympic Games and the World Equestrian Games \(WEG\) \(France, Brazil and USA\). The materials and track\-in\-a\-box protocols that were developed were used in the selection process for the tenders submitted for the Tokyo Olympic surface. The in\-situ protocols were used at the Tokyo test event and will be used at the Olympic Games in 2021 \[D\]. The in\-situ protocol has recently been adapted for an American Society for Testing and Materials \(ASTM\) standard \(F3400\-19\) and the suite of materials, track\-in\-a\-box and certification protocols are currently under consideration by voting members of the ASTM. The benefits of measuring surfaces to a defined standard for events, horses and riders was highlighted at Tryon, USA \(WEG 2018\). Prior to the WEG, three horses fell during competition in the main arena \[E\]. After extensive testing, a new main arena and surface were proposed and used for the games, which was hailed as a huge success. Implementation of the certification process on a wider scale was agreed by the Footing Standards Working Group in April 2019 \[D\]. They proposed that all 5\* competitions \(Approximately 90 worldwide/year\) should have in\-situ surface certification at the start of each competition. This recommendation is awaiting FEI approval by the Jumping Committee and the General Assembly and will result in a rule change if approved. In addition, the Working Group recommended that surface providers are given the opportunity to have their products FEI certified using the materials testing and track\-in\-a\-box testing protocols. Surface evaluation using functional properties terminology is also embedded into the new FEI Event Classification system \[D\] that is designed to ensure that standards are maintained at all FEI competitions. Test results and surface evaluations are already influencing perception of acceptable surfaces and of maintenance practices, with practitioners more commonly favouring softer, well cushioned surfaces. Ultimately, this will reduce injury risk for the horse, as hard surfaces are a contributory factor in the development of overuse injuries \(2\). 

 <ins> **Increasing awareness of factors that influence horse health, welfare and performance**</ins> 

 Increasing awareness of intrinsic and extrinsic factors beyond the white paper that can impact on the health and performance of horses is also a key driver for the University of Central Lancashire’s equine research team. In order to increase the reach of our work, a day of workshops were produced so that the footage and presentations could be used as part of the launch of the FEI Campus, a free educational website, targeted towards the international equestrian community \[F\]. The FEI Campus was launched in 2017 and by March 2018 it had already attracted 15,541 visitors \(3,117 registered members\) worldwide who had engaged with the learning materials which included all four presentations from the workshops \[F\]. The University of Central Lancashire’s contribution included research work on asymmetry \[6\] and balance \[5\] in horses and further dissemination of the proposed equipment and techniques to be used for equestrian surface certification \[A\]\[2\]. A key element of embedding new knowledge that will benefit horse welfare is through our work with scientific practitioners.  Hobbs supervised the doctoral research of Dr Simon Curtis, Fellow of the Worshipful Company of Farriers. Since successfully graduating, Curtis has visited 15 different countries in Europe, North and South America, Australasia and Asia to date, to present the work to over 2000 farriers, vets and breeders. The research includes techniques developed in \[6\] on asymmetric hoof growth, foot balance, loading patterns and hoof distortion. 

 In March 2018, Curtis was acknowledged for his efforts, receiving the Colin Spedding Award from HRH Princess Anne at the National Equine Forum. The impact of his work in influencing practice was captured in a survey in 2018 \[G\], showing that his dissemination of the research had reached practitioners from every continent. From the survey, 95.7% of 516 respondents reported that Curtis’ research has positively influenced their knowledge, skills development and/ or practice within the equine industry. An example of the impact of his research is illustrated by this quote from the Programme Manager of BYS Farrier School in Sweden. 

 **‘Simon's study means a lot to our development work on hoof care, correction of foals and various working methods within the hoof care sector in Sweden. His thesis is also of great importance for our future breeding work.’ \[G\].** 

 Educating students and practitioners on aspects of equine locomotion and their demands on the musculoskeletal system of the horse from our research findings \[1, 2, 5, 6\] is a priority for the research team. Along with the workshops and seminars given by the research team, Hobbs’ collaborator Hilary Clayton \(Michigan State University\), a scientist, vet, dressage trainer and Grand Prix rider also disseminates our collaborative research \[5\] to the equestrian community to aid improvements in training practice \[H\]. This includes an annual presentation to judges at the US Dressage Federation Convention and many workshops and training sessions worldwide. Our research is embedded in equine science course curriculums at a local, national and international level \[I\] providing enhanced knowledge and understanding to current and future equine practitioners. Our methods of calculating moments around the centre of mass and then using them to investigate balance and locomotion \[5\] also has reach beyond the gaits performed by sports horses. A member of the Mongolian ambling horse federation remarked on using these techniques to investigate the ‘Usan telmen’ gait: 

 **‘I truly inspired by your work which the techniques that used in these studies and logic explanations, result are sufficient to understand and explore the behavior of other gaits too.’ \[I\]** 

 One of the keys to reaching stakeholders globally is using gold open access journals, which Hobbs and Clayton have prioritised wherever possible \[5, 6\]. This allows further dissemination to occur through lay article reviews and helps to spread important messages originating from the scientific work as widely as possible, such as the messages in \[5\] highlighted by *HorseTalk*, New Zealand: 

 **‘Given the complexities involved, it is not surprising that some horses fail to learn the biomechanical skills necessary for passage….Researchers Hilary Clayton and Sarah Jane Hobbs… writing in the journal PeerJ, said the slow speed of passage challenged the horse’s ability to control the sagittal\-plane moments around the center of mass.’ \[H\].** 

 Awareness of equine surface testing and surface standards for show jumping competitions has already made an impression on equestrian practitioners within the sport of eventing. Eventing is primarily performed on turf surfaces, which can vary considerably in their functional properties. Course designers, organisers, riders and other practitioners within eventing have recognised the benefits in having a quantifiable description of the ‘going’ prior to an event, particularly for the cross\-country phase \[J\]. Cross\-country courses are undulating and up to approximately 6.8 km in length, which limits the possibility of using identical equipment and methods to those used in show jumping competitions at all but the highest level. As such, Hobbs and Graydon, together with ex\-junior team British Eventing \(BE\) veterinarian Mark Lucey, and colleagues from Nottingham Trent University, tested 26 affiliated BE courses with a range of surface measuring devices over the 2019 eventing season in the UK. The results from this initial work are driving the establishment of standard methods and equipment for measuring cross country turf surfaces in the future. This work has already been highly praised by stakeholders, such as Philip Herbert \(accredited BE course designer\): 

 **‘Thank you and all of your team for this most comprehensive report. I am most impressed with the trouble you have gone to and the amount of data you have recorded. You will be most welcome to come to Burghley, at any time in the future and if you require any assistance from me, in my capacity as BE Ground Condition Adviser, do please get in touch. I wish you every success with this process in the future, I am sure it will be a valuable asset to equestrian sport.’ \[J\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into experiential learning at Southampton Business School found that positive solution\-based news stories are more effective than catastrophic stories or cautionary tales at inspiring ethical/sustainable behaviour and mindsets. This research has had impacts in the news sector, raising public awareness of the adverse effect of the dominance of negative news and supporting the design of high\-profile initiatives by leading media organisations \(including BBC and The Guardian\) that have engaged several million people in a more constructive, solutions\-focused approach to journalism. The research has informed the content of ‘constructive journalism’ training in the UK and Europe. Sustained media engagement by Professor Denise Baden resulted in the research inspiring a best\-selling book on news and mental health; supporting the evidence base for a constructive journalism project within the voluntary sector; and shaping a new approach to criminal justice reporting in England and Wales. The work also informed the design of projects that encourage writers to create positive visions of what a sustainable society might look like, in response to the climate crisis. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development published a commitment to embed ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability in business education curricula. 

 Beginning in 2013, research by Baden set out to explore the most effective way to elicit a more ethical and sustainable mindset among students. An initial study drawing on learning and social psychology theories, posited that pedagogical methods exposing students to businesses that operated in an ethical manner would encourage them to follow their lead. Baden found that the opportunity to work with social entrepreneurs or ‘responsible’ business professionals provided students with inspirational role models and positive learning opportunities \[ **3.1**\]. 

 Baden explored positive role models further through a study involving 96 undergraduates in business ethics at Southampton Business School. One group was exposed to positive role models of ethical leaders; the other was exposed to cautionary tales of business scandals. Halfway through the module, the classes were switched. The students were asked to reflect on their differing responses. Baden found that exposing students to positive role models elicited beliefs that business can be both ethical and successful, while stories of scandals had the opposite effect. Drawing on Ajzen’s theory of planned behaviour, it was argued that negative depictions of business can lead to less ethical behaviour and perpetuate descriptive norms of business as typically unethical, as cynicism correlated with less ethical intentions. Some students commented that the media’s focus on scandals had damaged their faith in business, and that positive role models were not sufficiently publicised \[ **3.2**\]. 

 This inspired Baden to explore the effects of exposing 259 undergraduate students to positive and negative versions of similar news stories. Negative stories included the war in Syria and coral reef destruction. Positive stories included peace talks with Iran and oceans becoming cleaner. She found that positive news gave rise to significantly higher motivation to take positive actions, such as adopting pro\-environment practices. Conversely, the more anxious or pessimistic the stories made participants feel, the less motivated they were to act \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. Baden interviewed news editors and journalists and found relatively little awareness of the consequences of the negative bias in the news. However, some did recognise that negative bias can create feelings of disengagement and powerlessness, and that a backlash against positive news as being fluffy or propaganda had gone too far \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. 

 In a further study run with Karen McIntyre at Virginia Commonwealth University \(US\), 480 US participants were exposed to the same news story that had been manipulated to elicit positive, neutral or negative emotions. Findings revealed that catastrophe\-framed stories reduced intentions to act to address issues. Solution\-based stories resulted in greater intentions to take positive action and were still perceived as legitimate journalism \[ **3.4**\]. Baden applied this concept to the challenge of communicating climate change in a way that engages the wider public in pro\-environmental behaviours. She analysed readers’ differing responses to climate\-related short stories focused on solutions or catastrophes. Results indicated that stories with an emphasis on solutions were more effective in motivating pro\-environmental intentions. Being able to identify with a positive role model, whose pro\-environmental behaviours are easily imitable, was seen as inspirational, thus reaffirming findings from the earlier business education studies. Many reported feelings of futility and low self\-efficacy when reading ‘catastrophic’ stories \[ **3.5**, **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Influencing news sector initiatives that seek to ‘combat apathy and inspire people’** 

 Having found, through her analysis of students’ reflections, that positive news can be a significantly more effective motivator in spurring people into action, Baden communicated her research outcomes in ‘The Conversation’ in March 2015. It received 8,883 reads \(as at 31/12/2020\), was republished in a Hungarian newspaper, and attracted direct attention of journalists, leading ultimately to the adoption of more constructive journalism approaches by the Guardian and the BBC \[ **5.1**\]. The Guardian confirms that Baden’s research was one of the reasons it launched a new project *Half Full* in June 2016. According to an article by its head of special projects, the project sought to establish a ‘middle ground’ through ‘constructive journalism, focused on solutions and answers, but not necessarily endorsing them’. It continued: ‘If we publish more examples of people trying to do inspiring things, perhaps it can inspire us all to make our world a little better.’ 

 The editor later wrote to Baden: 

 *“The work you have done – particularly your papers and original research into the damaging effects of negative news – made a real impact on senior leaders in our newsroom at a time when we were discussing how to combat apathy and inspire people … Your research became a real talking point among editors keen to change up our news mix – particularly the key findings of your research that positive news stories are more likely to spur people into actions to make the world a better place and negative news can lead to despair and helpless apathy*.” \[ **5.2**\] 

 The Half Full project evolved into The Guardian’s *The Upside* initiative, launched in February 2018, which ‘comprises journalism that focuses on our capacity to act together to make positive change’. While readership figures are confidential, the Guardian editor said: “ *I could say anecdotally that other departments \(at The Guardian\) have launched their own series of 'constructive journalism', having seen how well the Upside has been received”.* 

 The BBC’s head of special projects also confirmed that Baden’s research helped inform her approach to setting up the Solutions\-Focused Journalism initiative, which she launched in August 2016 to ‘help colleagues think about how they might broaden their understanding of what news is to also include a focus on solutions’. This included delivering workshops and developing resources for BBC staff and working with BBC Academy to incorporate the approach in their journalism training. This has been a successful approach for the BBC, reflected in audience engagement with its solutions\-focused journalism season *Crossing Divides*, a series that sought solutions to ‘a fragmented world’ and aimed to uncover ‘stories of how different individuals and communities are coming together across these lines to engage with one another, building on part of the BBC’s public purpose to contribute to social cohesion’. The series generated 30,000,000 page views online and over 27,000,000 views on social media \[ **5.3**\]. 

 An article on journalism.co.uk in March 2019 quoted a senior BBC editor as saying that reaching larger numbers of younger people had ‘been made simpler by the clever combination of solutions journalism and social media feeds’, referring to a BBC video story on Norway’s plastic waste solution that totalled more than 70,000,000 views, 50,000 comments and 239,000 Facebook shares \- one of their most successful videos in 2018 \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **Informing constructive journalism training at colleges in UK and internationally** 

 Baden was awarded GBP10,000 from the University’s ESRC Impact Acceleration Account to work with the Constructive Journalism Project to deliver 23 workshops to around 800 people \(students\) at journalism colleges and to media professionals in newsrooms in the UK, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the US in 2015\-2016. Baden’s research findings were a key component of the workshops that were designed to help participants develop a more balanced approach to news reporting. The Constructive Journalism Project was co\-founded by Sean Dagan Wood, who is also the publisher of *Positive News*, which describes itself as ‘the first media organisation in the world that is dedicated to quality, independent reporting about what’s going right’. He commented that the workshops had ‘been successful in raising the profile of constructive journalism over the past year and showing young journalists that there are other options outside of the existing culture of mainstream media’. \[ **5.5**\] 

 From 503 feedback reports received across the 23 workshops, 92% strongly agreed or agreed the workshop had raised their awareness of constructive journalism; 90% strongly agreed or agreed they were better able to balance their news reporting; 80% strongly agreed or agreed their awareness of ethical issues had increased; 85% strongly agreed or agreed they had increased their knowledge; 88% strongly agreed or agreed the issues raised in the workshop were easy to understand \[ **5.6**\]. Individual responses, reported in an article in Positive News \[ **5.5**\], included a journalism student at Glasgow Caledonian University, who said the course *“rejuvenated my desire to do this job”*, while a journalist who attended a session at Der Spiegel’s Reporter Forum in Hamburg said: *“I’m tired of writing and filming bad news and people who, when you look closely, have nothing new to say: ‘the world is evil, everything is getting worse, and we can’t do anything about it’. Constructive journalism can change this\!”* The workshop contributed to the introduction of constructive journalism modules to courses at University of Strathclyde, which in turn resulted in the launch, in 2018, of the student\-led *Constructive News Scotland* and, in 2019, the *Glasgow Sloth*, which was nominated for the Scottish Student Journalism Awards. It helped inform a new constructive journalism module for the undergraduate course at University of Central Lancashire, with the course leader describing the workshop as “very practical and inspiring” \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Baden’s research has also influenced training delivered by the Constructive Voices project, run by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations \(NCVO\), which represents the interests of the voluntary sector. The initiative ‘flags up solutions\-based stories sourced primarily from charities and social enterprises – and works with journalists to ensure those stories are heard’. The editor of Constructive Voices confirms the impact the research has had on the project: “ *As the editor of NCVO’s Constructive Voices project, my role involves delivering talks about constructive journalism to journalism students. Your research forms a vital part of my presentations. I also cite your work on the NCVO website in my express guide to constructive journalism and have links to it on our webpages for journalists and charities whom I connect with in order to encourage media coverage of solutions\-focussed stories.*” \[ **5.8**\] 

 The managing director of the French NGO *Reporters d’Espoirs* reports that he cited Baden’s research in several training courses run in France, for example in Lille, Paris and Toulouse, reaching over 100 people \(students\). Baden’s work was also cited in a book on solutions journalism that Reporters d’Espoirs published \(in French\) in January 2020 \[ **5.9**\]. 

 **Stimulating public debate to raise awareness of solutions\-focused journalism** 

 Baden’s research received sustained media coverage between 2015 and 2019 \[ **5.10**\]. She was interviewed for a BBC Radio 4 documentary *Good News Is No News*, in which former news editor Charlie Beckett asked why solutions\-based ideas for news tend to be dismissed by the media. Baden’s 2015 article in The Conversation has been cited on the Constructive Journalism, Positive News and NCVO’s Constructive Voices websites, and in the Huffington Post. Baden was interviewed on LBC radio’s morning show in July 2016 about the effects of overly negative news. And in October 2016 she was on a panel of three experts, alongside a BBC editor and a BBC presenter, at a public event called Hubbub of News in London, organised by a group of scientists, artists, broadcasters and public health experts who were based at the Wellcome Collection. The event was recorded and published as an online podcast. Baden was also one of five panellists on a Guardian podcast *We need to talk about … the power of positive news coverage*, published online in July 2018 for the Guardian’s 134,567 podcast subscribers. Baden’s paper in Journalism Studies \[ **3.5**\] featured prominently in the Guardian’s *The Upside* column of recommended reads in October 2018, with the headline ‘Reading this article could seriously improve your health’ referring to the research. The paper was also cited in a further Guardian piece in January 2019. Altmetrics data show the paper’s attention score is in the top 5% of outputs. 

 The Journalism Studies paper \[ **3.5**\] led directly to an invitation in June 2019 from the director of the Criminal Justice Alliance \(CJA\), a coalition of more than 90 organisations committed to improving the criminal justice system, for Baden to help reshape new criteria for its Media Awards. Baden was also asked to participate in an expert group tasked with developing good practice criteria for criminal justice reporting by ‘drawing on constructive journalism’. The CJA director wrote: *“Denise’s research in particular led to criteria 6 \(‘influence and inspire people to think differently, care about the issue and take positive action’\) and in turn the rest of the criteria. For example, it helped us to understand that showing solutions and what works \(criteria 1\) and reducing negativity \(criteria 3\) is more likely to inspire people to care about the issue and take positive action.”* \[ **5.11**\] 

 Jodie Jackson, author of a book on the impact of the news cycle on mental health called *You Are What You Read*, said Baden’s research inspired her work \[ **5.12**\]. Published in April 2019, the book was the number one best seller in Amazon’s media studies category and had an average rating of 4/5 from 87 global ratings. 

 While Baden’s research is one part of a wider constructive journalism movement, there is clear evidence that the concept has resonated within the media industry and beyond. In addition to the initiatives by media organisations, a 2018 journalism.co.uk article reporting on its own Newsrewired panel event said: *“Constructive journalism is experiencing a rise in engagement from both the public and the press, driven by a need for solutions to consumer news fatigue or outright rejection.”* The NCVO said its Constructive Voices project had engaged 200 charities, social enterprises and community interest companies, and secured extensive coverage across multiple BBC channels \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **Encouraging climate action through environmental storytelling** 

 Baden’s research into ways to inspire pro\-environmental behaviours through stories resulted in Baden launching the Green Stories writing competition in early 2018 \[ **5.13**\]. It aims to engage the public in creating positive visions of a sustainable society via creative projects, including writing, film and stage plays. The Guardian’s *The Upside* and BBC’s *Writers Room* recommended the project to their readers. Short stories from the first writing competition were published in an anthology ‘Resurrection Trust’ with a foreword from Caroline Lucas MP and review by environmentalist and writer Jonathon Porritt: “Most people find it very difficult indeed to imagine what ‘living sustainably’ might really mean – and neither dry facts nor hypothetical scenarios seem to help very much\! The Editors of Resurrection Trust have set out to address that challenge through the power of the short story, with as diverse, surprising and hugely enjoyable a collection of entries as one might expect from an open competition of this kind.” 

 Royalties from over 100 sales were put towards prizes for future competitions. In 2019/2020, further competitions \(novel, stage, play, radio play, interactive fiction, tv series, flash fiction, screenplay\) were run to solicit positive visions of what a sustainable society might look, which received 1094 entries \(as at 31/12/20\). Numerous production companies \(Red Production, Whistledown Productions, Planet Zero, BBC Writer’s Room\) and literary agencies \(The Literary Consultancy, Daniel Goldsmith, Redhammer Literary Agents\) support the project, agreeing to read and consider work from competition finalists. 

 Entrants and others involved \(e.g. judges\) were asked to give their feedback on any impact staking part had on them. Of 250 feedback respondents, including 219 writers, 83% said they had made use of information in the Green Stories website which lists transformative sustainable solutions. 89% agreed that participation increased their writing skills; 89% agreed it had increased knowledge; 80% agreed that it increased awareness of green policies; 81% agreed that it enabled deeper understanding of environmental issues and policies; 56% agreed that it affected what policies they would support; 74% agreed that it increased their engagement in pro\-environmental behaviours; 80% agreed it made them more optimistic about the future and 84% agreed participation inspired them to be more pro\-active about green issues. Qualitative data are available, and an example extract is: “ *through this process I have evaluated our actions further and we have in my firm decided to alter our sustainability policies further.*” \[ **5.13**\] 

 The research has also informed the Global Action Plan’s ‘Flickers for the Future’ competition, that calls on young filmmakers to tell a different story – one where humans and planet thrive together. Baden has been invited to serve as a member of the expert panel. As a result, her research and experience has informed the design of the competition and associated workshops \[ **5.14**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by the National HIPIMS Technology Centre at Sheffield Hallam University \(SHU\) has driven innovation and created value across the supply chain, achieving market\-leading performance for applications in consumer electronics, manufacturing, and biomedical implants. New HIPIMS technologies have generated revenue in excess of GBP124,000,000 for coatings systems/equipment manufacturers and cutting tool businesses. The research has led to changes in manufacturing practice at Ionbond UK, the largest HIPIMS manufacturing facility in the UK, safeguarding 12 jobs, generating around GBP1,200,000 in new business and substantially increasing productivity. The application of HIPIMS technology has vastly improved performance and longevity for medical implants and the licencing of HIPIMS to Zimmer Biomet has created 8 new jobs in the UK and USA. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professors Ehiasarian and Hovsepian and their group at SHU have led the development of High\-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering \(HIPIMS\), which has become an industrially important physical vapour deposition \(PVD\) method of applying coatings using high current plasma glow discharges which generate an ionised vapour that is free of macro\-particles. 

 Surface pre\-treatments and nano\-scale coatings based on SHU’s HIPIMS advances have fulfilled long\-standing needs of industry for high\-density and better adhesion and enabled end\-users to improve coating performance, durability, and reliability of their products. 

 Since the original work at SHU which pioneered HIPIMS as a novel branch of PVD, the research has continued to make key contributions to the understanding and implementation of HIPIMS through an ongoing programme of collaborative experimental research. Sheffield Hallam has collaborated with industrial partners and more than 15 research groups across the world, including *Fraunhofer IST*, *Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory*, *CERN*, *Rutherford Appleton Laboratory*, *Zimmer Biomet*, and *Gillette*. 

 A specific innovation that resulted from the research was a breakthrough for achieving “fully\-dense” coatings \[ **R1,R2,R3,R4**\] through application of kWcm<sup>\-2</sup> power densities. This methodology proved capable of eliminating the intergranular pores and macro\-defects which had previously led to coating failures associated with production by conventional PVD technologies. Research has focussed on three areas: 

####  1. Investigation into the design of plasma generators to produce HIPIMS discharges 

 The first area relates to an investigation into how HIPIMS might be transformed into a commercial coating production process, which is dependable, controllable, and predictable. The research established the principles of HIPIMS plasmas and applied them to the upscaling of the hardware and coating technology for industrial production. Ehiasarian’s group collaborated with *Trumpf Hüttinger* *\(TH\)* to investigate the temporal development of the discharge and used it to co\-develop the first industrial scale commercial grade HIPIMS generator with MW pulse capability \[ **R5**\]. This led to the world's first large scale experimental HIPIMS tests at SHU in 2003. In 2007, the group’s HIPIMS research facilities were upgraded to include an industrial production\-grade automated deposition system, unique within the university sector. 

 This enabled the industrial applicability of HIPIMS innovations which proved to be critical in realising technology transfer to the manufacturing sector through collaborative research. Investigation of the electron\-collision ionisation mechanisms \[ **R3**\] and discovering plasma self\-organisation led to research outputs underpinning a second\-generation product with *TH* , the *HighPulse 4000 \(G2*\) in 2016, with precision\-controlled power delivery. Research focussed on the stable deposition of materials for applications such as touch\-screen displays, transparent thin film transistors, architectural glass, and semiconductor manufacturing. 

####  2. Development of systems to apply the coatings 

 Ehiasarian and Hovsepian’s research at Sheffield Hallam developed systems and technologies for HIPIMS deposition which was scalable beyond the research laboratory. An efficient plasma\-etching and substrate pre\-treatment method, patented in 2006 \[ **R1**\], revealed local epitaxial coating growth on steel substrates and accounted for enhanced adhesion. Strong adhesion is a critical requirement for all coatings exposed to mechanical, thermal, and oxidative stress such as cutting tools, power generation, jet propulsion turbines, and automotive bearings/engine components. Ehiasarian’s research into the confinement of the \(ionised\) deposition flux led to patenting a high deposition rate HIPIMS source \(GB0608582A, applied 02.05.2006\) and a substrate bias power supply \(GB2437080B, granted 12.10.2011\). This research delivered previously unobtainable coating coverage of through\-silicon vias \(aspect ratio 30:1\) realised using appropriate ionisation conditions \[ **R4**\]. Industrial research with *Evatec* \(between 2008\-2010\) developed HIPIMS technology for through\-silicon via \(TSV\) interconnects of next generation miniaturised 3D\-Integrated microelectronics devices. Research via an Innovate UK project \(132366\) with *Ionbond* in 2017/2018 created the first digital twin of the HIPIMS process, and elevated Quality Assurance to high\-value manufacturing standards. 

####  3. Research into the formulation of nanolayer coatings for specific applications 

 The third aspect relates to Hovsepian’s group’s research into nanoscale multilayer coatings \(nanolayers\) produced by HIPIMS, where synergistic combinations of materials were tailored to withstand demanding environments. CrN/NbN combined wear and corrosion\-resistant materials in a nanolayer stack to enable superhardening and were densified to achieve a material suitable for use in orthopaedic implants enhancing fatigue resistance and mitigating metal sensitivity. This work was applied through collaboration with *Zimmer Biomet* spanning 2005\-2020, with the coating performance confirmed in independent testing in a total hip replacement ram model at the Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science at University College London \[ **R6**\]. 

 TiAlCN/VCN and CrAlCN/CrBCN materials were investigated for use in cutting tools via a methodology that employed architecture gradation from nanolayer to nanocomposite where a carbon matrix reduced reactions with the workpiece. This research was undertaken in collaboration with *Sandvik* between 2015\-2018 and a patent application was filed \(EP3374537A1, 2016\). Research into CrAlBYN/AlSiN nanolayers \(2016\-2018\) employed dopants to investigate the enhancement of elasticity and potential to protect *Rolls\-Royce plc* aero\-engine turbine blades against hot corrosion, resulting in a patent application \(EP3527688A1, 16.01.2019\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 During the period 2014\-2020 SHU collaborated with 23 companies across 8 diverse sectors applying HIPIMS research to develop the next generation of durable, high performance thin films, coatings and plasma enhanced diffusion treatments. SHU HIPIMS research has led to the following impacts: 

####  1. Six New High\-Performance Coating Deposition Technologies for Coatings Systems Manufacturers 

 SHU has licensed its patent on pre\-treatment to *Hauzer* *TechnoCoating, CemeCon, and Systec SVS,* and has transferred knowhow on coating deposition to *Oerlikon Balzers*. SHU’s know\-how is also embedded in the Highly Ionised Sputter \(HIS\) sold by *Evatec* to target TSV wafer packaging applications. 

 Following the licencing/know\-how transfer, the companies have created a market portfolio of HIPIMS deposition systems comprising the Flexicoat®, CC800® HiPIMS, NOVELC HIPIMS, INLENIA and the CLUSTERLINE® ranges, respectively. 

 According to Systec, the new HIPIMS sputtering technologies offered 

 “ *significant advantages over the more traditional arc technology … guarantee a droplet\-free coating and thus offer a reduction in roughness and an improvement in corrosion resistance … \[and\] can avoid expensive and time\-consuming re\-polishing”*.\[ **E1**\] 

 The CEO at Hauzer concurs: 

 “ *HIPIMS…performance increase in machining compared to conventional technologies is reaching 30\-100% in life\- time or in higher cutting speeds*” \[ **E1**\] 

 Economic impact through sales \(2014\-2020\) has been significant, with sales directly attributable to HIPIMS systems totalling **GBP16,200,000**, and with HIPIMS expanding markets for all the manufacturers \[ **E1**\]. The Product Manager for Coating Equipment of CemeCon has stated that: “ *HiPIMS coatings and HiPIMS equipment is a substantial part of our business”* \[ **CemeCon total reported revenues of GBP39,000,000 \(2015\-2020\)**\] *,* \[ **E1**\] and: 

 *“In our development efforts we have significantly been inspired by the research results in the field of HIPIMS published by Sheffield Hallam University in refereed journals and the interactions we have had at the International Conference on HIPIMS organised by Sheffield Hallam University and Fraunhofer IST.”* \[ **E1**\] 

####  2. Improvements in products, production and profitability for tool manufacturers Paul Horn \(HORN\), Walter <text removed for publication> 

 The impact of SHU’s research and knowledge transfer on HIPIMS extends to products that utilise the technology. Three leading tools manufacturers have developed new products with significantly improved tool life using HIPIMS coatings produced by equipment supplied by Hauzer and CemeCon which utilises SHU know\-how as described in Section 1. *HORN’s* Coating Engineer has noted that products with HIPIMS coatings were *""able to outperform the tool life of already existing arc and sputter coatings by a factor of 2 to 5*"".” \[ **E2**\] 

 For *Walter AG*, HIPIMS enabled the development of the  [M2131](https://www.walter-tools.com/en-us/press/news/Pages/2015-ramping-m2131.aspx) 90° ramping milling cutter which has increased metal removal rates and **extended tool life up to 200 percent**. \[ **E2**\] 

 <text removed for publication> developed a suite of tools with HIPIMS coatings for one of the world’s large manufacturers <text removed for publication>. The European Managing Director at <text removed for publication> stated that HIPIMS coated products had been central to the growth of sales to this customer, and that: “ *we believe that based upon levels of activity in 2019, the customer would **save in excess of a** **seven\-figure sum per annum**, that's just on the tooling costs”* \[ **E2**\] 

 **3. Established the first industrial scale Plasma Generators** 

 HIPIMS products have **enabled additional hardware sales at a total value of GBP108,000,000** embedding SHU HIPIMS technology into > **20** **new customers** and the **creation/safeguarding of 30 jobs.** \[ **E3**\] In 2018, and in collaboration with SHU, *Trumpf Hüttinger, Poland* launched the *Highpulse 4000 \(G2\)* plasma generator, thus establishing the company as sole supplier of industrial scale generators. The superior rates and coating quality have reduced the cost of ownership in decorative, semiconductor, glazing and display industries. 

 HIPIMS research is further exploited via <text removed for publication> sales of >200 million iPhones per year \(figures from 2018\) to address the HIPIMS technology enabled durable, high\-gloss gold version of the outer casing of the iPhone 12 Pro, launched in October 2020. The quality of the gold finish, which is not achievable by standard PVD technologies used for other colour options, formed a key element of the marketing surrounding the launch of the iPhone 12 Pro. *“…our new gold uses a **high\-power magnetron coating process** that gives the stainless steel \[underlying casing\] a stunning bright gold finish.” Greg Joswiak, SVP Worldwide Marketing, Apple* \[ **E4**\] 

####  4. Improvements to Manufacturing Practice and Productivity for Ionbond, UK 

 The partnership between SHU and global leaders in coating technologies, *Ionbond UK,* established the first industrial facility for HIPIMS in the UK. The CEO of Ionbond stated that: 

 “ *Our collaboration with SHU established the first industrial facility for HIPIMS in the UK.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease \(GORD\) is a chronic disease with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 13.98%. Current methods for diagnosing GORD are highly invasive and lack sensitivity and specificity. Newcastle research confirmed that pepsin was a suitable biomarker of reflux events and was responsible for damage during reflux events. However no test existed to easily and accurately detect pepsin in patients. Newcastle research in collaboration with Technostics led to the development of Peptest, a sensitive and non\-invasive measure of pepsin presence and reflux events. Peptest has achieved regulatory approval in several countries, including FDA approval in the US; has generated £1.2 million in revenue in 46 countries; since 2019 is being actively used in at least 6 NHS trusts.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Reflux events and current diagnosis methods</ins> 

 Gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease \(GORD\), commonly called heartburn, is the repeated movement of stomach acid up from the stomach to the throat, damaging the mucus layer in the throat and oesophagus. GORD is a chronic disease affecting all age groups with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 13.98%**Footnote:**

 Nirwan JS, et al. \(2020\) Global Prevalence and Risk Factors of Gastro\-oesophageal Reflux Disease \(GORD\): Systematic Review with Meta\-analysis. *Sci Reports.* 10:5814. DOI: 10.1038/s41598\-020\-62795\-1 
. From the mid\-1980s, GORD was gradually recognised to be linked to several diseases of the upper airways and lungs including asthma, voice disorders and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**Footnote:**

. The recognition was slow because of the lack of strong evidence for reflux events or that refluxate was damaging. 

 GORD is now recognised as a major burden on primary care resources with estimates of £750 million**Footnote:**

in the USA spent on diagnosis, treatment, prescriptions and sick leave. Many patients are treated with expensive and inappropriate medication without having a confirmed diagnosis. Current tests for reflux disease, such as PPI trials or endoscopy, suffer from a lack of specificity or sensitivity**Footnote:**

 Bytzer et al. \(2012\) Limited ability of the proton\-pump inhibitor test to identify patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. *Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology*. 10\(12\):1360\-6. DOI: 10.1016/j.cgh.2012.06.030. 
while others such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 24 hour pH monitoring \(BRAVO\) or high\-resolution manometry, are highly invasive. There was therefore a clear unmet need for a simple, rapid, accurate and non\-invasive diagnostic test to confirm the presence of GORD and direct future treatment. Such a test would considerably improve resource spending and patient QOL. 

 <ins>Pepsin as a biomarker for reflux events and as a source of damage during events</ins> 

 A biomarker for reflux was needed, the importance of which would be increased if it was also responsible for the progression of diseases associated with GORD. One suggested biomarker was pepsin protein. However at the outset of research, no assay for pepsin protein was available. Newcastle demonstrated that pepsin could be used as a biomarker as it can be detected in sputum samples, indicating its presence outside the stomach and a reflux event \(R1, R2, R3\). In addition Newcastle research demonstrated that pepsin can retain tissue damaging activity up to pH 6.5 indicating that pepsin itself has the potential to be a causative agent in disease \(R4, R5\). This increases the need for a sensitive and non\-invasive test for pepsin. 

 <ins>ELISA development and creation of Peptest</ins> 

 Newcastle developed an assay with specificity and sensitivity for pepsin in the ng/ml range, by designing an ELISA with a polyclonal antibody to pepsin isolated from human pepsin from human gastric juice \(R3\). This ELISA was then further developed and commercialised by Technostics who, in collaboration with Newcastle University, developed a monoclonal antibody for the test. This eventually led Technostics to develop Peptest, a lateral flow test to measure pepsin, to be used as a diagnostic tool. Peptest was given an EU\-wide CE mark in January 2011.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Development of Peptest</ins> 

 Peptest is a non\-invasive lateral flow test for pepsin developed by Technostics Ltd. who confirm that Newcastle research “ *described the first ELISA for pepsin, including a key polyclonal pepsin antibody, which informed development of our monoclonal antibody and ultimately led us to develop Peptest, a world class lateral flow test for pepsin*” \(EV1\). Peptest is now manufactured and distributed by the UK based company RD Biomed \[Redacted for publication\] \(EV1\). 

 This is the only test available non\-invasive for pepsin and operates much like the COVID\-19 lateral flow test. Approximately 1ml of saliva is applied to a custom sample chip containing two unique and specific human pepsin monoclonal antibodies \(EV2\). Visible reaction of the antibodies to pepsin presence provides a qualitative pepsin positive/negative result within 10 minutes. When used in clinic, the test can be conducted at the bedside, quantified further within 15 minutes by simply inserting into an in\-house Peptest reader, or if a reader is not present at the healthcare centre, in depth quantitative analysis can be completed at RD Biomed, usually within one business day \(EV1\). 

 Peptest is highly regarded in the diagnosis of GORD events and is considered an ‘ *industry leading gold standard assay*’ \(EV1\). In the diagnosis of GORD and laryngopharyngeal reflux \(stomach content reaching the larynx and pharynx\), Peptest has 95% and 81% sensitivity, and an 89% and 100% specificity respectively \(EV1\). 

 <ins>Impacts</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>the NHS</ins> 

 The UK is not the primary market for Peptest so in 2019, RD Biomed assigned a new UK distributor \(Biohit UK\) to grow the number of NHS hospitals and trusts supplied. As of the end of 2020, 6 NHS trusts are now using Peptest in everyday practice \[Redacted for publication\] \(EV1\). 

 Increased Peptest use is expected to lead to savings for the NHS. \[Redacted for publication\] \(EV3\). Gastroenterology referrals, gastroscopy sessions and impedance of pH monitoring are noted as all avoidable following a positive Peptest result, leading to concurrent savings. 

 <ins>Impacts</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>Technostics and RD Biomed</ins> 

 The primary markets for Peptest have been Asia and Oceania, North America and the rest of the EU. Distribution to these markets has been facilitated by registration as an in vitro diagnostic device \(EV2\), its initial CE certification in 2011 and further regulatory approvals in several countries. It was registered as a low\-risk Class 1 medical device by the FDA in 2017 \(EV4\) and approved by the Chinese health authorities in 2019 \(EV5\). It is also approved in Canada, Brazil, Australia, Germany and France \(EV1\). Chinese approval is especially important as diagnosis of reflux has increased in Asian populations**Footnote:**

 El\-Serag HB, et al. \(2014\) Update on the epidemiology of gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease: a systematic review. *Gut*. 63\(6\):871–880. DOI: 10.1136/gutjnl\-2012\-304269. 
. Indeed, a Chinese validation study of Peptest, which analysed samples from 709 GORD patients from 7 Shanghai and 2 Beijing hospitals, found that reflux disease in China was likely much higher than previously estimated \(EV6\). 

 While not required, regulatory approval of Peptest has encouraged international sales to healthcare providers. Peptest is also available privately, sold directly to patients through the Peptest website. These distribution routes have led to \[Redacted for publication\] sales since January 2014 in 46 countries in Europe, Sub\-Saharan and North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, North America and Latin America and the Caribbean \(EV1\). Tests are sold in 50, 10 or single test formats, along with required consumables and an additional sample reader is also available \(the PEPCube\). \[Redacted for publication\] \(EV1\). 

 \[Redacted for publication\] \(EV1\). A 2014 survey of Peptest customers conducted by the manufacturers, reported that 79% of respondents were happy with their diagnosis and 91% said that they would buy Peptest again. Customers especially praised “fast and efficient” service and quick test turnaround \(EV1, EV7\). 

 <ins>Summary</ins> 

 Newcastle development of the first ELISA against pepsin, including a key polyclonal antibody, led to the development and international commercialisation of the fast and non\-invasive Peptest by RD Biomed, with significant markets in Asia, Europe and US.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Gender Budgeting is the analysis of public resource allocation and revenue raising from a gender perspective. Gender budgeting activates gender mainstreaming by bringing together policy and resource decision making \(O’Hagan, \[C10\]\). Since 2000, researchers at GCU have produced research on the adoption and implementation of gender and equalities budget analysis. From an initial focus on the Scottish Government as an early pioneer among devolved governments, this research has directly impacted on the Equality Budget Statement \(EBS\), budgetary processes in Scotland, recommendations by international bodies and at sub/national level across the UK and beyond, and on civil society advocacy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Gender budgeting research and policy analysis began at GCU in 2000, enhancing international policy transfer and learning in the newly formed government institutions in Scotland. Early academic research and pressure from civil society resulted in the introduction of the Equality Budgets Advisory Group \(EBAG\) and the UK’s first ‘Equality Budget Statement’ in 2009. O’Hagan’s initial research of these institutional arrangements alongside the Scottish budget process and comparative analysis of other sub\-national governments \(Basque Country and Andalucía\) produced an institutional “Framework of Favourable Conditions” \(FFC\) for the adoption and implementation of gender budgeting.\[R1\] O’Hagan’s findings from interviews with officials, politicians, civil society activists, process tracing and documentary analysis of the budget processes and parliamentary engagement \(2000\-2010\) in the three territories were analysed from a feminist institutionalist perspective. The FFC has been further explored as a diagnostic of current practice \[R2\] and its application in distinct governmental contexts has been reviewed and refined \[C4\-C10\]. 

 O’Hagan’s gendered policy analysis and application of feminist economics within budget processes informed the documentary analysis of social security proposals \[R3\], highlighting implications for the new Social Security powers for Scotland and further implications for gender assessment of fiscal policy. 

 The research processes and findings – disseminated through multiple policy channels including parliamentary committees and membership of EBAG – mutually reinforced the research and its impact via O’Hagan’s role as an academic activist involved in the policy process. This has given her a unique vantage position to conduct feminist analyses of policy developments in Scotland. The research \[R1, R2\] led to O’Hagan’s appointment to the Commission on Local Tax Reform \(2015\) and Budget Review Group \(2016\-2017\), and \[R3\] on social security led to O’Hagan’s appointment on the Expert Advisory Group on Disability and Carers’ Benefits providing advice and guidance to government and the Social Security Agency for the first round of devolved benefits \(2017\-2021\) following the Social Security \(Scotland\) Act 2016. 

 Consistent with principles of community engagement and co\-production of policy, all research outputs have also been disseminated in more accessible formats such as on\-line blogs and reflection pieces \(Wales Centre for Public Policy\), and on\-line videos and training animations \(Health and Social Care Academy, Scotland, and Marginal Eyes by Engender Scotland\). Extending equalities analysis into the evaluation of Participatory Budgeting \(PB\) in Scotland 2016\-2018 applied a wider equalities lens to participatory governance in practice. Commissioned by the Scottish Government, O’Hagan led a three\-year evaluation project comprising participatory action research, multiple observations of PB events and focus groups in 6 case study areas and 60\+ interviews with officials, community members, and politicians across Scotland. Proposing a new typology for formulating and evaluating PB activities, O’Hagan et al.’s 3Ts of ‘Transaction, Transference, and Transformation’ recommended alternative approaches for PB to incorporate equalities analysis and outcomes. \[R4, R5\] 

 As section 4 makes clear, O’Hagan’s research has contributed to changes in equalities monitoring and equality impact assessment. In recognition of her work on equality analysis in public finance, O’Hagan was awarded the Political Studies Association Jo Cox Award for Active Citizenship and Public Service 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 O’Hagan’s research has secured policy impact within Scotland, amplified through pressure from civil society groups \(including Scottish Women’s Budget Group \[SWBG\] of which O’Hagan was Convenor from 2006\-2018\) to adopt feminist approaches to policy analysis in budgeting processes. 

 Equalities budgeting impacts from O’Hagan’s research and her position as a policy insider manifest in three inter\-related ways: 

 <ins>\(</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>Re\-conceptualising economic and fiscal issues \[R1, R2, R3\]</ins> 

 Feminist economics and policy analysis underpin gender budgeting, operationalising gender analysis at all stages of the policy process. The inception of the Scottish Parliament \(1999\) and the Beijing Platform for Action \(1995\) which included the global direction to include gender analysis in government budget processes \[R1\] were the impetus for civil society action in Scotland through the SWBG \[R1, C1, C2\]. International comparisons and analysis of the Scottish budget process led directly to the creation in 2009 of the Equality Budget Statement \[C1\]. Its iterations have been directly informed by \[R1, R2, C1, C2\] and O’Hagan’s sustained interventions as a member of the Equality Budgets Advisory Group \(EBAG\) and since 2018 as independent Chair. The revised budget process includes recommendations from O’Hagan’s membership of the Budget Review Group \[C2\] whose “influence meant that the scrutiny of equality issues was a core consideration” \(Group member, former Auditor General\), acknowledged by the Finance and Constitution Committee as having “directly contributed to recommendations that were accepted by the Scottish Government.” 

 <ins>\(ii\)</ins> <ins>Informing policy analysis, debates and discourse \[R1\-R5\]</ins> 

 International interest and impact \[see C4, C10\], \[C4\] and the Pan Islands Conference \(2017\) organised by O’Hagan at GCU with civil society and government participants from UK and Ireland. O’Hagan’s Framework directly contributed to subsequent changes in budgetary processes in Wales \[C5\], Ireland \[R2, C4\], Scotland \[C2\] and internationally as attested in the WBG Casebook \[C9\] and the creation of a 2020 toolkit on gender budgeting in European Structural Funds for the European Institute for Gender Equality \(EIGE\) \[C6, C7\]. O’Hagan’s framework has been applied to budget process reviews in Wales \[C4, C5\], Barcelona, the Basque Country, Andalucía, Iceland, and Ireland \[C3, C6\-10\]. The framework also structured civil society approaches to budget scrutiny in Spain, where the Platform for Gender Impact Assessment Now\! applied “learning from O’Hagan’s research to create the campaigning platform of feminist organisations in 2008, and the later practical application by various feminist organisations in Spain of her research on gender budgeting in Spain, UK and Europe.” \[R1\] 

 “Gender budgeting has been an area of strategic importance for CIPFA. \[O’Hagan\] was identified as one of the UK experts and was the author for a formal CIPFA briefing document which remains CIPFA’s formal commentary in this important area.” \(Chartered Institute of Public Finance Accounting \(CIPFA\), Director\). 

 <ins>\(iii\)</ins> <ins>Directly influencing policy and practice by governments and civil society organisations \[R2, R4, R6\]</ins> 

 O’Hagan’s framework \[R1\] was applied \[C4\] leading to the revision of gender budgeting in the Welsh Government, implementing the specific recommendations from \[C5\] the Gender Equality Roadmap, and pilots in discrete policy areas commencing in the 2019\-2020 budget period. 

 UK Women’s Budget Group confirmed O’Hagan’s contribution \[C9\] as “significant and valuable” in changing policy gender responsive budgeting through the 2018 Casebook, used as the basis for training and workshop sessions with officials and civil society representatives in Australia, Columbia, France, Morocco, New Zealand, Turkey and Vietnam. Changes secured in government policy based on O’Hagan’s research are echoed by institutional and civil society stakeholders. 

 The NI Women’s Budget Group reported that, “O’Hagan’s work has brought ‘gender responsive budgeting’ to the fore in the wider gender equality policy agenda. This has led to ongoing discussions with the Department for Communities, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the Department of Finance and Belfast City Council.” \[C11\] 

 A Scottish Government official attributed policy change in participatory budgeting guidance and the application of the 3T’s model in the strategic approach to PB following the recommendations from \[R4\] and subsequent outputs \[R5\]: “Findings helped inform Scottish Government policy development…how to focus spending for the national support programme in 2018/19 to embed PB in an inclusive and transparent way. The final report’s proposed 3Ts approach and implications for practice will inform the work plan for a national PB programme board to be established in Spring/Summer 2020.” \[C12\] 

 The CEO of the Glasgow Disability Alliance described PB evaluation research \[R5\] led by O’Hagan as powerful, adding that “The Evaluation Report outlines new possibilities by shifting the balance of decisions through transferring resources to local communities. Laying out the transformative potential of PB, the Report suggests a possible world of radical change and new relationships and power dynamics between citizens and local authorities.”

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Livestock provide one third of the protein consumed by humans. Alternatives to imported soya, a key protein component of ruminant diets, are needed to provide food security. Participatory and scientific research led by Dr Christina Marley in IBERS enabled Waitrose and their producers to understand and overcome barriers to adopting home\-grown protein forages as protein feed for ruminant livestock. The resulting removal of imported soya from beef, dairy and lamb production systems by a major UK food retailer has impacted on production and commerce, provided environmental benefits for the sector, and contributed to a 16.9% decrease in UK soya imports.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

###  *The Global Challenge: Developing Sustainable Protein Sources for livestock* 

 Competition for land to produce food, feed and biofuel is intensifying pressure on livestock systems to contribute to global protein security. Sustainable agri\-food systems need to be developed to provide food security for an expected 9.7 billion people by 2050. Economically, soya is expensive and subject to price volatility, creating a lack of food security. Given increasing global competition for this resource, and reports of its detrimental environmental impacts, there is a need to reduce reliance on imported soya in livestock diets. 

###  *How the Research Developed* 

 The defining research on the potential to reduce reliance on imported protein feed within ruminant systems first began as part of an alternative forage crops research programme \[3.7\] resulting in papers by Marley \[3.1\] in 2003. Coupled with this, the first UK research on the use of protein forages such as chicory to improve livestock performance and health, was conducted by Marley at AU \[3.2\]. From 2002–2007, a Defra\-funded project \[3.8\] showed how high\-protein forages, such as red clover, kale and lucerne, could be conserved as silage and used to improve productivity and nutrient use efficiency in livestock systems, making them a viable high\-protein winter feed for UK livestock \[3.3\]. Closely aligned to this, research in plant breeding resulted in genetic improvements in forage species that reduced the environmental impact of livestock systems \[3.4\]. In 2009, the Agricultural Manager at Waitrose was introduced to the protein forages and participatory research conducted by Marley’s team. At that time, AHDB\-funded research \[3.9\] undertaken in 2009\-2012 overcame speculation of detrimental effects on either productivity or product quality when a protein forage was used in beef production systems \[3.5\]. More recently, research has improved understanding of the impact of protein forages on the environment \[3.6\]. 

###  *Research Approach* 

 Despite these research advances, the adoption of high protein forages by the industry was limited. Marley and her team recognised that this underpinning research would only be adopted by the industry by collaboratively involving farmers in the research process. In 2011 many UK livestock farmers, \[text removed for publication\], were dependent on soya to provide protein feed to livestock. 

 Through the Sustainable Forage Protein \(SFP\) project \(2012\-2016\) \[3.10\], Marley and her team undertook participatory and scientific research to support the integration of protein forages into ruminant systems. In 2012, farmer workshops were arranged to determine the barriers to the uptake of home\-grown protein forages and the science gaps needed to create change. Five project themes were used to overcome the barriers identified in the production cycle to fully integrate protein forages. These included their establishment, conservation, supplying out\-of\-season grazed forage protein, and determining their effects on product quality. Eight participatory research farmers agreed to act as case studies for the industry and supported by McCalman \(AU\), an extension officer in Marley’s team, they changed their systems and adopted protein forages. This approach helped address some of the practical challenges and constraints experienced by the sector, with participating farmers drawing on their own experiences to the select the most suitable techniques.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Between 2012\-2016, as part of the Sustainable Forage Protein \(SFP\) project \[3.10\], on\-farm activities and protein forage research were disseminated across the Waitrose supply chain through nine events \(eight on participatory farms; one at IBERS\), each attended by 60\-100 farmers \[5.1.1\], various producer meetings, and five annual Waitrose Farming Conferences \(\[text removed for publication\] \[5.1.1\]\). Attendance at these events changed understanding among farmers across the supply chain, and farming practices \[5.2.1\]. Knowledge exchange across the supply chain was through internal newsletters and the project website \[5.5.1\]. By 2016, more than a third of producers \(\[text removed for publication\]\) in the supply chains across the UK had adopted or were trying out new home\-grown forage proteins \[5.1.2\]. Further adoption continues on participatory farms \[5.2.2\- 8\] and across the supply chain, with Waitrose and supply chain partners continuing to monitor protein forage uptake by producers, with the results up to March 2020 shown in Table 1 \[5.1.2\]. 

| “Responsible Efficient Production” \(REP\) Assessment March 2020 | Outcome per Supply Chain \(%\) | Overall %  supply chain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|| Lamb | Dairy | Beef | Ruminants |
| 1\) Uptake of Mixed leys | 80.4 | 52.6 | 63.6 | 69.5 |
| 2\) Mixed leys used containing protein forage | 65.1 | 33.3 | 54.6 | 57.1 |
| 3\) Red or White Clover adopted | 79.2 | 93.6 | 72.1 | 76.6 |
| 4\) Uptake of bespoke WFP seed mixes sown | 55.5 | 62.8 | 23.2 | 39.3 |
| 5\) Forages reduced concentrate/feed Costs | 88.4 | 51.3 | 67.1 | 74.4 |

 Table 1: Uptake of protein forages determined for Waitrose Farming Partnership \(WFP\) by independent assessor. 

 Wider dissemination across the industry was achieved through articles in the media \[5.5.2\] and other articles in farmer literature \[5.5.3\], including a SFP booklet, produced in 2016 containing testimonials from participating farmers, research findings, economic analysis and carbon emissions data \(Bangor University\) \[5.5.4\]. As of July 2020, the booklet ‘remains the best and most comprehensive forage protein management guide available in the industry’ \[5.3.1\]. 

###  *Impacts on Production* 

 Agri\-food producers reported \(May\-June 2020\): Improved resilience and feed security in: 

 i\) Lamb: ‘IBERS research allows us to use…protein forages to displace the costs of expensive fertilisers and feeds’ \[5.2.2\], to ‘eliminate the need to import very expensive protein as concentrates’ allowing production to be ‘more resilient, and able to withstand major price fluctuations in input prices’ \[5.2.3\] and ‘cut out the use of supplement feeds to 150 ewes’ \[5.2.4\]; ii\) Dairy: ‘ceased supplementing our youngstock with concentrates’ \[5.2.5\]; 

 iii\) Beef: ‘working with IBERS…I was able to…remove soya completely’ \[5.2.6\] and ‘as a result of this research...the ability to reduce reliance on imported protein feed’ \[5.2.7\]. 

 For many farmers across the wider supply chain soya has been ‘removed entirely from the ration’ \[5.2.1\]. Forage protein provided resilience during a drought when lucerne was ‘the only green field on the farm’ \[5.4.1\]. The Agricultural Manager at Waitrose reported that \[text removed for publication\] dairy producers removed soya from diets of lactating cows, \[text removed for publication\] \[5.1.1\]. \[text removed for publication\]. 

 <ins>Improved Productivity</ins> from protein forages evidenced by: 

 i\) Lamb: ‘more efficient production’ \[5.2.3\] and ‘a 25% increase in scanning percentage’ \[5.2.4\]; 

 ii\) Dairy: ‘volume of milk per cow, produced from grazed grass, rose from 1190 litres in 2012 to 2060 litres in 2017’ \[5.2.5\]; 

 iii\) Beef: ‘Pushing...growth rates...from...0.8kg/day to over 1kg/day’ and ‘able to increase cattle numbers off the same acreage...with higher growth rates and better use of forage’ \[5.2.6\]. An improved quality in forage quality was also reported, with the proportion of protein by at least 4\-5% \[5.2.1; 5.2.3; 5.2.6\]. 

 <ins>Reduced Costs of Production</ins> were reported in: i\) lamb: ‘grazing ewes on kale…saved around 40% of costs’ \[5.2.4\]; ii\) dairy: ‘concentrate use per litre of milk decreased from 0.30kg per litre to 0.24kg per litre’ and ‘saved fuel...time and labour’ \[5.2.5\]; and iii\) beef: ‘increased profitability – savings through using home grown forage versus purchased feed’ \[5.2.6\]. 

###  *Impacts on Commerce and the Economy* 

 The protein forage research ‘conducted by Dr Marley’s team has underpinned and supported a change of policy within the Waitrose ruminant supply chain, allowing for the reduction and removal of imported protein feed \(soya\) from feed rations in the ruminant supply chain’ \[5.1.2\]. 

 i\) Lamb: In 2017, Dalehead Foods established a ‘forage\-fed scheme’ to supply Waitrose with lambs produced without concentrates. ‘By 2019, Dalehead produced \[text removed for publication\] forage\-fed lambs, an increase of 100%’ since 2016. In 2020, ‘85% of lamb producers are using protein forages in place of feed… Without the support of the...project research team, we would not have had the knowledge needed to support our producers to achieve this change’. Furthermore, ‘business strategy, operations and workplaces practices changes as a result of the protein forages research conducted by AU’, providing the option for ‘a new policy to supply British lamb 365 days of the year’. \[5.4.2\] 

 ii\) Dairy: Farmers were able ‘to increase the amount of forage protein grown on farm with 94% now growing forage protein crops \(increased from 76% in 2016\)’ \[5.4.1\]; with Müller Milk & Ingredients and WDF \(Waitrose Dairy Farmers\) able to remove soya from dairy cow feed rations \[5.4.1\]. Organic dairy producers ‘produced around \[text removed for publication\] more from home grown protein per cow per year’, saving ‘\[text removed for publication\] purchased feed’, \[text removed for publication\] \[5.4.3\]. 

 iii\) *Beef*: In 2016, the research led to a 37% increase in the use of protein forage\-feed across their beef supply chain. At the corporate level, Dovecote Park was ‘able to remove soya from cattle finishing rations’. Dovecotes’ records \(May 2019\) showed ‘74% of farmers using red and white clover for increased productivity’, and 68% having a reduction in costs. In April 2020, producers continue to see the ‘benefit of these changes and... to increase the acreage sown to sustainable forage protein’. \[5.4.4\] 

 Agricultural businesses reported benefits including new products created with a catalogue of bespoke WFP seed mixtures \[5.5.5\] launched spring 2017, and increased sales of existing protein forage seed \[5.3.1\]. Although not a direct SFP partner, Pöttinger collaborated with AU on protein forage conservation research, providing in\-kind contribution in 2014. Research on ensiling techniques, conducted by R.Fychan \(AU\), showed a rubber roller conditioner led to a ‘31% reduction in protein lost during harvest’; enabling Pöttinger to increase sales of this conditioner, \[text removed for publication\]. \[5.3.2\] 

###  *Impacts on Understanding, Learning and Participation* 

 Wider benefits are seen across the farming community: “This has filtered through to other local farmers who are also using more home\-grown forages” \[5.2.6\] and “learning’s’ from the \(SFP\) project are continuing to have a wider impact on UK livestock producers” \[5.4.5\]. 

 Dr Marley’s research on protein forages was highlighted on International Women’s Day 2020 for “her enthusiasm and ability to translate the science for impact with different audiences that was so infectious and impressive” \[5.4.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr O’Connell’s and Prof DeSouza’s research has improved healthcare policy for people in pain with health insurance in the USA. This has facilitated more efficient clinical provision and reduced patient exposure to ineffective and unproven treatments for between 5,300,000 to 10,600,000 people. 

 It has informed the web\-content of a range of health information providers with a reach of millions of users enabling access to reliable information for a condition that affects 10\-20% of adults globally. Dr O’Connell has co\-created patient\-facing information on the management of pain that has had international reach, including 60,000 visitors per year benefitting from access to trustworthy information 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 10\-20% of adults report moderate to severe long\-standing pain with serious implications for their social and working lives and placing substantial burden on healthcare and social systems. Patients, clinicians and policy\-makers are faced with a maze of options only some of which might offer benefits. Reliable evidence regarding which treatments are effective and safe is vital to guide clinical decisions to ensure the delivery of high\-value care. Dr O’Connell and Prof De Souza have produced a body of high\-quality evidence syntheses of treatment effectiveness in persistent pain which have influenced policy and informed public/clinician\-facing information sources. 

 The evidence regarding which interventions are effective and safe is highly variable in terms of volume and quality. This represents a substantial challenge to policymakers, clinicians and to people with pain; and novel, up to date and robust syntheses of the evidence are vital to reduce unwanted variation in care and to inform better policy and clinical decision making. 

 Dr O’Connell has undertaken and published a body of systematic reviews and overviews relevant to the management of persistent pain, including reviews of pharmacological, interventional and rehabilitation\-based treatments. These reviews \[1.1\-1.5\], conducted and published between 2009 to 2018 were led by Dr O’Connell in collaboration with Prof DeSouza \[1.1\] and an international team of collaborators and were produced with Cochrane, a global organisation recognised as the standard leader in this type of research. Dr O’Connell is a reviewer and the Co\-ordinating Editor of the Cochrane Pain Palliative and Supportive Care review group. 

 The projects that have led to the described impacts include original systematic reviews of the effectiveness of non\-invasive brain stimulation for chronic pain \[1.1\], local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome \(CRPS\) \[1.2\], physiotherapy interventions for CRPS \[1.3\], Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \(TENS\) for neuropathic pain \[1.4\] and a systematic overview of reviews of all clinical interventions for CRPS \[1.5\]. 

 Each of these reviews was based upon a pre\-published protocol and reported to meet the accepted standards outlined by the internationally recognised Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\-Analyses \(PRISMA\) statement and the Cochrane Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews \(MECIR\) standards at the time that they were conducted. 

 Each of these reviews represents the most reliable synthesis and summary of the effectiveness and safety for these interventions that was available at the time of publication and produces valuable, internationally relevant information to guide policy with regards to clinical commissioning and treatment reimbursement and to support people in pain and their clinicians to make valid clinical decisions. The reviews highlight a critical lack of high\-quality evidence to support the effectiveness of commonly used interventions such as local anaesthetic sympathetic blocks \[1.2\] and some physiotherapy\-based approaches for CRPS \[1.3\] and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \(TENS\) for neuropathic pain, a condition that is considered one of the main clinical indications for that technology. One review identified a lack of clinically important benefits of emerging novel treatments such as non\-invasive brain stimulation techniques \[1.1\] and illustrate where the most promising evidence of effectiveness is across all interventions for CRPS \[1.5\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 A number of major health insurance providers in the US have developed their reimbursement policies in light of these reviews. Based on the combined recent membership figures for these 4 insurance schemes \(53,400,000 members\) and a prevalence of persistent pain of 10\-20% these policies apply to between 5,300,000 to 10,600,000 people with health insurance. The reviews have enabled important evidence\-based policy decisions which allow for more efficient clinical provision and reduce patient exposure to ineffective and unproven treatments. 

  

 Between 2017 and 2019, policies from United Healthcare \[2.1\], Regence \[2.2\], UCare \[2.3\] and the Government Employers Health Association \(GEHA\) \[2.4\] used the review on the topic \[1.1\] to justify not routinely offering non\-invasive brain stimulation techniques for chronic pain. 

 A range of information resources have been designed, underpinned by the evidence in these reviews, for people in pain and clinicians to inform their understanding of the condition and their treatment choices. 

 The PainHEALTH website \[2.5\] is a Western Australia \(WA\) Department of Health government funded website developed through a collaboration of researchers, clinicians and consumers, with the specific goal of promoting timely access to reliable and practical pain management resources for all Western Australian health consumers and improving access to good information to people with musculoskeletal pain in remote and hard to reach communities. At the invitation of colleagues in WA, Dr O’Connell led the development of patient facing online information relating to CRPS for the website. 

 This information on CRPS was directly based on Brunel reviews \[1.3, 1.5\] and summarises for the lay reader which treatments show promise and which appear to be unsafe and/or ineffective across the full range of treatments including drugs, invasive procedures and non\-pharmacological options. The pages went live in 2017. Tracking use statistics show the website is well accessed with over 1,000,000 visitors per year benefitting from trustworthy, accessible and up to date information about their pain, and has a global reach, with users accessing the resource from over 150 countries. The page on managing CRPS received over 5,000 visitors in January 2019 alone suggesting a reach of approximately 60,000 users per year for this rare condition. A formal mixed methods evaluation of the painHEALTH project included 414 users of the resource and found that users perceived it as filling an important gap in holistic pain care, and that it provided holistic and credible information to support self\-management and co\-care of pain. Health professionals reported that they perceived it to be a useful tool to complement clinical care and training \[2.6\]. The website has now been approved for a further 5 years of government funding \(2018\-2023 AUD125,000, equivalent to GBP70,000 \(11\-2020\) and Dr O’Connell will continue to work with the painHEALTH team to further enhance the information on CRPS based upon this research. 

 Patients and clinicians increasingly turn to internet\-based information sources to inform decisions about care and it is important that information based on the best evidence to date is freely available. A range of patient and clinician facing online resources independently developed information resources and recommendations relating to various treatment options for persistent pain that are underpinned by these reviews. Patient\-facing resources include the respected and award\-winning UK\-based “Patient.info” website \(formerly patient.co.uk\) who cite the Brunel review of TENS for neuropathic pain \[1.4\] in their patient information resource on TENS \[2.7\], the US Women’s National Health Network who cite the same review in their information on alternatives to drugs for chronic pain \[2.8\]. Information resources for clinicians include the “Uptodate.com” \[2.9\] and “Practical pain management” \[2.10\] websites who provide clinician updates on best clinical practice for CRPS, and ketamine use with the evidence in reviews 1.2 and 1.5 as critical evidence sources. These resources have considerable global reach. According to information on their websites, Patient.info has over 6,000,000 users; UptoDate is used by approximately 1,700,000 clinicians to stay abreast of current evidence across over 190 countries, and Practical Pain Management has a print circulation of more than 41,000 with over 700,000 unique website visitors per month. 

 This research has directly helped improve healthcare policy for between 5,300,000 to 10,600,000 people in pain with health insurance in the US. It informs trustworthy, accessible information to clinicians and people with pain about pain management that has global reach.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Optimising pharmaceutical manufacturing processes is expensive, time\-consuming, and negatively impacts patients waiting for new or improved treatments.  University of Leeds research has developed automated platforms for the self\-optimisation of chemical transformations, which have been deployed within pharmaceutical development by global pharmaceutical companies.  These platforms act as autonomous units, combining continuous flow reactors with in\-line analytics, reactor control and evolutionary algorithms to optimise pharmaceutical processes rapidly.  This has significantly reduced development time, resulting in substantial productivity gains and faster translation of materials to clinical trials.  Applications have included development of the AstraZeneca anti\-cancer agent TAGRISSO<sup>TM</sup> in an accelerated timeframe, which has current annual sales of \~£3Bn. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Institute of Process Research and Development \(iPRD\) was established in 2008 as a joint venture between the School of Chemical & Process Engineering and the School of Chemistry at the University of Leeds to exploit expertise in process chemistry and develop new technologies for, and in partnership with, the fine chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries.  Alongside the construction of a new 650 m<sup>2</sup> process development laboratory, the Institute was bolstered by four joint appointments between the two Schools, three relevant to this study:  Dr Richard **Bourne** \(continuous processing, process optimisation\), Professor John Blacker \(process chemistry, continuous processing\), and Professor Frans **Muller** \(reaction engineering, kinetic modelling\).  **Bourne** and **Muller** are returned in UoA12, Blacker in UoA8. 

 **Bourne** was recruited in 2012 to lead the development of automated continuous flow reactor systems and he has directly supervised eleven industrially\-funded/sponsored PDRAs and PhD students in collaboration with four global pharmaceutical companies \(AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories\), developing Self\-Optimising Flow Reactors \(SOFR\). 

 Initially, AstraZeneca sponsored the development of a platform for self\-optimising the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds using closed\-loop feedback at meso\-scale.  Prior work worldwide had focused on self\-optimisation in micro reactors, or in niche media such as supercritical fluids.  The shift to meso\-scale pharmaceutical synthesis critically required development of suitable analytical methods, meso\-volume reactor platforms with material saving modifications, accurate pumping solutions, and development of machine learning optimisation algorithms.  In 2015, **Bourne** received a Royal Academy of Engineering Industrial Fellowship \(ISS1516\\8\\32\) to spend 50% of his time establishing a replica of the University’s SOFR system within the AstraZeneca \(Macclesfield\) Process Research and Development group, and apply it to ‘live’ manufacturing projects such as the kinase inhibitor AZD9291 proposed for lung cancer therapy.  The SOFR combined online analysis with evolutionary feedback algorithms to rapidly achieve optimum conditions for the final bond\-forming steps in synthesising AZD9291.  Optimisations were initially carried out on a model compound, with the data used to track the formation of various impurities and propose a mechanism for their formation.  This was then applied to the optimisation of a two\-step telescoped reaction to synthesise AZD9291 in 89% yield \[1\]. 

 Subsequently, AstraZeneca continued to sponsor research projects at Leeds to improve automated optimisation platforms.  These included developing direct mass spectrometry for reaction analysis, which greatly expanded the scope of chemistries to include compounds without chromophores \[2\].  This has proved critical to the development of viable flow processes including a large scale production for clinical trials.  The research also developed techniques for multi\-objective optimisation \(visualising the trade\-off between objectives such as purity and productivity\) and optimising multiple unit operations \(i.e. reactor and separation\) \[3\].  This approach was applied to the synthesis of BACE1 inhibitor AZD3293 proposed for Alzheimer’s disease therapy \[4\]. 

 AstraZeneca \(Macclesfield\) began applying these automated platforms to assess reaction kinetics \[5, 6\] \(co\-funded through the University of Leeds EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account\).  This work explores the use of mixed integer linear programming for model discrimination and automated parameterisation of models.  In addition, development of networked systems for parallelised optimisations across different sites was initiated through the £2M EPSRC grant ‘Cognitive Chemical Manufacturing’ \(EP/R032807/1\) with AstraZeneca, Swagelok and IBM, who are developing novel algorithms to reduce experimental burden and provide more robust multi\-objective optimisations. 

 In 2019, **Bourne** was appointed as an AstraZeneca / Royal Academy of Engineering Senior Research Fellow in Digital Manufacturing and Discovery of Pharmaceuticals \(RCSRF1920\\9\\38\), in recognition of the impact of his research upon manufacturing and development practices in the pharmaceutical industry.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The development of the SOFR platform at the University of Leeds has changed business practice and outcomes. 

 AstraZeneca established their own SOFR platform at their Macclesfield site, facilitated through **Bourne**’s RAEng Industrial Fellowship secondment, which included his training of AstraZeneca staff \[A\].  This transformative approach has enabled AstraZeneca to rapidly develop viable continuous flow process\(es\) to meet the demands of rapid drug development timelines, and contributes to the company’s on\-going improvement \[text removed for publication\] \[A\]. 

 To date, AstraZeneca have applied this technology to \[text removed for publication\] projects across different therapy areas and it is now part of their standard workflow \[A\], leading to significant financial impact and impact on patient health.  AZD9291 is an example of such a product in the public domain: 

-  AZD9291, a kinase inhibitor for the treatment of lung cancer, was fast\-tracked for approval by the Federal Drugs Administration \(FDA\) due to an unmet patient need \[B\].  By applying the SOFR technology developed at the University of Leeds, AstraZeneca was able to develop a manufacturing process in an unprecedentedly short 2.5 years from a normal medicine development cycle of approximately 8 years \[A\].  The SOFR technology played a key role \[text removed for publication\] in the final stage of the synthesis.  AZD9291 was launched in 2018 as TAGRISSO<sup>TM</sup>, which is now an approved first line treatment in over 75 countries \[C\], so the speed at which AZD9291 became available has significantly impacted patient health worldwide.  This is now AstraZeneca’s biggest selling medicine with current annual sales of \~£3Bn, and has had significant societal impact by extending cancer patients’ lives \[text removed for publication\] compared to previous standard\-of\-care treatments \[A\]. 

 Such success created a route to international innovation, with AstraZeneca transferring SOFR technologies to their Gothenburg site in the Sample Development team.  **Bourne** and AstraZeneca \(Gothenburg\) colleagues developed a new proof\-of\-concept system in 2017 \(based on the original SOFR\) \[D\], \[text removed for publication\].  In addition, a scientific role was created by AstraZeneca within the **Bourne** group at the University of Leeds for a three\-year period from January 2019 to advance the technology of the system \[D\].  AstraZeneca is planning a significant internal investment \[text removed for publication\] to evolve and deploy these systems to AstraZeneca research sites \[text removed for publication\] \[D\].

 The York St John Counselling & Mental Health Centre \( [https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/working\-with\-the\-community/counselling\-and\-mental\-health\-centre/](https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/working-with-the-community/counselling-and-mental-health-centre/)\) provides accessible evidence\-based wellbeing interventions to citizens. Established in 2016, it develops and delivers practice\-based evidence and evidence\-based services for citizens of York and North Yorkshire, along with the recent addition of online practice and research due to the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 Underpinned by core values of *community, collaboration,* and *creativity,* the Centre develops research and practice associated with a range of mental health and wellbeing issues, with specific expertise and research outputs related to domestic violence, bereavement, trauma, and anger management. It offers high quality research, training and placement options for trainee practitioners and students interested in developing skills and knowledge of leadership and management in frontline mental health services. 

 Partnerships forged with regional and local domestic violence organisations \( *IDAS; York Women’s Centre*\), a local council \( *City of York*\), a Coaching Community Interest Company \( *Coaching York*\), and a hospice \( *Teeside Hospice*\), support delivery of research projects, whilst an active Advisory Board brings strategic expertise from health, public health, business and third sectors **\[5.3\]**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As a precursor to opening of the Centre, the Director was part of a team successful in securing £450k funding for a randomised trial \(PRaCTICED\) from the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy **\[3.6\]** *.* The trial examined the efficacy of an NHS *Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies* \(IAPT\) intervention, *Counselling for Depression* \(CfD\), compared with outcomes from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \(CBT\).  Professor Gabriel secured NHS contracts to commission York St John to deliver \(IAPT\) training on CfD at York St John University. This is now a thriving NHS commissioned training programme for York St John and contributes to IAPT delivery across Northern England. A paper summarising the RCT outcomes is currently under review with *Lancet Psychiatry.* 

 Funding of £10k was secured from York Feoffees, to work in partnership with IDAS \(Independent Domestic Abuse Services\) to research a young person to parent aggression project **\[3.1\]** and develop an evidence\-based group intervention for children **\[3.2\]**. Key findings from the research included recognition of the value of intervening with both the aggressive child and the parent; it was also found that frontline workers \(including social workers, police, domestic abuse agency workers, youth workers\) could be deeply and negatively impacted by their work experiences **\[3.1\]**. The pilot group for children found that participants valued the strengths\-based approach which provided relationship and behavioural skills to take away from the group experience **\[3.2\]**.  Additionally, the Centre’s Director and Research Fellow \(Dr Jeannette Roddy, Salford University\) have developed a training curriculum for counsellors working with domestic abuse **\[3.3\]**. 

 Dr Gary Shepherd leads on anger management research. Shepherd designed a behavioural modification module, delivered through the Centre, which demonstrated positive impact for participants who were able to make positive adjustments in their self and other perceptions and behaviours **\[3.5\].**  Dr Trish Hobman leads on training psychological therapists to deliver IAPT therapy in the NHS and led on delivery of the CfD practitioner training for practitioners involved in the PRaCTICED trial **\[3.6\]**. York St John contributed to the outcomes paper from the RCT \(under review with *Lancet Psychiatry* at time of case study submission\). Dr John Wilson, an Honorary Research Fellow in the Centre, collaborates with Professor Gabriel on bereavement research **\[3.4\]**. Teesside Hospice and the Centre are piloting a bereavement measure, AGES, developed through Centre research.  A case study paper on the use of AGES is in review with the *British Journal of Guidance and Counselling.*  Feedback from the Teesside Hospice has been positive, with the measure providing valuable evidence of progress for the bereaved.  At the time of the case study submission the research project *Learning from our Losses,* researching bereavement in the Care Home Sector during the Covid\-19 pandemic, is being finalised. 

 In 2018, the York St John University Centre established a *Research and Training Clinic Consortium \(RTCC\)* involving York St John, Abertay, Newman and Salford Universities. Recent additions to RTCC research projects include the Open University, Roehampton, plus University of East London **\[5.10\]**.  RTCC’s inaugural project involves testing a new outcome measure, ReQoL \(recovering quality of life measure, which the Centre is licensed to administer\) within the context of humanistic and pluralistic therapies. Additionally, RTCC is undertaking a Prospero registered evidence review of online counselling **.** 

 In 2019 the Centre was invited to contribute to the creation of the *Northern Quarter Project*, a City of York Council initiated project in York involving York St John Counselling & Mental Health Centre, Converge, lived experience members of local communities, City of York Council, North Yorkshire Police, TEWV \(Tees, Esk & Weir NHS Trust\), Clinical Commissioning Group, and Mind.  The work involves evidence\-based decision\-making and researching, and the mapping of current provision for mental health and wellbeing  **–** see  [https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/18216798.pioneering\-project\-boost\-mental\-health\-northern\-york\-launched/](https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/18216798.pioneering-project-boost-mental-health-northern-york-launched/)\).

 Generating sustainable practice is core to the Centre’s work. The Centre has directly influenced the lives of over 1000 service users: positively impacting their relationships, families, work, and lives. Outcomes compare well with outputs from the Government’s *Improving Access to Psychological Therapies* \(IAPT\) programme with 90% of our clients moving from moderate to minor mental distress across the course of treatment. Reach and significance is amplified through service user and partner networks, plus outcome evidence **\[5.2; 5.9\]**. 

 Client testimonies endorse how the services have enhanced their wellbeing and mental health. Reaching clients through health and social care contacts and networks in the wider community and by ‘word of mouth’, former clients now regularly recommending it to others. 

 Direct impact through provision of research\-informed and evidence\-based interventions is epitomised in typical client feedback we receive **\[5.2; 5.9\] \-** see examples below: 

 “*I have used the services of cmhc twice in recent years \(for relationship counselling and anger management\).  Both experiences were of a service run in a professional but compassionate way leading to constructive and positive outcomes”.* 

 *“The counselling has made a significant impact for me.  Both in terms of dealing with current issues but also identifying and addressing underlying past issues that were having an impact on my life”*. 

 *“Please keep doing what you’re doing, and I know you will continue to make a difference to so many peoples’ lives”.* 

 Shepherd’s work **\[3.5\]** proves how clients who access evidence\-based anger management groups can support themselves through emotional regulation to move forward effectively and to change previous aggressive behaviour. This is also evidenced in the first client statement above. Gabriel and Wilson’s work on bereavement **\[3.4\]** has led to the development of a grief measure, AGES, which is being tested in Teesside Hospice and the Centre; importantly, the measure provides evidence for clients of how their counselling work has supported them to recover from their bereavement and loss. The measure has also been used for an online \(video\) COVID\-19 bereavement support group; all members of the group moved from a deeply traumatised state through to acknowledgement of their situation and adjustment to their circumstances. Feedback from participants plus requests from stakeholders indicate the value of access to evidence\-based bereavement support **\[5.8; 5.9\],** including a bereavement support group \(pilot ran September\-December 2020\) and a closed social media support group \(currently 400\+ members\) **.** The Centre hosted the 2020 1<sup>st</sup> International Online Bereavement Conference, attended by several hundred UK and International delegates, generating interest in further work and events **\[5.7; 5.10\],** including being commissioned to provide consultancy to a national bereavement organisation **\[5.8\],** plus testimonies from the Hospice sector, epitomised by a ‘thank you’ letter from St Gemma’s Hospice **\[5.9\].** 

 Gabriel et al’s work on domestic violence and abuse \(DVA\) and its impact on young people and adults has drawn attention to the need for early interventions to prevent future mental ill\-health or victimisation later in life **\[3.2\]**. DVA research highlighted the impact on frontline workers of exposure to violence and abuse **\[3.1\]** and influenced development of a research\-informed training for frontline practitioners **\[3.3; 5.5\].** The research has informed and supported work at IDAS, a leading UK DVA charity, and we are in the process of evaluating further groups delivered in North Yorkshire.  As with many areas of work, Covid\-19 has impacted on access to School contexts and pupils/parents/teachers. 

 **Building Impact Impetus**: **Influencing Communities and Professionals** 

 The Centre’s research and training practice not only influences local and national communities, citizens, and practitioners **\[5.1; 5.2\],** it also provides life and work\-related experiences for new practitioner generations and roles in frontline mental health practice \- not least in the form of *real\-life and meaningful research and practice at the frontline of mental health services.* Since opening, over 100 trainee practitioner opportunities and research associate roles have created work\-related administrative, management and Advisory Board placements for undergraduate and postgraduate students, plus five Graduate Interns furthered their careers.  Employment for local students has been generated, with two students currently employed as Office Administrators. All former employees have secured jobs, internships, funded PhDs, or tenured academic Graduate Teaching Assistant \(GTA\) posts. 

 The Centre’s research contributes to and informs the International *Pluralistic Practice Network*  \(https://pluralisticpractice.weebly.com/links.html\).  The network draws international academics and researchers from the field of integrative therapy practice.  A 2016 textbook captures research\-based and evidence\-informed work and research from the network; see  [https://uk.sagepub.com/en\-gb/eur/the\-handbook\-of\-pluralistic\-counselling\-and\-psychotherapy/book243250\#contents](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/the-handbook-of-pluralistic-counselling-and-psychotherapy/book243250) which includes a chapter from Gabriel \(2016, pages 300\-313\) and is used by UK and European Pluralistic training programmes \(including University counsellor training programmes at Queens, Abertay, Roehampton, South Wales, Oslo\). 

 Gabriel’s work with the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy and research\-based textbooks on ethics have influenced practice ethics.  *Relational Ethics in Practice*, an edited text  [https://www.routledge.com/Relational\-Ethics\-in\-Practice\-Narratives\-from\-Counselling\-and\-Psychotherapy/Gabriel\-Casemore/p/book/9780415425919  and *Speaking the Unspeakable*](https://www.routledge.com/Relational-Ethics-in-Practice-Narratives-from-Counselling-and-Psychotherapy/Gabriel-Casemore/p/book/9780415425919%20%20and%20Speaking%20the%20Unspeakable) 

 [https://www.routledge.com/Speaking\-the\-Unspeakable\-The\-Ethics\-of\-Dual\-Relationships\-in\-Counselling/Gabriel/p/book/9780203086933](https://www.routledge.com/Speaking-the-Unspeakable-The-Ethics-of-Dual-Relationships-in-Counselling/Gabriel/p/book/9780203086933) a research\-informed exemplar text on dual and multiple role relationships in counselling and psychotherapy, have enhanced the clinical, training and research work in the clinic, as well as the counselling professions more widely, with citations in International journals plus use as resources within counsellor training sites **\[5.5\]**. Gabriel Chairs BACP’s *Ethics and Good Practice Guidance Committee*, responsible for the development and enhancement of the Associations *Ethical Framework* *for the Counselling Professions*, plus production of ethics resources available through multiple media, including online and print\-based **\[5.1\].**  The synergies of professional knowledge and evidence derived from the Centre’s work and research, concurrent with development work with the BACP Committee, provide a fertile context and impetus for advancing evidence\-informed practice; with updating of the Ethical Framework due in 2021, providing a context to innovate UK and International practice ethics. 

 Gabriel’s ethics research informs BACP good practice guidance resources; her *Good Practice in Action GPiA044* resource is one of the top downloaded documents \( *over 900 downloads January\-November 2020, plus over 2000 views of an online e\-resource on ethical decision\-making*\), providing research and practice\-based informed guidance for counselling professionals.  In early 2020, Gabriel worked closely with the Association to identify and provide key online evidence\-based resources for upskilling practitioner members **\[5.1\]** during the Covid\-19 crisis. One resource focussed primarily on safeguarding and managing risk online whilst the other supported supervisors to prepare them for challenges they may encounter when working with supervisees online **\[5.1\].**  These online resource events were attended by over 2,000 practitioner members of BACP including International members. Gabriel’s work supported BACP to venture into delivering remotely recorded online events to large numbers of Association members **\[5.1\].** 

 Research and practice outputs reached York and North Yorkshire communities through York Mix \(a monthly column across 2019\) and broadcasts on Radio York.  A paper on domestic abuse, published in 2020 in The Conversation **\[5.4\],** generated an increase in domestic violence referrals to the Centre and the development of a partnership with York Women’s Centre. 

 Arising from the Covid\-19 pandemic, to enable access to the research\-based Centre services, practitioners were provided with training on working through online video and telephone platforms.  We are now seeing increased referrals from across the UK and, to support our practice and research into online therapy, a rapid review is underway with RTCC members \( *the review involves Open University plus Abertay, Salford, Newman, Roehampton and York St John Universities*\) on the effectiveness of online counselling. The review has an approved *Prospero* registration.  A second RTCC research phase will see analyses of its national minimum dataset \- with national and international impact for the delivery of humanistic and pluralistic psychological therapies.  Additionally, York St John University have invested in growth of the Centre though the provision of bespoke premises at 32\-34 Clarence Street, York \(due to open Autumn 2021\) to enable expansion of research projects, knowledge production and exchange, and evidence\-based research and practice placements.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UAL’s research in photography, filmmaking and curation as they relate to the recording and representation of diverse communities is linked closely to ethical questions about the role of documentation. This work tackles ways in which political, cultural and social change can be effected by subverting standard tropes in photography and filmmaking, and by challenging curatorial conventions. The work has influenced the presentation of photography and film in museums and galleries through displaying imagery previously unseen, or not hitherto viewed as a legitimate subject for study or display. Collectively, research has created new approaches that shape the way the ‘subject’ is represented. The development of new participatory and empathic practices has led to new ways of representing life in Britain. These prioritise inclusivity and diversity, regularly representing marginalised communities through creative collaborations, constructing counter\-cultural narratives and giving meaning, visibility and value to the dispossessed, excluded, forgotten or obscured. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Key methodological approaches that underpin the impact are given below. 

 In *Living in Hell* \(2003–2005\) \[3.1.\], artist/photographer **Hunter** created photographic images based on grim headlines from his local paper, the *Hackney Gazette*. His work is underpinned by the twin themes of place and identity. Focused on inner city landscapes and spaces, **Hunter** has long referenced classical paintings, through research into how historic painters have recorded, described and given narratives to their environments, lives and subjects. In his work, **Hunter** shifts this previously privileged approach to the representation of marginalised communities. In 2009, **Hunter** developed these themes, reframing classical tropes for *A Palace for Us*, the result of a long\-term residency spent on Hackney’s Woodberry Down Estate. The project documents 50 years of life on the estate through the testimonies of residents who had lived there since it was first built. The outcome reflects an in\-depth knowledge of the area and the deep involvement of the estate’s residents in the process of the film’s making. \[3.2.\] 

 When **Williams** curated *How We Are: Photographing Britain from the 1840s to the Present* \(Tate Britain, 2007\) \[3.3.\], she had long tackled the challenges of researching, collecting and exhibiting photography. Whilst, previously, better\-known international photographers had been the conventional subject matter for major exhibitions in the UK, **Williams**’ approach focused on extending the scope of photographic content, investigating hitherto unexplored family archives and personal collections, and exhibiting the work of unknown photographers or those seen as being outside the canon. 

 **Davidmann**’s work examines transsexual visibility/invisibility and public/private gender expression. Research during this AHRC fellowship \(2007–2010\) \[3.4.\] captured participants’ experiences in the contrasting spaces of the street, where only female/male genders are recognised, and in a photographic studio away from the visual regimes of the street or the identity space of the home. 

 **Rughani**’s work centres the difficult ethical questions and decisions confronted by documentary photographers and filmmakers. It challenges the relationship between ethics and aesthetics in forms of documentary arts and film practice, with a focus on the tension between ‘responsibility’ and ‘artistic freedom’. In *The Dance of Documentary Ethics* \(2013\), Rughani offered new insights into methodologies of ethically challenging filming decisions in practice\-based research, a trajectory followed in *The Art of Not Knowing* and *Are You A Vulture*? \[3.5.\] 

 Artist\-filmmaker **Raban**’s research practice has focused on the ‘island’ of Britain and its people, alongside a conviction that history is formed by collective memories rather than definitive historical interpretations. *Time and the Wave* \(2013\) \[3.6.\] engages with the paradox that the present cannot be reflected upon until it has become the past, by focusing on key London events filmed in 2012 and 2013: the opening of Westfield Shopping Centre at Stratford, the Occupy movement’s encampment at St Paul’s Cathedral, the Queen’s Jubilee Thames pageant and the funeral of Margaret Thatcher. This work addresses the English obsession with nostalgic displays of pageantry, contrasted with political activism. 

 **Zimmerman,** in collaboration with **Hunter**, took further the thinking around place and identity in the inner city in *Real Estates \(*2015\), a six\-week series of events at East London’s Peer Gallery, supporting ‘Estate’ \[3.7.\], a long\-term project based around Haggerston Estate, co\-ordinated by **Zimmerman**, in which **Hunter** took part. **Zimmerman**’s practice\-based research investigates historical and contemporary methods in filmmaking—technical, representational, aesthetic and ethical—harnessed to create a filmic language that is often tender and delicate, supporting her empathic approach to her films’ subject matter and characters. *Estate, a Reverie* is a feature\-length, highly collaborative essay film that tracks the passing of Hackney’s Haggerston Estate, challenging media stereotypes of housing estates, and their inhabitants as a threatening underclass.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In *Justine* \(2013\), **Rughani** took further the thinking developed for *The Dance of Documentary Ethics*. Premiered at the Stockholm Academy of Art, *Justine* is an award\-winning \(Research in practice award from the British Association of Film, Television and Screen Studies\) short documentary film portrait of a young woman with severe neurological disorders. The film has been used to help social services assessors achieve a fuller picture of the experiences of a young person with such conditions and quickly became an important teaching tool at universities in several countries, entering curricula in documentary studies. The film sits at the centre of UAL’s *Ethics for Making,* a free online initiative for students, teachers and makers to explore creative arts practice, that builds on **Rughani**’s questioning of existing modes of documentation to develop methods of empathic looking and listening. The film was screened and debated at UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities \(December 2015, Leicester\). The film’s methodology has been debated in leading international art and academic conferences and human rights film festivals. 

 The University has further supported work in this field through its Photography and the Archive Research Centre \(PARC, founded by **Williams** in 2003\). As a measure of the importance of **Williams** to British photography and its curation, her archive became part of the Martin Parr Foundation in March 2019. The archive reveals the progression of **Williams**’ practice, creating a resource for the study and interpretation of photography and cultural networks from the early 1970s, as well as a forming a historical record of the thinking that drove changes in attitudes towards photography. Parr described **Williams** as “one of the most esteemed British photography curators, with a long and illustrious career”. \[5.1.\] 

 **Williams** co\-curated and devised with Karen Shepherdson, \(now UAL Programme Director, Photography\) the widely applauded exhibition *Seaside: Photographed* \(2019, GBP220,000 ACE Strategic Touring grant; GBP10,000 Turner Contemporary\). This photography exhibition \(and book\), Turner Contemporary’s first, presented a set of themes to do with everyday life, whilst showing the British seaside in a personal, empathic way. Critical reception recognised the pertinence of the approach: “Not the least pleasure of this tremendous show of seaside photographs \[...\] is the sheer rush of revelation”, and “…the result of many years’ work and quite formidable research on the part of its curators. As a result, a subject that might have been fluffy and superficial in other hands has been permitted quite astonishing complexity”. \[5.2.\] \[5.3.\] Central to the project was a ‘Call for Works’, a tool used infrequently in UK exhibition projects, important because it enabled the curators to venture far beyond already known work to discover bodies of work that had become obscured in the fragmented histories of British photography. **Williams**’ objective was to explore a complex topic in a way that would respect both specialised and non\-specialised audiences \(approximately 12,500 visitors\). 

 Award\-winning artist/photographer **Davidmann**, a UAL PhD alumna, was one of the first to receive an AHRC Creative Fellowship \( *Beyond Male and Female: The Experience of Photography and the Self\-Visualisation of Transsexual People*\). **Davidmann** took this work further in *Ken. To be destroyed*, a multi\-faceted project based on a family archive that contained images, letters and papers relating to her uncle, Ken, that revealed that he was transgender. The project was disseminated in a series of outputs including a book, six solo exhibitions, two group exhibitions, three events at the V&A, and a co\-authored journal article. **Davidmann** won a Philip Leverhulme Prize \(The Leverhulme Trust, 2016–2019\), and the project was nominated for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize \(2017\). *Ken. To Be Destroyed* \(2016, supported by PARC\) received extensive exposure through international media \[5.4.\] \[5.5.\], the venues at which it was exhibited and at a range of conferences, symposia and debates, all of which served to reach new audiences and networks, for example, the LGBTQ\+ Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections’ ‘Without Borders’ conference \(June 2016\). **Davidmann**’s work has contributed to raising awareness of trans people’s lived experience and to generating greater understanding. 

 **Hunter**’s body of research has continued to develop the themes evident in his early work. For example, *A Journey Home* \(2019\), a collaboration with Hastings Museum and Art Gallery, Lucy Bell Gallery and Hastings taxi firm 247247, traces its research roots back to *Living in Hell and Other Stories*. **Hunter** photographed each taxi driver in their favourite location in the town. Their stories were recorded by Hanna Wiebe, a multimedia artist working with sound and photography; these became part of the soundscape for the exhibition. \( *A Journey Home*, Hastings Museum and Art Gallery, 2019. 14,252 visitors. Funded by Arts Council England. 11 photographs inspired by paintings in the Hastings Museum and Art Gallery collection\). The exhibition attracted local and national media coverage, including *The Guardian* \[5.6\], *Wallpaper\ and BBC South East. Visitors to the exhibition commented: ""Brilliant; if only people could view this and not judge people as many do”. ""Timely subject, gentle, moving approach, brilliant photographs, anything that humanises migrant experience is welcome at present.” \[5.7.\] **Hunter**’s work is in many international collections including; MoMA, New York; National Gallery, London and the Smithsonian, Washington. **Hunter**’s internationally known image, *Woman Reading a Possession Order*, \(now part of the V&A’s collection\) is part of the exhibition, *Inspiration—Contemporary Art and Classics* \(co\-curated by UAL research fellow, James Putnam\), first staged at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, then at Ateneum \(Finnish National Gallery\). 

 Alongside his work using still imagery, exhibited in both film and art contexts, **Raban**’s extensive body of work over the last five decades has impacted on filmmakers and filmmaking. The BFI: **“**one of the foremost British artists and experimental filmmakers of the last forty years”; “ **Raban** has acquired a reputation as one of the most singularly important artists to work in \[landscape and nature in film\].” \[5.8.\] While known initially for his landscape and expanded cinema films of the 1970s, in the 1980s, his focus moved towards a more historical and socio\-political context: the history of London and the Thames. *Time and the Wave* was screened internationally \(e.g. London International Film Festival, 2013; National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2015\), and shown as a continuous installation at the Mercosul Biennial in Brazil \(2013\). It was nominated for the Oberhausen International Short Film Festival \(2014\). Raban runs UAL’s Documentary Research Forum, an arena to develop ideas around documentary in film, sound and photography. 

 **Zimmerman**’s award\-winning work engages in an innovative and radical way with those she films, extending the collective ownership to audiences by staging discussion forums at screenings \(in prisons and community centres, at film festivals and for disadvantaged young people\), often with one or more of the actors taking part. For *Estate*, Zimmerman worked with the residents of the estate—herself one of them—having direct impact on each of the participants. Joshua Oppenheimer, Director of *The Act of Killing,* described *Estate, A Reverie as* “a deeply moving portrait of a community struggling to survive in a boarded\-up London public housing project, long slated for demolition. Multi\-layered and profound, Andrea **Zimmerman**’s film masterfully immerses us in a dreamlike lost world of misfits, outcasts and survivors whom she films with love and aching tenderness. Her ground\-breaking approach to cinema—at once collaborative and performative—creates a work of rare intimacy, a lyrical and gripping vision of the loneliness and disempowerment that haunts life even in the world’s wealthiest cities” \[5.9.\], while Paul Sng \(maker of the highly successful *Dispossession: The Great Social Housing Swindle,* 2017\) cites *Estate* as one of his key influences: “ *Estate: A Reverie* was among a small handful of films that inspired and informed *Dispossession*, a documentary about the mismanagement of social housing. Andrea’s empathy and respect for the residents shines through in a tender and powerful meditation on what it means to call somewhere home”. \[5.10.\] 

 Multi\-cultural working\-class voices are underrepresented in the theories and practices of essay film and visual culture. *Estate* produced a visual map that works towards bridging this knowledge gap. For example, **Zimmerman** researched housing policy for the film, interviewing architects, activists, sociologists, poets, residents and council workers as well as filming town hall meetings in order to gather opinions and insights from the local community and housing experts. This work helped to inform understanding of planning, local and government housing policy and, crucially, the voices of residents and other locals who were being impacted. **Zimmerman** also photographed the estate regularly, which led to a photo essay book, *Estate: Art, Politics and Social Housing in Britain* \(2010\). The ethos of **Zimmerman**’s work seeks to trouble ideological frameworks, especially around class, race and marginalised lives, in order to explore and perform how stories can be told across differences and beyond fixed ways of seeing. Her recent film, *Here for Life* \(2019, commissioned by Artangel following an open competition\), continues this direction. **Zimmerman** was joint winner of the Film London Jarman Award in 2020 for the film. Artangel: "" *Here for Life* fuses fiction with documentary, conjuring up a world where difference makes no difference and hope is given a voice through trust"". Founder of theatre company Cardboard Citizens: “If this film tells us anything about London today, it’s that there are many unconsidered lives surviving against the odds. It feels important to tell these kinds of stories today—to hear from people who are often ‘othered’ in a variety of ways—to show a world we don’t see enough of”. \[5.11.\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Swift’s** research deals with the methodology of working with fragmentary poetic texts. This lay at the heart of her collaboration with creative practitioners and Potential Difference Theatre, which has led to a series of artistic collaborations, events, and outputs between 2014 and 2020. The research has had significant impact on creative processes in a range of areas, both within the group that was directly involved and more broadly in the sector. The research has given rise to new creative outputs and new methods of working. It has also contributed to economic prosperity in the creative sector through work created and funds generated. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Swift’s** Leverhulme\-funded work on fragmentary literary texts **\[G1\]** from the ancient world has revolutionised understanding of the authors on which she works. Literary fragments may preserve a whole passage or poem, but are usually much less complete, consisting of out\-of\-context quotations, or remnants of a damaged papyrus. In working with texts such as these, **Swift’s** work has addressed the methodological questions of dealing with fragmentation, and the dilemma a scholar faces of how far to go in reconstructing what came in the gaps. 

 **Swift’s** 2019 landmark edition and commentary on Archilochus **\[O1\]** involves a thorough engagement with these methodological issues: she produced her own text, which supersedes the classic edition of Martin West, differing from it in many passages, and including new fragments not previously identified as Archilochean. Archilochus survives in over three hundred fragments, ranging from single words to poems of more than fifty lines. **Swift’s** critical edition required constant choices about how much to supplement or emend the text as transmitted. Doing so can assist the reader by clarifying the train of thought and the logic of the narrative. Yet supplementation runs the risk of imposing the editor’s own unconscious assumptions and biases onto the text. **Swift** deals with similar issues in the commentary section, where for each fragment she attempts to extract as much contextual and literary information as possible, to present each fragment’s value as a source. However, building an argument on such scant information is risky, and requires difficult decisions as to how much speculation is legitimate. Because this major edition and commentary defines access to a text for a generation, the expert handling of these methodological questions were crucial to the success of the volume, as well as to its influence on students and scholars who work with it. 

 Several of **Swift’s** articles deal with similar questions of how far scholars can legitimately go in reconstructing the argument of lost poems, and what the payoff can be. For example, her 2014 article on the recently discovered Telephus Elegy **\[O2\]** reconstructs damaged sections to hint at a political agenda behind an apparently pedestrian retelling of a myth. Similarly, her 2018 article on the new Sappho **\[O3\]** tries to make sense of the poem by reading it in comparison with other texts about brother\-pairs. These questions of how scholars should handle fragmentation, and what we are choosing when we fill in gaps, form the cornerstone of her artistic collaboration with Potential Difference Theatre, and are at the heart of the play *Fragments* she has co\-written with them, which was successful in gaining funding from the Arts Council.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Impact on Creative Processes 

 Since 2014, **Swift** has been embedded in a team of artists assembled by Potential Difference Theatre \(PD\) on a project called *Fragments*. This has been a cultural endeavour over 6 years, exploring how fragmentation and the process of working with fragments relates to everyday human experience, and how it can be represented artistically. The project has generated new types of creative practice, and new methods of collaboration between academics and artists. The artistic team, mainly freelancers employed by PD on the project, included actors, puppeteers, set/costume designers, lighting and sound designers, musicians, a composer, a dramaturg, a lyricist, and a writer/director. **Swift’s** position as a co\-creator within the team, rather than simply as a consultant, allowed her to have deeper impact on the artistic process. PD attest that this relationship has helped them “ *manifest a new creative process for the company*”, which will have “ *lasting impact*” on how they develop work, and that it “ *led to the discovery of several innovative ways of representing ideas*” **\[C1\]**. Tom Espiner, a performer involved since 2014, comments that **Swift’s** research “ *brought in the key initial starting point*” for the project **\[C2\]**, while the visual designer on the project, Lucy Sierra, commented that her presence “ *allowed for a completely different way of thinking*” and “ *reframed my understanding of the ancient material and helped me focus on how to connect it to our artistic goals*” **\[C3\]**. 

 Individual artists who took part in workshops or productions report that their engagement with **Swift’s** research led to a change in their practice. For example, Tom Espiner reports that the idea of fragmentation now “ *seems to be permeating everything into everything that I’m doing*” **\[C4\]**. The team organised workshops in October 2018 and February 2020 on how assembling texts from fragments could be realised aesthetically. They created a range of visual techniques to represent papyri and the texts they preserve, using shadow puppetry performed with abstract shapes, and object manipulation. These replicated the effect of piecing information together from fragments, encouraging the viewer’s mind to fill in gaps to infer meaning. As part of this, **Swift** and the artists collaborated with an Oxford\-based neuroscientist to investigate parallels between her work and scientific research on how sensory perception arises from the brain creating meaning out of fragmented information. Throughout the workshops, the artists and **Swift** engaged in conversations drawing on her research to explore the practicalities of working with papyri, and the intellectual steps by which a scholar makes decisions about a text. The artists then tried to devise techniques to represent this physically and visually. Thus, the form of this artistic practice grew out of discussions about the research methodology. Jess Mabel Jones, freelance performer and puppeteer who acted as the puppetry consultant for the project, states that “ *Laura’s research on fragments set up the parameters for the whole artistic project*”. She further attests that the new techniques she created as a result of these discussions have been career\-defining, stating “ *the insights I gained through engaging with Laura’s research have \[…\] shaped my development as a puppeteer, since it has led to me developing a specialism in collage and abstract images of a type that are unique in my field*” **\[C5\]**. These techniques have become an important part of her practice, so much so that she has gone on to use them in later work. Tom Espiner comments on how the ideas he developed during the *Fragments* collaboration fed back into and influenced his work on other projects \(a play his company has developed and performed about sight\-loss called ‘Going Dark’, his work on the stage version of ‘Life of Pi’, and the opera of ‘The Little Match Girl’\) **\[C2\]**. He also attests that it has influenced his teaching of drama students, as well as his work on sound design and as a Foley artist working on cinematic sound **\[C2\]**. Lucy Sierra states that her engagement with **Swift’s** research on fragments has stimulated a new interest in sensory perception and inferring meaning from partial information, which has taken her work as a freelancer in new directions **\[C3\]**. 

 The research\-driven nature of the collaboration has created new relationships between the artists and other partners across the academic and museums sector. The Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Collection and British Library agreed to host the artistic team for a tour of their collections, while the British Library also invited them to develop a public event showcasing their new creative techniques \(this would have taken place in March 2020: see Covid statement\). The British Museum invited selected artists in to attend special sessions on conservation technique. PD’s testimonial describes the value of these relationships in communicating with new audiences and **\[C1\]**, while Jess Mabel Jones states that “ *as an artist from a working class background \[…\] I wouldn’t have known how to have had these conversations with very specific practitioners in their field*”, and comments on the “ *greater network*” it has led to, calling it “ *invaluable*” **\[C4\]**. The creative team organised a Knowledge Exchange Forum in July 2018, which allowed them to share their new process with a wider group of practitioners, mainly drawn from theatre and spoken word. Participants at that event attest to the impact that learning about this methodology had on their own practice, and on their future plans. For example, Josephine Balmer, a prominent poet and translator who attended the day, writes “ *I found that my own creative practice has been transformed by my interactions with the Fragments project*” **\[C6\]**. She further explains how it led directly to her establishing a new collaboration with an academic, which itself culminated in a performance event and a new poetry collection soon to be published **\[C6\]**. The impact on the poetry world is further evidenced by Balmer’s invitation to feature the project and script from the 2017 production in the prestigious poetry magazine ‘The High Window’ in a special edition in December 2018 **\[C7\]**. Similarly, the Artistic Director of Penned in the Margins, an independent arts organisation, writes of the “ *real benefits to the production*” that he believes the type of collaboration pioneered by the *Fragments* team can bring, and states that as a result of the Forum he is “ *considering how \[this model\] could be adapted to our own future productions*” **\[C8\]**. Thus, the creative collaboration enabled by **Swift’s** research has had a significant impact on the individual artists involved, and has subsequently begun to reach more widely through the sector. Indeed, PD attest that other theatre companies now seek their advice on how to construct partnerships in higher education, which demonstrates the impact of the new methodology on creative industries **\[C1\]**. 

###  Impact on Creative Outputs 

 **Swift’s** research inspired the *Fragments* project from its outset and has led to the co\-creation of several new cultural artefacts, most notably two new play scripts, the first performed to approximately 150 people in 2017 **\[C9\]**, and the second workshopped collaboratively between 2018\-2020 \(the final performance, due in May 2020, has been postponed due to the Coronavirus pandemic: see Covid statement\). To create the scripts, artists were asked to devise scenes or characters around a set of research ideas presented by **Swift** on different types of fragmented texts, or how scholars work with them. This formed the basis of a first written draft, subsequently improvised around by the artists, until a finalised version was agreed upon. Thus, the research ideas were deeply embedded into the writing process. 

 As an example, in the 2017 play, the artists chose to improvise and then develop a scene exploring how far a scholar should speculate when filling in gaps in a fragmented text, versus insisting on exact parallels. The actors devised characters of an older PhD supervisor and a talented but inexperienced student: the supervisor reproaches his student for making suggestions without sufficient evidence “ *You can't just suggest something was in the text because you like the sound of it*”, while the student objects that insisting on exact parallels means “ *we just have to re\-create the plays we already have*”, and argues “ *It's poetry. Isn't that the point? It’s creative*” **\[C9\]**. The same script contains a scene where a tragic fragment is reconstructed in a range of ways from the plausible to the absurd, inspired by conversations about the process for conjecturing how a lacuna can be filled. Thus, the scene begins with the plausible supposition that a fragment \(from the prologue of Euripides’ play *Cresphontes*\) depicted the young hero speaking to a gatekeeper about recent events in the kingdom. As other characters in the play object to aspects of reconstruction \(raising issues genuinely posed by scholars working on the papyrus\) the scene repeatedly resets to take account of their objections, with each new hypothesis becoming increasingly unlikely, until the ancient characters find themselves in modern and comic settings such as drunk in a bar, or in a hotel corridor **\[C9\]**. During the 2018\-20 workshops, the artists further responded to **Swift’s** research by creating new physical, visual, and auditory techniques to represent fragmentation, such as scenes occurring partly off\-stage, the use of objects, lighting, and screens to occlude audience sightlines, and sound effects based on creating gaps in a piece of audio, or layering fragmented sound effects over each other to invite the listener to make connections between them. Thus the research influenced not only the text of the plays, but inspired an assortment of staging, visual, and sound techniques, all of which are creative outputs in their own right, since they represent the professional work of artists such as sound and set designers, composers, and directors impacted upon by the underpinning research. The designer Lucy Sierra commented when interviewed that she would previously have felt intimidated by the idea of fragmentation in a performance context, but that engaging with **Swift’s** research gave her newfound confidence to represent the idea visually **\[C4\]**. 

 Since 2014, the *Fragments* project has generated participatory discussions and workshops to around 175 people: a mixture of drama students at East 15 Acting School \(who worked on ideas inspired by the project as a two\-day workshop during their MA course\), creative industry professionals, other academics, and the general public **\[C1\]**. As PD note, the long life of the project has also led to “ *unusually deep relationships with the artists involved*” **\[C1\]**; this has enhanced the level of impact on their work, and has also created new opportunities, leading to two new artistic projects, and to a collaborator joining the company as an associate artist **\[C1\]**. These new projects have been influenced by *Fragments* in adopting research\-driven methodologies and have generated both new research and artistic outputs. For example, the strong bond within the artistic team of *Fragments*, combined with the interruption to the project caused by the closure of theatres in March 2020 led to the artists creating a series of discussions about the impact of Covid\-19 on the theatre industry. Because of their previous research relationship with **Swift**, the artists decided that this new work too would benefit from a research angle, and so these discussions became part of a new research project for **Swift**, whose work with the group was awarded a special research grant from the British Academy of GBP8,835, and resulted in a socially distanced outdoor performance in early November 2020. This research collaboration and its creative outputs \(audio visual assets and art installation\) has now been selected to feature as a special exhibit in the British Academy’s Summer Showcase in 2021. This will be held digitally, as was the case for the 2020 Showcase, whose exhibits attracted 3,600 views within the first 48 hours, and the Academy expects similar if not greater reach this year. The British Academy also promotes the Showcase exhibits to a selected VIP audience of approximately 500 people including senior figures from cultural organisations, funders, politicians, senior government figures, and members of the press. Thus, the new form of collaboration with **Swift** has now led to a new approach to later work, and this approach is featured by the British Academy as a highlight of their year in terms of ability to influence and engage the public and policymakers **\[C11\]**. 

###  Economic Impact on the Creative Sector 

 The collaboration, informed by **Swift’s** research, has contributed to economic prosperity via the creative sector. PD describe the process as having “ *had a transformative impact on the business model of the company*” **\[C1\]**. The level to which research was embedded in the project was crucial in its funding success. This was not only because the relationship with **Swift** gave the project credibility and allowed it to fulfil its artistic goals, but also because the rigour in the research\-relationship was transformative in terms of opening doors with funders and with other partners such as the British Library and British Academy. This is attested both by PD’s testimonial, and by the Arts’ Council’s feedback on their successful application in 2019 \(for GBP20,686\). The Arts Council names the research relationship with **Swift** specifically as one reason for supporting the project, and comments that a further reason for support is that “ *earlier phases have been developed with input from partners*” \(i.e. **Swift**\) **\[C10\]**. It is highly unusual for partners or academic consultants to be mentioned in this way. Over the six years of the project’s life, it has provided around 500 days of employment for 26 freelance actors, designers, producers and stage management. It has brought in over GBP50,000 through grant applications, and this provided the majority of PD’s turnover in the 2017/18 and 2019/20 financial years. Moreover, the expenditure on production costs has further generated around GBP9,000 in Theatre Tax Relief, money which will be channelled into getting new artistic projects off the ground and pump\-priming them to a stage when they too can generate funding. For context, GBP9,000 is enough to cover PD’s core operating costs for around 1.5 years, and the project will generate a significant portion more in the following REF cycle. The financial security this offers has allowed PD to increase the ambition and output of their other projects, and thus the economic contribution of *Fragments* has enabled other artistic endeavours to flourish **\[C1\]**. Finally, the fact *Fragments* continued in online form in 2020 allowed PD to continue offering paid work to their freelancers during the pandemic when theatres were closed, which they note was “ *so important in helping them maintain their artistic identity during a period that has been devastating for the performing arts”* **\[C1\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ICMEC \(International Centre for the Study of the Mixed Economy of childcare\) interrogates policies and proposes strategies to mitigate childcare marketisation risks to disadvantaged children’s access to quality early childhood education and care \(ECEC\). It explores alternatives to marketised ECEC to benefit children’s life chances and economic wellbeing within low\-income families. ICMEC’s research influences UK and international policy law and services by working with policy makers, informing public debate, and influencing the ECEC sector’s operations and strategies.  More equitable early childhood education and care systems contribute to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 10, reduced inequalities within and between countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 ICMEC, a multi\-disciplinary research centre, was established in 2007 by Professors Penn and Lloyd to survey policy\-relevant evidence about the impact of the marketisation of early childhood education and care systems. As the only UK research centre specialising in this area, it serves as an on\-line meeting point for scholars researching developments within mixed economies of childcare \( **R1**\), with research associates across six continents. ICMEC’s primary focus is on strategies and policies to improve access to high quality and affordable provision within marketised ECEC systems \( **R1**, **R5**\). 

  

 Inadequate childcare can have a devastating influence on young children’s wellbeing, development and life chances \( **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\). England’s ECEC reflects growing marketisation which diminishes its intended policy purpose. Most ECEC provision for children aged nought to five is now delivered by private childcare businesses, including day nurseries and childminders \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). According to 2020 official statistics, 66% of three\-year\-olds and 86% of eligible disadvantaged two\-year\-olds received their subsidised early education in private sector provision, mostly for\-profit childcare businesses. Almost a quarter of four\-year olds also did so, but most attended primary Reception classes. These businessesdelivered additional childcare hours employed parents required for these age groups and for under threes. The burgeoning private childcare market shows increasing financialisaton, where heavily indebted private for\-profit childcare groups, owned by international investors, finance their expansion to the detriment of disadvantaged children’s equitable access \( **R2**, **R3**\). The pandemic has increased ECEC sustainability and equity risks linked to this trend \( **S6**\). 

  

 ECEC’s systemic weakness contributes to the disadvantage that increasing numbers of young children experience \( **R6**\). Official UK poverty figures confirm families with children are bearing the brunt of rising poverty. Across the UK over four million children now live in poverty, almost one in three, with under\-fives making up 53% of this total. Poverty affects over two million young children, jeopardizing their present and future well\-being. 

  

 ICMEC’s research highlights the growing dominance of the private\-for\-profit sector among ECEC providers in the UK, European Union, OECD member states and elsewhere, and its negative effect on children’s equitable access to affordable, high quality services. \( **R1**, **R4**\). ICMEC’s research into childcare marketisation’s impact and alternatives to marketisation or mitigating policies has reached a wide national and international policymaker, professional and academic audience \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\). 

  

 An ICMEC commission from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation \(JRF\), an influential independent social change organisation working to solve UK poverty, illustrates ICMEC’s policy influence. In 2014, JRF commissioned 33 evidence reviews of existing policy research across a range of areas to inform an anti\-poverty strategy for the UK. Eva Lloyd reviewed evidence for the links between early childhood education and care and poverty \( **R4**\). JRF published each review’s findings \( **R4**\), while the researchers’ academic institutions published their long reports. This evidence informed public and parliamentary debates on poverty eradication.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **ICMEC’s contribution to national policy, debate and awareness** 

 The 2014 House of Lords Select Committee on Affordable Childcare used ICMEC’s evidence. Its report cited ICMEC research to scrutin **i**ze proposed and existing early years legislation and make recommendations to Government \( **S1**\). For instance, recommendations 42 and 45 clearly reflected findings from ICMEC research cited in paragraph 39 and in Annex A’s section on OECD comparisons of childcare costs and public spending on childcare. 

  

 ICMEC made a significant contribution to the implementation of the 2015 Conservative Government’s flagship 30 hours free childcare policy. Lloyd was advisor for three evaluations in this policy’s evolution \( **S2**\). Changes to the evolving policy led to a better ECEC experience for young children. 

  

 ICMEC’s research and international seminar series have frequently prompted  requests to its director for further face\-to\-face meetings, including with HM Treasury, the Department for Education, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Cabinet Office Open Innovation team,  the National Audit Office, the Social Mobility Commission, the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Poverty, the Children and Families Directorate of the Scottish Government, several Labour Party Shadow Early Years ministers, Glasgow City Council and LB Islington. These consultations heightened policymaker awareness of the risk to equitable ECEC access from the private\-for\-profit sector’s rapid expansion and led to research commissions \( **R4,** **R6, S6**\). 

  

 ICMEC also informs research and campaigning to promote equitable ECEC access through contributions to publications produced by national NGOs and charities, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation \( **R4**\) and the Child Poverty Action Group \(CPAG\) \( **R5**\). Reports by the Resolution Foundation and the New Economics Foundation both reference ICMEC research \( **S3**\). In a 2016 CPAG publication \( **R5**\), published in the run\-up to the Conservative government’s life chances strategy launch, Lloyd and others argued that improving children’s life changes was impossible without addressing child poverty, further contributing to policy debate. 

  

 To foster public debate ICMEC shares research findings with UK practitioner and general audiences via articles in practitioner magazines, presentations to policymaker and practitioner audiences and media contributions through  [blogs](file:///D:/blogs) \( **S6**\), articles \( **S7**\) and interviews. In 2020 alone, through articles on the BBC News website, in *The Week* and in *the New Stateman*, ICMEC’s research reached a combined daily audience of more than 26 million. 

  

 **ICMEC’s contribution to international communities** 

 ICMEC engages with international communities, NGOs and policy makers through various communication avenues, including childcare quality improvement organisation Bureau Kwaliteit Kinderopvang \(the Netherlands\); childcare umbrella organisation Start Strong \(Ireland\), the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Bavarian State Institute for Early Childhood Research and the German Youth Institute \(Germany\). Three country examples evidence this impact. 

  

 <ins>Ireland/Eire</ins> 

  

 Penn and Lloyd contributed a review of international policies and strategies to reduce childcare markets’ equity risks to a 2014 report \( **S4**\) by Irish early years umbrella organisation *Start Strong*. The report informed Irish early childhood policy development. This work generated an invitation to Lloyd to speak at a 2015 Dublin ECEC policy seminar organised by the Irish Department of Children and Youth Affairs. This meeting resulted in the 2018 launch of Ireland’s first major ECEC policy document: *First 5*. 

  

 In 2019, the Irish Minister of Children and Youth Affairs invited Lloyd to join an independent Expert Group tasked with developing a new funding model for early learning and childcare and out\-of\-school care. Facilitated by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs \(now the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth\), this group is directly responsible for shaping Irish early childhood policy \( **S4**\).

 Lloyd collaborated with the Dutch Social and Economic Council \(SER\) on a review of Dutch ECEC and to help formulate its recommendations. In 2015, she addressed the SER international expert meeting launching this review. SER’s 2016 report contains a case study of the UK \(section 4.3\) reflecting and citing Lloyd’s input, acknowledging her contribution to the expert meeting \(SER, 2016, p. 177\) and references ICMEC research \( **S5**\). 

  

 Next, SER commissioned a comparative study of European ECEC systems, with Lloyd authoring the comparison with England’s early childhood policies and systems \(SEO, 2020, p. 54\). This report for SER directly informed Dutch early childhood policymaking \( **S5**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel research has supported the growth of a green technology business that produces decking from wood polymer composite incorporating waste products. Having started as a small importation business, by 2017 Brunel research had helped Ecodek develop into a company worth GBP8,500,000 manufacturing durable, recyclable decking in the UK and selling its products across the UK and worldwide. 

 It now employs over 50 staff, manufacturing 1,000,000 linear metres of decking per annum, consuming 3,600t of sustainably sourced wood and recycled plastic \(including the equivalent of over 100,000,000 4\-pint milk bottles\) whilst locking up 600,000 kgCO<sub>2</sub> each year. The decking has now been used in over 6,000 projects, including a number of high\-profile prestige projects, such as the Jumeirah Residence Beach Walkway in Dubai, the London Olympic Stadium and Prime Place Greenwich. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Mizi Fan’s long\-standing collaboration with Vannplastic and Ecodek has enabled the company to develop the technology to produce decking from wood polymer composite \(WPC\) and hence become the UK’s leading decking manufacturer and supplier. 

 A key focus of the research has been the use of waste products to create the composite as well as ensuring that the decking is recyclable \[Ref 1\]. To enhance the sustainability of WPCs and alleviate the resource competition with other industrial sectors, Prof Fan developed a research programme which explored the use of waste tyre rubber as a potential source material to create Rubber\-Wood\-Plastic Composites \(RubWPC\). In 2013 Brunel led an EU FP7 R&D project, RubWPC, collaborating with Ecodek and other partners \[Ref 2\]. 

 In this research the Brunel team developed new mixture designs, determined the structure and bonding mechanism, and established the complex structure\-property relationship of RubWPC. These were then transferred to the Ecodek research facility for further testing on the test production line before being scaled up for commercial production. 

 Further research continued into other potential materials. In 2016 Brunel and Ecodek collaborated in the EU funded SMART\-Plant and GelClad research projects which sought to create new generations of WPC using both biopolymer and bio/renewable fibres with minimal environmental impacts. These projects aimed at replacing the extensively used oil\-based thermoplastics in WPC by using bioplastics, such as Polyhydroxyalkanoates \(PHA\) and Poly\(lactic acid\) \(PLA\). A highly novel cost\-effective, durable industrialised and easy to install composite insulation cladding system was developed and implemented \(GELCLAD cladding,   [https://www.gelclad.eu/](https://www.gelclad.eu/) \) \[Ref 3\]. 

 The Brunel research group has also sought to address the major challenges of fire and other properties of cellulosic\-bioplastics materials \[Ref 4\], intrinsic incompatibility and insufficient interfacial bonding between the raw material constituents \[Ref 2,5\], and processing difficulties of bioplastics on existing compounding/extrusion line \[Ref 3,6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Ecodek is now the leading company for extruded wood polymer composite \(WPC\) decking in the UK and the only one which manufactures its products in the UK. A carbon negative organisation, Ecodek was founded in 2002 and was purchased by the Epwin Group for GBP8,500,000 in 2015 \[S1\].  By 2017 they were manufacturing around 1,000,000 linear metres of decking per year consuming 3,600t of sustainably sourced wood and recycled plastic \[S2, S3\].  The Founder and Former Managing Director of Ecodek stated \[S1\], that Professor Fan’s research 

 *“was fundamental to the company’s technical development and growth and underpinned development of the Ecodek product range”.* 

 The composite material which is used for all of Ecodek’s products, would not have been achievable without the initial research and subsequent development work of Prof Fan and his team \[S1, S3\]. This longstanding relationship between Professor Fan and the company has been key to the success of the products that it has developed. 

 Each year the Ecodek manufacturing process locks up 600,000kgCO<sub>2</sub>, the equivalent of 300,000 trees per year. 

 **Developing products with a sustainable lifecycle** 

 Ecodek manufactures its products from recycled waste materials \(98%\) – primarily plastic \(HDPE\) with sustainably sourced or waste wood\- and its products are 100% recyclable and will be bought back by the company for reuse. The company only sends 2% of its waste to landfill and aiming to reduce this to 0%. 

 The company prides itself on creating a product that is sustainable. In 2016 the company used the equivalent of 100,000,000 recycled \(4 pint\) milk bottles in its decking, ensuring that the plastic did not get sent to landfill, and will be recycled again at the end of its life as decking \[S3\]. The Ecodek product range has been assessed by Bangor University to be carbon negative due to the net effect of removing carbon from the atmosphere. 

 Professor Fan’s expertise in materials and composites enabled the company to develop its own algorithms for agile additive solutions allowing them to adapt to variable qualities of HDPE feedstock. Ecodek was able to accept a wider range of waste materials from recycling companies, which allowed them to move away from using virgin HDPE in its formulas. 

 In addition, Ecodek is able to offer a waste buyback scheme: returned waste, off\-cut, old\-stock or unused Ecodek decking are bought back, recycled and used again. 

 **Building in\-house research and development capabilities** 

 The EU funded RubWPC project was the catalyst for Ecodek to develop their own in\-house capabilities. Prior to this, technical development was the responsibility of one of the founding partners. The project *“enabled the company to invest in technical staff as well as create a dedicated in\-house laboratory as well as a small test production line. The lab was equipped with DSE, FTIR and a UTM in order to test tensile strength, all of which enabled us to develop our product range and factory quality control.”* \[S1\] 

 The company was able to recruit a technical manager and a lab technician in 2014 and 2015 to conduct the research with Brunel and they remained following the project. The ongoing relationship between Professor Fan and his team and the Ecodek team has meant that the staff based at Ecodek have been able to increase the capabilities of their in\-house research and development laboratory. In particular, the company now has facilities and capabilities to test their product durability to more formal, industrial standards. The Technical Manager said \(in a private communication\) that “working with Prof Fan had forced changes, in a good way”, leading to an expansion of the skill sets employed at Ecodek and growing the technical department. 

 Ongoing research and development on the consistency of the polymer has been a necessary part of the Ecodek story as the availability and composition of the feedstock varies. In 2016, Ecodek used over 100,000,000 recycled 4\-pint milk bottles in their product \[S3\].  As a result of Prof Fan’s research, the company has developed an ability to respond to changing source materials, such as variations in the thickness of the bottles, which can vary between 0.3\-0.66mm.  Additional research on the consistency of the product material has expanded to testing of other recyclable materials, including gypsum, glass, hemp, agricultural waste, film waste and HDPE waste. 

 **Growing the Company** 

 From its formation in 2002, Ecodek has grown from a small operation that imported its product to a local manufacturer of environmentally\-friendly decking that was sold across the UK and the world. 

 In 2014 Vannplastic Ltd \(trading as Ecodek\) made an operating profit of GBP600,000. Ecodek was acquired by Epwin Group plc in November 2015 for GBP8,500,000. Epwin Group’s operational profit for the year to 31 December 2016 was GBP24,000,000 up from GBP19,100,000 in 2015. The increased material input costs as a result of continuing weakness of sterling against both the US Dollar and the Euro resulted in an operating profit of GBP22,300,000 in 2017 \[S3, S4\]. 

 Based in Wrexham, North Wales, Ecodek has grown from a small company in 2002 with only one production line to a company with 4 full production lines staffed by 50 staff 24 hours a day. The research and development team has grown from just the founding partner to a team of 6 staff with relevant technical knowledge and skill. Both the Founder and the Technical Manager of Ecodek attribute this growth to the work with Prof Fan \[S1,S3\]. 

 New products and innovative solutions have been developed as a result of Fan’s research findings which address the difficulties of mixing recyclable materials and maintaining consistency, thereby sustaining the business in the market. In addition to decking, Ecodek’s product range has expanded to facades, sub\-structure support beams for decks, and motorway sound barriers. All of these products use the composite materials developed in collaboration with Prof. Fan \[S3,S4\]. 

 **Ecodek products in use** 

 The weather resilience of Ecodek products means that they have an international appeal and are in use by clients across the globe, whether direct to consumers or through builders’ merchants such as Travis Perkins, including: 

 Dubai, UAE – Ecodek designed and developed a specific substructure for the Jumeirah Beach Walkway which would withstand the rigors of the climate. The walkway runs 14km along the UAE’s Persian Gulf coastline. At 1.7km “JBR The Walk” was designed as part of the Jumeirah Beach Residence, a hotel and shopping area with 15,000 residents in one of the most developed areas of Dubai. The final delivery of substructure was made in 2017. The Walk is one of Dubai’s most famous tourist attractions. Brunel’s research on wood polymer composite was used in this construction \[S1, S3\]. 

 London, UK – Ecodek decking was installed around the outside of the London 2012 Olympic stadium. As part of the legacy of the London Olympic Games, the park, stadium and other facilities have been converted and have been in continuous use since 2012. With over 5,700,000 visitors \[S5\] to the stadium since 2013 and its rebranding as the permanent home of British Athletics and West Ham United, the unique design benefits of Ecodek decking, including sustainability and durability, continue to be effectively demonstrated in this high traffic area. West Ham reported total attendance of 1,238,318 for the 22 games of the 2018/19 season \[S6\]. Following the end of the 2018/19 football season, the stadium hosted over 242,000 visitors at concerts, athletics meetings and baseball matches \[S3, S7\]. Again, this product had been developed with research from Brunel \[S1, S3\]. 

 Other prestige projects that have used decking manufactured by Ecodek include the Old Bailey London, Royal Wharf Docklands, Mann Island Liverpool and RSPB Weymouth \[S8\]. In total, Ecodek products have been used on over 6,000 projects. 

 **Sustainability in UK Housing Developments** 

 A key market for Ecodek products has been high rise housing developments with balconies across the UK as the decking can be manufactured to the exact size of the outdoor spaces. This reduces wastage in terms of having to re\-cut standard lengths and also saves time in the installation of the product. By 2015, approximately 65% of Ecodek’s sales were to housing developers, such as Barratt Homes and Taylor Wimpey. An example of such a development is Prime Place Greenwich which utilised 6 tonnes of decking \[S9\]. The bespoke nature of the manufacturing meant that at 360 Barking, another London development, Ecodek was able to supply lengths of decking at very specific lengths e.g. 7m, 5.73m, 4.9m, 3.75m and 1.9m, leading to minimal waste for the developer \[S10\]. Owners of the properties in these developments value the weather\-proofing and durability of the decking, which come with a 25\-year guarantee.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Alice Mesnard’s research uses a novel market\-based economic modelling approach to influence policy making and discourses in two distinct areas: \(1\) cannabis legalisation and \(2\) illegal migration. Using laws of supply, demand, and competition, the model was applied to the cannabis market, and in 2019 the French government used Mesnard’s research as the basis for a new policy on the legalisation of cannabis, currently being debated by Members of the National Assembly. The model was initially used to design migrant visa schemes, aimed at weakening human smuggling markets. The resulting schemes for permanent visas for highly skilled workers and temporary visas for lower skilled workers are informing policy debates at the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development, the UK Home Office, and the World Bank. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **2.1 Background** 

 Dr Mesnard has developed a novel approach to address two complex and controversial policy problems, firstly, migration and human smuggling and, secondly, the \(illegal\) market for cannabis. The modelling applies economic conventions such as ‘supply and demand’, ‘competition’ and ‘pricing strategies’ to the ‘markets’ for human smuggling and cannabis. The main novelty of the approach is that it takes into account the competitive response of smugglers to prohibition or legalisation policies, which highlights some drawbacks of past policies and suggests innovative ways forward **\[3.2\-3.6\]**. 

 **2.2 Research on human smuggling** 

 Dr Mesnard’s background research focuses on the design of migration policies to improve human development and studies the effects of temporary guest\-worker programmes on illegal labour markets in destination countries **\[3.1\]** and on labour markets in origin countries such as Tunisia, to which she devoted her PhD dissertation. She extended this research in collaboration with Professor Auriol \(Toulouse School of Economics\), an expert in industrial organisation, to design policies to tackle the large\-scale problem of human smuggling – in 2016 it was estimated 2.5 million migrants were smuggled for an economic return of USD5.5 billion \(United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\) **\[3.2\]**. 

 Their market\-based theoretical model studies how to regulate the flows of economic migrants by selling visas, while at the same time driving human smugglers out of business **\[3.2\]**. They model how smugglers adapt their strategy by offering low\-cost services to compete with increased legal channels or by increasing fees in response to enforcement against illegal activities. They identify a policy predicament, which is that *either* you eliminate smugglers by increasing legal work visas, at the cost of increasing migration, *or* you restrict flows by enforcing border controls, which fuels smugglers’ businesses and fosters criminal cartels. The model demonstrates that through fine\-tuning a pricing strategy for permanent visas, prices can be set to both suppress smugglers’ activities *and* control the flows of migrants. This combines selling visas at ‘eviction’ prices – driving smugglers out of the market – with increased sanctions against human smuggling and illegal working **\[3.2\]**. As a result, high\-skilled workers are recruited through legal channels and the policy mix generates revenue through the sale of visas and taxes on employment which can be used to finance enforcement. They applied the model to the long\-haul permanent migration of Chinese people to the USA, using secondary data on smugglers’ fees and costs on this route and undocumented workers in the USA. This research **\[3.2\]** was funded by the Norface Research Programme on Migration, as part of the TEMPO project **\[3.7\]**. 

 Following discussions with the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) in 2015 on the absence of policy options for low\-skilled migrants, Mesnard and Auriol extended their model in collaboration with a jointly supervised PhD student, Tiffanie Perrault \(University of Montreal\). They designed a low\-priced temporary visa scheme to recruit low\-skilled workers. Using survey data on smugglers’ fees and costs on the route from Senegal to Europe and on illegal Senegalese workers, they calibrated the model and applied it to this route. The main feature of the extended model **\[3.3\]** is that it would meet labour market needs in specific sectors \(e.g. social care, construction, hospitality\), as identified in most OECD countries . The delivery of temporary visas through this scheme and its enforcement would help address public concerns related to unwillingness to accept more migrants, the permeability of borders to illegal migrants, and the inhumane smuggling market. Currently, Mesnard is part of the interdisciplinary Horizon 2020 MAGYC project **\[3.9\]** appraising a range of policy responses to illegal migration and assessing their efficiency for the long\-term governance of migration. Empirical findings **\[3.4\]** of this project so far are in line with Mesnard’s earlier results **\[3.2, 3.3\]**, highlighting that agreements that increase visa channels for nationals from third countries are likely to be effective policy instruments to reduce illegal migration to Europe. 

 **2.3 Research on the cannabis market** 

 Drug policy internationally can be said to exist on a continuum between prohibition on the one hand, and liberalisation on the other. Mesnard’s research on the cannabis market \(with Auriol and Perrault\) originates in their critical analysis of the unintended consequences of prohibition policies, which saw increased criminality and higher prices, but no weakening of illegal markets. To resolve this prohibition\-legalisation trade\-off, they adapted and applied their market\-based approach to the regulation of cannabis markets **\[3.5\]**. 

 To achieve this, they extended the demand side modelling of risky individual choices to capture behavioural traits which are likely to characterise cannabis consumers. The adapted model is flexible to accommodate consumer distortions in decision making – for example, discounting their probability of being caught or having different risk aversions for gains and losses. It investigates theoretically the different ways legalisation can be implemented to reduce illegal activities and analyses how the objective of defeating crime may conflict with other objectives, such as raising taxes or decreasing cannabis consumption **\[3.6\]**. The various trade\-offs are then illustrated with the help of calibrations. Using US data on cannabis consumption and price, as well as estimates of price elasticities and production costs of cannabis from previous studies, they simulate different pricing scenarios and combinations of policy instruments **\[3.5\] \[3.6\]**. A key finding from this analysis is that the ‘eviction’ prices predicted to drive illegal dealers out of business are much lower than the prices for legal cannabis in the US states that opted for legalisation, which left room for an illegal market to flourish. The cannabis model shows that increasing sanctions on illegal markets combined with improving the quality of certified products introduced in a new legal market allows a government to charge higher ‘eviction’ prices for legal cannabis, which undermine dealers’ profits and viability, while still controlling cannabis use. Uniquely, this novel policy mix combines elements of prohibition, such as enforced sanctions against the illicit market, and legalisation policies – two approaches usually framed as oppositional – in a market\-based approach **\[3.5\] \[ 3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since the migration “crisis” in 2015, Mesnard has widely disseminated her research through media appearances, policy articles and conferences, meetings with policy makers and other stakeholders, policy blogs, as well as academic routes. 

 **4.1 Impact on French government policy on cannabis legalisation** 

 France has a long\-standing policy and regulatory problem with cannabis use – it is the most widely consumed drug in the country despite stringent policies criminalising its recreational use. The country is in the process of approving sweeping new policies with respect to legalising cannabis which are strongly influenced and shaped by Mesnard *et* *al*’s ‘mixed\-policy’ modelling and analysis **\[3.5\] \[3.6\]**. In this respect, Mesnard’s research has led directly to a change in French government policy. 

 This impact originates in Mesnard and co\-authors’ presentations at high\-level international drug policy and practitioner conferences which led the Conseil d’Analyse Economique \(CAE\), the independent committee providing economic advice to the French Prime Minister, to commission a policy paper from Auriol, Mesnard and Perrault to identify policy options to legalise recreational cannabis in France. The paper formed the basis of a Note published by the CAE in June 2019 **\[5.1\]**, setting out policy recommendations on how to organise the legal market for cannabis and set the price for legal cannabis to control consumption. Mesnard’s policy paper and simulations were summarised in Box 3 \[p.9\] of this report and attached to it in full as a Focus **\[5.2\]**. The report acknowledges the direct influence of Mesnard’s work: 

 “We are then faced with a dilemma between eliminating trafficking or limiting consumption. An innovative policy, which combines targeted repressive measures with a policy of legalization at a predatory price, helps to mitigate this problem. The idea is to redeploy police forces and to use part of the tax revenue generated by legalization to intensify the repression of mafia networks. The simulations conducted as part of this Note suggest a price of 9 euros per gram of herbal cannabis \(see Box 3\)” **\[5.1, p.9\].** 

 The CAE report was presented to the French Prime Minister and all Secretaries of State, then launched as Government policy in June 2019. The report received wide coverage in the French media, including the front pages of 30 national newspapers and 9 major regional newspapers in France, as well as international media, such as Reuters and the Huffington Post **\[5.3\]**. It was then debated by Members of the French National Assembly, who set up a Parliamentary Commission to inform and consult the public on the options for and implications of legalising cannabis. 

 The Parliamentary Commission for Economic and Social Affairs met the CAE in July 2019 where the authors of the report explained the research findings and how to set the ‘eviction’ price based on the research **\[3.5\]**. The commission continued to meet during 2020, with some delays due to the pandemic, calling expert evidence to inform their recommendations. The testimonial from the civil servant managing the commission **\[5.4\]** confirms the ongoing importance of the research to the government’s legalisation policy and that Mesnard will give evidence to the commission based on her latest research **\[3.6\]** on how to implement a legal cannabis market in France. Subsequently Mesnard has accepted an invitation to appear before the commission on 10 February 2021. 

 **4.2 Impacts on the international migration debate** 

 Migration policy\-making and regulation is difficult and challenging, highly politically sensitive, and involves complex and inter\-relating factors. For wider society, controlling borders, illegal migration, and the criminal activity of human smugglers are of intense public interest and debate. In this contested arena, Mesnard has actively promoted the mixed\-policy, ‘market’ based proposals of the research **\[3.2\] \[3.3\]** and is having impact by informing policy debates in three areas: \(1\) the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development’s \(OECD\) work on migration, \(2\) the UK’s new post\-Brexit immigration policy, and \(3\) shaping and influencing thinking on migration and human smuggling more widely. 

 The OECD is the international organisation for evidence\-based standards and policies. Working in 100 countries, its global reach means OECD member and partner countries represent about 80% of world trade and investment. The OECD’s work on migration responds to the dynamic international situation through publications, analyses, and policy briefs looking at possible responses to structural drivers and geopolitical shocks. In 2015 Mesnard presented her research **\[3.2\]** to the OECD’s migration specialists. It was reviewed alongside other policy options in an OECD report “Can we put an end to human smuggling?” \(December 2015\), which synthesised available evidence and reviewed policy tools. It emphasised the need to undermine the business model of smugglers and discussed Mesnard’s high\-priced permanent visa proposal in a prominent position **\[5.5, p.11\]**. The report identified a gap in policy options for low\-skilled temporary migrants, which Mesnard and co\-authors addressed in the recent extension of their research on temporary visas **\[3.3\]**. Publication of the OECD report, at the height of the European “migrant crisis”, meant Mesnard’s research was covered extensively in the media in Europe, Africa, and the USA, with Mesnard participating in radio and TV debates, and presenting the research to the Commission for the Study of the European Communities \(CEDECE\). 

 Mesnard’s second strand of impact in this arena involves her contribution to discussions on the UK’s post\-Brexit immigration policy. After her appearance in a public debate about the ethics of the permanent and temporary visa proposals at the University of Louvain \(Belgium\) in late 2018, she was invited by the Chief Economist of the UK Home Office to present her permanent and temporary visa research to analytical and policy officials. The Chief Economist chaired the seminar \(January 2020\) and wrote afterwards: 

 “In the context of a new Government and leaving the European Union, we are currently reviewing key components of the UK’s immigration system. Dr Mesnard’s research on the human smuggling market has contributed to this important policy debate. We hope to hear from Dr Mesnard again as her work in this important field progresses”. **\[5.6\]** 

 As the UK government published its post\-Brexit immigration policy in May 2020, Mesnard presented her permanent and temporary visa proposals at meetings with the Confederation of British Industry and other stakeholders. They were positively received as a way of addressing labour shortages in certain sectors and further discussions are planned ahead of the expected policy review in 2022. 

 Thirdly, the permanent and temporary visa research and mixed\-policy proposals have shaped and influenced policy discussions on migration and human smuggling more widely. In 2015, Mesnard was appointed as Visiting Fellow by the Center for Global Development \(CGD\) a leading US\-based development think tank and commissioned to write a policy paper **\[3.8\]** on her permanent visa proposals **\[5.7\]**. The proposals also featured in a World Bank publication \(2019\) on policies for attracting labour and dealing with the repercussions in both origin and destination countries **\[5.8, p.55\];** a Mercator Dialogue on Asylum and Migration \(a European research\-policy coalition\) paper \(2019, p.2\) on replacing irregular migration across the Mediterranean **\[5.9\];** and an Open Society Foundation \(the world’s largest private funder\) publication on regularising illegal immigrants in Poland \(2020\) **\[5.10, p.3\]**. In September 2020, Mesnard presented the visa proposals **\[3.3\]** to the World Bank/ IZA/ French Agency for Development Conference on Migration and Development. She continues to promote her mixed\-policy proposals to policy and practitioner audiences through events and invited meetings, thereby extending awareness of new ideas to resolve these challenging problems.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research in the Built Environment & Sustainable Technologies \(BEST\) Research Institute at Liverpool John Moores University \(LJMU\) allows sustainable and low\-cost repairs, surfacing and maintenance of the existing asphalt, reducing the need for a complete resurfacing of roads. The application of thin layers postpones major repairs for several years and is suitable for all types of roads, therefore reducing the costs of major reconstruction works as well as reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emission and preventing disruption to infrastructure users. Since developing new products based on the research at LJMU and developed with LJMU, Colas Ltd has increased annual sales by over €7M in the UK and France through laying over 850,000 m<sup>2</sup> of roads in 2018 and 2019 using the new product, with similar projections for 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The LJMU Research Team comprises Professor Hassan Al Nageim \(Lead\) and Dr Clare Harris from the Civil Engineering Department, Linda Seton and Nicola Dempster from the School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences and Dr Howard Robinson, Managing Director of ASI Solutions as an external advisor. This multi\-disciplinary team, supported by seven PhD students, have spent twenty years at LJMU working in the field of improving the properties of hot mix asphalt \(HMA\), culminating in 2 granted patents \(PT1 and PT2\). The research behind these patents sparked interest and collaboration with companies including Colas Ltd, Tarmac Ltd, and Velocity UK Ltd. This collaboration led to the team’s research focusing on \(i\) zero CO<sub>2</sub> emission cold mix asphalt \(CMA\) using secondary cementitious materials \(SCM\), \(ii\) micro\-asphalt \(EF1\), and \(iii\) bituminous emulsions for roads and highways surfacing \(EF2\). 

 The team responded to environmental and industry needs, namely: \(i\) sustainable development \(the use of CMA to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to 85% and a reduction of fume exposure by 100%\); \(ii\) asphalt production improvements \(simplified cold mix plants, produced on site \(i.e. mobile plant\), longer storage period\); \(iii\) cost effectiveness \(no heating for storage or mixing, use of industrial waste materials\); \(iv\) improving engineering properties \(high stiffness modulus, high rutting resistance and high fatigue resistance\); and \(v\) improving durability compared to traditional hot mix asphalt \(high resistance to rainfall and water\). 

 The team focused in particular on researching the properties of CMA \(Cold Mix Asphalt\), which can be prepared and constructed at ambient temperature, is cheaper to produce, easier to transport and has no health and safety issues compared to HMA. This was achieved by experimenting with different waste streams to formulate new cold bituminous emulsion mixtures \(CBEM\) \(UR1\) similar to what had been achieved with HMA in PT1 and PT2. This then led to experiments comparing the mechanical strengths between these new mixes along with the traditional HMA methods \(UR2\) and then comparing different waste streams to improve the curing times of CMA to make it comparable to HMA \(UR3\). The combined lab results of all of these components are reported in UR4, which was the start of a KTP \(EF1\) with Colas Ltd taking this research forward to a new product for Colas. 

 Hot mix asphalt produces 221kg of CO<sub>2</sub> / tonne during the mixing and paving process, whereas CMA has zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during mixing and paving. The UK produces 26 million tonnes of HMA per year. However, to date and since 1957 when CMA was first introduced in the USA, conventional CMA has not had the durability and mechanical strength of HMA and has a long curing time \(2\-24 months\) and is therefore restricted for use only in footways and lightweight trafficked pavements. In response to a request from the Tarmac R&D Managing Director in 2000, to explore green and cheap technologies to challenge the restrictions imposed by road engineers on the use of conventional CMA, the LJMU research team provided, for the first time worldwide, CMA containing secondary cementitious materials from waste ashes suitable for road and highways asphalt structural layers with a curing time of less than 1 day, a stiffness modulus 27 times more than a mixture with commercial limestone dust after 3 days, and with significant resistance to rutting in wheel\-track tests at high temperatures. These results are much better than the two grades of hot asphalt concrete binder course \(currently used by road engineers\) meaning it can carry heavy traffic loads in hot climate conditions. 

 The research team continued to research and develop a new fast\-curing and environmentally friendly cold asphalt concrete for binder courses mixture \(CACB\) following the success of EF1. The result \(UR5 and UR6\) is a mix that has the same gradation as that of traditional hot asphalt concrete mixtures but incorporates a binary blended cementitious filler \(BBCF\) containing waste, high calcium fly ash \(HCFA\) and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue \(FC3R\) activated by a waste alkaline NaOH solution. The benefits of the new mixture are significantly improved mechanical properties including water susceptibility, and a substantially lower thermal sensitivity than traditional hot asphalt concrete binder course mixtures.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact has been through: \(i\) the development and commercialisation of a product \(COLBIFIBRE\) in the UK and EU, with annual sales of over 7m EU in 2018 and 2019, and \(ii\) the development of another novel product \(Colbond 50X Emulsion\), which has recently gone into production. 

 **\(i\) Sale of products in the UK and EU \(COLBIFIBRE\)** 

 LJMU’s previous research involving experimentation with different waste streams to formulate new cold bituminous emulsion mixtures \(CBEM\)\(UR1\), comparing the mechanical strengths between these new mixes along with the traditional HMA methods \(UR2\) and then comparing different waste streams to improve the curing times of CMA \(UR3\) resulted in Colas Ltd collaborating in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with LJMU \(EF1\). The compound COLBIFIBRE was developed through this KTP 2013\-2015, where the exact mix of the compound is commercially sensitive and belongs to Colas Ltd. 

 COLBIFIBRE improves the durability of existing asphalt, allowing the aging stock of roads and highways to remain in service for longer. In addition, it provides a construction environment that is more cost effective and produces no CO<sub>2</sub> during its production and construction, as it is bonded using cold bituminous emulsions. 

 “In 2015, the research results on fibre reinforced micro asphalt were presented to Colas Ltd who partnered with LJMU to perform on\-site trials in Leeds and assess its performance.  Subsequently, Colas decided to commercialise the product and use it in a number of their road surfacing contracts for Local Authorities in the UK on roads and city streets. In France, the technology has been used in the development of a combined surface treatment called COLBIFIBRE, with applications on highways/roads ranging from traffic categories T5 to T1.” \(EV2\) 

 “In 2018, the revenue for COLBIFIBRE was about 4m Euros, accounting for resurfacing of more than 500,000 m2 of roads. The sales in 2019 dropped to over 3m Euros, due to difficult trading conditions, accounting for more than 350,000 m2 of roads, and sales indicate similar trade in the first half of 2020, before activity recovers.” \(EV3\) 

 The local councils in the UK, France, and Ireland prefer this material application as a maintenance surface layer over other types of road surface layers such as hot rolled asphalt, dense bitumen macadam and mastic asphalt to treat road surface aging. 

 “In France, it is used when pavement degradation is too severe to be treated with other single types of treatment and it restores impermeability to the road surface, improves skid resistance of the surface course, and extends the service life.” \(EV2\) 

 None of the conventional micro\-asphalts possess the unique characteristics of this product, which include reinforced anti\-cracking complex micro\-asphalt; dual fibre reinforcement and dual asphalt coating to block cracks; reinforcement of the new wearing course; waterproofing the pavements; and repair of affected areas in a single day. Thin layers postpone major repairs for several years and are suitable for all types of roads. \(EV1\) 

 **\(ii\) New product development \(Colbond 50X Emulsion\)** 

 This new emulsion was developed through a second KTP \(EF2\) for Colas Ltd in 2019.  The emulsion is the first of its kind internationally and emerged through defined industrial needs. Colas required a product to achieve improved bonding strength for a bonding coat applied between pavement layers, which when applied would be able to penetrate dust on the surface and also when fully broken would prevent ‘pick\-up’ on wheels, tracks or tyres of the paver/delivery vehicles. \(EV4, EV5\) 

 Colbond 50X Emulsion \(EV4, EV5\) is also a spray application on road surfaces to promote a stronger adhesion between an old road surface and the new bituminous overlay. This new emulsion made its way into production at Colas’ Warrington UK Emulsion and Micro\-asphalt plant in February 2020.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Heuser and Meyrick facilitate an appreciation for, and understanding of, once prominent but now side\-lined creative practices and the changing values they reflect. Retrieving, documenting and re\-presenting a wide range of early to mid\-20th\-century cultural products, they generate public interest and engagement, demonstrably impacting on creativity, culture and society. While their catalogues raisonné serve as standard reference texts for collectors, dealers, auctioneers and museum curators worldwide, their exhibitions enable key cultural institutions such as the Royal Academy of Arts, as well as regional venues, to extend their reach for the benefit of a broader, more inclusive audience. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Discrete yet interrelated and largely interdisciplinary, Heuser and Meyrick’s investigative research challenges the ways in which cultural products are classified and historical relevance is determined. Through original archival research, analysis and contextual interpretation, they offer insights into early methods employed in the attribution of Old Master paintings \[3.1, 3.2\], as well as neglected media and revived practices such as 1930s tempera paintings made with recipes dating from the Renaissance, and line engraving methods modelled on Quattrocento techniques \[3.3, 3.4\]. Underlying these diverse projects is the central question why some works, especially products existing as multiples or disseminated via mass media, are canonised while others fall into oblivion or face critical neglect. 

 Examining the historic circumstances and institutional forces that shape the production and reception of works of art and audio\-visual culture, Heuser and Meyrick assess largely untapped primary sources and archival materials to demonstrate how legacies are constructed, practices abandoned and traditions rejected, how spheres of influence widen and reputations fade. 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s ongoing research for catalogues raisonné on British printmakers, which since 2012 have been undertaken in partnership with the Royal Academy of Arts, London, entails tracking down and closely examining thousands of works in public collections, private archives and commercial galleries \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. When no extant prints can be traced but plates and blocks can be located, they draw on their practical knowledge to take impressions for reproduction in their publications. To document states and proofs and establish chronologies, they consult auction records, dealer catalogues and museum databases along with published writings and personal diaries, sales ledgers and correspondences. 

 Responding to the absence of reliable data and consistent information, Heuser and Meyrick extract detail from, and corroborate evidence with, the records of museums and exhibiting societies. Other sources include the archives of print publishers, artists’ wills and valuations for probate, as well as photographs and personal effects, to identify subjects and uncover their cultural and autobiographical references. 

 Heuser and Meyrick have used comparable methodologies in piecing together the biographies of collectors such as queer Welsh dilettante George Powell \(1842–1882\) and artist\-dealer Hugh Blaker \(1873–1934\) \[3.1, 3.2\] through their dispersed collections, in order to uncover the rationales and passions that underlie collecting practices. Open to the multiple and complex narratives this yields, their research has led to unexpected and wide\-ranging discoveries, outputs and impacts. 

 In their re\-presentations of the unseen and unheard, Heuser and Meyrick jointly and individually apply their historic knowledge, curatorial experience, and interdisciplinary methodologies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s projects for the Royal Academy of Arts \(RA\) have assisted a major institution in fulfilling its mission to *‘introduce new audiences to \[its\] art and artists’*. In turn, the RA and regional tour venues have invested significant resources to stage Heuser and Meyrick’s outputs. Their RA exhibitions have attracted nearly GBP100,000 corporate sponsorship. 

 ‘Through a combination of meticulous original research and imaginative public outreach they succeeded once again in stimulating new interest in the life and work of two lesser\-known members of the Royal Academy … publishing the first definitive catalogues of Anderson and Tunnicliffe’s complete output as printmakers alongside detailed accounts of their professional lives’ \[5.1\]. 

 Attendance figures for the exhibitions rank among the highest recorded for the RA’s Tennant Room displays \[5.2\]. Visitor books attest to their appeal and resonance \[5.3\]. Anderson was considered ‘frighteningly topical’, an ‘excellent exposé’ of an ‘unknown’ printmaker and a ‘marvellous discovery’ of an artist whose ‘world view is still pertinent’. Audiences appreciated the ‘great insight to a vanished London’ and ‘tremendously engaging’ narrative. The Tunnicliffe show was welcomed as ‘an eye opener’ that offered ‘much to learn as well as view’. Heuser and Meyrick were praised for ‘bringing Tunnicliffe’s work to the RA’ by viewers wanting ‘more exhibitions like this’. The effective use of the *Smartify* app and the integration of a family\-orientated activity area in the gallery was commended for ‘keeping \[Tunnicliffe’s\] name alive for younger generations’. 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s accompanying curator talks and lunchtime lectures proved increasingly popular: Anderson \(104 tickets\) and Tunnicliffe \(154 tickets, fully booked\) \[5.4\]. Their video introductions on the RA’s website and Vimeo as well as Twitter broadened public reach and increased engagement. 

 The exhibitions were recommended as among the top three ‘must see’ shows in the UK \( *The Telegraph*\), ‘the best things to see, do and book this weekend’ \( *Country Life*\), and ‘Art Picks of the Week’ \( *London Evening Standard*\). They attracted audiences interested in British wildlife \(Tunnicliffe\), architectural history and social history \(Anderson\) as well as farming methods and traditional crafts, with reviews appearing in diverse periodicals such as *The* *Mayfair Times* and the *Regional Furniture Society* \[5.5\]. Heuser re\-curated the RA exhibitions to tour regional venues, further extending their reach. Accessible narratives led to invitations to deliver talks to numerous local art groups and national arts societies. 

 Heuser and Meyrick’s catalogues raisonné are now a principal source of reference for curators and private collectors, dealers and auctioneers, educators, and the general public. They are held by the British Museum, Christchurch Art Gallery, New York Public Library, Chicago Public Library, Princeton, Rijksmuseum, Smithsonian and the Yale Centre for British Art. Curators, salesrooms and dealers now routinely reference ‘Heuser\-Meyrick’ catalogue numbers \[5.6\]. Reviews of Heuser and Meyrick’s books have appeared in *The Burlington Magazine* and *County Life* \[5.7\]. The Tunnicliffe volume was chosen for *Apollo*’s September Book Competition prize, was Hatchard’s July *Book of the Month* and featured in their 2017 *Christmas Catalogue*. Heuser and Meyrick were also among Hatchard’s 2017 *Authors of the Year* \[5.8\]. 

 Evidence suggests that Heuser and Meyrick’s outputs have influenced the art market. Beetles Gallery priced Anderson engravings such as *Beer and Skittles* at £1,450, typically £550–750 a few years previously, citing Heuser\-Meyrick numbers. In June 2019, Abbott and Holder listed Tunnicliffe’s *Goshawk* at £2,250, a 300% price increase compared to previous years \[5.9\]. 

 For dealer John Robertson, the Anderson catalogue became a ‘constant companion for weeks’. Consulting Actuary Stuart Southall acknowledges that one reason he become a collector was ‘having the good fortune to meet’ Meyrick whose ‘encyclopaedic knowledge’ has ‘helped shape \[his\] collection’, which now exceeds 4,000 prints \[5.10\]. 

 Enquiries from collectors, national and international dealers, auctioneers, the media and the public demonstrate trust in Heuser and Meyrick’s connoisseurship. Heuser’s research on Powell led to regional participation in ArtUK’s *Sculpture Near You* project \(2019–2020\), talks to community groups, and an invited LGBTQ\+ performance. Meyrick’s research on Blaker: 

-  furnished Louvre curators with provenance documentation for a canvas now identified as by Georges de la Tour \(2014\); 

-  resulted in video interviews with Meyrick for the *Earlier Mona Lisa* exhibition in Singapore \(2014–15\), Shanghai \(2016\) and Florence \(2019\); 

-  informed TernTV on a Botticelli painting featured in BBC4’s *Britain’s Lost Masterpieces* \(2019\) \[5.11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In Scotland, autism is estimated to affect 103.50/10,000 people. Lengthy waiting times for diagnosis is a significant problem affecting 74% of children and 59% of adults referred. Females particularly experience issues from lengthy waiting times, including missed or delayed diagnosis. Cutting edge QMU research is directly responsible for reducing the burden of Scottish diagnostic waitlists for autism. QMU researchers analyzed the nature of waiting times and ways these could be reduced with reference to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \(SIGN\) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) autism guidelines. QMU research informed key Scottish Government decision making and major restructuring of NHS provision nationally. Based on QMU research, Scottish Government funded national implementation \(including 71% of health boards, representing 92% of the population\) has supported new practices to reduce waiting times \(leading to up to 52 week reductions in waits\). Other impacts include identifying more females through improved male/female diagnosis ratio, increased use of autism diagnostic tools by practitioners, increase in knowledge and awareness amongst staff and creation of new senior practitioner posts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to the QMU research, there was no evidence about the nature of the problem or possible solutions to long waits for diagnosis for people with presumptive autism in Scotland. There was no robust evidence about waiting times or empirical data on services undertaking diagnosis. Pioneering QMU research on autism diagnosis waiting times was completed 2011\-2014 as part of an influential multidisciplinary collaboration led by QMU \(PI Forsyth\) with Scottish Government endorsement inclusive of funding from Minister for Public Health & Sport, & Minister for Mental Health alongside research results feeding directly to policy makers.

 **Key Research 2011\-2014** 

1.  QMU research measured adherence to SIGN and NICE clinical guidelines and whether adherence influenced waiting times for diagnosis in Scotland \[R3.1; R3.2\]. 

1.  Studies systematically investigated the extent and cause of waiting times for diagnosis in children and adults \[R3.3; R3.4\]. This research provided the first evidence of lengthy waiting times for diagnostic assessment in Scotland \(331 days for children and 162 days for adults\). On conclusion, it was found that 79% of child cases and 59% of adult cases breached the 119\-day UK standard for waiting times for diagnosis \[R3.3; R3.4\]. 

1.  QMU research showed for the first time the scale of waiting times and associated under\-diagnosis of females, showing there was an urgent need to address this issue from both a gender equality and economic perspective, considering the high personal and economic costs of undiagnosed autism \[R3.5\]. 

1.  An important investigation was made by QMU into average age of diagnosis in adults \(identified as 31 years\) \[R3.5\]. Given that adults with autism cost health and social care services more than those with dementia, cancer or heart disease, this late diagnosis is a significant issue for Government and Society 

1.  There is debate within this field about which standardized diagnostic instruments to use within the diagnostic assessment process. We identified strengths and weaknesses in current diagnostic practice, together with guidance for practitioners to aid effective decision making and training \[R3.6\]. 

1.  Several key recommendations were made as a result of the research, representing vital messages for policymakers and practitioners, including real\-world advice on guideline adherence \[R3.2; R3.2\], that comprehensive information about  the individual that is directly relevant to the diagnosis of autism should be routinely sought prior to, or at the point of referral \[R3.3\], the necessity to develop and maintain multi\-agency diagnostic pathways and collaborative local action plans \[R3.4\], the need to take action to rectify the under recognition of females with autism \[R3.5\], and the need for wider training in use of standardised interview \(clinical history\) tools  and clinical observation tools \[R3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Context:**</ins> In Scotland, autism is estimated to affect 56,449 individuals, and there are around 8,000 new cases yearly. Lengthy waiting times and delayed diagnosis exacerbates costs, and creates dissatisfaction and stress. Waiting times is a chronic problem, and prior to the QMU research, there was no evidence about how to reduce the waiting time burden. QMU research led to significant new approaches to reducing waiting times. QMU’s research has had profound implications for the organisation and delivery of autism services, has provided evidential support for Scottish Government policy decisions, and has been highly influential across NHS Scotland. 

 <ins> **Pathways to impact:</ins>** QMU research has been persuasive and inspired significant national action over standards and pathways for waiting times and autism diagnosis in Scotland. Research has been disseminated through Scottish Government websites \[S1\] \[S2\] referenced in influential international and national autism diagnostic standards \(SIGN ASD guidelines, Australian ASD guidelines\) \[S3\] and was recently made available on a specifically designed website to support ongoing ease of access and a single point of national reference. Since the site went live, there has been additional international reach, with 17,238 hits from 49 countries recorded in the 8 months since inception.  Because waiting times are a high profile target and a key barometer for performance of services, pathways and diagnostic protocols developed as a result of the QMU research are recognised and supported by the Scottish Government \[S2\]. QMU’s autism research received Governmental and ministerial endorsements \[S4\] \[S2\] and there was additional stimulus provided by Ministerial appointment of a National Improvement Advisor 2015\-2018 to implement QMU research findings across Scotland \[S2\]. This multifaceted dissemination, take\-up, and active Government support has led to enduring and sustainable impacts across the NHS for clinicians, service users and their families. 

 <ins> **Beneficiaries, Reach and Significance:</ins>** Beneficiaries are the NHS, practitioners and people with autism and their families. Major impacts associated with the use of QMU’s autism research are: significant reduction in waiting times for autistic people, increase in recognition of females with autism, increased use of autism diagnostic tools by practitioners, creation of a national practice community, and creation of new senior practitioner posts. 

 <ins> **Reducing waiting times**</ins><ins>:</ins> Application of QMU research has used to develop evidence based pathways and new multidisciplinary working practices \[S5.1\] \[S5.2\] \[S6\] \[S7\] \[S8\].  Large clinical services across urban and remote and rural areas of Scotland have established new systems for providing, recording and monitoring autism diagnosis \[S5.1\] \[S5.2\] \[S6\] \[S7\] \[S8\]. This has led to significant reductions in duration of waitlists in Scotland \[S5.1\] \[S5.2\] \[S6\] \[S8\]. More efficient services have been demonstrated and evidenced by Government funded evaluations. In 2014, national evaluation of a model for autism diagnosis directly derived from QMU autism research \(71% of Scottish Health Boards representing 92% of the population and 50 diagnosticians\) demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the wait for diagnosis \(average waits reduced from 147 days to 119 days \- longest reduction was 364 days\) \[S5.1\]. Following this, an NHS organization with 21 hospitals completely reorganised their autism diagnosis services drawing on the research and an evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in waits \(reduction in NHS waiting times from 270 days to 122.5 days\) \[S5.2\]. 

 <ins> **Reduced waits and recognition for females with autism:**</ins> QMU autism research has raised clinicians’ awareness of problematic waiting times and associated under\-recognition of females with autism. New diagnostic services, developed using QMU research, have led to an increased awareness of the presentation of females with autism and the risk of late diagnosis, leading to improved recognition, support and reductions in waits \[S8\]. A large urban NHS organization \(serving a population of 897,770\) improved their male/female diagnosis ratio from 5:1 to 2.7:1 across 400 cases \[S5.2\] following an improvement process drawing on QMU research. 

 <ins> **Increased use of Autism diagnostic instruments in the assessment pathway**</ins><ins>:</ins> QMU research has supported service planning associated with waiting times and diagnosis by influencing autism diagnostic instruments used in practice \[S2\] \[S7\]. Uptake of recommendations derived from QMU autism research led to an increase in the number of practitioners trained in and using autism diagnosis instruments leading to more efficient and effective pathways nationally \[S2\] \[S7\]. Diagnosticians \(representing NHS Boards serving a population of 3,436,105 and 35,564 autistic people\) were trained in 2013 in ADOS autism diagnostic instruments \[S2\] \[S7\]. This 2013 training led to impacts 2014 onwards by increasing capacity of expert staff to identify people with autism \[S2\] \[S7\]. 

 <ins> **Creation of practice community to reduce waiting times and improve diagnosis:**</ins> In 2014, QMU’s innovative approach to autism waiting times and diagnosis led to the development of a national autism diagnostic community of practice supporting the direct translation of the research into clinical practice.  An Autism Knowledge Hub was established in 2018 due to practitioner request, with Government funding, to facilitate use of QMU research findings with national and international active members \[S2\]. A protocol was created developing a new single pathway for diagnosis. For the first time, in 2016, services collaborated to develop single pathways to reduce waiting times and matching of professional skills to need \[S5.1\]. Health board areas have since been revising and updating pathways based development work, using QMU evidence to write localised and bespoke pathways \[S2\] \[S6\] \[S7\] \[S8\]. 

 <ins> **Creation of new national senior practitioner posts:**</ins> A key recommendation arising from QMU’s autism research was to ensure maintenance of improvements in multi\-agency diagnostic pathways and collaborative local action plans. The Scottish Government “Programme for Government 2019\-2020” \[S9\] committed funding to support these recommendations. This funding was released to facilitate use of QMU protocols, policies and procedures nationally \[S2\]. Three full time senior practitioner posts were recruited with the objective of working to maintain improvements generated from the QMU research in autism diagnosis \[S2\]. 

 <ins> **Reach beyond Scotland:</ins>  Across 2014\-2020 NHS organizations and healthcare facilities outside of Scotland have contacted QMU in order to adopt research recommendations and materials derived from the research in waiting times reduction initiatives. For example, an English NHS trust, serving a population of 536,000, with 900 referrals per year, used QMU research to reduce waiting times and improve delivery of autism diagnosis services in 2018 \[S10\]. They reported that implementation of training and development activities directly derived from QMU research, applied across its entire children’s workforce, led to reductions in waiting times, with 25% of all referrals receiving a diagnosis more quickly in 2018 \[S10\]. The developments have also led to an increased awareness of the presentation of girls with autism, increased training for staff, increased use of autism diagnostic tools, and a community of practice to maintain and develop practitioners skills \[S10\]. The main research website has also had international reach, as evidenced by 17,238 hits from 49 countries recorded in 8 months.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2019, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that half of UK adults were financially vulnerable, with 8 million working\-age adults, 4 million children and 2 million pensioners living in poverty; a situation made worse by the COVID\-19 pandemic. A lack of ability to appropriately manage their personal finances can contribute to people’s financial vulnerability. The underpinning research investigated the effectiveness of different approaches to help adults in low\-middle income households to successfully manage their money. The findings created impact **by informing the policies** and **improving the practices** of national and community organisations that work **to reduce the public’s financial vulnerability.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The primary underpinning research was a joint project between Coventry University \(CU\) and The Open University involving Dibb, Appleyard and Roby, funded by the Money Advice Service \(2017\-2018\) as part of its What Works programme \(hereafter the MAS project\) \(G1\). The MAS project built on CU’s strong track\-record and coherent body of research on personal financial wellbeing, including projects funded by the AHRC, Barrow Cadbury, Carnegie UK Trust and internal Coventry University funding \(2015\-2018\), which involved Appleyard, Dibb and Research Assistant Aslam \(G2\-G5\). These other projects grounded the underpinning MAS research as follows: \(i\) informing understanding of the relationship between individuals’ behaviour and their financial capability \(G2, G5\); \(ii\) clarifying the institutional and other causes of financial vulnerability \(G3, G4\); and offering deeper insights into the role of responsible lending in increasing financial resilience \(R4, R5\). All projects \(G1\-G5\) contributed to developing the community, practice and policy network used during the MAS project \(R3\), with this network also subsequently used to support impact. Collectively these projects have been synthesised in a series of project reports and policy documents \(R3, R6\), and disseminated through internationally\-regarded journals and conferences \(R1, R2, R4\). 

###  Money Advice Service project 

 The MAS project \(G1\) included CU researchers Dibb \(CU PI\), Appleyard and Roby, with support from CU Research Assistants. Being financially capable can significantly improve an individual’s ability to make good financial decisions \(R1\-R3\). A research intervention with people in low\-to\-moderate income households showed that using teaching materials to improve these individuals’ financial understanding increased their ability to make good financial decisions. The research tested the effectiveness of teaching materials that introduced them to simple budgeting and saving tools. The tools were designed to improve their day\-to\-day financial decision\-making and help them build a modest ‘emergency’ fund to reduce their vulnerability to unexpected bills or financial shocks. The efficacy of several channels of delivering the teaching materials was tested with different participant cohorts. 

 Qualitative and quantitative data were collected across eight sites from 4,195 participants who were credit unions members, housing association tenants, local community residents and mature students from a HE college. Data were gathered pre\- and post\-intervention concerning people’s attitudes towards money, their financial understanding, financial capability and financial behaviour. Qualitative data were collected via personal interviews, workshops and focus groups; with quantitative survey data gathered using a Randomised Control Trial design. Actual savings data from three credit unions was reviewed to provide tangible evidence of the intervention’s effectiveness. The CU researchers were specifically responsible for the collection and analysis of the qualitative data. They also supported the design of the quantitative research instruments, contributed to the quantitative data analysis, co\-authored the final project report, and led on the project impact work; working alongside non\-academic project partners including Community Action: Milton Keynes, whose volunteers gathered data from local community members \(R3\). 

 The findings showed that the teaching materials and budgeting and savings tools improved the financial understanding of participants, so they understood how to budget, the need to save for the future and the importance of creating an emergency fund \(R3\). Qualitative feedback from the mature students and credit union members gathered in the months after the intervention also indicated improvements in financial capability, with many using their new skills to routinely save and budget. The quantitative data gathered from the credit unions involved in the project supported these results, showing that participants were more likely to budget and were saving an average of £21.73 more after one month \(R3\). Feedback from community volunteers in Milton Keynes found that the biggest effect was on reducing people’s spending. The final project report concluded there was: 

 ‘*…good evidence that a short, low\-cost, behaviourally\-informed intervention can work to improve financial behaviour and resilience, and can do so for people who are Just About Managing who are most in need of financial capability but tend to be hard to reach*’ \(R3: p.51\). 

 The findings also revealed more about the challenges people face and how they navigate the hard choices they encounter in managing their money. For example, new insights were gained into the complex role of emotional factors in influencing individuals to make economically inadvisable spending choices, even though these decisions sometimes increased their financial vulnerability \(R1, R2\). The intervention findings and the insights into individuals’ financial behaviour \(G1\) were central to the activities that later led to impact from the project.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Overview 

 The impact of the research was to significantly influence the policies and practices of national and community organisations that work to reduce the public’s financial vulnerability. These organisations play a crucial role in improving individuals’ understanding of their finances and their ability to manage them effectively. Prioritising this route afforded good reach for the impact and enabled access to large sections of the public. Changing these organisations’ policies and practices provides a pathway to enable more individuals to access materials and tools that help increase their financial capability and lead in some cases to better financial decisions. 

 All achieved impacts have been undertaken subsequent to the underpinning research cited in section 2 and are attributable to it. The impact activities described draw on the underpinning research in several ways: \(i\) the findings have directly influenced the content of national and community organisations’ policies and practices; \(ii\) impact materials created for these organisations have been informed by the project findings \(G1\) about how individuals can be helped to manage their finances; and \(iii\) insights into suitable channels and approaches for disseminating materials have informed how impact is achieved; for example, the underpinning research revealed preferences among younger participants to manage their money using apps and web\-based platforms. These insights \(G1\) were the basis for a subsequent Coventry University Impact Acceleration project to create a free\-to\-use *MoneySkills* app \(S1\) as a vehicle for impact. The app, available via iOS, Android and in web\-based format, has been used by several of the national and community organisations. 

 Below, the scale and scope of the achieved impact on the policies and practices of national and community organisations is shown, and the links with the research findings explained. 

###  Impact on the policies and practices of influential organisations 

 Impact has been created with national organisations including the \(i\) **Money and Pensions Service**, \(ii\) **Salary Finance**, \(iii\) the **Centre for Community Finance Europe**, \(iv\) **Creditspring**; and \(v\) at a community level through organisations that work to reduce financial vulnerability, such as the **England Illegal Money Lending Team**. 

 After submitting our findings to the MAS Consultation on Working\-Age Money\-Management, we were invited to contribute to the future priorities and UK Strategy of the **Money and Pensions Service \(MAPS\)**, the national body formed from the 2019 merger of the Pensions Advisory Service, Pension Wise and MAS. Our findings showing the efficacy of digital education tools and the use of community partnerships to improve access to hard to reach audiences \(R2\), directly influenced the national future priorities, including in relation to the need for goals\-based saving \(S2\). As the Policy Manager at MAPS confirmed \(S3\): 

 “*Yes, your consultation contribution really helped. In fact, it fed into both our 2018/19 Business Plan and the Listening Document that is informing our national strategy.”* 

 His email also explains the impact of our findings on their future work, including through three subsequent MAPS projects: the *Youth Checkpoints project*, which focused on supporting younger people’s financial capability; *Money Supporters project*, which embedded financial capability in front\-line services; and a *local community partnership pilot*. 

 UK organisation **Salary Finance** \( [www.salaryfinance.com](http://www.salaryfinance.com/)\), which is recognised for its socially responsible approach to supporting employees’ financial wellbeing, used our research findings in a toolkit developed for its membership of over 500 UK employers, which represent circa 3 million UK employees. As Salary Finance’s Head of Financial Education explained, the research: 

 “… *played an important role in shaping Salary Finance’s practices in how it supports employers to look after the financial wellbeing of their employees. This impact is seen in the practical toolkit created for employers to design financial wellbeing support in their organisations”* \(S4\). 

 His letter gives specific details of three ways the project findings \(G1\) directly influenced the content of the financial wellbeing toolkit: \(i\) in emphasising the role of trusted ambassadors in supporting individuals to manage their money effectively; \(ii\) in demonstrating the importance for individuals to be able to access financial tools in a paper\-based format; and \(iii\) in encouraging the sharing of stories to help individuals talk about their money. 

 The **Centre for Community Finance Europe** \( [www.cfcfe.eu](http://www.cfcfe.eu/)\), a membership organisation for 46 credit unions across Europe, invited us to produce a CFCFE White Paper \(S5\) on financial capability guidelines informed by the underpinning research findings \(R1\-R3\). This was launched and promoted to its members, which offer services to 150,000 individuals in the UK \(S6\). The White Paper \(S5\) guided these credit unions on best practice: how these individuals can be helped to budget, save and set financial goals \(R3\) and avoid making emotional decisions that increase their financial vulnerability \(R1, R2\). This guidance included explaining the use of the *MoneySkills* app \(S1\). CFCFE state that: 

 “*… the research from \[CU\] has shaped and continues to influence our practices in the advice we offer to our credit union members about how they can support the financial capability of their membership”* \(S6\). 

 Direct feedback from the credit unions themselves shows that their practices in dealing with members who have accounts with them has changed as a result. For example, one credit union described it as a “great resource” and emphasised the need for resources like the MoneySkills app, while another is using the app to support the financial education of 18\-30 year olds \(S7\). 

 **Creditspring** \( [www.creditspring.co.uk](http://www.creditspring.co.uk/)\), a Fintech company, is using the *MoneySkills* app \(S1\) via its portal to support the financial stability of its 10,000 UK members, as their Marketing Executive explains: 

 “*The MoneySkills App is great for Creditspring members as the e\-zines are super easy to use and helpful. Everything is straightforward and easy to understand, which our members value”* \(S8\). 

 The underpinning research \(G1\) and contacts from earlier projects \(G2\-G5\) have led to our findings about suitable money\-management tools that use apps and web\-based platforms influencing the content of training offered by the national **England Illegal Money Lending Team**. This training has used the *MoneySkills* app in a virtual course to prevent people from falling victim to loan sharks, and to help them rebuild their finances. In the six months since the course started in mid\-2020, 123 people attended the training from organisations embedded within vulnerable communities, including: Citizens Advice, YMCA, Disability Advice, Big Local \- Local Trust, the DWP, schools, colleges, councils, housing associations, mental health charities and the police \(S9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Centre for Business Research \(CBR\) Labour Regulation Index is an original and methodologically innovative dataset of labour laws from around the world which has been constructed at Cambridge over the past decade. Its use by international agencies, including the International Labour Organization \(ILO\) and Asian Development Bank, is changing understandings of the role of labour laws in promoting sustainable economic development and growth. The Cambridge team have used the dataset to give advice to policy makers in several countries across Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa, and, through knowledge exchange, supported a major labour law reform initiative in Vietnam in 2019. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research explores the effects of worker\-protective labour laws on unemployment, employment, productivity, and inequality. In 2008 the World Bank asserted that ‘laws created to protect workers often hurt them’ by introducing labour market rigidities and distortions \( *Doing Business Report* 2008, p. 19\). This claim is theoretically contentious \(since it is accepted that labour protections may address labour market imperfections\) and lacked a sound evidence base. Indicators of the ‘strictness’ of employment laws were developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\) in the 1990s and the World Bank in the 2000s. These indices, although the principal data sources for hundreds of econometric studies, suffer from serious methodological flaws. The motivation for creating the CBR Labour Regulation Index \(CBR\-LRI\) was to build a more reliable empirical foundation for understanding how labour laws work in practice, and in particular how they might be used to promote more egalitarian and inclusive forms of economic growth. 

 The CBR\-LRI is part of a wider database, the CBR Leximetric Datasets, whose construction began in 2005 when a team based at the Cambridge Centre for Business Research \(CBR\) led by Simon Deakin received ESRC funding to carry out research on the relationship between law and economic development. Over time, further funding, including a major award under the DFID\-ESRC Joint Fund on Poverty Alleviation, made it possible to expand the original datasets. The CBR\-LRI currently contains data for 117 countries \(95% of global GDP\) for nearly 50 years \(1970\-2013: **\[R1\]**\). The authors of the CBR\-LRI are Simon Deakin \(currently Director of the CBR and a professor in the Cambridge Law Faculty\), Zoe Adams \(previously a researcher in the CBR \(2013\-15\), from 2018 a Research Fellow at King’s College, Cambridge and an affiliated lecturer in the Cambridge Law Faculty\), and Louise Bishop \(a researcher in the CBR 2015\-16 and 2020\-present\). Further ESRC funding was obtained in 2020 and an updated version of the dataset, covering the period up to 2020, will be published in 2021. 

 The CBR\-LRI makes two methodological advances in the area of ‘leximetric’ \(legal\-quantitative\) data coding \(these are explained in **\[R1\]**, Adams et al., **\[R2\]**, and Deakin, 2018 **\[R3\]**\). The first is to design an original coding protocol or algorithm that is neutral in its characterisation of the protective function of labour law rules, so avoiding the bias towards treating them as ‘rigidities’ which is built into the OECD and World Bank indices. The second is to provide details of primary sources \(statutes, court judgments and collective agreements\) underlying all the codings \(see Adams et al., 2017, **\[R1\]**\). This ‘complete sourcing’ approach means that there is less scope for inconsistency and error in the coding process. The dataset contains over 200,000 data points \(40 indicators x 117 countries x 50 years = 234,000 individual entries\). Because all the primary sources for the codings are publicly available in an online codebook, they can be checked by third parties using the dataset. Feedback is regularly sought and received on the codings from national labour law experts, and the dataset periodically updated. There is no similar transparency, nor an equivalent mechanism for error correction, in the case of the OECD and World Bank indices. 

 Because the Cambridge dataset is more comprehensive than alternatives in terms of years and countries covered, and is more transparently coded, it provides richer data than other indices, and can be used more effectively for benchmarking national\-level laws against a common template. This makes it possible to conduct more systematic cross\-national and longitudinal studies. The Cambridge team of lawyers and economists has used the dataset in time\-series and panel data econometric analysis. Results suggest that a higher level of worker protection through labour law is correlated with greater equality as measured by a rise in labour’s share of national income. The impact on productivity and employment is positive over the long run \(Adams et al., 2019, **\[R4\]**\). This result is in line with an independent analysis carried out by ILO economists on part of the CBR dataset in 2015 which is described in section 4 below. These are important findings because they challenge the previous consensus that labour laws are counter\-productive. They open the way to a more constructive and realistic assessment of how labour law reform can contribute to greater equality without harming economic growth, and how it can be used as part of a wider suite of policies aimed at promoting social and economic development which is sustainable over the long run \( **\[R2\]**, **\[R3\]** and **\[R4\]**\). 

 The CBR dataset is the second most highly downloaded item in the Cambridge University Open Access repository, Apollo, with over 8,000 downloads from over 130 countries since 2016. The dataset is being widely used by researchers in economics, sociology and political science. A 2020 paper by Campos et al on labour law reform in Europe employs the CBR dataset on the grounds that it is ‘meticulously documented’ and ‘provides a much larger country and time coverage than other datasets’ \(‘Close encounters of the European kind: economic integration, sectoral heterogeneity and structural reforms’, \( [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2020.103511](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2020.103511)\). Research using the dataset is challenging previous understandings of labour laws as ‘rigidities’. An influential paper \(> 300 citations\) by Acharya et al. \(2014\) reports a positive correlation between stronger employer protection, as measured by the Cambridge index, and firm\-level innovation \(‘Labor laws and innovation’, \( [https://doi.org/10.1086/674106](https://doi.org/10.1086/674106)\). 

 The methodology employed to create the CBR\-LRI index informed the production of additional data sources including IRLex, a dataset of collective labour laws published by the ILO from 2015 **\[R5\]**. Deakin and Bishop collaborated with ILO officials to create a coding template and to complete a number of country reports. The dataset facilitates the benchmarking of different countries’ laws against a common coding protocol and so facilitates impact assessments of the kind used in legislative reform programmes, as in the case of Vietnam described below in Section 4.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 It is vital for international organisations and national governments to have reliable data on labour laws and a solid evidence base for assessing their social and economic impacts. The CBR dataset was designed to meet these needs. Through direct collaboration by the Cambridge team with agencies and governments and through the wider use of the index by, and its growing reputation within, the research community, the dataset is having a tangible impact on labour market policy making. In particular, its use is strengthening the case for labour law reforms targeted at reducing inequality and promoting worker voice while maintaining sustainable economic development. This change is reflected in the policy position taken by global and regional\-level agencies, in the advice they give to national governments, and in the implementation of reforms at national level. 

 **\(i\) Co\-production with the ILO, 2014\-15** 

 The CBR\-LRI dataset was extended from an initial five countries in 2007 to over 60 countries in 2014 in collaboration with the International Labour Organization \(ILO\), a UN agency with a global remit to raise labour standards and promote inclusive growth. The results of the collaboration were published in Chapter 4 of the ILO’s flagship *World employment and social outlook report* in 2015 \(ILO, 2015\). The chapter ‘builds on the ILO’s consideration of how labour regulation – considered as a labour market institution – can contribute to equitable and sustainable development’. It describes the CBR\-LRI as ‘a rich new dataset’ \(ILO, 2015, p. 111\), and ‘uniquely detailed and comprehensive’ \(ILO, 2015, p. 112\). Analysis of the dataset by ILO economists concluded that ‘if carefully designed, employment regulation can provide protection to workers in different types of employment without harming job creation’ \(ILO, 2015, p. 122\). **\[E6\]** 

 The Head of the Labour Law and Reform Unit at the ILO since 2015, writes in a testimonial: 

 *‘The ILO has collaborated closely and to very good effect with the CBR over a period of some years. At different times the ILO has provided facilities and also funding for the development of the CBR Labour Regulation Index. The 2015 World Economic and Social Outlook, the ILO’s flagship publication on the world of work in global perspective, made use of the dataset to show the overall generally positive effects of labour regulation in the long run for development, among other things’* **\[E1\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Knowledge exchange with the Asian Development Bank, 2017\-2020, and the OECD, 2019\-2020** 

 In 2017 the Cambridge team was approached by the Asian Development Bank \(ADB\) for assistance with a report being prepared on the relationship between employment protection laws, productivity, and employment. The ADB is a regional agency with a developmental remit which includes advice and knowledge transfer. ADB officials used CBR data to prepare an internal working paper \(Ranjan et al., 2018 **\[E2\]**\) and a chapter in the ADB’s flagship publication, the *Asian Development Outlook 2018* \(Asian Development Bank, 2018, **\[E3\]**\) *.* 

 The ADB official who commissioned the CBR data, has written in a testimonial: *‘for any analysis of labor regulations, I think the CBR LRI database is an indispensable resource. We found the CBR LRI database very useful for the purpose of comparing labor regulations across countries and over time’* **\[E4\]**. 

 In 2020 the CBR received a further request for data from the ADB, this time for an updating of the dataset to cover a number of countries for the years 2013\-2020. The updating was completed in September 2020. 

 In July 2019 and November 2020 Deakin participated in workshops organized by the OECD to discuss labour market data. The OECD is an intergovernmental agency charged with promoting economic policy coordination and information exchange. The OECD invited Deakin to offer advice on the updating of Professor Jelle Visser’s index on collective bargaining over wages and conditions of employment, which relies significantly on data collated in the CBR index for certain of its categories \(Visser, 2019 **\[E5\]**\). 

 **\(iii\) National\-level knowledge exchange and influence over labour law reforms** 

 Labour law reform has for some time been a major issue in several Latin American countries. After he gave a keynote lecture at a regional labour law congress in Lima in 2016, Deakin was approached by the Peruvian Ministry of Labour for republication of the work on the basis that it contained *‘several ideas that would be useful to improve the Peruvian reality’* \(testimonial from an official in the Ministerio del Trabajo y Promoción del Empleo, Lima, 2018 **\[E7\]**\). In 2020 Deakin was due to give a series of lectures at the University of the Republic \(Uruguay\) and to meet labour market policy makers and stakeholders in Montevideo; this visit was postponed because of the Covid\-19 emergency but will take place at the earliest opportunity. 

 East Asia is another context in which labour law reform is under active consideration. In 2015 and 2016 Deakin discussed labour law reform at meetings of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. In 2015 he visited Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to present a report to labour ministry officials and senior judges on reform of the Vietnamese labour laws and labour court system. In 2019 the Vietnamese authorities announced a major reform of laws governing freedom of association. The ILO provided advice to the Vietnamese government, using the IRLex index to carry out impact assessments. Dr. Chang\-Hee Lee, who collaborated with Deakin and Bishop in the construction of IRLex and later became the Director of the ILO office in Vietnam, has written in a testimonial: 

 *‘The National Assembly adopted a revised Labour Code in November 2019, which brings fundamental changes to the ways industrial relations would function, as it brings new rights of freedom of association at enterprise level, with strengthened provisions on collective bargaining. Throughout the process of the revision which began in 2016, IR Lex was actively used whenever drafters of the government and National Assembly wanted to know about comparative information on certain legal provisions on IR \(registration of unions, most representative union status. unfair labour practices, for example\). ILO was able to provide almost immediate response to request of the drafters, and some drafters who have English capacity accessed directly to IR Lex. IR Lex index has been highly instrumental for drafters who have to prepare and submit the impact assessment report to the legislature. It truly helped the complicated process of labour law reform in Viet Nam’* **\[E8\]**. 

 The onset of the Covid\-19 emergency put labour law reform in the spotlight in several countries. In September 2020 Deakin was approached by stakeholders in South Africa for feedback on data contained in the CBR index relating to the economic impact of dismissal laws. In October 2020 he was contacted by European\-level trade unions interested in using the CBR’s methodology to track changes to labour laws in EU countries in response to the Covid crisis.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Liverpool VISION research unit \(led by Prof Rowe\) is unique in focussing on research for post\-stroke visual impairment \(PSVI\). PSVI effects 60% of stroke survivors but has historically been under\-recognised, with poor detection and referral to eye care services, leading to restricted quality of life. UoL’s work has established incidence/prevalence rates of PSVI, essential components for vision screening, requirements for eye service provision, user\-defined impact of visual impairment, and consensus on management strategies. This has provided the underpinning evidence for present day PSVI policies, guidelines and clinical practice in the UK and internationally. This work has led to a significant change in clinical and societal recognition of PVSI, screening and services in the UK and internationally, and a doubling in stroke units including vision stroke services. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Visual impairment after stroke \(PSVI\) is common, debilitating and costly. Most stroke survivors with visual impairment report a reduction in quality of life. This is particularly true if the visual impairment is unidentified and therefore not recognised by the multi\-disciplinary team. For many stroke survivors, visual impairment results in inability or altered ability to undertake many aspects of daily activities with impact on return to work, participation in hobbies and family life, and can lead to social isolation, altered mood and depression. Wide\-ranging benefits to patients, their carers and the NHS can be achieved through early and accurate identification of PSVI and integrated screening and care services. 

 In order to improve outcomes for people with PSVI, the University of Liverpool VISION unit led by Professor Rowe, has carried out a programme of research with clinicians, stroke survivors and charities over the last decade. We have demonstrated the significant impact of visual impairment to stroke survivors and explored difficulties related to care provision through a range of studies including: systematic reviews, studies on screening, assessment, course and management of PSVI, and qualitative work exploring the impact of PSVI and unmet needs of stroke survivors. We have developed interventions and led evaluations \(10 randomised control trials/cohort studies\) addressing patient care pre and post discharge. UoL’s work has led to over 50 active NHS/academic collaborations in the delivery of multi\-site studies and the largest UK database for PSVI. 

##  Evidence synthesis: 

 UoL’s systematic reviews \(Cochrane Library/independent narrative reviews\) have examined the efficacy of screening methods \[3.1\] and effectiveness of interventions for PSVI \[3.2,  [www.cochranelibrary.com](http://www.cochranelibrary.com/)\]. All reviews found insufficient evidence for screening methods and interventions, leading to epidemiology, screening and rehabilitation research in PSVI to address these unmet needs. 

##  Epidemiology studies: 

 We recruited 915 \(VIS study\) and 1500 \(IVIS study\) patients for the world’s largest completed observation studies on PSVI \(Rowe as CI;  [https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population\-health\-sciences/staff/fiona\-rowe/](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/staff/fiona-rowe/)\). Findings consistently show lack of standardisation across services, poor detection of PSVI, poor referral and inconsistent management. 

##  Screening for PSVI: 

 Rowe designed and validated a screening form for use by the generic stroke team, which reported a 92% positive predictive value \[3.1\]. UoL’s screening form was adopted by the British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS:  [www.orthoptics.org.uk](http://www.orthoptics.org.uk/)\) and remains the national approved stroke vision screening form. We subsequently developed a visual impairment screening assessment \( *VISA*\) tool. Validation studies \[3.3\] showed VISA to be a reliable and sensitive means of screening for visual impairment in acute stroke survivors. A spin\-off screening assessment for paramedic 999 stroke call\-outs and Stroke Association 6\-month reviews evolved from VISA. We led a national team to create a stroke\-vision care pathway to pull all screening, assessment and referral aspects of care together \[3.4\]. 

##  Specialist assessment for PSVI: 

 Rowe’s clinical practice scoping surveys \[3.5\] identified a lack of standardised specialist visual assessment leading to the development of a professional body \(BIOS\) consensus statement \(led by Rowe\). We defined essential and desirable recommendations for service provision. We surveyed 548 clinical professionals \(UK\-based/international\), patients and carers to identify core outcome measures for PSVI assessment \[3.5\]. These results underpinned the professional development of care pathways in relation to screening, specialist assessment and driving \[3.4\]. 

##  Visual rehabilitation for PSVI: 

 UoL’s reviews identified considerable variability in management options. An important part of this research has been to source the best evidence\-based treatments for visual impairment. The VISION group specifically identified homonymous hemianopia \(type of visual field loss\) as a visual condition causing considerable impact to patient lives. Following a clinical trial of two interventions versus standard care \(no treatment\) a significant improvement to vision\-related quality of life for visual scanning training was reported \[3.6\]. These results have informed the development of a larger definitive trial commencing 2020, funded by Fight for Sight and the Stroke Association.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Stroke is the leading cause of disability affecting 15,000,000 globally \(World Health Organisation\). There are in excess of 100,000 new strokes per annum in the UK and 1,200,000 stroke survivors \(the Stroke Association Statistics\). Despite new onset visual impairment in 60% of cases, services and care for stroke survivors with visual impairment are limited. UoL’s research includes pioneering studies providing evidence to underpin clinical practice and the development of research studies and national guidelines \(e.g. Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party, British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS\), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\). A key impact of the University of Liverpool VISION unit’s research has been change to clinical practice guidelines, services and education, benefitting stroke survivors and their families, orthoptists, ophthalmologists, stroke physicians, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. 

##  National and international guidelines: 

 Rowe leads the vision group for the national Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party and her research on prevalence/incidence of PSVI, assessment and management led to a fully revised, evidence\-based vision section in the 2016 National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke \[5.1\]. 

 *“Because of the case she \[Prof Rowe\] made for the first time in 2016 we included a separate section on vision in stroke.”* \(National Clinical Director for Stroke, NHS England, 2019\) \[5.2.1\]. 

 Rowe was the vision advisor on the 2013 guideline panel for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) stroke rehabilitation in adults \[5.3\], which focused on producing evidence\-based clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of NHS patient care. As a result of her involvement, NICE guidelines changed to include new recommendations on referral and management of stroke\-related vision problems. 

 Rowe’s research informed a professional body consensus statement by BIOS outlining the orthoptic staffing requirements for acute stroke units and recommendations for vision assessment and management \[5.4\]. Rowe co\-wrote the BIOS professional practice guidelines for extended clinical practice in stroke \[5.5\] documenting the essential and desirable requirements for stroke care provided by orthoptists. These documents have been used by NHS Trusts \[5.2\] to support the development of new vision stroke services and maintenance of existing services. A survey published by Rowe in 2010 found integrated stroke\-vision services had increased from 45% of units to above 80% in the prior 10 years\). 

 “*We utilised many of the studies and reviews that Prof Rowe has published in order to evidence the need for orthoptic input into the Stroke service, as part of our successful business case.”* \(Lead Stroke Orthoptist, St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust\) \[5.2.2\]. 

 We have provided the evidence underpinning incidence and prevalence figures for PSVI and the types of visual conditions that occur. UoL’s findings are cited worldwide \[5.2.10\]. 

##  Service provision and international reach: 

 The VISION unit’s research highlights the need for better identification, specialist assessment and management of PSVI. Identification of gaps in evidence led to the development of the Rowe \(VIS\) screening form, which is now routinely used by BIOS and orthoptists across the UK in their stroke services which has improved the detection of PSVI \[5.2, 5.6\]. 

 Rowe contributed to writing the BIOS stroke care pathway \[5.7\] which was changed to reflect the evidence provided by Rowe’s research and provide improved signposting for patient care. In recognition of the limited scope of the BIOS pathway to acute care, Rowe led a national team to develop a wide\-reaching process pathway to capture stroke\-vision problems at all stages from pre\-hospital care to post\-stroke community care \[5.8\]. 

 Gaps in evidence also informed the development of research commissioned by the Stroke Association, which comprehensively outlined key needs of stroke survivors with visual impairment. In this report \[5.9\] and related publications, Rowe outlined the key features of an exemplar stroke vision service, UK\-wide professional clinician responses on assessment methods, management options and information resources. In recognition of outstanding contributions to stroke and vision services, BIOS awarded Rowe a national service recognition award in 2015. 

 Assessment at 6 months post stroke is a component of the National Stroke Strategy, and visual problems now form one facet that is encompassed in such checks; for example, inclusion in the Greater Manchester Stroke Assessment Tool \(GMSAT\). This research has reach beyond the UK. For example, groups in Australia, USA, India, Norway and the Netherlands have sought to improve their screening for PSVI and are have adopted UoL’s VISA screening with language translation where needed. 

 *“I then applied for funding for a national network on vision and stroke \[now agreed NOK5,000,000, \~GBP5,000,000\]. Fiona is on the steering committee and part of some of the working groups. We are using her research to build our cases and compare findings to see if we can structure things similarly”*. \(Associate Professor, NorVIS study\) \[5.2.3\]. 

##  Resources and education: 

 Rowe is an international expert advisor for PSVI, advising BIOS, Department of Health, UK Stroke Association, and Royal National Institute for the Blind \(RNIB\). UoL’s research has been widely disseminated at RNIB and Stroke Association national education events and conferences with impact at individual practitioner level. For example, feedback from a clinician at the Northern Ireland Multi Agency Stroke Team conference in 2016: 

 “*This has changed my practice for the future by making me more aware….I was surprised to hear what a large percentage of stroke patients do have visual problems post stroke*.” \[5.2.11\] 

 Rowe has overseen the writing of Stroke Association and RNIB stroke/vision information factsheets \[5.10\] which remain key download documents from their websites. Rowe has developed a range of resources for clinical practice and for patients which are used widely \(247 department downloads; 23/06/2020\) in the NHS \( [www.vision\-research.co.uk](http://www.vision-research.co.uk/)\). 

 *“If we didn’t have access to any of Fiona’s resources, it’s quite possible that ECLO’s would not see so many patients that had had strokes, stroke survivors wouldn’t have resources specific to them, and possibly wouldn’t know that they were even there, people would slip through the net”*. \(Clinical Lead for the Eye Clinic Support Team, RNIB\) \[5.2.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Poor literacy levels are a significant social, health and economic issue, costing the UK up to £2.4 billion per year \(Every Child a Reader, 2009\). Since 2005 Coventry University researchers have carried out work to address this issue, elucidating the role of the underlying linguistic skills of prosody, morphology, and phonology as a way to enhance literary development in children and young adults. Their work has influenced UK education policy and teaching provision for children at risk of literacy difficulties, and led directly to a commercial reading scheme which has been adopted in almost 2,000 schools in multiple countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Coventry University literacy research, commissioned by a number of high\-profile</ins> <ins>organisations</ins><ins>, has focused on rigorous studies of the roles of metalinguistic skills in literacy, establishing best practices in reading interventions and evaluating existing initiatives for their effectiveness.</ins> 

 <ins>Between 2005 and 2018 Coventry University researchers Professor Clare Wood and Dr Andrew Holliman, together with colleagues, developed a</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>of research focusing on the role of prosodic awareness in literacy development. Prosodic sensitivity is sensitivity to the patterns of sound variation across words and phrases. Changes of stress, timing or intonation can change the meaning of words or phrases: for example</ins> <ins>reCORD</ins> <ins>is a verb meaning to take note of something, while</ins> <ins>REcord</ins> <ins>is a noun denoting, for example, a high score or a vinyl disc.</ins> 

 <ins>From 2012\-15 Dr Holliman</ins> <ins>led a project for the Nuffield F</ins><ins>oundation</ins> <ins>\(G1\)</ins> <ins>testing speech rhythm sensitivity to identify literacy difficulties. Coventry University’s research has demonstrated that prosodic sensitivity has both direct and indirect routes to literacy \(R1, R2\), and that interventions designed to enhance speech rhythm sensitivity might be incorporated into early reading instruction methods to support other emergent literacy skills. In parallel with this project, Wood, Holliman and</ins> <ins>Vousden</ins> <ins>won Leverhulme funding</ins> <ins>\(G2\)</ins> <ins>for a PhD studentship \(2011\-2014\) to develop a speech rhythm intervention. This project successfully demonstrated, for the first time, that teaching prosodic sensitivity in the early years helps to improve literacy progress \(R3\).</ins> 

 <ins>Between 2013 and 2015, Clare Wood and Janet</ins> <ins>Vousden</ins> <ins>led a trial of ABRACADABRA</ins> <ins>\(G3\)</ins><ins>, an online literacy</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>composed of phonics, fluency and comprehension activities based around a series of age\-appropriate texts. The trial was focused on the use of digital technology to improve outcomes for disadvantaged children.  Their findings indicated that the</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>showed similar levels of success whether or not interventions were ICT based, improving literacy progress by around 3 months on average, and around 5 months in the children with lower socio\-economic status \(R4\).</ins> 

 <ins>In 2014, the literacy research team was enhanced by the appointment of Professor Julia Carroll and Dr Helen</ins> <ins>Breadmore</ins><ins>. From 2014 to 2017, Prof Carroll and Dr</ins> <ins>Breadmore</ins> <ins>led a Nuffield Foundation funded investigation</ins> <ins>\(G4\)</ins> <ins>of the role of phonological and morphological awareness in children with literacy difficulties and history of ear infections. This project investigated how much children use information about the internal structure of words \(morphology\) to compensate for these difficulties. Results</ins> <ins>emphasised</ins> <ins>the significant overlap with children who have repeated ear infections in the preschool years and children who have literacy difficulties in the school years \(R5\). It also demonstrated that morphological awareness could be an effective tool to overcome phonological difficulties in reading and spelling, something which should be considered in SEN \(special educational need\) provision. \(R6\).</ins> 

 <ins>Working to develop, establish and evaluate the most effective real\-world methods to enhance literacy development in children and young people, this research has resulted in a number of beneficial impacts at the level of policy and practice.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impacts from the research above have arisen in three key areas: the first through a commercial collaboration, and the second and third through commissioned evidence reviews and advisory roles which have directly informed educational policy and practice. 

 <ins>Informing Commercial Resources for Children’s Reading</ins> 

 Based on their prosody research \(R1\-3\), from 2015 Holliman, Wood and Vousden collaborated with educational publisher Rising Stars, now owned by Hodder Education, to develop a commercial reading scheme for 4\-7 year olds which embeds research findings linking spoken language skills and literacy development \(S1, S2\). First published in 2016, the Reading Planet resource series highlights information about prosodic sensitivity during shared reading for teachers and parents, helping children become confident independent readers. CU research features prominently in promotional materials for Reading Planet, and testimonials indicate that schools have identified improved literacy attainment resulting from the scheme: 

 “Our Phonics pass rate improved by 11% to 83% and we saw a 10% increase in the KS1 Reading SATs results, with 15% increase in greater depth. Reading Planet is definitely one of the things that has helped impact our reading results.” Teacher, Tranmoor Primary School, July 2019 \(S1\). 

 Reading Planet was the first reading scheme in the world to explicitly incorporate speech rhythm\-related resources for parents, teachers and children, and expert practitioners have highlighted the impact of the research element: 

 ‘Reading Planet really redefines our understanding of how children learn to read… because it is supported by research you know that it’s no quick\-fix or publishing folly.” Primary Review Magazine \(S1\). 

 Over 550 fiction and non\-fiction books \(and interactive e\-books\) now embed the research, including a parallel set released by Hodder Education for 7\-11 year old children. Reading Planet is now used by over 1,900 schools, reaching an estimated 200,000 children in the UK, increasing by approximately 95,000 per year \[S2\].  Initial international sales have resulted in over 500,000 export copies sold to date, with Australia the major export market \(S2\). 

 <ins>Tackling</ins> <ins>L</ins><ins>iteracy Attainment Inequalities in Schools</ins> 

 The government\-funded Education Endowment Foundation \(EEF\), mandated to improve evidence\-based practice in schools, have commissioned CU to carry out a number of activities to improve literacy attainment in schools. In 2018 this included a review highlighting the important roles for prosody, phonology and morphology for children acquiring literacy, which set out recommendations to help those falling behind. This was used as the basis for nationally distributed teacher guidance, and with over 61,000 unique page views and 23,910 downloads it is amongst the most popular materials on the EEF website \(S3\). The review is used in training for secondary school teachers, with the Director of Literacy for a multi\-academy trust describing it as ‘a powerful tool’, which she regularly utilises in training and in ‘the development of new materials and resources’ \(S4\). 

 <ins>Improving Support for Children with S</ins><ins>EN</ins> 

 In 2017 CU researchers were commissioned to carry out a review for the Department for Education \(DfE\) on effective interventions for children with special educational needs \(SEN\) \[S5\]. Drawing on research carried out by the CU team \[R4, R5\], the wide\-ranging review drove significant updates on guidance which underpinned the design of the new Early Career Framework \[S6\], the national guidance on career development for newly qualified teachers launched in September 2020, affecting over 28,000 new teachers each year. 

 Based on the review, the DfE worked with CU to create a user\-focussed resource for schools, teachers and other practitioners, using it as a key means ‘to improve how schools and colleges support children and young people’ \(S5\). As an example of use, following publication an academies trust representing 58 schools utilised the ‘seven key features’ of promising SEN support outlined in the resource as a ‘framework for structuring discussions with SENCOs’, before embedding them into an online academies trust ‘SEND Toolkit’ providing practical ‘guidance, resources and training for staff’. They were also incorporated into a ‘SEND Self Audit Tool’ used throughout the trust to gauge provision and determine effective ‘SEND Development Plans’ \(S7\). 

 The review also influenced national policy discussions. In June 2018 it was used by the National Deaf Children’s society to underpin their calls for dedicated support for children with hearing impairments \(S8, p.2\). In February 2018 at a parliamentary debate on SEN outcomes the UK Under\-Secretary of State for Education affirmed that the SEND resource provided ‘evidence on effective approaches’ for teaching staff, and that a governmental programme was being embedded to ‘further support the embedding of good SEND practice in schools’ \(S9\). 

 The influence on national policy with respect to SEND continues: in 2020 Prof Carroll was commissioned to provide a research overview on specific learning difficulties \(including dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia\) for the Council of Science and Technology \(CST\), who advise the Prime Minister on science and technology issues \[S10\]. This led directly to a letter from the CST to the Prime Minister making six recommendations for change.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study showcases the impact of Professor David Whyte’s research upon the labour and trade union movement at the highest levels. Whyte’ work identifies several failures of UK health and safety regulation. It maps the influence of Whyte’s evidence\-based proposals which set out a blueprint for a new system of health and safety enforcement, introduce legal reforms that are applicable to the changing world of work, and propose new mechanisms of compliance with international law. Those proposals featured in the 2017 and 2019 Labour Party General Election manifestos and remain embedded in the policies of both the Labour Party and the major UK trade unions. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research provides evidence and analysis that directly led to a number of proposals for enhancing the regulating of workplace safety in the UK. This underpinning research has been developed in close collaboration with the Institute of Employment Rights \(IER\) and it informs the policy proposals in the IER Manifesto for Labour Law project which provided the blueprint for Labour Party policy on the workplace. IER Director Carolyn Jones acknowledges “the central role that Professor David Whyte’s research has played in developing the Institute’s policy and advocacy work on workplace health and safety over the past decade….his work has driven a number of important aspects of Institute policy” and that “his findings have formed the basis of the Institute’s regular research reports, contributions to government inquiries and consultations and briefings for trade unions” \(corroborating source 5.3\). He has been a key member of the IER Manifesto team, joining the Executive Committee in 2014. During this period, Whyte’s research has underpinned a total of 13 briefings, research reports and submissions to government inquiries on behalf of the IER \(see publication 3.1 and corroborating source 5.4\). 

 Whyte’s underpinning research also provided the foundations for two North West Social Sciences Doctoral Training programme CASE studentships in partnership with the IER \(2015\-2019; and 2018\-present\), the first on UK compliance with international standards of labour law \(which develops capacity for amplifying research finding 4 below\), and the second on workers’ rights vs shareholders’ rights \(which develops capacity for amplifying research finding 3 below\). 

 The pathways between specific findings made in Whyte’s underpinning research and those policy proposals capture a broad range of regulatory interventions, including: 1 the concepts underpinning policy; 2 patterns of enforcement; 3 legal accountability; and 4 compliance with international benchmarks.  Those pathways are mapped out below: 

 RESEARCH FINDING 1: The deadly flaws in ‘risk regulation’ policy. 

 This research established that the operationalisation of UK government definition of “high” and “low” risk work to reshape regulatory policy is based on flawed assumptions, and likely to significantly exacerbate risks in workplaces. This research finding is derived from analysis set out in publications 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. This research finding underpins policy proposals 4 and 5 in table 1 below. 

 RESEARCH FINDING 2: The collapse of health and safety enforcement. 

 The underpinning research was based on the construction of an extensive and unique data set of Health and Safety Executive \(HSE\) regulatory activity generated by freedom of information requests. It found a collapse in all forms of HSE regulatory intervention and enforcement between 1997 and 2010.  This research is captured in publications 3.4 and 3.5. Those research findings underpin policy proposals 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 in table 1 below. 

 RESEARCH FINDING 3: The accountability gap in corporate offending. 

 This empirical analysis and conceptual critique of the use of fines against corporate entities forms the basis for a re\-calibration of sentencing policy, proposing more effective forms of revenue\-proportionate punishments, equity fines and debilitation measures. This research finding is based on evidence developed by Whyte’s research in publications 3.2 and 3.3. This research finding underpins the policy proposals 6, 7, 9 and 10 in table 1 below. 

 RESEARCH FINDING 4: UK failure to meet standards of international law. 

 This research finding is based on a unique “benchmarking analysis” that UK compliance with ILO standards lags behind most other member states of both the European Union and the OECD. This finding is detailed in publication 3.1. This unique analysis shows that UK compliance with ILO standards lags behind most other member states of both the European Union and the OECD.  This finding underpins the policy proposals 1, 2, 3, 8 and 9 in table 1 below.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Whyte’s research has had a profound influence on the development of policy on health and safety in the trade union movement and the Labour Party, and has provided a roadmap for the inclusion of practical and workable policy proposal that address regulatory failure and weak mechanisms of legal accountability. 

 Whyte’s research has had a seminal influence on the IER Manifesto for Labour Law project \(corroborating sources 5.1 and 5.2\). His work specifically underpins the policy proposals contained on pp 50\-53 of the IER Manifesto \(see table 1 below\). According to IER Director Carolyn Jones: “Professor Whyte’s publications and his research directly led to the development of 9 of the 25 policy recommendations contained in the Manifesto and subsequently fleshed out in IER’s ‘Rolling Out the Manifesto’ document.” \(corroborating sources 5.3 and 5.4\). 

 Table 1: Specific policy proposals underpinned by Whyte’s research 

| Para 8.22 Manifesto for Labour Law -  Establishment of ILO compliant inspection and enforcement regimes; -  Significant increase of HSE and local authority inspections; -  Provision of government funding to properly enforce the law; -  Repeal of policies prohibiting unannounced inspections to “low risk” workplaces.  Para 8.27 Manifesto for Labour Law -  A new scale in sentencing guidelines to ensure that sentences reflect both the seriousness of the offence and the ability to pay; -  A new tripartite standing body to review sentencing practices and guidelines; -  Placing the HSE inspection and prosecution regime on a new constitutional footing that will make funding secure and enforcement policy consistent; -  A new enforcement policy that places emphasis on inspectors making use of their powers and to prosecute on indictment; -  Creation of a new, discrete Unit within the Crown Prosecution Service solely responsible for Corporate Manslaughter. |

 Whyte’s research leads directly to the conclusion that a wholesale transformation of the way that the workplace is regulated is necessary, and that this transformation should encompass: a doubling of regulatory resources, the establishment of new principles to guide mandatory inspection and investigation, new ways of legislating for maximum workforce involvement, new forms of sanction for those breaching the law, and new modes of administration capable of overseeing this transformation. 

 According to Lord Hendy, “Professor Whyte’s research findings on the current effectiveness of the law on health and safety at work \(and its regulatory machinery\) have been influential on the development of the subsequent Labour Party policy on work, the workplace and industrial relations” \(corroborating source 5.5\).  As part of a team of experts assembled by the IER., his research influenced the recommendations contained in the ‘Manifesto for Labour Law’ and in the document, ‘Rolling out the Manifesto for Labour Law’ which were used as a basis for the 2017 and 2019 Labour Party Election Manifestos \(corroborating sources 5.5 and 5.6\). The recommendations set out in the IER Manifesto for Labour law provided the architecture of a new policy framework for the Labour Party, which, if implemented, “have the potential to transform the way workplace safety is regulated” \(corroborating source 5.5\). Whyte’s contributions to round table Labour Party consultations further influenced the drafting of the 2019 Labour Party Election Manifesto \(corroborating source 5.5\). 

 The Manifesto for Labour Law framework has endured as Labour Party policy under Keir Starmer’s leadership.  Former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell MP said of the IER Manifesto, “the detailed policy proposals drawn up by a specialist group of 26 of the UK’s leading labour law experts, is exactly what is needed to create fair, just, secure, democratic and productive conditions of work.” \(preface to corroborating source 5.2\). Len McCluskey, General Secretary of UNITE noted on its publication: “We are delighted to support the Institute of Employment Rights’ Manifesto for Labour Law, which provides us with the policy framework we need to move forward with a more progressive agenda in 2020” \(corroborating source 5.6\).  Mark Serwotka, General Secretary of the PCS similarly noted: “The IER's manifesto represents a major step towards a progressive alternative that PCS is proud to stand behind.” \(corroborating source 5.6\). A comprehensive list of other Trade Union and Labour Party leadership testimonies to the influence of the Manifesto for Labour Law is included in corroborating source 5.6. 

 All of the candidates in the 2020 Labour leadership contest committed to full support of the Manifesto for Labour Law. Current Labour Leader Keir Starmer has preserved the role of Minister for Employment Rights and Protections, the cornerstone of the IER Manifesto. 

 Whyte’s research has played an active role in guiding opinion “in the Labour Party and wider labour movement of the critical state of health and safety law \(and its enforcement\) in this country, and the measures which should be taken to improve it and adequately protect workers.” \(corroborating source 5.5\). Indeed, “Professor Whyte’s communication and popularisation of our policy proposals has helped to increase support for IER ideas.” \(corroborating source 5.3\). As part of this opinion\-shaping work, Whyte’s publication 3.1 was the subject of a high\-profile meeting of leading lawyers and trade unionists hosted by Unite \(corroborating source 5.7\). 

 The influence of his policy work for the IER is corroborated by Frances O’Grady, General Secretary of the TUC, Christine Blower, former General Secretary of the NUT, Matt Wrack, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union and Mick Cash, General Secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, \(corroborating source 5.8\).  The IER printed and distributed 2,500 copies of publication 3.1, to trade union members and officers in all of the major UK trade unions. 

 The underpinning research set out in section 2 has also impacted on international audiences, indicated by Whyte’s invitation to address a major trade union conference in Norway in February 2019.  The leaders of Fagforbundet \(the Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees\), Norsk Tjenestemannslag \(The Norwegian Civil Service Union\), Landsorganisasjonen i Norge \(the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions\) invited Whyte to incorporate his research findings into guiding their work.  At the conference Norway Prime Minister Erna Solberg and the leader of the Labour Party Jonas Gahr Støre discussed Whyte’s research findings \(corroborating statement 5.9\). Following the conference, the Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees requested and translated Whyte’s written proposals for a new system of shareholder fines \(corroborating source 5.10\) which has subsequently formed the focus of the union’s ongoing policy development on corporate crime.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over the past 20 years we have conducted research and practice development that has focused on developing theoretical frameworks, translation and implementation methods as well as tools and processes for evaluating the effectiveness of efforts to implement person\-centredness in nursing and healthcare.  The implementation of the Person\-centred Practice Framework \(PCPF\) developed because of our research has shaped nursing and healthcare developments in 22 countries.  The systematic and sustained implementation of a theory of person\-centredness in practice continues to result in significant differences in overall quality of patient experience, staff satisfaction and well\-being, as well as better workplace cultures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The PCPF, a mid\-range theory was developed from empirical research published between 2000–2010.  This body of peer\-reviewed research and the detail of the PCPF as a theory can be found in McCormack and McCance \(2010\).  It is this body of research upon which this case study is built. Despite revisions over time, the fundamental building blocks of the framework \(the domains\), and the key elements \(the constructs\), have remained stable over time. Refinements have reflected increased engagement with person\-centred theory, its implementation in a variety of contexts and contribution of this theory to a broad agenda of person\-centred policy, education, practice and research. The PCPF is the most adopted framework for informing the development of person\-centred practices and systems among multidisciplinary and interprofessional teams internationally and has been translated into 10 languages \(c.f. Bing\-Jonsson et al 2018\) \(Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin, Slovenian, Swedish and French\) and tested in multiple healthcare contexts in 22 countries \(c.f. Gruden et al 2020\). The framework and associated tools appeal to a wide range of stakeholders.  Influential participatory research and development undertaken with international partners in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Finland, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, The Republic of Ireland, Australia, South Africa, USA and Canada has resulted in the development of six evaluation instruments *\(The Person\-centred Nursing Index; The Context Assessment Index; the Person\-centred Practice Inventory \(PCPI\) \[with versions for staff, service users and healthcare students\]\)* and one observation tool *\(The Workplace Culture Critical Analysis Tool\).* Through various implementation studies that combine the use of the PCPF with these measurement tools, we have identified key outcomes from the implementation of person\-centred practice. 

 Our collaborative research and development projects in nursing home settings have resulted in improvements to the care environment, greater resident satisfaction, improved staff well\-being, reduction in falls and reduced use of psychotropic medications \(McCormack et al 2010, Buckley et al 2014, Mekki et al 2017; Mayer et al 2020\). In acute care settings, we have produced peer\-reviewed evidence of better engagement between staff and patients as well as improved retention of staff, greater job satisfaction and staff wellbeing \(McCance et al 2008, Parlour et al 2014, Hahtela et al 2015, Laird et al 2015\). In palliative care, our systematic evaluations of practice development programmes have shown improvements in regulator quality indicators, as well as improvements to the quality of the care environment, better and more effective staff communication, increased staff development, and better retention of staff \(Yalden et al 2013, McCormack et al 2018, Haraldsdottir et al 2020\).  An international programme of work leading to the development and testing of eight person\-centred nursing key performance indicators \(KPIs\) and associated measurement tools have been tested through a series of international implementation studies in a range of clinical settings \(McCance and Wilson 2015, McCance et al 2020\). Findings from these studies confirm that using the eight KPIs generates evidence of patient experience that facilitates engagement of nurses to develop person\-centred practice, contributing to an enhanced care experience.  Our ongoing research has led to the development of the first ever Indicators for Person\-centred Healthcare Curricula \(McCormack & Dewing 2019\) that are being tested in an Erasmus\+ pan\-European curriculum development project \(Dickson et al 2020\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research highlights the importance of developing person\-centred cultures in healthcare settings for staff to ‘be the best that they can be’ so that service users can experience person\-centred care.  The PCPF is designed to articulate the relationship between care cultures and care practices to inform targeted developments in care settings that have resulted in four kinds of impact: 

1.  Enhanced Practice Experience for Service\-users and Staff 

1.  Workplace Culture Change 

1.  Quality Improvements 

1.  Transformative Learning and Development 

 **Enhanced Practice Experience for Service Users and Staff**: In the Republic of Ireland, a national programme of development was commissioned by the Health Service Executive \(HSE\) across the Irish health system \(2017\-2020\) focusing on the creation of person\-centred cultures. Two\-hundred facilitators are embedded in the health system facilitating practice change.  Impacts include changes in behaviours among participants towards more person\-centred practices \(e.g. changes to language used in practice, better staff relationships\); more effective communication in and between teams; innovations in practice such as new services and improved quality assessments from regulation authorities \( *Evidence source 1\).*  As a result of this work a ‘practical’ set of Person\-centred Principles were developed and these, along with the PCPF have been integrated into the Health Service Executive’s ‘Health Services Change Guide’\( *Evidence source 2, pages 194\-197\).* 

 **Workplace Culture Change:** Further impact from our research can be demonstrated through the international adoption of the PCPF to facilitate culture change in healthcare settings. In NSW Australia the State Health Department’s ‘Essentials of Care’ Programme uses the Framework to develop person\-centred cultures and systematically change practices, policies and systems *.* Outcomes include improved patient outcomes, increased person\-centred care, more effective partnerships with service users, increased resource efficiency, improved professionalism among nurses as evidenced through the systematic evaluation of the work in one tertiary healthcare setting \( *Evidence Source 3\)*. 

 A programme of research and development focusing on the implementation of a set of 8 person\-centred Nursing Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) by nursing teams has been implemented in the UK, Denmark, Australia and Canada.  The person\-centred KPIs are derived from the PCPF and it is the combination of the KPIs as a mechanism for evaluating person\-centred care and the use of the theory of person\-centredness to drive forward improvements in practice that maximises impact. \( *Evidence* *Source 4 **\).**  Outcomes from this work include increased staff engagement in person\-centred care, a greater focus on improving practice, and increased ability of nurses and midwives to articulate and demonstrate the positive contribution of nursing and midwifery in different settings *\(Evidence Sources 5 and 6\).* 

 **Quality Improvements:** In Austria, the framework has been used to design a model of nursing home accreditation – the first of its kind in Austria.  The accreditation model incorporates the PCPF and the implementation of the model is evaluated using the associated instruments and tools. The framework provides a basis for all care and support processes as well as for organizational, strategic and structural measures at the state level. It also provides the theoretical framework for evaluation. \( *Evidence Source 7\).* 

 As a result of our ongoing research, Health Improvement Scotland \(HIS\), in its national ‘Specialist Dementia Unit’ improvement programme has adopted the *Workplace Culture Critical Analysis Tool \(WCCAT\)* to guide observations of practice and a participatory approach to the making of quality improvements.  One such example is that of Balmore Ward, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’ *\(Evidence source 8a\)*. The work, guided by our person\-centred research has resulted in outcomes including, changes in day\-to\-day practices and relationships with residents, better engagement with carers and implementation of meaningful activities for residents \( *Evidence Source 8b\).* The WCCAT is now integrated into the Scotland\-wide ‘Specialist Dementia Unit Improvement Programme *\(Evidence source 8c\).* 

 **Transformative Learning and Development:** The PCPF forms the core theoretical basis of ‘the Leadership Development Programme in Nursing Development Units \(NDUs\)’ in Germany. One of the outcomes from implementing the Framework has been the development of a new nursing organisational system to support and help embed person\-centredness in the units. The Framework has been translated into German and a guidance book has been developed for use across the health system in the Deggendorf region of Germany.  Nurses use this guidance book to reflect on their everyday practice *\(Evidence Source 9\)*, mapping situations to the framework and keeping notes: this forms the basis of reflection rounds with the team *.* Changes to practice include better ‘knowing’ of the patient and their family, more effective patient handover reports, implementation of a new nursing organisation system and a focus on continuous quality improvement *\(Evidence Source 10\).* The processes and outcomes from this work have been integrated into bachelor of nursing education programmes in Deggendorf Institute of Technology \(academic partner for the programme\) and collaboration extended to Switzerland and Austria. 

 Overall, the reach and significance of the impact, evidenced through these impact themes, demonstrates person\-centred outcomes for service\-users, healthcare staff and health systems.

###  5. Sources to corroborate the impact 

 **Evidence 1** **The National Person\-centred Cultures Programme** brings together a collection of narratives written by participants of the national programme six\-months after they completed the 12\-month facilitator development programme.  The narratives present details of changes to structures, processes and resulting outcomes in a variety of care settings across the Irish health system. 

 **Evidence 2** is a copy of the **Irish Health Service Executive’s ‘Health Services Change Guide’**. This guide was produced by the National Quality Improvement \(QI\) Leadership Team who are responsible for the upscaling of QI activities across the health system.  The team worked with members of the national programme \(evidence 1\) to generate a set of person\-centred principles to be integrated into QI programmes.  This is evidenced in pages 194\-197 of the guide. 

 **Evidence 3 Improving patient and staff outcomes using practice development**  is a peer\-reviewed international publication by Hennessey, C.E. and Fry, M. \(2016\)  [https://doi.org/10.1108/IJHCQA\-02\-2016\-0020](https://doi.org/10.1108/IJHCQA-02-2016-0020) In this paper, the authors provide an overview of the New South Wales State ‘Essentials of Care’ programme which is modelled on the PCPF and associated measurement tools, as well as the outcomes arising from its implementation and evaluation in one of Sydney’s major tertiary healthcare facilities \(The Prince of Wales Hospital/health system\). 

 **Evidence 4 Identifying key performance indicators for nursing and midwifery care using a consensus approach** is a peer\-reviewed international publication by McCance et al \(2012\)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365\-2702.2011.03820.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03820.x) 

 The paper provides an overview of the development of the KPI as a systematic and national project. 

 **Evidence 5 and 6** **Evaluating the use of key performance indicators to evidence the patient experience and Implementing person\-centred key performance indicators to strengthen leadership in community nursing: A feasibility study** are peer\-reviewed international publications by McCance et al \(2015\)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12899](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12899) and McCance et al \(2020\)  [https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13107](https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13107) These papers provide evidence of impact of the implementation of the KPIs in different care settings.  Thus importantly identifying the transferability of this body of evidence and the implementation and evaluation methodologies. 

 **Evidence 7** **Knowing the person of the resident – a theoretical framework for Person\-centred Practice in Long\-term Care \(PeoPLe**\) provides an overview of the significant work that has taken place in the region of Lower Austria to design a person\-centred approach to assuring and accrediting care home quality in that region.  Austria doesn’t have a national quality assurance and accreditation system for care homes and so this work is forming the basis for ongoing national developments. 

 **Evidence 8a, 8b, 8c** **NHS and Health Improvement Scotland policy/guidance documents** provide significant evidence of the impact of quality improvement work in specialist dementia units as part of a National Programme by Health Improvement Scotland, ‘Focus on Dementia’.  It demonstrates the processes used including the use of the observation tool, the WCCAT and together these evidence sources demonstrate outcomes for persons living with dementia, teams and cultures at local and national levels. 

 **Evidence 9** is a **German translation of the PCPF** and applied to the regional Nursing Development Unit programme in that region. Whilst **Evidence 10** is the **transcript of an interview held with the academic partner for that program**me, where she outlines the person\-centred processes used, learning strategies engaged, outcomes arising and key learning to inform ongoing and further implementation activity.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bournemouth University \(BU\) has worked with the Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust and Odstock Medical Limited in electrical stimulation for many years, developing new devices and pioneering treatment methods. Since 2013, the devices have been used to help more than 10,000 people nationwide to improve their walking. Over 25,000 devices have been sold and sales of a new wireless system \(Pace XL\), developed by BU, have generated more than GBP1,000,000 in sales. A new orthopaedic stimulator is now commercially available. 

 The new devices and treatments have been used to help people with a range of conditions, including Bell’s Palsy, Parkinson’s Disease, orthopaedic problems, people with multiple sclerosis and those recovering from strokes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Electrical stimulation \(ES\) is a method of externally controlling muscles following either neurological problems, where signals from the brain are interrupted due to neurological disease or accident \(stroke etc\), or in musculoskeletal problems due to muscle weakness or imbalance. When ES is used to provide a specific function, such as walking or hand grasp, it is known as functional electrical stimulation \(FES\). 

 The clinical service in Salisbury started after Professor Swain undertook the world’s first randomised controlled clinical trial of an FES orthosis in people who had a dropped foot as a result of a stroke. Results showed that it had significant advantages over traditional physiotherapy, as people receive therapy while they are walking, in addition to its orthotic effect, hence improving walking ability and quality of life \[R1\]. 

 BU took the lead in patenting the original Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator \(ODFS\) in 2001, later known as the ODFS Pace, and in the early work of establishing the first NHS company in England, Odstock Medical Limited \(OML\), in 2006. Since then, Swain has led a collaboration between BU, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust \(SFT\) and OML, with the clinical service expanding to include the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis \(MS\), spinal cord injury and Parkinson’s disease as well as stroke.  This is an ideal working relationship, with BU providing the academic infrastructure, SFT providing clinical supervision, and OML providing commercial expertise and promoting FES techniques and equipment, running training courses and developing marketing materials. 

 The group \(BU, SFT, OML\) achieved a number of world and European firsts, working with other universities such as Surrey, Southampton, Salford and UCL; these included the first implanted dropped foot stimulator clinical service in the world in 2006 and, through the development of the National Clinical FES Centre in Salisbury, also in 2006, the largest clinical service in the world based on the results of clinical trials. 

 Clinical trials undertaken at SFT, supervised by Swain and Taylor, have shown that, in people who have had a stroke, FES is well accepted and 43% of participants improved their speed \[R2\]. In people with MS, there was also a highly significant improvement in walking speed and a training affect in those people who were less impaired \[R3\]. 

 Swain recently held a GBP117,576 National Institute for Health Research Programme Grant, which looked at the use of technology \(including FES\) in improving upper limb function post\-stroke. This enabled the development of an upper limb service \[R4\] as this research showed that FES was the assistive technology treatment with most evidence of clinical efficacy. Two further grants from spinal cord injury charity The Inspire Foundation, worth a total of GBP183,440, demonstrated that it is possible to use surface electrodes to restore useful hand function to people with tetraplegia \[R5\]. 

 Research on a wireless system by BU led directly to the development of OML’s wireless ODFS Pace XL system shown in Figure 1 \[R6\]. 





 Figure 1: OML Pace XL stimulator with wireless footswitch \(courtesy of OML\). 

 Swain’s move to the Orthopaedic Research Institute \(ORI\) at BU to work with Wainwright and Middleton has enabled techniques developed for people with neurological problems to be applied to those with orthopaedic problems \[R7\]. Combining this expertise has led to the development of new stimulators and training courses.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  Health benefits 

 The findings from the BU, OML, SFT partnership have helped to develop the National Clinical FES Centre in Salisbury, the largest clinical service in the world. As of February 2020, 7,790 people have been treated in Salisbury \(excluding those on clinical trials\) and a wide range of clinical services has been provided. 

 In addition to those with walking problems, the following numbers of patients have been treated since 2014; 148 upper limb, 16 facial problems such as Bell’s Palsy and 8 for constipation. It has been established that our ES systems have radically changed people’s lives, increasing people’s functional ability and improving their quality of life, and hence participation in society \[E1, E2, E3\]: 

 ‘The ODFS Pace has given me my life back and I can’t imagine life without it. I am now able to do things around the house like cooking and cleaning. It also stops me relying on people all the time.’ 

 ‘One day I was in a wheelchair, the next day I was walking. FES has changed my life.’ 

 ‘I have been using a single channel stimulator for foot drop, due to MS, for five years. I wear it every day and it has allowed me to carry on working full\-time. It is the single most helpful thing in this journey as a patient, and has allowed me to remain as active as possible. I can’t praise the Odstock Medical staff enough\!’ 

 ‘Benefits are that it is strengthening his legs, his movement, more so when he is running, you can see that he’s lifting his leg more. He’s definitely participating more in school, getting involved with football.’ \[E4a, E4b\] 

 Over the past six years, other FES centres have been established in the UK, using our equipment, with the West Midlands Rehabilitation Centre having seen more than 1,400 patients, the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, more than 700, and Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital more than 500 \[E5\]. 

 BU research has shown that, in people with stroke, there is both a clinically significant orthotic effect in the walking speed, with 43% of participants improving their speed, and a training effect \(improvement when stimulation removed\) in the least disabled \[R2\]. In people with MS, due to the nature of the disease, there was no significant training effect, but people did have a 27% increase in walking speed, with 95% maintaining or improving their functional walking category \(FWC\) \[R3\]. Effort and fear of falling were reduced and people more able to achieve their goals. Actual falls were shown to be reduced by 72% and 73% in two trials \[E6\]. 

####  Policy impacts 

 FES obtained NICE approval in 2009 and, in 2016, a further NICE device specific publication, Medical Innovation Bulletin, MIB56, focused on the PACE system \[E7\]. Swain was also a professional expert on the development of new NICE guidelines \(IPG 677\) published in August 2020 on the use of electrical stimulation in non\-neurological long\-term conditions \[E8\]. 

 The Royal College of Physicians has positively commented on FES in its 2016 Stroke Guidelines: ‘People with stroke who have reduced ability to dorsiflex the foot \(“foot\-drop”\) should be offered functional electrical stimulation to improve their gait.’ 

 The Department of Health requested the establishment of training courses for professionals to spread the use of the techniques and FES technology worldwide.  Since 2014, OML has trained more than 600 staff in the UK and abroad in how to implement the devices and treatments developed with BU for people with lower limb restrictions and more than 400 staff in upper limb courses \[E5\]. 

####  Economic benefits 

 In order to compare the efficacy of FES to other medical treatments, QALY \(quality adjusted life years\) analysis was undertaken, initially by the NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency. This showed that the cost of FES per QALY was calculated at GBP9,658, compared to a hip replacement, GBP5,623 and hip resurfacing GBP12,370. A figure of GBP20,000 per QALY \(keeping a person in a good state of health for one year\) is the usual criteria for NHS funding. 

 Using data obtained since 2014, this has been recalculated at GBP4,086 per QALY when the reduction in falls in MS patients is taken into account. In a recent independent paper from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, which exclusively used equipment developed by our group, a cost per QALY of GBP6,137 was calculated \[E10\]. The mean length of usage of the system is 6.2 years, although many people use it far longer, with more than 25% of people using it for more than 11 years. 

 OML’s remit is to develop and sell FES/ES products, train staff and provide patient treatment, both to the NHS and privately, utilising technology developed at BU. In total, more than 25,000 stimulators have been sold in 13 overseas countries \[E5\], including developing countries such as India, with the US, Denmark and Germany being the biggest markets. The number of full\-time staff employed by OML has increased since 2013 \(see table below\) \[E5\]: 

| **Period** | **Up to 2013** | **Up to 2020** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staff employed | **16.4** | **25** |
| Patients treated | **4,996** | **7,790** |
| People trained | **2,565** | **3,620** |
| Countries where FES is distributed | **20** | **20** |

 FES sales have increased in value from GBP1,507,975 in 2012/13 to GBP2,122,360 in 2016/7 \[E5\]. Since 2016, OML has sold more than GBP3,000,000 of FES equipment, including 3,300 wireless systems worth more than GBP1,000,000 \[E5\]. A new orthopaedic stimulator, Orthopaedic Microstim, designed by ORI and marketed by OML, is also commercially available \[E5\]. It is suitable for the entire patient journey through joint replacement surgery: from pre\-conditioning, to reduction of oedema and pain immediately after surgery, to building up muscle strength once the patient has been discharged.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Context** 

 With a strategic vision to focus on pioneering commercially exploitable product innovations across a spectrum of application areas **\[3.A\-3.D\]**, the team conducted research in product design and data management **\[3.1,3.2\],** process/work\-cell design and work\-study analysis using digital mock\-up tools **\[3.2,3.3\]** and environmental impact analysis **\[3.4, 3.5\].** 

 **Key findings:** 

 **Nanokicking \(Project I\):** UWS research in product design \( **Vichare, Cameron**\) has led to the invention of cultureware capable of harvesting induced nano\-vibrations through a bio\-reactor for clinical trials. The research supported the team \(names of key individuals from 3.1 below\), working collaboratively with the team at the **University of Glasgow** \( **Dalby**\), achieving an entirely new discovery within tissue engineering which involves harnessing nano\-vibrations for growing surgical bone graft. Prior to this work, it was reported that 1KHz nano\-vibrations can stimulate osteogenesis in 2D and 3D cell culture **\[3.1\].** However, rotary/perfusion mechanical bioreactors used in the previous investigative projects were incommodious, as it was difficult to detach individual clinical samples from the cultureware, for clinical procedures. Underpinning product design research **\[3.1\]** \(injection mould design, mould manufacturability, and mould flow analysis\) has shown that the bio\-reactor system fitted with an innovative six\-well cultureware with toroidal shaped magnets incorporated in the base of each well can be realised and utilised for rapid osteogenesis. The cultureware was produced using an insert type multi\-ejection stroke injection moulding technique. The cultureware and thus collagen and mesenchymal stem cells \(MSCs\), all resonated at 1KHz with an amplitude of 30nm, and have produced clinical grade osteogenic\-cells. 

 **Rapid coating processes \(Project II\):** Underpinning research \( **Vichare**\) on dimensional variation analysis **\[3.2\]** and UWS’ original in\-house collaborative product/process development was applied for designing and manufacturing critical opto\-mechanical components of the Microwave Plasma Assisted Sputter \(MPAS\) system. This was in support of the research at the UWS’s Institute of Thin Films, Sensors and Imaging \(ITFSI\) to develop and patent a unique retrofittable plasma source for assisted deposition **\[3.6\]**. This is a high throughput MPAS system for rapid coating processes. Prior to this research, the technological barrier for optical coatings was the limited capacity of commercial Electron Beam Deposition \(EBD\) systems. Therefore, the demand for a high throughput versatile system for optical coatings was evident. This included complex rotating drum sub\-assembly with critical tolerances between optical and mechanical components of the system. The resulting MPAS system was designed to support four sputter targets. Industrial trials have shown a fourfold increase in the coating surface area and a sixfold increase in throughput, which has resulted in a sector\-leading operative optical coating system. 

 **Remanufacturing of street\-light housing \(Project III\):** The research team **\(Vichare, Olabi, Marzano\)** investigated and developed a large\-scale remanufacturing process for replacing sodium lamps in existing street\-light housings with LED lights. Underpinning research **\[3.5\]** included investigation of a chemical\-stripping process for aluminium alloy housings with polyester\-based powder coatings. The ground\-breaking research including life\-cycle assessment **\[3.4\]** has quantified significant chemical waste and associated environmental impact with de\-coating process. A re\-coating process was developed, which was applied on cleaned light housings without removing their original coating. Re\-coating trials were conducted on both i\) de\-coated castings and ii\) cleaned/wiped castings \(with existing coating\) for comparison purposes. Following this research, it was concluded that the de\-coating process is not required; thereby reducing chemical waste and the associated negative environmental impact. 

 WSL have stated that **\[5.6\]:** *“Re\-coating process for existing aluminium light\-housings was definitely a turning point for mass refurbishment projects, where we realised that chemical stripping process can be avoided. The similar approach can be applied to other refurbishment cases as well.”* 

 Research undertaken in work\-study and ergonomic analysis has resulted in a design and fabrication dedicated remanufacturing work\-station, which reduced disassembly process time by 68% **\[3.3\].** 

 The overall enhanced product development capability at UWS in delivering innovative products and processes, has gained significant industry recognition and resulted in a number of further Innovate UK funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) projects **\(Vichare, Leslie, Gibson, Rolland\)** \(Helia Photonics Ltd, Shanghai\-JAVAC \(China\), Consult Lift Services, Teer Coatings, Alphasense, GasClip \(USA\), Phoenix Instinct Limited, Sanondaf UK, ACS Clothing Limited\) **\[3.E\-3.L\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **History of impact generation** 

 Research in through\-life product development has been pivotal in several commercial exploitations at UWS: **\(1\)** An early collaboration between the tissue engineering group from the University of Glasgow \( **Dalby**\) and ITFSI research groups \( **Reid**\) from UWS resulted in a programme of investigative projects during \(2011 to2014\) for stimulating osteogenesis in MSCs, using externally induced mechanical nano\-vibrations \(nanokicking\). A follow\-on project, aimed at developing a clinical infrastructure for surgeons to develop a bone graft, demanded a specialised cultureware to be installed on a nano\-vibrational bioreactor. Thus, expertise in product design and data management, injection mould design and dimensional variation analysis \( **Vichare**\) from the Engineering group at UWS was sought \(2014 to2016\). This led to a collaboration with ITFSI research groups to investigate the design feasibility of novel cultureware \(Project I\). **\(2\)** This successful multidisciplinary collaboration extended to further investigate mechanical design aspects of various opto\-mechanical systems and sensors development projects within ITFSI \( **Gibson**\). This later resulted in the successful realisation of a sector\-leading MPAS system \(Project II\). **\(3\)** Within its Council Strategic Plan \(CSP\), GCC has made a commitment to be one of the most sustainable cities in Europe over the next 20 years. GCC and local authorities are working with WSL on several recycling projects. WSL is a fully licenced Waste Management Company, committed to providing positive environmental impact not solely by offering responsible recycle and repair options, but also investing significantly for exploring re\-usability pathways. The need for recycling or re\-using street\-light housing was first discussed with GCC in early 2016. WSL states that **\[5.6\]:** *“Although we have wide experience and virtuous knowledge base in processing electronic component, we wanted to extend this knowledge in recycling and re\-using large castings and coating processes. Most of our recycled/re\-used components have plastic housings, which can be re\-used after cosmetic alteration processes. However, re\-using street\-light housings \(made of aluminium alloy\) was comparatively new area for us. Thus, we had to explore recycling and re\-use options for these components with environment impact assessment.”* Initial coating trials and investigation outcomes **\(Vichare, Olabi\)** were presented to GCC executives. This initiated a follow\-on investigation on establishing a remanufacturing process for street\-light housings \(Project III\). In response, an interdisciplinary team with expertise in work\-cell design, human centric ergonomic design, life\-cycle analysis **\(Vichare, Marzano\)** was formed to configure a remanufacturing process, focusing on designing a dedicated workstation to reduce dis\-assembly time. 

 **Technological and economic impact through products and processes adoption:** 

 **Histocell**, a biopharmaceutical company based in Bilbao, **Spain**, has adopted our novel bioreactor technology and established a new production and testing process **\[5.2\]** of this nanovibrational system. 

 The CEO of Histocell, has confirmed **\[5.2\]:** *“Research projects aimed at adopting this technology for clinical trials, this included GBP2,800,000project funded by the **Sir Bobby Charlton Foundation landmine charity** **\[5.2, 5.3\]** and the new **Healikick consortium** which received EUR5.2m of European Horizon 2020 funding. These projects include direct funding to Histocell who are developing the GMP \(Good Manufacturing Practice\) grade clinical therapeutic intended for human use.* *We have transferred a number of nanovibrational systems to our laboratory at Histocell and have adopted the cell stimulation processes developed by your academic team to produce initial batches of osteogenic cells using this technique.”* 

 This system consists of i\) a bio\-reactor with piezo actuator source attached to the vibration plate for producing nano\-vibrations and ii\) toroidally shaped, six\-well cultureware with unidirectional ferrite magnets embedded in the base of each well for conformal attachment to the bioreactor’s magnetic vibration plate. This has impacted on Histocell’s capacity to introduce advanced therapeutic medical products and devices for ongoing clinical development in bone repair derived from MSCs in order to treat bone defects. 

 While confirming the used of these cultureware, Histocell stated that **\[5.2\]:** *“Through these ongoing projects, we will work with your team to test these cells in pre\-clinical scenarios, to establish a GMP production process and to produce cells for first\-in human clinical trial.”* 

 **HPL** and the **JAVAC** facility in Shanghai, **China**, are commercially using the UWS\-developed complex opto\-mechanical MPAS systems. This has directly resulted from Project II and has thus provided a significant technological impact by applying underpinning research for commercial exploitation internationally. 

 The CEO of JAVAC stated that **\[5.4\]:** “ *The novel MPAS process offers a disruptive technology providing up to six times enhancement of throughput compared to current state of the art Physical Vapour Deposition processes based on high temperature electron beam deposition \(primary method used worldwide for production of optical coatings\). JAVAC estimate 10 to 15 MPAS machine sales per annum with an equivalent sales value of USD7,000,000 to 10,000,000,.”* 

 This has provided JAVAC with a competitive advantage in the global optical coating market. Overall impact is contributed through mechanical system design, which involves consolidating design/manufacture requirements, applying dimensional variation analysis and managing product/process data for developing an entire MPAS and critical sub\-systems. 

 The CEO of HPL, commented that **\[5.5\]**: *“This opto\-mechanical system has enabled HPL to secure new business, examples include optical coating of microelectromechanical system wafers used in smart phone advanced spectrometers and large area components for holographic projectors. This has translated into additional HPL export sales of GBP180,000 per annum, set to double within the next six months \(78% of HPL total sales are export\)”* **.** 

 A new remanufacturing process was adopted by **WSL** **\[5.6\]**, following revolutionary collaborative research with the company and **GCC**. A dedicated remanufacturing work\-station was designed and evaluated using ergonomic principles and then fabricated and tested with a pilot batch of 100 street\-light\-housings; now operational at WSL. Resulting disassembly process time was reduced to an average of 9 minutes from 28 minutes; i.e. c.68% reduction in the processing time. 

 Considering the anticipated quantity of street\-light\-housings in GCC alone \(\~10,000\), the Managing Director of WSL has confirmed **\[5.6\]:** *“Following the initial project pilot stage, WSL is now in prime position to secure remanufacturing contracts for subsequent phases of street\-light replacement for GCC. Based on the research and results from initial remanufacturing process trials, the financial savings for GCC were estimated GBP260,000, and the turnover for WSL estimated to be approximately GBP900,000. The next two phases of the project of 15,000 units and 40,000 units are expected to generate turnover of around GBP12,500,000 over the period of the contracts with the creation of between 15 and 20 full time jobs”* **.**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Green chemistry research and innovation policy originating at Imperial College \(IC\) has propelled technologies that are now helping to achieve a thriving ‘net zero’ economy in London. Research commencing in 2006, co\-led by Professor Richard Templer, conceptualised the design of a near net zero industrial ecosystem which provided the framework for an EU\-funded accelerator programme for new clean technology start\-ups. Since 2011, the IC\-based accelerator has supported 64 start\-ups in securing $300 million of investment – a 25\-fold return on public funding. Building on this success, the Mayor of London sought Professor Templer’s advice in 2017 to create a cleantech roadmap that has now become part of official Mayoral policy.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 A number of countries, including the UK, have made commitments to move to a net zero emissions economy. In 2006, **a UK\-US chemistry group co\-led by Professor Richard Templer**, published the conceptual design of a near net zero industrial economy, underpinned by sustainable biopower and biomaterials **\[1\]**. It considered micro\-technologies, for example, gene engineering approaches to increase the efficiency of the carbon fixing photosynthetic reaction of the enzyme RuBisCO, as well macro\- interventions such as designing biomaterials for recycling as part of a circular system. 

 Since then, the fundamental underpinning chemistry and many of the research themes and technologies outlined in the 2006 paper have been further explored and developed at IC, partly through the support of a Climate\-KIC Accelerator Programme \(see section 4\). 

 An **IC team led by Professors Jason Hallett \(co\-author of \[1\]\) and Tom Welton plus Dr Agnieszka Brandt\-Talbot** investigated the use of lignocellulosic biomass as a source of liquid biofuels, bio\-based materials and bio\-derived chemicals. This requires a pre\-treatment step before the sugars contained in the biomass can be processed biologically or chemically. In 2017, the group demonstrated the feasibility of using low\-cost \(ca. $1 kg<sup>−1</sup>\) ionic liquids, including triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate, for fractionation into a cellulose rich pulp, a lignin and a distillate. They found that up to 85% of the lignin and up to 100% of the hemicellulose were solubilized into the ionic liquid solution. The ionic liquid was successfully recovered and recycled four times \[ **2**\]. This work effectively represented the first demonstration of an efficient and repeated lignocellulose fractionation and ultimately led to the creation of the successful **startup Lixea**. 

 An **IC team led by Professor Anthony Kucernak and Dr Daniel Malko** have investigated the use of non\-precious elements, including nitrogen carbon composites, as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. For example, in 2015 they found that the polymerisation of 1,5\-diaminonaphthalene provides self\-assembled nanospheres, which form a catalytically active high surface area.  Crucially the reaction is tolerant to a wide range of substances that normally poison precious metal\-based catalysts, thus lending itself to applications in complex and challenging mixtures, including in fuel cells using low quality fuels; oxygen sensing in different biological media; and in wastewater treatment \[ **3**\]. Indeed, this work led to the creation of **startup SweetGen**, offering solutions for the treatment of industrial wastewater streams \(with concurrent generation of electricity\). 

 For over a decade, **an IC group including Professors Nigel Brandon and Anthony Kucernak** has been developing stable, cost\-effective hybrid redox flow cells \(HRFC\) and regenerative fuel cells \(RFC\) for potential use in renewable energy grids. In a recent collaboration with the University of Warwick, the IC team showed enhanced durability and performance of HRFCs with hybrid electrodes consisting of electrophoretically deposited nitrogen\-doped graphene on carbon paper and economically sourced electrolytes \(including manganese or sulfur\) \[ **4**\]. In parallel to this work, Brandon, Kucernak and others have commercialised the technology through the spinout **RFC Power**. 

 Bacterial cellulose has potential use in novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, medicine, electronics and fabrics. In 2016, an **IC team including Professors Tom Ellis, Paul Freemont, and Richard Kitney** reported the development of a modular genetic toolkit that enables biosynthesis of patterned cellulose; functionalization of the cellulose surface with proteins; and tuneable control over cellulose production. This work laid the foundations for using genetic engineering to produce cellulose\-based materials, with numerous applications including novel high\-specificity water filters \[ **5**\]. Indeed, the work inspired the creation of **startup Puraffinity** which is developing a range of adsorbent media materials targeted to selectively capture and remove polyfluoroalkyl substances \(PFAS\) \- a global environmental challenge.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Transitioning to a net zero emissions economy was one of the focuses of the AtlantIC Alliance between IC, Georgia Tech and Oak Ridge National Labs \[A\]. In 2006, members of the group, co\-led by Professor Richard Templer, published the conceptual design of a near net zero industrial economy, underpinned by sustainable biopower and biomaterials \(see section 2\). To help bring this net zero vision to reality the team sought to create a climate\-change innovation organisation. In 2009, scientists at IC and ETH Zurich wrote a successful bid to fund an EU innovation partnership, the Climate Knowledge and Innovation Community KIC \(Climate\-KIC\). Professor Templer led and wrote the components on the creation of an Accelerator Programme and an allied education programme in the art of the efficient commercialising of innovation. 

 The IC\-based Climate\-KIC Accelerator, has been one of the most prolific programmes of its kind in this area. It ran from 2011 until 2020, with a total of €9.4 million of funding from the EU \(renewed yearly\) and has recently been awarded £5.9 million from HSBC and the European Regional Development Fund to run from 2021\-2025. 

###  Propelling clean tech solutions 

 Successful applicants received up to €40k each in seed funding from the Accelerator. Out of the 95 entrants to the programme, 64 have gone on to ‘graduate’ by raising over €200k investment each and/or achieving significant sales within 18 months. Collectively these startups have raised a total of $300 Million, creating upwards of 1000 jobs **\[B\]**. This represents a 67% success rate in raising significant funds and a 25\-fold return on initial public funding. Successful graduate companies include Lixea \(lixea.co\), Puraffinity \(puraffinity.com\) RFC Power \(rfcpower.com\) and SweetGen \(sweetgen.co.uk\) \(see section 2\). 

 Lixea was awarded €2.3 million \(£2m\) from the European Innovation Council in December 2019 in order to build a pilot plant to scale its innovative biomass fractionation process for the production of biochemicals, bioplastics, and biofuels from wood waste **\[C\]**. 

 Puraffinity received $3.55 million \(£2.8m\) from leading sustainability investors in 2019. This has allowed them to focus their PFAS water contamination solution on industries facing the most severe problems, such as airports, military bases and chemical manufacturing. Lead investor Kindred Capital commented: “We see their new product as a pioneering development which leverages chemistry principles in an advanced way to provide a solution to a key environmental issue.” \[ **D**\] 

 RFC Power has secured xxxxxxx  from investors including IP Group, who noted that “the market opportunity for long duration battery storage is already large and it is likely to grow rapidly over the next 10 years,” adding that “RFC can achieve a sustainable competitive advantage thanks to its two highly distinctive patent\-protected systems with lower levelised cost than current offerings.” \[ **E**\] 

 After winning the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Emerging Technologies Competition 2016, SweetGen has now completed a trials and demonstration period and focusing its abiotic wastewater fuel technology on the water treatment industry before expanding to different sectors including brewing, chemical and food and agriculture industries. \[ **F**\] 

###  Building a legacy in policy 

 Following seminal green chemistry research at IC and the success of the Climate\-KIC Accelerator, Templer was asked by the London Sustainable Development Commission \(LSDC\) to lead a team advising the Mayor of London on how to strengthen the growth of new clean technology \(cleantech\) businesses in London. This led to the ‘Better Future’ \(2016\) roadmap for the development of a cleantech innovation cluster **\[G\]**. 

 Better Future’s central conclusion was that both greater visibility and accelerated growth rate of the cleantech sector would be supported by the establishment of an innovation cluster. 

 To test some of the ideas within Better Future, IC chemists collaborated with partners including the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) and West London Business, through a European Regional Development Fund funded project – Better Futures **\[H\]**. This examined the effect of geographical clustering of a community of 56 cleantech businesses and the impact of technical assistance from IC’s researchers and postgraduate internships. 

 The influence of Better Future can now be seen in four major aspects of Mayoral strategy and policy – notably in the London Plan \(2017\); the Mayor’s Environment Strategy \(2018\); the Mayor’s Economic Development Strategy \(2018\); and Cleantech London \(2020\). 

 The London Plan is the key document defining binding policy and regulation for development in London **\[I\]**. In Policy E8, part F, it is written that “Clusters such as Tech City and MedCity should be promoted and the development of new clusters should be supported where opportunities exist, such as CleanTech innovation clusters”. This policy and recommendation follow directly from Better Future’s recommendations. Notably, the London Plan was approved by the UK Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government in January 2021 **\[I\]**. 

 The impact of Better Future in both the Environment Strategy and Economic Development Strategy is corroborated by a letter from Aram Wood \(Assistant Director, Energy and Environment Team, Greater London Authority\) **\[J\]**. 

 Aram Wood, Assistant Director, Energy and Environment Team, writes: 

 *‘The Mayor recognises that for London to remain an influential global city it must be at the forefront of developing the solutions to address the challenges of climate change. Prof. Templer’s contributions have been timely and important in helping us to determine how we turn these challenges into important opportunities.’* 

 *‘We have taken the ideas presented in Better Future and embedded them in Mayoral policy; they will continue to be influential policy until at least 2040; they form the basis for a significant part of London’s approach to addressing the climate emergency, and will be important in developing green and sustainable jobs for Londoners hit by the Covid\-19 pandemic.’* 

 Mayoral support for Better Future’s vision led to Templer working with the GLA to undertake a further study of how a cleantech cluster might be formed. This led to the development of the collaborative Cleantech London initiative **\[K\]** launched in March 2020. Its stated mission is to help London become a world\-leading cleantech innovation hotspot and Professor Templer now sits on the Board.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 MacAskill’s research on effective altruism led to millions of pounds in donations to charity. It motivated billionaire Ben Delo to pledge over USD500,000,000 to effective charities over his lifetime. The research also had a large influence on setting up the Long\-term Future Effective Altruism Fund, which has paid out more than USD4,000,000 to charitable purposes to this day. MacAskill has also reached a large public audience through several high\-profile podcasts and a TED talk, drawing dozens of people into the effective altruism movement with a commitment to improve human and animal wellbeing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Between 2015 and 2020, MacAskill and Ord have been carrying out desk research in moral philosophy to answer the most important questions regarding institutional, philanthropic and individual action to maximise impartial welfare. This came in two categories: the foundations of effective altruism, and decision\-making under moral uncertainty. 

 **Foundations of effective altruism**  Effective altruism uses evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others by as much as possible and taking action on that basis. For example: if you want to donate to charity, which charity will do the most good \(impartially considered\), with your donation? Or if you want to pursue a career that has a positive impact on the world, which career paths will have the biggest impact? 

  

 Research carried out by MacAskill between 2015 and 2019, including *The Definition of Effective Altruism* \[1\], *Effective Altruism: Introduction* \[2\], and *Understanding Effective Altruism and its Challenges* \[3\] further developed and defined the concept of ‘effective altruism’. This research enabled improved understanding of what implications these ideas have on contemporary debates in shaping altruistic actions to maximise impartial welfare. His research has helped distinguish effective altruism from related concepts, like utilitarianism, show how morally ecumenical effective altruism is, and respond to common misconceptions about effective altruism, such as that it is unable to account for ‘systemic change.’ 

  

 **Decision\-making under moral uncertainty** 

 Second, decision\-making under moral uncertainty. Very often we are uncertain about what we ought, morally, to do. So how should we make decisions in the face of such uncertainty? This is a crucial theoretical issue for someone who is engaged in the project of effective altruism because it impacts so heavily on the question of *cause\-prioritisation*: if you want to do the most good, should you try to improve the health of the world’s poorest people, try to reduce the risk of 

 civilizational catastrophe from climate change, or do something else? One’s answer to this question will depend on fundamental moral issues, like how to value the interests of future generations against the present generation. We don’t, currently, know the answers to those questions. But we still need to act, despite our uncertainty. The theory of decision\-making under moral uncertainty allows us to make more rational and reasoned decisions, despite that uncertainty. 

  

 Between 2015 and 2020, MacAskill and Ord generated a novel account of how correctly to make decisions under moral uncertainty, as outlined in the following works: *Moral Uncertainty* \[4\] *, Statistical Normalization Methods in Interpersonal and Intertheoretic Comparisons* \[5\], and *Practical Ethics Given Moral Uncertainty* \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of this research falls into two main areas: \(1\) public policy, law and services; \(2\) understanding, learning and participation. 

  

###  Diverting institutional philanthropic resources towards more effective causes 

 MacAskill’s research on effective altruism between 2015 and 2019 has influenced the work of NGOs and other organisations by directing philanthropic resources towards more effective causes. Key examples of these are listed below: 

  

-  MacAskill’s research on effective altruism \(especially research item 1\) led several philanthropists, including billionaire Ben Delo, to direct their donations towards charities working in the field of effective altruism. \[A\] Ben Delo has, as a result of MacAskill’s research, joined the Giving Pledge in 2019 and committed to donate the majority of his wealth to long\-term oriented effective altruistic causes. \[B\] Effective Giving UK, who advise Ben Delo, state: “Based on Prof. MacAskill’s research, our advisee and the UK’s youngest self\-made billionaire, Ben Delo, pledged to donate the majority of his wealth \(over USD500,000,000\) to work to safeguard future generations and protect the long\-term prospects of humanity. In Mr. Delo’s Giving Letter, he explicitly cites Prof. MacAskill’s work on effective altruism \[...\] as influential to his giving strategy.” Ben Delo learned about MacAskill’s unpublished work through having personal conversations with him. On the Giving Pledge website, Delo states, “My approach is inspired by philosopher William MacAskill and the effective altruism movement, which promotes the use of reason and evidence when deciding how best to help others \[...\]. In short, I believe that all lives are valuable, including those of future generations.” \[A\] 

-  After MacAskill’s research on effective altruism was featured on the Making Sense Podcast with Sam Harris, \[C\] Harris decided to pledge 10% of his personal earnings as well as USD3,500 of the organisation’s income to effective charities, by signing the Giving What We Can Pledge. \[D, page 348\] The podcast has approximately 1,000,000 downloads per episode. 

-  Based on his research, MacAskill advised the Centre for Effective Altruism in establishing a fund for individual donors, directed to the long\-term future. The Centre for Effective Altruism is an Oxford\-based charity working in support of the effective altruism community in bringing about positive changes in how we improve the world. MacAskill co\-founded the organisation in 2011. The Executive Director of the Centre for Effective Altruism said: “MacAskill’s research was \[sic\] vital input in establishing the Long\-Term Future Fund.” \[E\] The Long\-Term Future Fund has raised more than USD4,800,000, of which over USD4,100,000 was paid out between March 2017 and November 2020 for charitable purposes. \[F\] 

###  Diverting lay public resources towards more effective causes 

 MacAskill and Ord’s research has contributed to enhancing understanding of issues in effective charity and decision\-making on the benefits of giving to evidence\-based charities. He has stimulated public interest and engagement in altruistic decision\-making, increased awareness of these areas and challenged norms in the area of effective ways to improve welfare. Below are some of the key examples of how this has been achieved. 

  

-  In April 2018, MacAskill argued the moral importance of the long\-term future in a TED talk on the concept of effective altruism \[A, B, C\], released on the TED website. \[G\]The talk has been watched almost 2,000,000 times and has been picked up by popular news and public intellectuals, including Max Tegmark, famous author, physicist, cosmologist and machine learning researcher on Twitter. Tegmark writes, “This was one of my favorite 2018 TED talks: let's not only do good but pick our battles wisely\!” \[G\] 

-  MacAskill presented his research on moral uncertainty \[research items 4, 5, 6\] on popular podcasts over the period 2015\-2019, including the 80,000 Hours podcast \(circa 26,000 downloads\), The Tim Ferriss Show, Very Bad Wizards, and the AI Alignment Podcast.\[H\] Some of these appearances popularised MacAskill’s research, and led to changes in the audience’s donation behaviours and careers \- such as a survey respondent starting an MPhil in a related field after listening to a podcast of MacAskill’s on Moral Uncertainty. \[L\] 

-  MacAskill encouraged people to join the effective altruism movement, and to dedicate more of their time and money towards effective charity. In a survey by the Effective Altruism Forum of their members in 2019, respondents were asked how they had first heard of effective altruism, 72 people \(63% of 115 open comments\) cite MacAskill’s podcast appearances, and 4 people \(5% of 76 open comments\) cite MacAskill’s TED talk \[I\]. The mean donation to effective charities per survey respondent was USD6,407 \(calculation: USD16,100,000 total donations \[J\] among 2513 respondents \[K\].\) One of the survey respondents who was influenced by reading MacAskill’s work said “I now donate 10% of my income” to charities and causes “such as the Against Malaria Foundation and efforts to reduce existential risk.” \[L\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Resounding Societies was a research effort concerned with the restoration, preservation and performance of three under\-represented musical traditions: *classical Arabic music*, especially Turkish and Egyptian traditions \(c1800–1960\); *South Asian music* in Mughal India and the British colonial Indian Ocean \(c1600–1900\); and *medieval European song* \(c1100–1400\). Lost or endangered through cultural suppression or passage of time, these traditions were revitalised through research by King’s music scholars, who created a shared methodology based on critical, philological and performance\-informed approaches. To the benefit of audiences, cultural institutions and performers worldwide, their research led to: changes in the preservation and presentation of music in libraries and museums; increasing awareness and appreciation of lost music through performance and programming; a change in performance practice and the creation of new opportunities for performers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Resounding Societies research initiative was developed within the King’s Music Department’s wider research strategies in historical sound studies, ethnomusicology and performance\-informed approaches, and through broader institutional support from King’s Cultural Community Namely: researchers sought to identify, interpret, restore and preserve sources for lost and endangered musical traditions housed in libraries, archives and museums across Europe, North America and Asia, to better understand their effects on past societies, and with a view to restoring them for performance today. Underpinning research was undertaken over an 11\-year period \(between 2009 and 2020\), with King’s researchers collectively receiving GBP1,253,867 funding from the British Academy, European Research Council and the Leverhulme Trust to support research and research collaboration with cultural stakeholders, such as the British Library and British Museum. 

 There were three interlocking features of the research methodology. 

#  Identification and interpretation of new written and recorded sources 

 The identification of new sources \(written and recorded\) and the fresh interpretation of new and already known sources through critical, philological and ethnomusicological methodologies were at the heart of the research. Comprehensive study of 30 manuscript sources of *medieval European song* traditions revised the understanding of notation in early songbooks, raising new awareness of these sources as witnesses to lost features of vocal performance \[1\]. Researchers also identified many new sources. Analysis and transcription of lost recordings \(records, cassettes and film soundtracks\) of Turkish and Egyptian classical music resulted in the reconstitution for the first time of a forgotten strand of late 19th\-century *classical Arabic music* \[5,6\]. The SHAMSA database 1.0 \[4\], which constitutes the largest single repository of primary written sources on Indian music and dance in the world, was the outcome of research to identify over 300 written sources c1700–1900 for the history and analysis of *South Asian music*, including North Indian \(Hindustani\) music and dance in Mughal and British colonial South Asia. 

#  Inclusion of visual and literary sources for lost and endangered music 

 Diverse evidence not normally deemed ‘musical’ – owing to its lack of notation or transcribable sound – was an innovative feature of research, with researchers working in museums and libraries across Europe, North America and Asia to establish a new source\-base for musicology. Identification and study of visual and literary representations brought to light lost biographical information about musicians and dancers, and evidence of performance in Mughal court culture, all recorded and interpreted in the SHAMSA database \[4\] and in podcasts Histories of the Ephemeral \[3\]. Research demonstrating relationships between music, material artefacts, and visual and literary representations resulted in new insights into the role of song in medieval European court culture \[2\]. 

#  Performance\-informed approaches to restoration 

 Researchers sought to reimagine the sounds represented in the sources by developing a performance\-informed approach. They experimented with transcription and arrangements of sources for performance, and used performance or collaboration with performers as an investigatory tool. This approach was exemplified in the Histories of the Ephemeral podcasts \[3\], which included performed experiments to restore lost melodies of Hindustani lyrics, including those in sources recorded in the SHAMSA database \[4\]. Research developed through collaboration with Oxford Maqam, a group dedicated to the revival of lost traditions of *classical Arabic music*, resulted in a new methodology for transcription, arrangement and performances of a lost repertoire of Egyptian Nahda era music \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings and methodologies underpinning the Resounding Societies research initiative have brought new awareness, understanding and appreciation of lost musical traditions in three areas. 

#  Changes in the preservation and presentation of music in museums and libraries 

 King’s research <ins>g</ins>enerated new knowledge about lost music through research on notated, literary and visual manuscripts and objects housed in national and international museums and libraries. Researchers engaged these cultural partners in their research process, serving also as consultants and contributors to public programmes, leading to changes in policies of preservation and presentation of music in these institutions. 

 King’s research and consultancies **informed curatorial decisions for exhibitions and gallery displays, to include new provision for music\-related objects and performance**. In the 2015 Musical Wonders of India digital exhibition of musical instruments hosted by the Victoria and Albert Museum, King’s research into *South Asian music* \[3, 4\] determined the selections of instruments exhibited, including many rarely seen on public display. According to the Curator of South Asian Art, the exhibition made instruments “much more accessible to the public and \[was able\] to bridge the gap between the musical instrument as a visually beautiful yet static object and as a playable sonic entity”, adding that King’s research “has been of great and ongoing value to the Museum in our understanding of the musical instruments and musicological manuscripts in our collection, which feeds through to the way we display and interpret those objects for our visitors” \[A\]. Its success resulted in changes to the permanent display in 2017: as part of the rehanging of the South Asian gallery, the instrument display was redesigned to include items previously kept in storage \[A\]. 

 King’s research and consultancy on *medieval European song* likewise informed musical objects and gallery soundscapes used in the 2016 exhibition Feast for the Senses at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, and Ringling Museum, Sarasota, and were integral to exhibition planning at the British Museum from 2016 \[1, 2\] \[B\]. For British Museum Curator of the Late Medieval European Collection, the research illuminating links between visual arts and music \[2\] “demonstrate\[s\] that thinking of these two strands of medieval culture as separate … does a disservice to them both”, a point that inspired the curator to “incorporate a new approach to thinking about art and music in the Middle Ages at the British Museum”. For example, it informed planning for the 2021 Thomas Becket exhibition by “shaping my approach to music in the exhibition … encompassing objects on display \[and\] actual music we aim to play in the space” \[B pp.41–45\]. 

 King’s research also led to **changes in policy around preservation, performance and digital or visitor access to little\-known musical sources and objects**. In October 2013, the University of Manchester’s John Rylands Library put online a little\-known Persian manuscript of music treatises for the first time, as a consequence of King’s research for the SHAMSA project \[4\], which brought the significance of the manuscript to the library’s attention \[C\]. For the Manuscript Curator and Archivist at The John Rylands Library, the research also revealed “the wider untapped potential of the Library’s Persian manuscripts collection”, in line with the library’s wider mission to “promote the use and enjoyment of the collections by diverse audiences”. This revelation contributed to a two\-year appointment of a cataloguer dedicated to the digitisation of manuscripts in the collection \[C\]. 

 Two national collections incorporated King’s research into their educational programmes. At the British Museum, King’s research demonstrating the relationship of objects and music in *medieval European culture* led to a series of three lecture\-recitals, Things that Sing, in the Sutton Hoo gallery in 2017–19. These collectively drew over 1,500 visitors, benefiting the museum in achieving their goal of widening access to the collection and deepening audience understanding of the collections, as attested in audience feedback \[B pp.3–40\]. In 2018, the British Library hosted six public lectures on *South Asian music* culture, Histories of the Ephemeral, drawing on King’s research into little\-known manuscripts housed in the collection \(included in the SHAMSA database, \[4\]\), with audiences totalling 2,000 people. Between 2014 and 2019, the library also commissioned and hosted five guest blogs presenting King’s research on their Persian manuscript collection, collectively receiving 9,298 hits to date and 5,140 shares on a range of social media channels \[D pp.4–15\]. For the Senior Curator of the Persian Collection, the live and mediated formats made areas of the manuscript collection that were relatively little known available for a wider public: it “brought together several different types of audiences with varied research interest, thus making a significant contribution to the Library’s public profile”, she explained. It succeeded, too, “in laying the foundations for possible future projects” \[D pp.16–17\]. 

#  Increasing awareness and appreciation of lost music through performance and programming 

 King’s research led to new possibilities for performance of lost and endangered music, to the benefit of international audiences, and of organisations dedicated to widening public awareness of under\-represented cultures through music programming. 

 King’s research devoted to the discovery and performance methodologies of *classical Arabic music* \[5, 6\], notably of little\-known Egyptian Nahda era music, underpinned a collaboration with the ensemble Oxford Maqam **to promote awareness and appreciation of lost traditions through performance** \[E\]. The group’s co\-founder explains that, as well as identifying and interpreting sources of lost music, “the contribution … lies in the ability to hear, analyse and notate the music in western notation, which nobody else in the ensemble can do” \[E p.15\]. Between 2013 and 2019, Oxford Maqam performed over 27 live concerts, radio broadcasts, workshops and lecture\-recitals across Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Kuwait and the UK; and further reached audiences through their 2018 *Wax Cylinder* CD, YouTube presence and website, with the 63 YouTube videos receiving over 61,000 hits in the research period \[E pp.4–14\]. Bringing lost traditions alive benefited diverse audiences in different ways. For some, performances were a gateway to a new musical world, with listener surveys indicating intention to “find out more about classical Arabic music” as a result \[E\]. For others, they were a powerful connection to a lost musical heritage and to “home”. Vice President of the Egyptian Cultural Association in Melbourne, host to Oxford Maqam in 2018, reported the “enormous and unbelievable” reaction of listeners, many migrants to Australia from Egypt \[F\]. One said, “I couldn’t wait till the morning to share \[the\] music for all Middle Eastern migrants who love hearing tunes that bring back home,” while another explained, “I felt transported back in time to a very special moment in the history of classical Egyptian music” \[F\]. Many saw it not just as “reminiscent \[of\] their days in Egypt”, but also as an opportunity “to let the younger ones learn about it” \[F\]. 

 Research also **changed approaches to programming music**, notably within organisations concerned to widen awareness of under\-represented areas of cultural history. Since 2015, King’s research has informed programming for BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4 and World Service Arabic \[G\]. For the producer of the May 2020 BBC Radio 4 programme, ‘Knight Fights Giant Snail’, devoted to little\-known medieval illuminated prayerbooks, King’s research into *medieval European song* \[1, 2\], specifically as related to visual culture, helped her unlock the sound\-world of the manuscripts and informed the musical selections played \[G\]. Music made the material come alive: “simply seeing an image can feel remote but as soon as you realise there is a soundscape behind it brings the world to life and makes history feel more relatable and universal”, in turn making rare material accessible to a wider audience \[G\]. King’s research \[3\] also informed musical selections from British colonial India included in the BBC Radio 3 programme ‘Forgotten Masters’, relating to the 2019 exhibition of Company Era paintings at the Wallace Collection \[G\]. In January 2015, to mark the 77th anniversary of the BBC World Service Arabic, the programme’s Director turned to Oxford Maqam’s collaboration with King’s research \[5, 6\] to develop a programme of lost *classical Arabic music*. For the Director, the group’s contribution was “perfectly suited” to the anniversary mission to explore the Arabic radio music archive, since “they are well known performers of a historical Arabic musical genre not commonly heard, particularly in live performance” \[G\]. King’s research has also shaped programming decisions at organisations promoting awareness of Arab culture. In 2018–19, Oxford Maqam performed in Kuwait at the invitation of the Sheikh Jaber Al\-Ahmed Cultural Centre, a venue and music conservatory promoting Kuwait’s cultural heritage, the most significant of its kind in the Gulf. The centre’s Music Director explained that the group showed him “that there was a strong taste for Egyptian classical culture in Kuwait”, shaping future programming decisions – “these initiatives will certainly continue” \[H\]. 

#  A change in performance practice and the creation of new opportunities for performers 

 King’s research has expanded the musical horizons of performers by enriching and extending their historical knowledge of lost or endangered musical traditions, and the practice of their performance, leading to new opportunities. 

 Research led **performers to expand their practice, profile and performance opportunities.** One artist \(harpsichordist\) first encountered King’s research into restoring and interpreting lost sources of *South Asian music* during her 2011–12 residency in the Foyle Special Collections Library at King’s. This and subsequent collaborations informed her work on an 18th\-century transcription of Hindustani airs for harpsichord in William Hamilton Bird’s *Oriental Miscellany*, leading to the 2015 CD, *Oriental Airs*. She explains how King’s research “was vital to understanding the songs … \[leading to\] insights which were an inspiration when performing the works, and greatly affecting my interpretation on the harpsichord” \[I\]. The CD raised her international profile, reaching number 14 in the Indian Classical iTune Charts in 2015, and winning the 2015 Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik for her *“fearless advocacy when it comes to unconventional discoveries”* \[I pp.3–5\]. Two singers similarly benefited from King’s research methodology for musical restoration \[1, 2, 5, 6\]. One singer, a classically trained Egyptian opera singer, encountered King’s approach through workshops with Oxford Maqam, hosted as part of Dr James Whitbourn’s Music Egypt Project \(2019–2022\). For this artist, exposure to the group’s distinctive instrumentation and knowledge of *classical Arabic music* taught her to adapt her vocal practice in ways that are “far from opera and classical music structure”. The value of the performance methodology, she explained, was not only to open up new ways to sing, but also the opportunity “to bring new cultural awareness through music by incorporating traditional Egyptian music with Opera” \[I pp.6–7\]. For another singer and director, exposure to King’s research into *medieval European song* \[1, 2\] resulted in expansion of his performance practice. Between 2015 and 2019, collaboration with King’s researchers offered ways “to break open the sources and try to build meaningful and beautiful music from the rubble”, an approach he subsequently applied to training singers as director of his groups Ensemble Trouvère and Scherzo Ensemble. The methodology has “given me the skills to research any historical repertory and confidently assemble a programme which is able to illuminate new features of that repertory whilst also being interesting and entertaining for the audience” \[I pp.8–11\]. Use of the King’s approach to presenting rare medieval traditions has also led to performance opportunities at the British Museum and Mercers’ Hall, London, including as part of the 2020/21 events marking the 900th anniversary of St Thomas Becket \[B\]. 

 King’s research also **changed approaches to music pedagogy**. Exposure to King’s methods \[6\] through Oxford Maqam led the Sheikh Jaber Al\-Ahmed Cultural Centre to introduce classes in *classical Arabic music* performed in an authentic idiom at the Centre’s conservatory: the Director explains that “we have made decisions about this curriculum in light of them”, adding that their approach to learning, performing and improvising “is unique in the Arab world” \[H\]. As a full\-time school dedicated to “harnessing the musical talents of the children of Kuwait”, new generations of students will now ensure lost aspects of Arab musical culture remain alive for future generations.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) data and modelling of ice\-sheet and glacier melting from the world’s polar and high\-mountain regions have fundamentally reduced uncertainties in estimates of future global sea\-level rise, informing decisions by international policymakers. 

 UoE researchers have improved the spatial and temporal resolution for satellite monitoring of changing ice sheets and glaciers through developing algorithms underpinning EUR300,000,000 worth of satellite mission development by the European Space Agency. They have also acquired field geophysical data and made theoretical developments in ice\-sheet numerical modelling that have informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) reports, which underpin scientific advice to international and national government policies on climate change mitigation and adaptation. 

  
","
 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The team of ice\-sheet and glacier scientists at the University of Edinburgh have acquired important new satellite and field data and developed novel numerical modelling techniques to monitor change around the world’s ice\-covered regions. These include the ice\-covered continents of Antarctica \(57 times the area of the UK\) and Greenland \(9 times the area of the UK\), and major ice\-covered mountain belts such as the Himalayas and Andes. 

 Satellite observations gathered over glaciers worldwide have been critical to substantially improving estimates of the rates of ice loss and to quantifying their contribution to sea\-level rise. The vast majority of ice loss is concentrated around the margins of Antarctica and Greenland, and high\-mountain regions such as the Himalayas, Iceland and South America. Gathering observations that are global and of sufficient spatial and temporal resolution is key to generating robust assessments of glaciers’ health. To this end, UoE researchers have developed new methodologies to process radar altimetry data from the CryoSat satellite, exploiting the full signal waveform to generate swath of elevation as opposed to a single elevation measurement as was previously extracted **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. These have led to an order of magnitude increase in the resolution at which ice loss can be routinely and globally mapped from space. This methodology has been applied to reassess climate impact on ice volumes and sea\-level rise contribution, showing that Greenland today is losing ice seven times faster than two decades ago, and pinpointing where the ocean is eroding ice under rapidly melting Antarctic ice shelves. Data products from this have been made available publicly to the community, and support a candidate satellite mission concept for the European Commission Copernicus satellite programme Sentinel **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

 Field data acquired from the deep interior of Antarctica have been critical to constraining British Antarctic Survey models of future ice retreat from Antarctica and its consequent contributions to global sea\-level rise. Numerical models that are used to predict future ice retreat and contributions to rising sea levels require knowledge of the geometry and physical properties of the beds of glaciated catchments that drain to the ocean. To this end, over the November 2013 – February 2014 austral field season, UoE researchers acquired and analysed ice\-penetrating radar datasets over Pine Island Glacier \(PIG\), West Antarctica’s most rapidly thinning region, as part of NERC’s iSTAR \(Ice Sheet Stability Research\) Programme. Maps of the ice bed and properties produced over the subsequent years **\[3.4\]** have fundamentally informed numerical modelling of PIG’s future **\[5.3\]**. 

 Numerical modelling strategies developed by UoE scientists have informed us about the impact of oceans on the flow and retreat of ice around West Antarctica and Greenland, and have additionally demonstrated the important role that climate variability plays in the ice\-ocean system **\[3.3, 3.5, 3.6\]**. These findings **\[3.5\]** have been cited by the recent IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate and the numerical tools developed for the studies have proven key components of wider community efforts to project West Antarctica’s future **\[3.6; 5.3\].**

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Changes taking place in the Arctic, Antarctic and other glaciated regions are drivers for disruptive global changes, especially sea\-level rise, with major ramifications for people living both in polar regions and worldwide. Research conducted by the group has provided key input to climate change decision\-making by international policymakers, in particular through key contributions on sea\-level rise to the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\). These reports are the formal scientific input to the decision\-making processes of international climate change negotiations and agreements. We evidence our research cited in the 2019 IPCC *Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate* in **\[5.1\]** while our data and modelling contributions to the IPCC Sixth Assessment \(due 2021\) are evidenced below in this section \(“Informing policy…”\) 

##  Improving technology to provide accurate assessment of climate change impacts on ice sheets and glaciers and their contribution to sea\-level change 

 The EU *Copernicus* Earth Observation programme was established to fulfil the growing need amongst European policymakers to access accurate and timely information services to better manage the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. The new cryospheric processing techniques developed at Edinburgh since 2013 **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]** have been crucial to developing a new European Space Agency \(ESA\) EUR300,000,000 satellite mission concept for polar ice and snow topography monitoring within the *Copernicus* programme. The head of Research and Development at ESA’s Climate Department highlights: “ *This objective is possible thanks to the techniques that you have robustly demonstrated and applied during the last 7 years. The project is now entering into its second implementation phase. I am pleased to recognise the direct benefit of your involvement with industry via the two industrial consortiums led by Airbus Defense and Space and by OHB Sweden \(with a budget of EUR300,000,000\)*. *Doing so, you are ensuring implementation of the latest techniques and that the consortium translate user requirements in to sensor and spacecraft design specifications. In this way, your research will lead to the broadest possible scientific legacy.”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 The team’s new algorithms have also supported the continuing development and applications of the EUR170,000,000 ESA Cryosat satellite mission which monitors ice sheets and sea\-ice volume. The CryoSat Mission Manager for ESA states that the team’s algorithms have resulted in  “an *increase the quantity of observation \[of ice change\] by two orders of magnitude … which has led to more accurate volume estimates and applications beyond the sole Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets that CryoSat was designed to monitor, e.g. over the ice fields of Patagonia”. The new work has also been used to argue for continuing funding \[EUR10,000,000 per annum\] of the mission operational exploitation* **\[5.3\]**. Additionally in 2019, and on the research by the Edinburgh team, ESA launched the EUR400,000 CryoTEMPO programme to provide “ *easy to use and hassle free”* products on ice\-sheet and glacier changes observed by satellites for non\-specialist users **\[5.3\]**. 

 The team’s activities in satellite remote sensing also led, in 2019, to the formation of a startup company *Earthwave*, which now employs seven staff and has GBP347,000 annual turnover from clients in the UK and Europe **\[5.5\]**. 

##  Informing policy through more accurate estimates of the Antarctic contribution to sea\-level rise. 

 Much UK national policy on mitigating sea\-level rise is informed by the IPCC; in turn, the IPCC is informed by major national programmes such as the GBP2,4000,000 British Antarctic Survey \(BAS\) numerical\-modelling programme that is dedicated towards providing greatly improved predictions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet’s fate and its contribution to global sea\-level rise over the next 200 years. Over the reporting period the BAS programme has been underpinned by geophysical measurements of the shape and condition of Antarctica’s ice\-sheet bed acquired and processed into subglacial topographic maps by the UoE\-led team **\[3.4\]**, and numerical\-modelling equations and strategies that were developed at Edinburgh **\[3.6\]** which have contributed to greatly\-reduced uncertainties in BAS’ programme for numerically modelling the ice\-sheet’s future. To quote BAS’ Director of Science *‘Our British Antarctic Survey … contributions to IPCC have been underpinned by modelling strategies and equations formulated by Dan and his team at Edinburgh since late 2013’* and *‘Datasets Rob and his team produced… have been crucial in providing underpinning numerical modelling of West Antarctica’s future which has been undertaken to support the upcoming sea\-level rise assessments for the IPCC 6<sup>th</sup> assessment reports, used as the primary evidence bases for global policymakers in planning sea\-level defences’* **\[5.4\]** *.* For example, 18 of the group’s research papers since 2013 were cited in the 2019 IPCC Special Report *Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate* **\[5.1\]** in which the Amundsen Sea Sector of West Antarctica and Greenland \(a focus of our data gathering and modelling efforts\) were highlighted in the Summary for Policymakers as key sources of future sea\-level rise.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by Oxford Brookes’ Performance Augmentation Lab \(PAL\) led to the creation of an international standard by the world’s most prestigious professional body in engineering, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\). This standard defines how industry across the globe should design and develop products that use virtual and augmented reality technology to train and up\-skill workers. The research undertaken by Dr Fridolin Wild at PAL resulted in novel augmented reality and wearable technology to up\-skill workers in industry and service related sectors. Through the development of Virtual Reality \(VR\), Augmented Reality \(AR\) and Wearable Technology \(WT\) an innovative system has been developed that enables training software to be produced at low cost and at scale. This allows effective training – enabling new skills, knowledge, and abilities, addressing skills gaps and reducing costs for employers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Human Performance Augmentation refers to the process of equipping users with wearable and pervasive computing technology that allows them to apply abstract knowledge into practical application \(e.g. training in high\-risk situations\) and, ultimately, act at a level of mastery otherwise not achievable **\[3.1\]**. 

 The Performance Augmentation Lab at Oxford Brookes University created a ground\-breaking, in situ, authoring system that helps overcome the content production barrier for 3D augmented reality training content. We created a novel software development framework for experience capture and sharing **\[3.2\]**. Expert users wear the glasses and the e\-textile to move freely around in their workplace without motion sickness effects **\[3.3\]**, to record a sequence of guiding steps, using so\-called ‘task stations’ \(points of interest in the environment\) to anchor multimodal content they select or produce. The content can be stored to the cloud and used in disparate locations, such as in space. Under different conditions, the software adapts to the local work environment automatically, before a trainee can replay the guidance sequence that directs the task **\[3.4\]**. 

 Our research, developed across four major grants, provides a new approach. Building on earlier work \(EUR8,300,000 H2020\-funded TELLME project, 2012–2015\), Wild coordinated, as scientific director, the EUR2,753,000 H2020 funded WEKIT project \(2015–2019\), which advanced from a proof of concept for Augmented Reality specification \(Technology Readiness Level 3\), to an industrial strength platform \(TRL 7\) that supports the wearer of AR devices. The project validated the developed methodology and technology in three pilot test\-beds in aviation, space engineering, and medicine, where the application is especially relevant **\[3.2\]**. 

 The EUR7,741,697 H2020 funded TCBL project \(2015–2019\), running in parallel, complemented this with further technology development and test cases in the textile and clothing industry. Within the EUR4,000,000 H2020 funded ARETE project \(2019–2022\) we enhanced the technology into a more collaborative, cross\-device/cross\-platform by adding an AR abstraction layer over the vendor\-specific AR toolkits, complementing it with groupware technology to allow for the orchestration of classroom\-sized audiences, which has not previously been achieved. 

 A key invention in this context, for experience capture, includes the ‘ghost track’ recording and replay, which uses simplified motion sensing with sensor fusion from e\-textile integrated sensors and smart glasses for recording. This allows us to calculate and deliver a 3D holographic character presence in replay, re\-enacting expert movement in the real environment while replaying a think\-aloud audio protocol, with the expert now absent. This is illustrated in the figure below. 



 Example of the AR Ghost Track on Mars Surface Simulator capturing \(left\) the instructor workflow and \(right\) AR view of the trainee with ghost instructor visible **\[3.3, 3.5\]** 

 Our research on Performance Augmentation is world leading. Fridolin Wild was appointed the chair of the IEEE standard development. This is an extension of the specification for Augmented Reality Learning Experience Models \(ARLEM, IEEE standard association working group p1589, **\[3.6\]**. The representation standard provides a conceptual model guiding implementation by software manufacturers, while establishing interoperability for an open market of Augmented Reality learning content. Further, we have devised architectural blue prints, frameworks, and extracted design patterns for Performance Augmentation as exemplified by the software developed:

 **4. Details of the impact** 

####  Impact on Multipliers: software vendors, public sector, other leaders in the field 

 The IEEE is the key professional body for engineering, computing and technology around the world, with over 419,000 members in 160 countries. In January 2020, the Standards Board of the IEEE Standard Association \(which contains representatives of leading technological nations, international standards institutes and accreditation bodies of all major nations\), approved P1589/Draft3, an Augmented Reality Learning Experience Model. 

 This P1589 standard **\[5.1\]** is currently the only standard for delivery of interactive AR content across the key standardisation bodies, IEEE, MPEG, ISO, ETSI, CEN/CENELEC. The IEEE subcommittee was chaired by Fridolin Wild and the framework is based on his work. It enables vendors and other stakeholders \(such as in public procurement\) to quickly adopt an approved conceptual model and component architecture for AR training, and provide AR content at scale. This lowers entry barriers to authoring of learning and training experiences, and facilitates the creation of online repositories and market places. It allows manufacturers and developers to ensure that the product meets the required criteria for valid and effective use for the wearer and the task designer. 

 Within the European Space Agency, a shared vision \(“New Space”, “Space 4.0”\) and according digital agenda is gradually emerging. Performance Augmentation technologies have an important role in this, for example in product assurance and safety, in astronaut training and autonomous support. An empirical study, conducted by Wild’s team among personnel from ESA, other space agencies and industry \(in total 56 organisations\) was carried out to develop the technology roadmap for AR in space product assurance and safety. It showed most appreciation for the deployment of performance augmentation technologies for the use cases of operator training and process management, quality inspection and testing, non\-conformance documentation, configuration management, and linking in of remote experts **\[3.6\]**. The studies conducted **\[S1, 3.6\]** provide strong evidence that operator training and process management can be supported successfully with AR. The ESA expert workshop held by Wild’s team on AR/VR for European space programme rated standardisation \(with 64%\) as the most important area for ESA to invest into in order to leverage the use of AR/VR in space missions **\[5.7\]**. 

####  Impact on Industry: creating real products 

 The research outputs are deployed in the aviation, textiles, space, medical and healthcare sectors, and the creative industries. Several companies are building economic success from technologies enabled by the research conducted: for example, ALTEC S.p.a. \(Aerospace Logistics Technology Engineering Company\), EBIT, PaceLab, WordsWorthLearning, Microsoft and WEKIT ECS **\[5.3, 5.6\]**. 

 ALTEC continues to exploit the WEKIT applications, to augment the training process for astronauts and to support future space exploration, including on Mars. ALTEC Space have proposed to the major space agencies further testing with crew members and scientists in so\-called ‘analogue’ environments like Pangaea or Concordia **\[5.5\]**. 

 The WEKIT software provided the foundation for the MobiPV procedure viewer and the MobiPV4Hololens app of the European Space Agency \(developed by VTT, based on existing code\). 

 Through its IT company EBIT, Esaote offers healthcare IT systems for workflow management of radiology and cardiology diagnostic processes. EBIT says about the WEKIT software solution: “AR authoring and training has other advantages: it takes less time than conventional training; could be easily repeated; provides more detailed information in complex cases; and may provide real time comparison results without the presence of the expert” **\[5.5\]**. Both EBIT and Esaote are proceeding to experiment further with the devices to support equipment and software for augmenting physicians’ diagnostic procedures with AR **\[5.4\]**. 

 A Milan\-based, 600 employee company \(with subsidiaries in Italy, Germany, UK, France, Switzerland, USA\), TXT has developed the Pacelab WEAVR system, which is now one of the major products in aerospace, used for on\-the\-job training of pilots, cabin crew, maintenance technicians, and field technicians \(with additional applications in marketing\) \( [https://www.txtgroup.com/markets/solutions/pacelab\-weavr/](https://www.txtgroup.com/markets/solutions/pacelab-weavr/)\). It encompasses virtual training \( [https://www.txtgroup.com/markets/solutions/virtual\-training/](https://www.txtgroup.com/markets/solutions/virtual-training/)\) and operation support use cases \( [https://www.txtgroup.com/markets/solutions/armr\-field\-support/](https://www.txtgroup.com/markets/solutions/armr-field-support/)\). TXT created a start\-up to experiment on AR for new markets outside of aerospace \( [https://sense\-immaterialreality.com/](https://sense-immaterialreality.com/)\). **\[5.2\]** The experience with our EC funded projects and the IEEE standard in development was one of the key stepping\-stones for that. 

 A spin out company is linking research with industry \(WEKIT ECS Ltd\). WEKIT ECS has developed an AR training system implementing the standard. 

####  Impact on People and Economic Benefits 

 WEKIT has shown the benefits of using experience captured through automated extraction from users’ real\-world demonstration and live guidance solution. The impact assessment from the evaluations across the user validated projects found **\[5.4, 5.5\]**, that: 

-  Live guidance enables upskilling on the job: We were able to show that the autonomous AR and wearable technology performance augmentation solution performs equally as well as traditional training methods. **\[5.4, 5.5\]** 

-  The research outputs help to drastically reduce training time \(for Mars the predicted amount of training needed rises to 6 years for a 2\-3 year mission, which is no longer feasible\). Furthermore, it provides autonomy where other support is not available \(e.g. in deep space missions, where communication with ground control takes 8\-24 min depending on distance from Earth to Mars\) **\[3.4\]**. 

-  Experts and trainees assess a high level of acceptance, with a positive attitude towards the technology, a high level of hedonic motivation to use, and low effort expectancy when working with the technology. The system is considered stimulating, and easy to use. **\[3.5\]** 

 WEKIT ECS is a company of 15, currently engaging in valuation and approaching investors. The training methodology and systems of the WEKIT project can reduce costs by up to 85%, serving a market of 1,500,000 companies in the EU who paying for training, spending EUR13,800,000 in total every hour **\[5.7\]**. Supported by the IEEE standard, WEKIT ECS is in an excellent position to ensure growth and wider impact, leading future developments in AR and VR.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In 2015, the United Nations \(UN\) unanimously agreed to eliminate Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting \(FGM/C\) by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, progress towards ending these harmful practices has been sporadic. Since 2016, Northumbria University has been investigating spatial and temporal trends in FGM/C using demographic and health datasets. This analysis enabled the UN to estimate that 68,000,000 girls worldwide are at risk of FGM/C by 2030. The research more accurately identified FGM/C hotspots which transformed the UN’s FGM/C programmes through better strategic allocation of over USD70,000,000 of UNFPA\-UNICEF funding \(2018\-2020\) across 17 countries. Northumbria’s research also identified new avenues of legal recourse, which led to The World Bank adopting a new legal and capacity\-building framework designed to hold states to account. These international changes have resulted in country\-level improvements in anti\-FGM/C efforts, including new initiatives in Kenya, Egypt, and the UK, as well as new legislation in Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea. Northumbria’s research also informed one of the key international policy documents focused on the elimination of FGM/C, the UN’s Human Rights Council’s resolution A/HRC/RES/38/6. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting \(FGM/C\) is an internationally\-recognised human rights violation. Its elimination is one of the targets under the United Nations \(UN\) Sustainable Development Goals \(SDG 5.3\). Northumbria University research, led by Professor Ngianga\-Bakwin Kandala, investigated spatial and temporal FGM/C trends to build evidence in support of international interventions in high\-prevalence countries. 

 In 2016, Northumbria University was commissioned by the Population Council to use innovative approaches to analysing successive household data in order to reveal FGM/C trends, geographic patterns, and risk factors among girls aged 14 and younger in Kenya. The research was conducted using a statistical modelling technique called survival analysis, which is utilised to estimate the expected duration of time until an event \(typically the occurrence of death or disease\). Professor Kandala realised that the age of girls’ genital cutting could be treated as an event for survival analysis. The innovative decision to use this form of analysis allowed for the interpretation of complex data sets with a dynamic interaction of factors \[ **R1**\]. This was enabled by advanced Bayesian geo\-additive modelling techniques. The study revealed the prevalent spatial and temporal trends across different geographical scales \(national, regional, county, district\), showing that whereas the overall number of FGM/C cases on a national scale had decreased between 1998 and 2014, some regions continued to exhibit large volumes of cases \[ **R1**\]. These high\-risk regions were identified as FGM/C hotspots. Funding of GBP362,000 for this work was awarded to Kandala by UK Aid and the UK Government through the Department for International Development\-funded project, *'Evidence to End FGM/C: Research to Help Girls and Women Thrive'*, coordinated by the Population Council \(grant number SR1801\). 

 The success of these novel techniques in revealing new insights into the prevalence and patterns of FGM/C was recognised by the United Nations Population Fund \(UNFPA\) and the United Nations Children’s Fund \(UNICEF\). Northumbria University developed the research to build a detailed, granular understanding of FGM/C practices for the ‘ *UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme to Eliminate Female Genital Mutilation: Accelerating Change*’ designed to estimate the number of girls at risk worldwide. Employing data sets from 17 countries spread across Africa and the Middle East, this research investigated the geographical variations of FGM/C practices over sustained periods of time \(1990\-2017\) in low\- and middle\-income countries \[ **R2**\]. Research revealed significant downward trends in FGM/C on the regional level in East Africa. By contrast, the decline in prevalence has been much slower in North Africa and West Africa. 

 Further work revisited FGM/C in Kenya \[ **R3**\], but also focused on new locations, such as Senegal \[ **R4**\] and Nigeria \[ **R5**\]. The objective of this research was to identify and map FGM/C hotspots in order to give an accurate picture of the dynamics of FGM/C in these countries. These studies recommended re\-allocating resources to FGM/C hotspots and using campaigns targeted at specific populations. Collectively, these studies demonstrated the importance of creating evidence\-based policies that account for the global trends in FGM/C as well as in\-depth understanding of the socio\-cultural differences between communities. 

 Northumbria’s research assessed individual\- and community\-level characteristics, as well as the geographical location of a girl and her mother. Other characteristics included socio\-demographic variables such as age of a girl and her mother, mother’s education, ethnicity, and household wealth. Researchers also developed a variable called the ethnic fractionalization index \(EFI\), which measured the level of ethnic mixing of a given community. Including the EFI variable in the models was justified by the hypothesis that different social norms may be inﬂuenced by different reference groups, with tolerance towards change higher among certain groups. In regions where there is little ethnic diversity, and where the prevalence of FGM/C is near\-universal, there may be little opportunity to shift to a reference group that does not uphold the practices. For example, the prevalence of FGM/C among the Somali ethnic group is high, irrespective of whether the group lives in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, or Tanzania \[ **R3**\]. 

 Northumbria researchers also conducted the first systematic interdisciplinary research study into the legal aspects of FGM/C on the global scale \[ **R6**\]. This research demonstrated a significant gap between existing regulations and enforcement practices on the ground. The authors argued that making states liable for the actions of FGM/C perpetrators and imposing penalties and compensation could encourage states to assume a more robust and proactive role in enforcing the law and allowing more victims to obtain redress \[ **R6**\]. The research demonstrated how international human rights law may be used effectively to make a difference to the lives of FGM/C survivors and enable their representatives to make arguable cases for civil remedies before the appropriate jurisdictions. The research was published as a book \[ **R6**\] and was supported by the World Bank’s ‘ *Empowering Women by Balancing the Law’* initiative.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 By utilising novel techniques to more accurately identify the number and characteristics of girls at risk of FGM/C, Northumbria University’s research has transformed international efforts to end the FGM/C practices. Through the UNFPA\-UNICEF programme and revised funding allocation strategy, Northumbria’s research impacted national roadmaps to end FGM/C in 17 African countries. The research led the World Bank to change its strategy on holding states to account and supporting legislators. This resulted in new legislation in three countries and improved efforts by other states. The research also informed a UN resolution on FGM/C. 

###  4.1 Transforming international efforts to end FGM/C through UNFPA 

 Prior to Northumbria’s research utilising survival analysis to identify the geo\-spatial distribution of FGM/C, the figures on the number of girls at risk used by UNFPA were outdated and incomplete \[ **E1**, p1\]. The new data generated by Kandala and his team on the distribution of FGM/C according to different variables \(age groups, ethnicity, religion\) and across geographical scales \(national, regional, county, district\) was adopted by the UNFPA\-UNICEF programme \[ **E1**, p1; **E2**\]. The research enabled UNFPA to account for the changes in population growth and allowed the agency to revise their data on girls and women at risk of FGM/C. Accurate calculation of the number of girls at risk is crucial for evidence\-based anti\-FGM/C efforts \[ **E1**, p1\]. The new method was applied across 17 high\-prevalence countries. Dr Nafissatou Diop, Chief of the Gender and Human Rights Branch at the UNFPA, confirmed: 

 ‘*Based on the survival analysis, Professor Kandala and his research team from Northumbria University and UNFPA demographers developed a methodology for analysing the annual number of girls at risk of FGM… This work provided the UNFPA with detailed, accurate and up\-to\-date representation of FGM prevalence… \[This\] allowed us to revise the earlier used incorrect number of 3 million of girls and women at risk of FGM… As a direct result of Northumbria University’s research, UNFPA started to use the new methodology of calculating number of girls at risk of FGM \(based on survival analysis of datasets\) … Once the analysis of number of girls at risk was completed for individual countries, we were able to calculate the aggregated number of 68,000,000 girls at risk of FGM by 2030’* \[ **E1**, p1\-2\]. 

 Dr Diop added: *‘The number of 68 million girls at risk by 2030 is frightening, and due to its frightening nature UNFPA was able to bring attention to FGM in international media and through an array of high\-profile events’* \[ **E1**, p4\]. In February 2019, UNFPA launched the ‘68 Million Girls at Risk’ exhibition that was presented in New York, Geneva, and Brussels. The new data about the numbers of girls at risk was vitally important in bringing the attention of media, policy\-makers, and the public to the issue of FGM/C, raising the visibility and urgency to eliminate the practices. UNFPA’s media analysis estimated the exhibition led to an estimated 4,660,000,000 \(non\-unique\) webpage views via the international media coverage \[ **E1**, p6\]. Dr Diop stated: *‘I am happy to note that… practitioners and advocacy groups around the world abandoned the previously\-used statistics of FGM, and now use more accurate and up\-to\-date FGM prevalence numbers based on survival analysis’* \[ **E1**, p4\]. 

 Furthermore, Dr Diop confirmed that Northumbria’s research *“transformed the Phase III of the ‘UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of FGM/C: Accelerate Change’ \(2018\-2021\). Based on the new understanding of the FGM hotspots, UNFPA changed the way funding is allocated to individual countries on the programme”* \[ **E1**, p2\]. This transformation occurred in 2018 when, for the first time, UNFPA\-UNICEF funding was allocated to countries through a three\-tiered system that built on the research, to correspond to the number of girls at risk in each country \[ **E1**\]. Countries identified as having more girls at risk received more funding. In 2018, this meant the Tier 1 countries of Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and the Sudan received USD11,806,482 from a total raised of USD14,387,090 \[ **E3**, p107\]. The total funding for the project grew from USD14,400,000 in 2018 \[ **E3**, p107\] to USD25,800,000 in 2019 \[ **E3**, p190\], reaching USD30,000,000 in 2020 \[ **E1**, p2\]. Hence, over three years of Phase III, Northumbria’s research has shaped the allocation of over USD70,000,000 \(2018\-2020\). 

 In Tier 1 countries, new funding led to significantly stronger and more impactful anti\-FGM/C efforts. Dr Diop said *‘\[the new funding system is\] unquestionably changing the national efforts to eliminate this harmful traditional practice, as it allows national coordination bodies, third sector organisations, advocacy groups, legal practitioners, religious and traditional leaders to build capacity for resisting FGM’* \[ **E1**, p3\]. Two important examples are Egypt and Kenya. In Egypt, few steps were being taken to eliminate FGM/C, yet the number of girls at risk in the country was very large. The new funding directly led to a growth in the scale of ambition of anti\-FGM/C efforts and the strength of the national workplan \[ **E1**, p2\]. The new funding allowed Egypt to move away from small interventions into a full\-scale national vision in terms of education, communication, work with the ministry of health, and wider society’s perception of the issue. For Tier 1 country Kenya, the anti\-FGM/C allocation increased from USD500,000 in 2018 \[ **E3**, p109\] to USD4,500,000 in 2020 \[ **E1**, p2\]. Enhanced funding has enabled national anti\-FGM/C bodies and civil society to realise joint efforts to work towards the elimination of FGM/C and this has contributed to a presidential initiative to end FGM/C by 2022 \[ **E4**\]. The Population Council also reported that the research enabled them to work more closely with stakeholders in partner countries. For example, the research informed the Kenyan Anti\-FGM/C Board’s 2019–2023 strategic plan \[ **E5**, p19\]. 

 Northumbria’s research on the role of ethnicity in the prevalence of FGM/C also influenced where UNFPA directed interventions. Research findings were important, as they enabled coordination of policy efforts to eliminate FGM/C across borders. UNFPA worked with five countries \(Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania\) to develop cross\-border collaboration and legal and policy frameworks aimed at eliminating FGM/C \[ **E1**, p3; **E6**\]. In the UK, the same research enabled the UK’s National FGM/C Centre to identify specific communities at risk and allocate resources accordingly \[ **E7**\]. The Head of the National FGM Centre stated: ‘ *Kandala’s research has been indispensable to the success of our approach… The research has also been instrumental in identifying specific communities that practice FGM \(e.g. particular ethnic groups\)… For instance, without Kandala’s research we would not be able to put in place a better strategy for the safeguarding of children in the London Boroughs of Barking and Dagenham* \[ **E7**\]. 

###  4.2 Transforming legislative approaches through the World Bank 

 Northumbria’s research enhanced context\-specific understanding of FGM/C issues and, according to the World Bank’s Senior Legal Counsel: *‘As a result of Komba’s and Kandala’s research there has been a substantial transformation in the way in which The World Bank regards the role of the state in the face of FGM’* \[ **E8**, p2\]. In particular, the World Bank used the research to develop a new policy on creating legislation that enabled victims of FGM/C to hold states liable for failures to protect them against the practices \[ **E8**, p2\]. In February 2020, this led to new national legislation in Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea \[ **E8**, p2\]. 

 Advocacy programmes and training delivered by the World Bank in Africa have been influenced by the research, leading to the development of a new roadmap holding states to account for FGM/C practices. In Guinea Bissau and Equatorial Guinea, the research has been used to train 200 prosecutors, 140 lawyers, and 200 judges on litigation matters involved in the practices of FGM/C. This resulted in improved legal practice \[ **E8**\]. In Sierra Leone, research led to new evidence\-based recommendations for advisers and judges in magistrate and high courts. As a result, a record number of lawyers in Sierra Leone have taken action for compensation for victims of FGM/C \[ **E8**, p2\]. Thanks to these legal pressures, the World Bank is now seeing more efforts being made by the governments of Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea to enforce the law to protect victims of FGM/C and to provide justice for women and girls affected \[ **E8**\]. The World Bank’s Senior Legal Counsel stated: ‘ *research by Komba and Kandala has changed fundamentally our approach to scrutinising the actions of governments in respect of FGM. The research by Komba and Kandala has provided new insights that we have incorporated into our own approach to FGM prevention and risk reduction*’ \[ **E8**, p3\]. 

###  4.3 Informing Human Rights Council’s resolution 

 Through the estimate that 68 million girls are at risk of FGM/C by 2030 globally, which emerged from research at Northumbria, the UNFPA was able to influence the adoption of a resolution by the Human Rights Council to eliminate FGM/C \[ **E9**\]. According to Dr Diop at the UNFPA: 

 *‘\[Northumbria’s research\] findings informed the policy brief developed by the African Union \(UNFPA’s formal partners\) for the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly \[2018\]. During this session, the African Union presented the resolution A/HRC/RES/38/6 on the elimination of FGM that took into account key evidence emerging from the UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme… Through the UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme, Northumbria University’s research informed one of the key international policy documents focused on elimination of FGM… Furthermore, during the 44th Session of the Human Rights Council \[2020\], resolution A/HRC/L.20 on the elimination of FGM was adopted, which was based on the 2018 A/HRC/RES/38/6 resolution... These policy documents are used as reference to guide and assess countries progress… This shows the wide influence of our programme and Northumbria University’s transformative research’* \[ **E1**, p3\-4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 For more than 20 years, academic and curator Clare Harris has pioneered new ways of representing Tibetan culture in her publications, exhibitions, online platforms and collaborations with Tibetan researchers and artists from China, India and the global Tibetan diaspora. Her work has fostered new modes of understanding, increased well\-being among a group of refugees, and given unprecedented opportunities to Tibetans to reflect on their identity outside traditional community settings. Harris’ most recent project has specifically engaged with Tibetans in the UK to co\-curate exhibitions, workshops and public events that challenge long\-established and resilient stereotypes about Tibet. This project has shaped understanding amongst museum audiences about Tibetan identity and enabled Tibetans themselves to change the narrative about Tibet at a critical juncture in its history. Her work has also directly influenced curatorial practice concerning Tibet at major museums \(British Museum and World Museum, Liverpool\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 March 2019 marked 60 years since the 14th Dalai Lama escaped from Tibet and the Tibetan diaspora was initiated. Today, approximately 250,000 Tibetans are living as refugees around the world. After 1959, the homeland they vacated was absorbed into the People’s Republic of China and 6,000,000 Tibetans are now citizens of that nation. The creation of these two ‘Tibets’ \- in exile and in China \- has led to widely divergent experiences for Tibetans, as well as distinct differences in how non\-Tibetans perceive and represent them. 

 For more than two decades, Clare Harris has been conducting anthropological research into the production of knowledge about Tibet by outsiders and the ways it has been communicated in museums and visual/material culture from the nineteenth century to the present day. Her investigations in museums and archives have shown how powerful representational tropes about Tibet and Tibetans have been established by foreign photographers, collectors of objects, and curators, while her fieldwork in Tibetan communities worldwide has established how the impact of outsiders’ representations continues to impinge on the lives of contemporary Tibetans. These themes are explored at length in ‘The Museum on the Roof of the World’ \(2012\) \( **R1**\) and ‘Photography and Tibet’ \(2016\) \( **R2**\), two monographs in which Harris critiqued the reductive stereotypes that have fixed and framed Tibet in visual, material and museological contexts. These works show that whether as a traditionalist, spiritual ‘Shangri\-La’ \(as in accounts produced in the West since the 19<sup>th</sup> century\) or, as a modernised Maoist utopia \(in post\-1959 visions of the country in China\), the representation of Tibet has been constantly embroiled in politicised debates and remains a highly contested subject among academics, politicians, journalists, and Tibetans themselves. 

 Harris’ work also emphasises that Tibetans have largely been absent from the spaces in which such knowledge and representations are produced, particularly in academic circles and in museums whether in the West or China. \( **R3**, **R4**\) Most egregiously, they have lacked access to their archival and material histories embodied in the vast quantities of Tibetan objects stored in institutions around the world and the capacity to determine how that heritage might be interpreted and represented according to their own criteria. Harris has therefore focused on asserting the agency of Tibetans wherever and whenever it can be unearthed in the historical record, as well as in contemporary cultural formats. As a curator, she has pursued an ethically\-engaged methodology that seeks to counteract the limitations of the past and facilitate new modes of expression: first, by sharing the results of her own research as widely as possible with Tibetans through exhibitions \(e.g. **R5**, a book published for an exhibition co\-produced with Tibetan artist Nyema Droma\), publications and digital projects and second, by enabling Tibetans to gain access to the collections, staff and spaces of museums in the West. By actively pursuing principles of co\-curation and collaborative knowledge\-making, she has sought to enable Tibetans to create their own visions of how Tibet should be represented in the future and to redress the power imbalances of the past.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Tibetans are a highly marginalized group in the UK; the Office of Tibet estimates that the current population has been at no more than 1,000. The presence of this ‘minority among minorities’ in Britain is rarely acknowledged in public discourse and has never been explicitly celebrated in a British museum before. Nor have the two Tibets \(of China and the global Tibetan diaspora\) previously been brought together in an exhibition format. Harris’ research has led to a series of collaborative projects with Tibetan individuals and groups designed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the creation of the two ‘Tibets’ in 2019, culminating in the *Performing Tibetan Identities* \( *PTI*\) exhibition at the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, where Harris is Curator for Asian Collections. With its strong track record of collaboration with ‘source communities’ and its decolonizing agenda, the Pitt Rivers has been, and continues to be a prime site for asserting indigenous agency. This project attempted to overturn the conventional balance of curatorial/academic power and assign it to Tibetans by opening up the galleries, collections and practices of the Pitt Rivers Museum: according to a Tibetan visitor to the exhibition it was “a precedent of its own, in sync with the current needs of the Tibetan community” \[ **E1**\]. This has resulted in changes in **understanding and participation** amongst members of the Tibetan community, national\-level Tibetan organisations, and museum visitors, as well as changes in the **creative and cultural practices** of influential Tibetan individuals, and curators in national and international museums. 

 <ins> **Performing Tibetan Identities**</ins> 

 *PTI* was a practice\-based, co\-curated effort to address some of the issues of identity and representation regarding Tibet in a museum context \(as identified in **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\). It also sought to provide a space for the Tibetan community to convene and reflect on their own identity and representation. The main *PTI* exhibition featured ‘double portraits’ by Tibetan artist and photographer Nyema Droma \(who Harris had met in the process of researching **R2**\), showing Tibetans in both traditional and contemporary dress reflecting different facets of their lives.  Over 30 Tibetan individuals in China or living in exile in Europe, were photographed for the exhibition and helped to conceive its messages. The show was supplemented by a series of public engagement with research activities \(4 workshops for Tibetans and 4 public events between October 2018 and May 2019\). These events were supported by a number of Tibetan individuals and organisations in the UK including: the Office of Tibet \(London\), as well as community organisations such as the ‘Tibetan Community of the UK’ \(whose elected members represent 1,000\+ Tibetans in Britain\), and Y\-TEC, a charity that supports culture\-specific learning for young Tibetans \( **E2**\). The active participation of the individuals and organisations above ensured that the exibition and workshops reached the Tibetan community in the UK effectively, resulting in **the project directly reaching one fifth of Tibetans in the UK,** with 200 Tibetans attending events in the museum in\-person. 

 <ins> **Increasing exploration and \(self\-\)representation of Tibetan identities**</ins> 

 The exhibition project was intended primarily to benefit the UK Tibetan community by nurturing a greater sense of wellbeing and social inclusion through making connections to historic photographs and objects, creating their own narratives about them, and changing attitudes to museums. As mentioned above, the exhibition was supported by 4 facilitated workshops for more than 60 Tibetans \(3 for adults, 1 for young people\) held at the museum. The workshop events provided a reflective space for Tibetans to explore the questions raised by the exhibition and to discuss issues of Tibetan identity further. Feedback from the events specifically for the Tibetan community is captured as part of a wider exhibition report from the Pitt Rivers Museum Evaluation team \[ **E1**\]; and workshop feedback provided by Tibetan teenagers is captured in a report by the Pitt Rivers Museum Education Officer \[ **E3**\]. 

 The displays at the Pitt Rivers substantially enhanced the profile of Tibet and Tibetans, with many commenting that they were ‘proud to see my culture in this exhibition’ \[ **E1**\]. Others felt that their sense of ‘Tibetaness’ had been enhanced \[ **E1**\]. **E1** elaborates on ways in which Tibetan visitors reported personally benefitting from the exhibition: ‘This exhibition made me think of all the layers of identity that I have, being Tibetan, human, student etc’ \[ **E1**\]; ‘I used to slightly struggle with being mixed \[ethnicity\] but as I became more assured I’ve become more confident’ \[ **E1**\]. 

 The opportunity to explore their own identity further was particularly powerful for young audiences. One visitor reported after the exhibition: ‘I want to learn Tibetan from my dad and wear my chuba \[Tibetan coat\] more often and get in touch with my Tibetan family’ \[ **E1**\]. One teenage workshop participant said that as a result of the exhibition and events: ‘ **I am now more aware** of the fact that there are many Tibetans out there that have struggles with identifying as Tibetan. \[The workshop\] provided me with comfort…I feel less alone and more comfortable with my identity’ \[ **E3**\]. When asked if the workshop had made these 17 young people reflect on their identity, the 15 who gave feedback all agreed it had, with some saying ‘yes, because **I had never asked the question to myself**’ and ‘Before a week ago, **I never even knew that there was a museum that had Tibetan artefacts**’ \[ **E3**\]. The Museum’s Education Officer reported that the workshop for young people ‘made me think about the role I hold, and how I can use my position to further develop my equitable community engaged research practice and how I can continue to support people in connecting with their identities and heritages’ \[ **E3**\]. A young Tibetan man in one of the workshops for adults said: ‘…what I felt really special about all the exhibition is like, this exhibition shows profound Tibetan perspective, or Tibetan narrative on issues. It’s in the forefront… it **challenges the stereotyping** of being Tibetan’ \[ **E4**\]. 

 The adult workshop participants underscored the unusual nature of the opportunity afforded by the project. The audio transcriptions show several of the interviewees reflecting that there are generally no opportunities to think about their ‘Tibetaness’ beyond events directly organised by their own community \(‘…I think it’s only like when there are Tibetan events. That’s all there is. Cause that’s when the Tibetans gather up and there’s only Tibetans.…we don’t really get to meet up apart from the events and occasions and stuff like that’, **E4,** p15\). They also emphasise the sense of pride they felt at the representation of their culture in a major museum and the importance of interacting with young Tibetan artists and curators as role models. 

 The degree to which this opportunity was appreciated was confirmed by Tibetan community leaders from the Office of Tibet. The former representative of HH Dalai Lama said in May 2019 that the exhibition had been ‘encouraging Tibetans…and giving them the platform to show their work’ and also allowing ‘the general public to appreciate what we Tibetans are capable of doing and giving Tibetans the opportunity to tell their stories in their own words’ \[ **E5**\].  Another community leader, the Secretary of the Office of Tibet \(Dalai Lama’s representative in the UK\), said that the ‘The fluidity with which diaspora Tibetans moved on from cultural/traditional to contemporary as conveyed through Nyema’s amazing photographs, was a surprise revelation for me. We haven’t given much thought to this transition’. He went on to reflect that ‘for him, it did change his attitude to museums and collections’ and gave him ‘a fresh perspective to look at culture and cultural objects’ which has helped with his work at Tibet House \(a UK charity established with the aim of preserving Tibetan language and culture\) \[ **E6**\]. 

 As a project located at the Pitt Rivers Museum, this exhibition also **benefitted non\-Tibetan audiences**, enabling a wide range of museum visitors to encounter a place they knew little about \(Tibet\) and to **rethink their own identities** through images critiquing stereotypes about Tibetans. The exhibition was available to all visitors to the Pitt Rivers \(485,030 in 2019\) and to Tibetans and others virtually and globally via the museum’s website \(6,838 views between Oct 2018 to Sept 2020 for exhibition\-related content\). The Pitt Rivers Education team also used it as part of their secondary school art programme, which reached 10,500 pupils in 2019. Harris and team were able to evaluate the impact of the *PTI* exhibition through the collection of over 400 pieces of feedback in different forms – a survey, post\-it feedback wall and ‘vox\-pop’ interviews with visitors in the museum. Of those surveyed, 66% of visitors agreed that it had **changed their perception of Tibetans**. In empathising with Tibetan refugees, similar numbers were inspired to reflect on their own sense of identity and highlighted their mixed heritage or migration stories. The exhibition was described by visitors as having “broken all boundaries” and made people “think deeply about prejudice and stereotypes in general” \[ **E1**\]. For 62% of visitors, the exhibition also changed their experience of the Pitt Rivers by inserting contemporary perspectives from new and different voices, making “the whole museum feel less like a house full of colonial plunder” \[ **E1**\]. Another visitor noted that “for the first time, the social role of the museum is being fulfilled” \[ **E1**\]. 

 <ins> **Developing artistic and curatorial practice for Tibetan \(self\-\)representation**</ins> 

 For Nyema Droma, the creator of original artworks and co\-curator of the *PTI* exhibition, the experience of being ‘artist in residence’ at the Pitt Rivers was transformative. Usually based in China, it was her first exhibition in a major museum anywhere in the world. She writes: “As a photographer or an artist, it has helped me with building stronger connections with different artists and curators...., I have learned so many methods of how to put together an exhibition … All of these skills and experiences will definitely play a big role in future projects. …. Now I've stopped my commercial photography work, as I have found more value in curating my own work as well as creating a platform for other artists’ \[ **E7**\]. Since the project was completed in 2019, Nyema has curated three further exhibitions in the US and China. She been offered a residency at a museum in New York, and invited to curate a show at another venue there \[ **E7**\]. 

 Having grown up with a passion to learn about his Tibetan heritage as a refugee in India, **Thupten Kelsang** came to Oxford to work with Prof Harris ‘due to the specific expertise on Tibetan museum representations encapsulated by Prof. Harris’ seminal work’ \[ **E8**\]. His interest in Harris’ work means that he is now set to become the first Tibetan trained in museology \(with a PhD\) anywhere in the world. As a key collaborator on the *PTI* project, he helped to organise and  deliver multiple workshops for members of the Tibetan community in the UK at the Pitt Rivers, as well as at the British Museum \(BM\) and Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  For most, this was their first opportunity to view Tibetan collections in British museums. Most importantly, Kelsang curated a case display in the heart of the Pitt Rivers using objects loaned by his fellow refugees, becoming the first indigenous person to do so and **the first Tibetan to devise a display in a Western museum**. For Kelsang, this project brought “displaced people and displaced objects together” enabling Tibetans to “reconnect with their heritage” and for museums to “become sites of healing after trauma” \[ **E8**\]. 

 Harris’ research and practice has also proved to be a significant source of inspiration for curators from internationally\-renowed museums in the UK. The Curator for South Asia at the British Museum outlines how Harris’ work has helped to ensure the consultation of communities represented in major exhibitions: ‘The curatorial practice you \[Harris\] have developed at the Pitt Rivers in fostering ‘indigenous’ curation and voice in museums had an important impact on the development of a key section of the *Tantra: Enlightenment to Revolution* exhibition at the BM \(Sep 2020 – Jan 2021\)’. Workshops facilitated in 2020 by Thupten Kelsang, saw ‘members of the Tibetan diaspora …consulted during a workshop at the museum on the role, history, and care of Tibetan ritual objects made with human remains’ \[ **E9**\]. They also report the particular influence of **R5** on the approach to new developments at the museum: ‘\[Harris’\] publications were also very helpful in the development of a section of the new South Asia gallery dedicated to Tibetan history and visual culture \(opened November 2017\), especially *The Museum on the Roof of the World* \[ **R1**\] which I found particularly beneficial to my curatorial practice’. 

 The Lead Curator at the World Museum \(part of Liverpool Museums\) testifies that Harris’ research has been ‘instrumental in shaping my own practice’ and explains how it ‘guided my acquisition programme and the artworks chosen for the collection. **As a result, National Museums Liverpool is the only UK based museum service to have an active collecting policy in contemporary Tibetan art**’ \[ **E10**\]. They go on to say that they have shared this curatorial practice further afield, inspired by Harris’ research: ‘\[ **R5**\] has also been highly influential in my recent role as curator for the Tibet Museum in Dharamshala, India \[run by the Central Tibetan Administration\]….I developed a collecting project based on Prof. Harris’s concept of ‘Museum of Absence’… This has resulted in an innovative collecting programme that focuses its attention on what is absent. This has involved collecting objects often discarded or not consider Tibetan and reinterpreting them to fill absences in the museum’s retelling of escape and exile. As a team we have also highlight absences in the new displays, by instructing visitors where there are absences, leaving plinths empty, and explaining why important types of objects are absent in exile’ \[ **E10**\]. 

 Harris’ research – through the Performing Tibetan Identities project – has demonstrated how researchers and curators can better engage with Tibetans, as creators of artworks and co\-curators of exhibitions, to reach out to a ‘minority amongst minorities’. An unprecedented project of its kind, on an institutional level PTI has helped other major museums to begin to address the limitations and absences in their thinking and practices around Tibet. It has also highlighted the importance of collaboration with Tibetan community members, in which they are active participants in the process of rethinking the representation of Tibet. The result is a recognition by the Tibetan community in the UK of how this project enabled them to meaningfully reflect on their identity and culture and to shape how others perceive them in their own terms.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our work has developed an algorithm which identifies clinical subgroups in patients with patellofemoral pain and shown that targeted interventions using these subgroups improves patient outcomes. Our work on non\-surgical treatments for knee pain has helped over 50,000 patients per year across Southeast Asia and changed prescription guidelines in New Zealand. In addition, our work has provided evidence to support the use of Orthotic Walkers which have been shown to provide a more effective treatment for the management of ankle injuries. Our work was used as evidence which changed the Korean insurance reimbursement system’s status of Walkers in 2017, helping approximately 20,000 patients per year in South Korea.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Our work on patellofemoral pain was the first to determine the biomechanical effects on the three\-dimensional movement and control of the knee when using taping and proprioceptive bracing \[1\] and demonstrated that improvements in knee control are possible. In addition, our work was the first to identify differences in knee stability in patients with patellofemoral pain when compared with healthy individuals. This helped to establish that patients with patellofemoral pain whom demonstrate deficits in knee stability may be treated using such interventions. Our work provided a “proof of principle”, which explored the improvements in control and mapped these improvements to pain and function and showed their effectiveness during rehabilitation \[2\]. This work contributed to the consensus statements of the International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreats \(2010\-2018\) and led to the subsequent hosting of this event at University of Central Lancashire and Manchester University in 2016. 

 The Targeted Interventions for Patellofemoral Pain Studies \(TIPPs\) group, funded by Arthritis Research UK \(ARUK\), was established in 2009 and included colleagues from 11 Universities across four countries. This group, led by staff from University of Central Lancashire, explored the existence of clinical sub\-groups in people with patellofemoral pain and successfully identified three sub\-groups: a weak and tight muscle group, a weak and over\-pronated group, and a previously unidentified strong group \(figure 1\). This work resulted in an algorithm being developed at the University of Central Lancashire using hierarchical clustering techniques, which allowed the allocation of patients to their respective subgroups \[3\]. The TIPPs algorithm was used to confirm the presence of similar sub\-groups in the wider population and showed clinically important benefits when using targeted interventions for each subgroup compared to a multimodal treatment consisting of a combination of all components of the treatments within all three targeted interventions \[2\]. 



 Figure 1 \- Three clinical sub\-groups of people with patellofemoral pain 

 A collaboration between Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Central Lancashire and Edge Hill University secured further funding from ARUK \(2016\) and Versus Arthritis \(2019\) to develop a mobile app \(Appatella\). Appatella was released on Google Play in 2018 \[A\], incorporating the algorithm, allowing dissemination to clinicians and implementation into clinical practice. This enabled clinicians to sub\-group these patients within the clinical setting for the first time, which is being used by key opinion leaders to guide patients through targeted rehabilitation programmes in Southeast Asia \[B\]. 

 
Much of our work aims to provide clinicians with evidence about treatments to assist patient recovery after injury. This has included the efficacy of knee bracing in Patellofemoral Pain, Anterior Cruciate Ligament injuries and knee Osteoarthritis \[1, 2, 4, 5\]. However, another example of our work is the testing and development of Orthotic Walkers \[6\] \(Figure 2\), which are used in the management of ankle fractures and Achilles tendon ruptures and have been shown to provide a faster and more effective recovery than immobilisation casting techniques. Our work was the first paper to report the biomechanical effects on the movement and loads on the knee and hip joints when wearing these devices. This work considered the design of the footplate and angle of inclination of the shank in different Orthotic Walkers and determined that different designs showed different loads and gait patterns. This is an important factor, as the correct load is required to optimise the healing process, and we were subsequently asked to input in the design and testing of the next generation of Orthotic Walkers for DJO inc.

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The annual prevalence of patellofemoral pain \(PFP\) in the general population is estimated to be around 23%. No standardised treatment for PFP exists, therefore physiotherapy treatment varies widely and comprises of a mixed package, or multimodal approach, which is delivered on a trial\-and\-error basis and leads to poor outcomes, with 90% of people reporting pain for at least four years following diagnosis. Our work demonstrates a paradigm shift by identifying specific patient sub\-groups using six low cost, quick and simple clinical assessments requiring minimal equipment. This allows clinicians to identify subgroups and therefore provide targeted interventions for specific presentations, with the goal of improving patient outcomes in those unresponsive to treatment. 

 In order to implement the subgrouping, the app “Appatella” was developed \[A\]. This offers a direct link with our subgrouping algorithm without the need for complex calculations and incorporates instructions on how to perform the clinical assessments without the need for additional training. Appatella is a GDPR compliant, digital clinical tool available in both Android and Apple iOS formats, which consists of three main components. Firstly, a clinician interface, which allows subgrouping to guide treatment decision\-making through the algorithm. Secondly, a clinician/patient interface which delivers clinical interventions, including outcome measures and reminders. Finally, a web\-based database tool for clinicians and researchers that allows the creation and storage of clinical interventions with outcome measures. This uses a variety of media which can be deployed and implemented through the mobile app. The feedback received to date shows that clinicians recognise the subgroups and strongly support the need to develop a quick and simple system to allocate patients to these subgroups \[B, C\]. Since 2018 the beta version of Appatella has been downloaded by over 1,000 clinicians across 30 countries and is due to be released fully in late 2020. This will facilitate the assessment and subgrouping as well as the delivery of targeted treatments for this problematic condition. 

 In 2015 we presented the concept of a “ladder of intervention” for musculoskeletal knee problems at the World Confederation for Physical Therapy. This led to the development of the concept of assessing four key factors: Pain, Alignment, Strength and Stability \(PASS\). Our work has shown there are a number of interventions that can have a positive effect on all these factors. These include functional and proprioceptive knee bracing which we have demonstrated can help patients with Patellofemoral Pain, Anterior Cruciate Ligament injuries and knee Osteoarthritis \[1,2,4,5\]. The PASS concept has gained considerable clinical and commercial interest and has been incorporated into the marketing strategy for DJO inc., one of the largest providers of medical devices and services in the world \[D\]. We have had a significant impact on practitioners through over 200 invited talks to clinical groups, sports clubs, companies and academic groups in over 30 different countries across six continents since 2013, and a series of YouTube videos which have been viewed over 15,000 times \[E\]. This has had a positive effect on the prescription of knee bracing; for example, a seminar tour by Professor Richards in New Zealand in 2018 resulted in a 23% increase in knee brace sales, indicating a change in clinical practice with an increase in the prescription of knee bracing, this was directly attributed to the presentation of our research findings and was described as **“a direct and measurable positive impact on our business”** by the New Zealand sales manager for DJO Global \[F\]. This has subsequently produced a **“noticeable shift of treatment in the rehabilitation space towards the use of functional bracing to aid in the improvement of movement patterns, reduce pain and immobility secondary to fear avoidance”** which has led to changes in New Zealand’s Accident Compensation Corporation \(ACC\) policy, which now funds the prescription of lower limb bracing through physiotherapy and podiatry \[F\]. This is a significant development that emphasises the acceptance of bracing as an important part of the rehabilitation process and a way to get people back to work in less time than without bracing. Furthermore, seminars by Richards across the Asia Pacific region between 2014\-2020, which considered the prescription of bracing for knee instability, has influenced the management of over 50,000 patients across Southeast Asia and has been directly attributed to our work \[B, C, D, G\]. Additionally, in South Africa in 2019, Richards ran a similar seminar series. In a survey of approximately 300 delegates, 88% indicated they would be likely or very likely to change their clinical practice as a result of what they had learned. 

 Up until 2017, South Korea has used Plaster of Paris casting for treating ankle fractures. In 2017, our work on Orthotic Walkers was submitted as evidence along with nine other papers to the National Health Insurance system in South Korea to promote the use of Orthotic Walkers over traditional treatment methods \[D, I\]. As a result, these devices were approved for use in clinical practice which included financial reimbursement. Estimates based on sales indicate that around 20,000 patients per year, who would have been treated using Plaster of Paris casting, are now been treated using Orthotic Walkers, which have been shown to provide a faster and more effective recovery \[I\]. In addition, our work features strongly in the marketing materials from DJO Inc., which has been used as marketing evidence on the efficacy of these devices \[I\]. DJO Inc. sell millions of these devices each year globally. These marketing materials are distributed to clinicians and consumers worldwide to help them make informed treatment choices.

 Bournemouth University \(BU\) artists Vicky Isley and Paul Smith \(boredomresearch\) have collaborated with scientists to produce powerful computer\-animated artwork which have been exhibited worldwide including the UK, EU, United States, and Korea. The three interdisciplinary art\-science research projects developed between 2016\-2019 have enhanced scientific practice and improved the communication of science through art. BU research insights have enabled organisations to grow, both financially and strategically. The Biodesign Institute in Arizona used BU research insights to inform a successful USD8,500,000 bid to establish the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center. Animate projects have benefited from a greater profile and have developed practice in new areas of animation which has allowed them to extend their work internationally.

 boredomresearch is a collaboration between BU artists Vicky Isley and Paul Smith, who are internationally renowned for their projects combining art, science and technology. Through high\-profile collaborative projects they have created innovative outputs that represent scientific research aesthetically, not only communicating complex data to public audiences, but also leading scientific imagination beyond current research limitations. 

####  Dreams of Mice \(2015\-2016\) 

 Working with the University of Oxford, Isley and Smith captured data displaying the patterns of neuron activity in sleeping laboratory mice \[R1\]. Using computer modelling and game engine technology, they developed an innovative artwork in which real\-time neuron activity is represented on a three\-dimensional \(3D\) model of brain networks at a microscopic level \[R1\]. This artwork explores complex neuroscientific research in a form more intuitively understood by experts and non\-experts alike \[R2\]. 

 The project reflects upon the increased control, management and disruption of sleep behaviours by encroaching connective technologies, through illustrating the fragility of brain activity during sleep \[R1\]. Exhibitions include Mexico City, Glasgow School of Art and California.

####  AfterGlow \(2015\-2016\) 

 The Covid\-19 pandemic highlights the importance of public understanding of disease transmission. AfterGlow is a real\-time digital animation depicting malaria transmission, created under the Wellcome Trust funded Silent Signal programme and established by Animate Projects \[R3\]. 

 boredomresearch collaborated with Dr Paddy Brock \(University of Glasgow\) investigating a malaria parasite recently found to jump the species barrier from monkey to human via mosquitoes. As epidemiologists’ disease transmission models did not include ‘space’ in visual representations, Brock hoped to tackle this problem. Isley and Smith used Brock’s mathematical data to develop a spatially\-sensitive visual representation for AfterGlow; a computer animation that leads the audience on a visual journey through a landscape illuminated by glowing spirals which represent mosquito flight paths and infected blood, thereby illustrating the intimate relationship between disease and its environment \[R4\]. 

 AfterGlow won the moving image Lumen Prize award in 2016 and has been exhibited all over the world as part of the Silent Signal UK touring exhibition, including: Korea, Holland, USA, Italy, Columbia, Austria and Germany among others.

####  Robots in Distress \(2016\-2019\) 

 boredomresearch worked with computer scientists Thomas Schmickl and Ronald Thenius \(Artificial Life Laboratory, Graz University, Austria\) during the creation of the world’s largest underwater robot swarm, designed to monitor the heavily polluted Venice Lagoon. Isley and Smith’s research explored emotional robotics, highlighting that when addressing significant environmental concerns with technological solutions, the more human capacity for failure must be recognised \[R5\]. 

  

 As part of the Future Emerging Art and Technology \(FEAT\) initiative co\-financed by the EU Horizon’s 2020 research and innovation programme, Isley and Smith created an animation visualising emotional robotics; depicting a murky underwater world populated by small glowing robots seemingly helplessly navigating the hazards of plastic waste \[R6\]. Exhibitions took place in the UK, Brussels and Arizona.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Described as “the best contemporary arts practitioners” by the Director of Animate Projects \[E1\], boredomresearch's innovative work progressing science\-art collaboration has produced significant impact for a wide and varied range of beneficiaries. 

####  Enhancing scientific practice 

 By representing research data in visual, intuitive formats, boredomresearch provided their scientific collaborators with a “fresh look at their own work” \[E2, p.10\], encouraging questions and insights into abstract concepts at the frontiers of research. This positive feedback loop enhances scientific practice. 

 Scientists at the Artificial Life Laboratory described how working with boredomresearch on Robots in Distress “surely improved the quality of our work”; “they felt like fresh wind, that show\[ed\] us things, thoughts, views about our own work we did not know” \[E3\]. 

 A collaborating scientist described how Dreams of Mice envisions, “with an astonishing accuracy”, a fusion of methodologies for displaying neural activity that would help scientists “get closer to solving the mysteries of the brain and sleep” \[E4\]. 

 Dr Paddy Brock \(University of Glasgow\) describes how Isley and Smith’s work on Afterglow advanced his thinking on incorporating landscape into epidemiology models, something his field struggles with: “It is very difficult to make a model entirely spatially explicit, while at the same time making it quick, efficient and generalisable.\[...\] It’s been really interesting thinking about \[Isley and Smith’s\] approaches in terms of current trends in epidemiology and how space is being incorporated into these models” \[E5, 9:00\]. 

####  Improving the practice of communicating science through art 

 Projects from boredomresearch have provided innovative engagement opportunities for the public, in which “the merit \[…\] is scientific as well as artistic” \[E6, p.29\]. Collaborator Dr Brock praised how Afterglow “had great value in terms of science communication and engagement” \[E6, p.22\]. 

 As well as communicating research, the work of boredomresearch exemplifies and promotes the actual practice of communicating science through art. Award panellists commended how “in AfterGlow art embraces science” \[E6, p.28\], providing a “memorable example of artists employing digital media to its full potential” \[E6, p.28\]. Over 3,422,063 engagements from scientists, industry, civil society, policy makers and the public were recorded for the Silent Signal exhibits \[E7\]. A further 252 people \[E8\] visited the Robots in Distress exhibition in Arizona in December 2020, where visitors “gained a greater appreciation of scientific artwork” and are “hopeful that exhibitions like this one can be used as an example of how art and science can intersect and demonstrate the social and academic merit of arts based research” \[E9\]. 

####  Enabling organisations to grow financially and strategically 

 In 2017, the Biodesign Institute in Arizona invited boredomresearch to share their interdisciplinary research methods and present AfterGlow. The research insights “played a key role in forming the strategic public outreach documents for a successful bid of over USD8,500,000 from the National Cancer Institute to establish the new Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center” \(ACE\) \[E10\]. Best practice learnt from boredomresearch also led to a funded five\-year art\-science public communication initiative and a scheme dedicating “an estimated USD30,000 of funding for the next four years enabling four artists to collaborate with scientists leading to an estimated four new public engagement opportunities” \[E10\]. 

 In addition, “\[w\]orking with boredomresearch has enabled ACE to establish new and improved working relationships with cultural organisations at a national and international level including the public science education centre \- Centre of the Cell, Queen Mary University of London, CDC Gallery \(Centre for Disease Control\), Atlanta, Georgia and the ASU Art Museum, Arizona” \[E10\]. This supported ACE’s goal of “accelerating the progress of scientific research by harnessing creativity and innovation from the arts to create more expansive\-thinking scientists and establish wider outreach potential” \[E10\]. 

 Animate Projects exceeded their exhibition target audience of 24,000, thanks to Afterglow contributing “the largest proportion of viewings of all commissioned projects” \[E1\]. In Berlin alone, 84,000 viewed AfterGlow at a screening at the Sony Centre \[E1\]. AfterGlow also helped Animate Projects extend their reach into Asia, with screenings in Korea. This achieved a key strategic objective for the organisation, which has now gone on to lead new SciArt programmes in Asia with Isley as their best practice representative and mentor \[E1\]. 

 Animate Projects “invited boredomresearch \[…\] based on their previous work of creating dynamic real\-time animation projects influenced by scientific research” \[E1\]. These skills and experiences developed the practice of Animate Projects and their capacity for new types of work; “AfterGlow was the first Animate Projects production that was produced as a live animation installation \[…\] This has supported me to gain confidence in this field and has led onto the development of an XR project with gallery partners in the Midlands” \[E1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by **Professor John Oates** and colleagues identified the significance for child development of carers’ mental representations of their children and led to the design and development of a set of robust tools to measure these, for use by practitioners such as health visitors, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists. The tools have led to impact on health policies and professional services and practice through: 

-  Inclusion in the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Framework for Routine Outcome Measures in Perinatal Psychiatry \(2018\); 

-  Adoption by >30 NHS Trusts’ perinatal mental health services; 

-  Adoption by health care systems in >4 countries in 2 continents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to the research and development work of Prof. **Oates** and colleagues, there was an unmet need in perinatal mental health services for robust screening tools specifically designed to identify mothers’ disordered thinking about their infants. This is a known risk factor for dysfunctional parenting, difficulties in forming secure attachment relationships and longer\-term poor outcomes for the child. For example, a mother may perceive her infant as being too demanding and not caring about her, which can then lead to her not responding appropriately to infant signals of need for comfort, interfering with the formation of a secure attachment. 

 Research by **Oates** and colleagues has shown strong associations of such disorders with mothers’ anxiety and depression, and thus with subsequent developmental problems in their children **\[O1\]**. Although health visitors may often feel concerns about a mother\-infant relationship, until the tools that form the basis of this impact case study became available there were no easy\-to\-use instruments available for standardised assessment of this aspect in primary care. Psychotherapists and other health practitioners delivering perinatal health services also need easy\-to\-use tools as indicators to help them decide on the most appropriate treatments. Similar needs exist for assessing disordered caregiver thinking with respect to young children. Given the identified significance of such disorders, clinical research also requires validated instruments to investigate the developmental pathways and most appropriate treatments to avoid negative long\-term outcomes in child development. 

 Oates’ research gathered and analysed mothers’ narrative accounts of their perceptions of their infants to identify the range of descriptors they used. Based on a thematic analysis, forty\-four distinct descriptive terms were identified and presented to mothers in the form of a questionnaire with a Likert scale degree of agreement response frame. Statistical data analysis to identify principal components resulted in psychometrically robust 14\-item short form questionnaires in English and Hungarian **\[O2, O3\]** called the Mothers’ Object Relations Scales \- Short Form \(MORS\-SF\) also titled in service use as the ‘My Baby’ tool **\[O1\]**. This demonstrated that women’s mental representations of their infants’ thoughts and feelings towards them can be adequately described by values on two separate parameters \(warm\-cold and invasive\-distant\) and that these parameters can be accurately measured by the short form questionnaire **\[O1\]**. This questionnaire was designed to meet the need for a short, easy\-to\-administer tool for use by health practitioners in primary and secondary care. Prior to this discovery, the only available method for assessing maternal representations of infants had been structured clinical interviewing and subsequent systematic analysis of transcripts, requiring training and time\-consuming coding, an approach not feasible in primary mental health service delivery. Full\-scale community\-wide trials of MORS\-SF in an NHS Trust found that the tool showed clinical utility in assisting health visitors with making care pathway decisions **\[O4\]**. 

 The extensive validation research, carried out mainly in England and Hungary, has shown the psychometric robustness of the tools and their measurement efficacy. Further, this research has confirmed that the MORS\-SF parameters are associated with significant short\- and long\-term infant developmental outcomes and are affected by maternal anxiety and depression, while being moderated by social support **\[O1\]**; these findings are of significant value for health practitioners in gaining better understanding of the nature of service users’ problems in their relationships with their infants. 

 Health practitioners’ positive reception of MORS\-SF and the need for an equivalent for use with respect to older children stimulated the development of a modified version, MORS\-Child **\[O5\]**. This research was a collaboration with the University of Warwick Medical School and involved the validation of the tool for assessment in carers of older children \(2\-4 years\). MORS\-Child has been shown to perform better than the only other comparable tool **\[O5\]**. 

 In collaboration with the University of Birmingham, **Oates** followed a similar research methodology to include a selected set of the MORS\-SF questionnaire items in developing an assessment tool for use in informing and monitoring psychiatric and psychological treatments, the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire \(PBQ\) **\[O6\]**. Important benefits of PBQ over other tools include its alignment with clinicians’ interests in gaining insights into specific aspects of serious attachment problems between mother and infant that present in the period shortly after birth, to inform psychiatric treatment decisions and to track response to treatment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Rapid and accurate identification of cases where a mother has disordered thinking and atypical representations of her infant is critical in ensuring that ‘at risk’ mother\-child relationships can receive targeted, appropriate intervention at the earliest stage possible. Given the limited resources available for such interventions, to ensure optimal healthcare provider resource allocation it is important to identify where an intervention to specifically address this disorder is indicated. 

 As a package of clinically focused assessment instruments, the primary areas of impact are **Health Policies, and Professional Services and Practice**. The beneficiaries are the NHS and health services in other countries. 

 Pathways to impact on health services and practice have included talks, workshops, conference papers and training events undertaken by **Oates** and his research colleagues in the UK and overseas, throughout this period of assessment. The uptake of the instruments has been supported by giving guidance and advice for first and second\-tier perinatal mental health services, including via the Parent\-Infant Foundation, and collaborating with the Institute of Health Visiting to deliver training for health visitors **\[C1\]**. 

 The previous Professional Development Officer for the Institute of Health Visiting **\[C1\]** states: 

 *“The presentations and subsequent discussion were very well received. Practitioners reflected on their current practice in relation to parent infant interactions and recognised the significant benefits of the MORS SF tool in being able to demonstrate improved outcomes when working with families”.* 

 The Specialist Community Public Health Nurse for Somerset Sirona Care NHS services **\[C2\]** states: 

 *“Following your informative presentation at iHV PIMH champions training, I’m writing to let you know that all the North Somerset HV team continue to use MORS to enhance their assessments around infant/parents bond and screening for any concerns around attachment and bonding between parent and child. This allows the HV’s to discuss/offer an enhances service around both parental mental health and if there are any interventions to promoting bonding”.* 

 A further route to impact is a dedicated website **\[C3\]** that has been set up for health practitioners to register and gain access to proforma versions of the instruments, including in different languages. The website provides download guidance on administration, scoring and interpretation for the use of the tools in screening and treatment; to date \(31 Dec 2020\) more than 250 health practitioners have made use of the site. 

 **Inclusion of MORS\-SF and PBQ in a Royal College of Psychiatrists Framework** 

 As an overarching indicator of the significance of the suite of instruments, the MORS\-SF and PBQ have been included in the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ \(RCP\) Framework for Routine Outcome Measures in Perinatal Psychiatry \(2018\) **\[C4,** p.7 and p.15 **\]**. The RCP Framework recommends MORS\-SF and PBQ for use in perinatal services as ‘best practice’ in the UK. 

 Consequently, the RCP Framework has been a pathway to impact by leading to changes in routine clinical practice for perinatal health care professionals, and further NHS services adopting MORS\-SF in perinatal mental health programmes. This has been supported by the increased investment into this area of health, which is an NHS priority for development. MORS\-SF is also recommended by the NHS national IAPT \(Increased Access to Psychological Treatments\) Under\-Fives programme **\[C5\]**. 

 **Adoption of MORS\-SF by the NHS** 

 Adoption has become increasingly broad across the NHS in this assessment period, with >30 NHS Trusts’ perinatal mental health services reporting the use of MORS\-SF **\[C6**, pp.2\-3 **\]**, including the Bristol University C\-Change **\[C6**, pp.4\-9 **\]**, the Devon Children and Families Partnership **\[C6**, pp.10\-11 **\]**, the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust **\[C10**, pp.12\-16 **\]**, the Bradford Infant Mental Health Service **\[C6**, pp.17\-18 **\]** and the Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust **\[C6**, pp.19\-20 **\]**. 

 The Clinical Lead for Perinatal Mental Health in the Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust SMABS service **\[C6**, pp.19\-20 **\]** comments: “ *The Specialist Mother and Baby Mental Health Service in Bradford have used MORS\-SF since we launched in May 2018 as the tool was recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists as an outcome measure for perinatal services.  We have found it easy to use and a useful conversation starter to open dialogue around child development and baby’s needs \[…\].* *We are a multi\-disciplinary team with varied backgrounds \(psychological therapists, mental health nurses, occupational therapist and nursery nurses\), the tool has helped us bring the parent infant relationship to the centre of our work ensuring we hold baby in mind and support mum in holding the baby in mind”.* 

 Further, a Senior Psychologist in the Child and Parent Service within the  Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust **\[C6**, pp.21\-23 **\]**  states: *“We use it* \[MORS\-SF\] *as an outcome measure in our clinic work and in our group work, pre and post intervention, and  have found it has clinical utility also in assessment in helping generate conversations with parents about what interventions might be most useful for them*”. 

 MORS\-SF data gathered by NHS practitioners are entered into the National Mental Health Data hub, run by NHS Digital, contributing to statistics tracking and analysing mental health across the English population **\[C7\]**. 

 **Adoption of MORS\-SF and PBQ by health services overseas** 

 MORS\-SF has been translated into Polish, Chinese, Hungarian, Russian, Dutch, Hindi and Arabic, and has been adopted by health care systems in other countries including Hungary \[C8, p. 3\], Australia, Belgium **\[C8**, p.3 **\]** and Russia. 

 For example, the Head of the Early Childhood Eating and Sleeping Disorders Outpatient Clinic at the Heim Pál National Paediatric Institute, Budapest, Hungary **\[C8**, p.2 **\]** states: 

 *“The instrument is our primary research tool for questionnaire assessment of the mother\-infant relationship and aligns well with our theorising about the importance of maternal perceptions of infants and our therapeutic orientation. We have found that the MORS is a thought\-provoking set of questions, giving a unique value in starting them thinking about their child's behaviour potentially facilitating positive change in response to therapy”.* 

 And in Belgium the chief psychiatrist of the Bethany Psychiatric Hospital, Zoersel, Belgium **\[C8**, p.3 **\]** states: 

 *“We implemented the MORS\-SF in all our modules \[treatment pathways\] in the MBU \[mother\-baby unit\]. We are really pleased with the usefulness of it”.* 

 An online survey of MORS\-SF users **\[C8**, pp.4\-35 **\]** was conducted in June 2017. This survey reported wide uptake and application with more than 4,000 patients internationally. Based on **Oates’** and colleagues’ research and the positive value of the tools found by clinical users, initiatives have been established over the last five years in which these assessments are central elements. These include a new perinatal mental health clinic model in Budapest, incorporation into perinatal mental health treatment programmes in clinics in Perth, Australia and a revision to the IAPT \(Increased Access to Psychological Treatments\) Under\-Fives programme by NHS England. The MORS\-SF tool has been included in the Checkware virtual suite of clinical tools for access by health practitioners world\-wide **\[C8**, p.36 **\]**. 

 The PBQ has similarly been widely adopted internationally and translated into many languages, and Oates has collaborated with a Brazilian clinical team to develop and validate a version of the PBQ in Portuguese **\[C8**, pp.37\-43 **\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lancaster University’s research on lithium\-ion battery degradation directly led to the formation of the spin\-out company Altelium in 2019, \[text removed for publication\] 

 with first–year trading income of GBP121,000. Backed by Lloyd’s of London, Altelium insures energy storage containers based on used electric vehicle batteries. This is a rare instance of the financial services sector becoming a beneficiary of a strategic technology research programme aligned with the Government’s “Batteries for Britain” initiative. The availability of Altelium’s insurance–based battery warranty has enabled SMEs in the UK’s emerging battery industry, such as Connected Energy, AMTE Power \(formerly AGM Batteries\), Delta Motorsports, and Brill Power to enter the rapidly growing energy storage market. 

 Connected Energy rolled out their first batch of Mega\-Watt \(MW\)\-level energy storage systems with an Altelium warranty, and AMTE are growing their larger\-scale cell manufacturing provision.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Impact has arisen from lithium\-ion\-batteries \(LIBs\) research by the interdisciplinary team at Lancaster University’s Battery Laboratory \(BatLab\), led by Hoster. The research has directly enabled a new method of informing insurance risk calculation, with potential global reach. 

 Battery warranty presented two novel challenges for the insurance market: \(i\) chemically driven performance loss \(typical for batteries\), which had not been encountered as a basis for insurance risk calculation \(the main ones being mechanical fatigue and electronic failure\), and 

 \(ii\) historical data on battery performance had been too scarce, given that EV mass production only started in 2010 and the pace of new battery cells entering the market. 

 The lack of historical data was tackled by scientifically informed battery lifetime predictions along with real\-time monitoring of batteries in the field. The underpinning research has made three distinct contributions: 

-  A robust model to predict battery degradation, accounting for cycles and time \[G1\-G3\]; 

-  A new cell model based on lab performance tests and identification of the internal chemical processes that cause performance fade \(see Section 4 and \[G2\]\); 

-  Data encryption and machine learning capabilities for battery remote monitoring and the interpretation of incoming real\-world data \(‘battery status estimation’\), which validates and improves prior risk calculations \[G3\]. 

 This approach begins with fundamental battery research and then relies on multi\-scale modelling and model parameterisation \[G1\] to turn those insights into prognostic tools. Via two Innovate UK projects \[G2\-G3\], those tools were validated in commercial battery cells and then utilised to address performance and capacity fade. 

 **Batteries from fundamentals to applications.** 

 The atomistic understanding of processes occurring in battery cells \[3.2, 3.6\] allowed the BatLab team to improve non\-intrusive diagnostics of LIBs \[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\]. This fundamental research is part of the Multi\-Scale Modelling consortium funded by the Faraday Institution \[G1\]. It includes modelling the spatial distributions of Li atoms in LIB electrodes using electron structure theory 

 and Monte\-Carlo simulations \[3.2\]. These simulations explain the changes in LIB cell voltage during charge and discharge \[3.2\], which is the feature most used to track battery state\-of\- charge and state\-of\-health \[3.1, 3.3, 3.5\]. Improvements were also made in the method of ‘entropy profiling’, which measures the changes of free energy, entropy, and enthalpy in a LIB during charge and discharge. By reducing measurement time from weeks to hours, the method was made viable for diagnostics of commercial cells \[3.6\]. In a recent study \[3.2\], entropy profiling enabled us to shed new light on the well documented but poorly understood phenomenon of voltage hysteresis at graphite electrodes, which is crucial for the reliable estimation of battery status. 

 In a 2015 project with BMW \[3.4\], Hoster et al. also studied the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase, an electrochemical process that is necessary for the stabilisation of the graphite electrode after manufacturing but also leads to long\-term degradation \[3.4\]. 

 Commercial battery cells and their diagnosis \[3.1, 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6\] became the focus through a 2015 collaboration with Technical University Munich \[3.5 and 3.6\]. That opened the door for Innovate UK funded industry\-oriented projects \[G2, 3\], starting with the ‘UK Niche Vehicle Battery Cell Supply Chain’ \[G2\] consortium led by AMTE power \(formerly AGM Batteries\). Here, important trends in how battery operation influences the pace of battery degradation were found. For instance, if two battery cells are left on ‘idle’ for 12 months, both will lose capacity due to so\- called calendar ageing \[3.1\]. If one cell is charged to 70% and the other is fully discharged \(0 %\), then the former will lose 4 times more capacity than the latter; a third cell charged to 100% may even develop internal short\-circuits. Likewise, it was possible to quantify how battery degradation is impacted by charge/discharge rates, upper and lower voltage limits, and temperature \[3.1, 3.3 and 3.5\]. Those insights formed the basis of the algorithms and parameters behind Altelium’s battery insurance products. 

 **Project Pozibot: battery data capturing, authentication, and analysis.** 

 Early in the Niche Vehicle Battery project \[G2\] \(July 2018\), LU hosted a meeting with AMTE Power \(lead partner and a battery manufacturer\), Delta Motorsports, and the insurance company CNC Asset Ltd. AMTE power and Delta Motorsports stated an urgent need for insurance\-based warranties for battery packs, and CNC Asset confirmed that no such products existed so far. 

 Hoster then led a consortium to tackle that challenge, via the Innovate UK funded project ‘Pozibot’ \[G3\], in response to the call ‘Transforming Accountancy, Insurance and Legal Services with AI and Data’. Pozibot not only addressed battery diagnostics, but also topics like quantum\- based data encryption and asset tagging \(Robert Young and QuantumBase\), risk calculation \(Hoster group and Altelium\), machine learning \(Plamen Angelov\), and algorithm\-based decision making \(Hoster group and Altelium\). This paved the way for an algorithm\-driven ‘insuretech’ platform that detects faults automatically from remote data, offers predictive maintenance as a service to warranty clients and updates and adjusts risk and pricing models automatically for future contracts. Altelium Ltd. was created in May 2019, i.e., shortly after project Pozibot was awarded. 

 A parallel collaboration with Prof Katy Mason from the Lancaster University Management School involved the supervision of one PhD student and one Masters\-by\-Research student on the topic of energy\-storage systems based on second\-life electric vehicle batteries \(see reference 5.4\). 

 That collaboration helped identify the immediate market opportunity and further potential customers, which triggered the founding of Altelium Ltd. and the first client services agreements. 

 In summary, the research in the Lancaster BatLab \(spanning a broad research area, from atomic scale phenomena, to lifetime predictions of commercial batteries\), funded via the Faraday Institution and Innovate UK within the strategic Batteries for Britain initiative, has resulted in new ‘extended warranty’ products in the global insurance market. The impact of this strategic research funding has therefore boosted not only the science and technology sector, but also the financial services industry.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1. Impact on the financial services and insurance industry, and the creation of a new spin\-out company Altelium:** 

 Lancaster University \(LU\) spin\-out Altelium Ltd. was founded in 2019 in response to an early market opportunity identified in the preparation phase of project Pozibot \(section 3\). Altelium Ltd. interfaces the chemically driven uncertainties about battery degradation to risk calculations as common at the London insurance market. That interface is reflected by the three founding directors and their backgrounds Prof Harry Hoster \(Lancaster Chemistry\), Charley Grimston \(CNC Asset, insurance\), and John Pesmazoglou \(Helestia, insurance\). 

 The novelty of battery warranty to the insurance market is down to two facts \(see statement 5.5\): 

1.  Chemically driven performance loss, as typical for batteries, was not established as a basis of insurance risk calculation \(as opposed to mechanical fatigue or electronic failure\). 

1.  Historical data on battery performance was too scarce, given that EV mass production only started in 2010, and given the pace of new battery cells entering the market. 

 Altelium Ltd. brought a new ‘extended warranty’ product \(Battery Energy Storage System Warranty\) \[5.1\] to the London Insurance Market. The underpinning risk calculations are based on the Lancaster BatLab’s research results about the chemical processes of battery degradation \[3.1\-3.4\] in combination with the jointly developed data science and machine learning tools \[G3\]. The UK Faraday Institution stated in a recent report: *“through the creation of Altelium, the power of battery data can now be harnessed. Real time information about battery State of Health, enhanced by AI technology, has been packaged together in a secure platform, which is accessible and practical for customers who need to make investment or operation decisions about Electric Vehicle batteries”* \[5.1, 5.6\]. 

 As of November 2020, Altelium has 20 employees. Data experts Judith Elgie and Jazz Kirkwood are co\-located in the premises of Energy Lancaster and are thus embedded in the research activities of the Lancaster BatLab. Battery experts Prof Harry Hoster \(Altelium co\-founder\) and Dr Alana Aragon Z0lke are affiliated with LU and Altelium. All other employees \(software, operations, claims handling, finances, business development\) are based in Finmere, Buckinghamshire. 

 Since its founding, Altelium has raised **investments worth GBP390,000 from its founding shareholders** and won **GBP806,560 of research grants**. As of November 2020, income from first customers \(Connected Energy, and AMTE power\) **has been GBP121,000**. \[text removed for publication\]. \[5.5\] Altelium is determined to position itself to grow in support of UK and worldwide green energy initiatives and is poised to expand its team to maintain growth in line with international momentum. From 2021 onwards, Altelium expects income to reach GBP590,000, GBP2.117 million, and GBP4.095 million per annum, respectively \[5.5\]. Altelium's income projections \(""Net Worth Premium""\) are GBP0.7million, GBP4million, and GBP13million for years 2021, 2022, and 2023 \[5.1, 5.5\]. Altelium's Battery Energy Storage System Warranty is continuously improved to meet the demands of customers. Those demands grow and diversify, given the rapid growth of the Energy Storage market \(also due to the UK's Green Growth strategy\) and the rising wave of used electric vehicle batteries that become available for stationary energy storage \('second life'\). 

 On the Lloyd's of London side, work is progressing toward securing the first capital provider to financially underwrite the new insurance product created by the LU team and Altelium \- an extended warranty for a set of energy storage containers based on used electrical vehicle batteries \('second life'\). Negotiations started in November 2019 and are ongoing, with the aim of creating the foundations for a co\-designed battery warranty underwriting model. This represents a first of its kind globally and is a crucial milestone in the wider roll out of green technology \[5.2\]. 

 The Lancaster BatLab underpins trust relationships between Altelium and their customers and capital providers by ensuring that Altelium's algorithms and assumptions are founded on world­ leading research. This includes the provision of informed modifications of the warranty products as required for new battery cell models or different battery usage patterns. 

 **4.2 Supporting SMEs into the electric vehicles and stationary battery storage markets:** Insurance\-backed extended warranty allows SMEs to offer their customers longer \(e.g. five\-year\) warranties on their products \(e.g. energy storage containers that contain second\-life electric vehicle batteries\). Without such warranty, their products are not eligible for many 828 procurement processes, thus limiting their market chances. SMEs \(with their rather slim balance sheets\) can offer longer term \('extended'\) warranties only when backed by an insurance company with access to sufficient capital. Companies like Altelium and CNC Asset act as translators between warranty needs of technically oriented businesses and the large\-capital insurers \(e.g., in the Lloyd's of London syndicates\) by creating technically informed risk calculation and pricing. 

 The creation of Altelium and much of the work conducted by the LU team was motivated initially by the desire to provide support to those SMEs and green\-tech start\-ups with which it was engaged \[G2\-G3\], including: Connected Energy, AMTE Power \(formerly AGM Batteries\), Delta Motorsports, and Brill Power. For AMTE Power as an emerging player in battery cell manufacturing in the UK, the availability of insurance\-based battery warranty is essential *""if AMTE are to leverage the output of the Innovate UK funded project and establish a successful and commercially viable niche cell manufacturing facility in the UK""* \[5.3\]. Connected Energy \(www.c\-e\-int.com\) is a UK SME, specialising on the utilisation of second\-life battery packs in stationary energy storage solutions. Connected Energy confirmed that Altelium's 'Battery Energy Storage System Warranty' removed the principle roadblock from their entry into the energy storage market: *""Our collaboration with Altelium and Lancaster University was critical for achieving an extended warranty that satisfies our customers' needs to evaluate our products as a desirable investment case. This has a/read led to a successful bid for a large, 2nd\- life ESS and we expect more to come soon”* \[5.4 and 5.5\]. The fast adaptation of that product for the special demands of second\-life batteries was only possible via \(i\) **a Client Services Agreement worth GBP95,000** signed between Altelium and Connected Energy in April 2020 and \(ii\) underpinning contract research and consultancy by the Lancaster BatLab team funded by Altelium and CNC Asset. Connected Energy and other Altelium clients expect to install several thousand second\-life battery packs \(with a total power of more than 250 MW\) in the next three years \[5.5\], which could not proceed without the new warranty product. 

 **4.3 Environmental impact:** 

 The new battery warranty product and the work of LU and Altelium, has enabled companies and investors to more easily venture into the battery market, leading to enhanced growth and better market access for Electric Vehicle \(EV\), energy storage, and green technology producers \[5.1\- 5.6\]. 

 A faster deployment of energy storage solution and of clean transport in business setting has an even bigger environmental impact than the electrification of private cars. Whereas the latter are typically parked for 90% of their time, energy storage systems and business\-related vehicles are constantly in use. Clean air in ports, warehouses, and airports will strongly benefit from that transition. The UK’s GBP2.5 billion ‘Green Growth Strategy’ \(announced in November 2020\) will further boost the deployment of solar and wind energy installations, whose power variability is a key driver for energy storage installations. Our enabling of faster deployment of ‘second\-life’ battery storage systems is essential for the circular economy of Li ion batteries, where maximising the useful life is an important component. 

 As the Faraday Institution’s Head of Engagement has stated with regards to the hurdles facing the transition to green energy sources: *“Major barriers... hold back battery producers and electric vehicle \(EV\) manufacturers from having the confidence in the state of battery health to a level that can be warranted. The depth of information needed around battery history, changes to the battery chemistry and the impacts on future performance to underpin a battery warranty – or investment decisions in them – has not been readily available”* until now, thanks to research by Lancaster University and Altelium \[5.6\]. Empowering new players on the second\-life market \(including SMEs\) will ensure that battery packs with their expensive and partially hazardous components are accounted for throughout their life cycle, and eventually feed into verified and clean material recycling processes \[5.4\]. Lastly, our newly created link between battery science and technology on the one hand and financial services on the other will ensure that the ‘Green Growth Strategy’ will not only benefit the environment and the technical sector of the industry, but also the financial services sector, the central economic stronghold of the United Kingdom \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Sam George’s research on the ‘ethical Gothic’ has sought to shift away from horror, cultivating a sense of moral agency, employing gothic narratives to create empathy for the marginalised, monstrous or othered, including the natural world. Through extensive public engagement, pedagogical innovation and outreach activities, she has i\) increased public awareness of how Gothic narratives can challenge perceptions of otherness and difference, helping to combat prejudice and hate crime through her work with the Sophie Lancaster Foundation; ii\) used her research into folklore and myth to promote ecological conservation, working with the UK Wolf Conservation Trust to help inform public perceptions of wolves; iii\) worked with and inspired the Young Adult Fiction of the novelist Marcus Sedgwick. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning the case study is George’s work on Gothic studies, primarily vampire literature and culture, the representation of shapeshifters and other magical beings \(particularly werewolves\) and the relationship between folklore and fiction \(e.g. wolf myths, folktales of children raised by wolves etc.\). This research has been central to the ongoing Open Graves, Open Minds project \(OGOM\). The project has prospered through collaboration with Drs Bill Hughes and Kaja Franck. OGOM was established by George and Hughes in 2010 to lead and foster research, nationally and internationally, into how representations of the undead, the supernatural and the fantastical in literature and myth relate to, and can influence, contemporary attitudes on issues ranging from sexuality and social change, to otherness, hybridity or difference. Originally focusing on vampire fiction, film and television, OGOM has expanded its scope to embrace a range of Gothic genres and tropes examining such areas as the physical body and animal studies, including the extinction and conservation of seemingly ‘monstrous’ creatures \(such as wolves\). 

 OGOM has hosted three major international conferences: ‘Open Graves, Open Minds’ in 2010; ‘The Company of Wolves’ in 2015; and ‘The Urban Weird’ in 2018 \(a collaboration with the Supernatural Cities project hosted at the University of Portsmouth\). It has also hosted two smaller\-scale symposia, to commemorate the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Bram Stoker’s death in 2012, and the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of Polidori’s *The Vampyre* in 2019. These events have resulted in numerous publications, some of which have become staple texts for the vampire\-studies courses which have emerged in the wake of OGOM’s success. 

 George’s work with OGOM has increasingly focused on the power of contemporary Gothic fiction to speak to, and influence, a young readership; she has argued consistently that Gothic writing both enthuses young adult readers for literary studies, and provides a medium for them to explore complex questions of identity and ethical behaviour on both a personal and societal level. In particular, her research has explored how the study of the Gothic can shape the ethical thinking of young readers, particularly around two of the most pressing issues facing contemporary society: tolerance for difference in the face of rising instances of hate\-crime against BAME communities and minority subcultures, and the looming threat of ecological crisis. A selection of outputs relating to the ‘ethical Gothic’ are listed below \(3.1\-3.5\). Two distinct strands of publication have emerged: on Young Adult Gothic fiction, exploring questions of subculture, otherness and difference; and on wolves, exploring questions of human\-animal relations, monstrosity, wildness, extinction, habitat\-loss and rewilding. 

 These outputs are the result of a decade of sustained effort to rethink the way in which people conceptualise Gothic studies, both inside and outside the academy, and to demonstrate that the study of popular fiction can, by challenging prejudices and preconceptions, have transformative social impact.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 George has used the OGOM project to reconfigure attitudes towards the sorts of otherness commonly depicted and explored in Gothic fiction. By challenging prevailing conceptions of the meaning and significance of popular Gothic fiction, both in the academy and in broader public discourse, she has used Gothic fiction as a means of intervening directly in pressing contemporary ethical debates about social attitudes towards minority groups, and environmental degradation; this work has also directly affected the practice of an award\-winning creative writer working in the genre, who has collaborated in the project. 

 This impact has been achieved through a programme of public engagement, academic conferences which also attracted a non\-academic audience, dissemination through the mainstream media, and wide use of social media. George collaborated with two charities, the Sophie Lancaster Foundation and the UK Wolf Conservation Trust, has developed and implemented educational toolkits for sixth\-formers in schools and colleges. 

 **Public engagement with gothic narratives** 

 A key feature of the OGOM project has been its continuous engagement with interested members of public, as well as scholars and students. The OGOM conferences have sought to attract interested members of the public as well as an academic audience. The project website  [www.opengravesopenminds.com](http://www.opengravesopenminds.com/) had received 165,084 visitors by 31 December 2020. Social media includes Twitter \(@OGOMproject 7,303 followers and 315,000 impressions over a three\-month period; @DrSamGeorge1, c. 12,500 followers; OGOM Facebook group 920 members\). George has discussed the work of OGOM at literary festivals and public events including: 

-  ‘Books of Blood: objects lost and found’, *Being Human Festival* \(23 November 2017\) 

-  The Manchester Gothic Festival \(24\-29 October 2017\) 

-  Living Frankenstein event at SOAS and Bath Literary Festival \(23 and 25 May 2018\) 

-  Battle of the Books at Edinburgh Festival and London Conway Hall in collaboration with novelist Marcus Sedgwick \(20 August and 4 September 2018\) 

-  Supernatural St Albans Halloween Tour \(31 October 2018\) 

-  ‘The Black Vampyre: Gothic Visions of New Worlds’, online, *Being Human Festival* \(14 November 2020\) 

 This approach has established her as a leading public\-facing scholar of Gothic fiction, providing a platform to challenge conventional thinking about Gothic subcultures and pressing social and environmental issues. 

 **Ecological conservation: challenging perceptions of wolves** 

 The charity Rewilding Britain has argued that the UK should respond to the global climate crisis by rewilding a quarter of the nation’s land. One of the key obstacles, however, is widespread misunderstanding of or hostility towards the concept of rewilding. Much of this is rooted in negative associations with some of the wildlife which might be reintroduced in such a plan, such as the wolf. The portrayal of werewolves in literature has, George argues, influenced negative public perceptions of wolves. George has worked with OGOM to challenge negative stereotypes of wolves, by looking at werewolves in a more nuanced, positive light. Two events initially disseminated the work: the Company of Wolves conference \(2015\), an academic conference that attracted a non\-academic audience, and included a visit to see wolves at the UK Wolf Trust; and the ‘Redeeming the Wolf’ event at the AHRC’s 2017 Being Human festival. 

 Extensive media coverage of the Company of Wolves conference, showing high levels of readership and reciprocal engagement, demonstrates how George’s work has influenced public discourse on the issue. A Guardian article, *The howl truth: scholars get packing for UK werewolf conference* \(21 August 2015\), discussed initial interest in the conference. This inspired a further comment piece that argued it was time for the resurgence of the werewolf in the public imagination, drawing a connection between werewolves and modern society’s problems \(‘ *In our dog\-eat\-dog world, it’s time for werewolves*’ 30 August, 2015\). This piece attracted 96 comments of its own, e.g.: *“*Surprisingly insightful and frankly quite excellent article… I've been sensing the return of the Werewolf archetype in popular culture for some time now”. A further article on the conference in *The Independent* was shared widely on social media \(2,000 shares, 10,300 Facebook shares, 1,600 comments, 6,700 reactions\) while BBC Local Live \(Beds, Herts and Bucks\) excitedly live blogged the first day of the conference. Day two saw them publish a feature article on their interviews with visitors to the conference \[ **5.6**\]. 

 Public engagement on the subject continued with an article by George in *The Conversation* on the Hull werewolf, *Why We Should Welcome the Return of Old Stinker the English Werewolf* \(30 October, 2016\). It gained 16,879 reads, was shared 202 times on Twitter and 2,220 times on Facebook and attracted 63 comments, significant metrics for the site. George actively engaged with the people who commented, thereby stimulating debate on the topic \[ **5.2**\]. Elsewhere, she collaborated with Mike Collins, chief keeper at UK Wolf Trust, on a BBC article exploring the public perception of wolves and their conservation \(‘ *Little Red Riding Hood tale hampers wolf debate, says academic*’, 4 November 2017\). Cementing the relationship between George’s literary research and the wider re\-wilding debate, the article highlights George’s belief that negative perceptions of wolves arise from the “demonising folklore and fairytale around the animal”, with Collins confirming that there are “almost no wolf attacks on humans”, and that he would “welcome a debate about bringing the wolf back to British shores” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 
On arrival at the Redeeming the Wolf event \(18 November 2017\), audience members were asked to write three words they associate with the wolf, and then to perform this task again after attending the talks, film and panel. As Professor Garry Marvin, education and research committee at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust stated, this “thoughtful and active engagement with the public” gave a “snapshot of their attitudes to wolves, \[indicating\] what views they had come with and how they felt at the end of the day” \[ **5.7**\]. As shown, responses demonstrated how attitudes towards the wolf shifted significantly through engaging with this research. The audience response cards were then displayed at the UK Wolf Trust, playing a part in their educational outreach and public engagement. The Trust is now directing educational queries to the OGOM project. 

 OGOM’s Redeeming the Wolf educational pack incorporates the response cards alongside a collection of benevolent wolf myths, with a programme of interactive workshops, lectures and seminars. Educational outreach work was undertaken by George with 16 local schools, using these packs to engage students with both the ethical issues surrounding wolves and the nature of literary study through their textual representations. The recorded responses show significant shifts in attitudes – with almost all moving from a negative to a positive view of wolves – and increased ethical awareness, e.g. “I'd like to be more involved with environmental conservation” \[ **5.4**\]. The pack has been made available online. 

 **Perceptions of ‘otherness’ and hate crime** 

 George’s work on otherness and hate\-crime, approached through the study of Young Adult fiction, has pressing social relevance in the wake of Brexit, at a time when the Home Office has reported a spike in reported hate\-crimes. George is working with Poet Laureate Simon Armitage and the Sophie Lancaster Foundation, the charity set up in the wake of the murder of the Goth teenager Sophie in 2007 to encourage tolerance of subcultures through education and outreach, and to campaign for the inclusion of subcultures within the legal definition of hate crime. George’s research, disseminated in her keynote ‘Black Roses: The Representation and Appropriation of Sophie Lancaster from Broken Britain to Brexit \(2007–17\)’ at the Manchester Gothic Festival \(2017, 200\+ attendees\) “spoke directly to the work of the Foundation…She made people aware that hate crime is not restricted to issues of race or sexuality, that it can extend to subcultures and all those who are perceived as different within their own communities” \(Education Officer, Sophie Lancaster Foundation \[ **5.5**\]\). Over 50 people approached the Foundation’s stall after the talk to offer donations and request further information. Her work “had a lasting impact on the audience of festival goers. It has helped to cement and shape Sophie’s legacy … through increased donations to the Foundation; through an increased number of young people wanting to become involved in the work of the foundation; through changing people’s understanding of what a hate crime is” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Understanding Otherness educational packs, incorporating material from Armitage, were trialled in empathy workshops with students on the “Generation Dead” undergraduate module, where Armitage’s ‘Black Roses’ is tied to the themes of subculture, otherness and adolescence. Responses to evaluation after the workshops demonstrate a change from stereotyped attitudes to the Goth subculture, with positive descriptions including “gentle, enthusiastic, misunderstood”. They also show how the research fostered active commitment to work against hate crime, e.g. “I would personally look into volunteering at a charity or company that helps to rehabilitate victims of hate crime back into society and obviously spread word of the Sophie Lancaster foundation” \[ **5.10**\]. The Foundation were “struck by the level of impact” and the “strong shift in opinions about Sophie as a result of Sam’s work in the workshops”. They plan to use the exercises with their own live audiences and will direct teachers to the OGOM packs. Collaboration with the Foundation continues, with an event with Simon Armitage and Sylvia Lancaster in 2021 \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **The Black Vampyre** and ‘otherness’** 

 Research into the 1819 American Gothic slavery text ‘The Black Vampyre’ began with a social media campaign to celebrate this text: the first black vampire, the first vampire story by an American writer and the first vampire anti\-slavery narrative. It inspired 130,000 impressions on Twitter, 34 comments, 654 retweets and 1,780 likes. George’s article in *The Conversation* ‘America’s first vampire was Black and revolutionary’ \(30 October 2020\) received significant public attention: 38,171 reads; 14,600 Facebook shares; 405 Twitter retweets \[ **5.2**\]. A public event was held as part of the Being Human Festival \(November 2020\), focusing on how humanities research into Gothic narratives engages with people’s aspirations and dreams, especially when facing crises—such as plague, war, and racial oppression. The event had 159 attendees including participants from the US, Australia, South America and throughout Europe. The audience was asked what three words they would use to describe Gothic narratives after engaging with the discussion and there was a very strong shift away from horror and sensationalism; instead, the responses showed an understanding of how empathic and revolutionary the Gothic can be: “Humane, questioning and clever”; “Progressive, connecting, revolutionary”. Reponses to further questions demonstrated that attendees gained a new perspective on contemporary issues and understanding of Gothic narratives through exploring otherness: “The links to the BLM movement seemed particularly poignant”; “this event definitely opened a new perspective on the Gothic for me” \[ **5.9**\]. 

 **Inspiring and informing creative writing** 

 The author Marcus Sedgwick has been involved with OGOM since its inception. His fiction for young adults shows deep concern with ethical issues, often dramatised through the Gothic. He states that his writing has been influenced by his cooperation with OGOM: “working with OGOM and the team around Dr Sam George has encouraged me to voyage more deeply into the relationship between folklore and fiction, and I can see the result in all my work. It has been consistently inspired, enriched and informed by it…I strongly see a connection between this work with OGOM and a book I wrote some time later, *Midwinterblood*, perhaps the book for which I am best known… *The Monsters We Deserve* was very influenced by our discussions and my thinking about gothic monsters. One of the central questions…was inspired by OGOM\!\!” \[ **5.8**\]. *Midwinterblood* won the Michael L Printz Award, America’s most prestigious prize for writing for Young Adults.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Huertas Barros and Vine’s research into translation and interpreting \(T&I\) training has produced findings aimed at improving pedagogy and assessment that have been put into practice in the UK and beyond by a range of translation stakeholders. Impacts include: 

-  direct changes to the assessment practice of commercial translation companies; 

-  enhancing industry understanding of the nature of the trained workforce \(sharing detailed insights into academic provision and practice\); 

-  enhancing translation assessment practice across UK higher education institutions \(HEI\) via the first survey of such provision in this sector; 

-  extending this impact to translator training in Spain.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the spread of competence\-based approaches to translator training, a need has arisen for empirical studies of the extent to which this pedagogical approach is being incorporated in teaching, learning, and assessment on translation courses in HEI. Identifying assessment practice as a valuable lens through which to view current understandings of translation pedagogy, Huertas Barros and Vine undertook a case study of tutors’ \(n=16\) perceptions and use of summative assessment on the MA translation modules at the University of Westminster \[1\]. In doing so they redressed the lack of empirical studies on assessment practices and, more broadly, the lack of research relating assessment practices in translator education to wider HE debates on assessment. The survey results highlighted the need for assessment instruments and marking criteria to more explicitly reflect the skills demands of the commercial translation market \(the majority of tutors surveyed worked in both HEI and industry\); for such assessment criteria to be better clarified; and for assessments to encompass not only the end product but the translation process also. 

 Seeking to test the practical application of their findings, the results of Huertas Barros and Vine’s study were used as a basis for consultation and discussion with the MA teaching staff at Westminster, and this foundational research resulted in the remodelling of assessment practices in the core translation modules via the development of new criteria and a revamped feedback sheet, as well as changes in the weighting of assessments. In light of the changes implemented, Huertas Barros and Vine undertook a study of the broader learning community to assess the efficacy of these changes, surveying both the MA tutors \(n=16\) and the cohort of students \(n=53\) on their perceptions of the marking criteria and assessment patterns \[2\]. Through this second empirical study, Huertas Barros and Vine identified the importance of effectively integrating assessment literacy into course design, finding that fuller understanding of the criteria and processes involved in assessing translation will both raise assessment standards and better equip learners with the ability to objectively assess the quality of translation in their own work and that of others. By demonstrating how the construction of assessment standards can be enhanced through direct engagement with learning communities \(both tutors and students\), the methodology and findings of this research into changes at their own institution constituted an informed proposal for best practice in translation training across the broader sector, which Huertas Barros and Vine would take forward through the activities described in Section 4. 

 Outputs \[1\] and \[2\] were central to the University of Westminster’s successful application for European Masters in Translation \( [EMT](https://ec.europa.eu/info/resources-partners/european-masters-translation-emt_en)\) status in June 2019, with Westminster being one of only 5 institutions to have more than one MA course awarded EMT status. The assessment instruments, tasks, and criteria of the core translation modules of both of the awarded MA courses were redesigned on the basis of the findings of these outputs, demonstrating the value of this research to actionable assessment practice. 

 In carrying out background research for their survey of the assessment practices at Westminster, the researchers found that, although there had been a rapid increase in programmes offering translation and interpreting training, there was no research into how this training was being offered. The next phase of their research project was thus to investigate assessment practices across the UK HEI sector. Huertas Barros and Vine undertook, for the first time, a review of all 27 MA Translation courses offered by UK universities and investigated the extent to which competence\-based approaches and changes in the translation market are actually informing assessment practice on the core translation modules of such courses \[3\]. In regard to competence\-based approaches, the research revealed a diverse range of practices encompassing learning outcomes, assessment instruments and tasks, and assessment criteria. It also revealed unifying trends in the response from UK universities to market changes and new pedagogical approaches to translation. The data collected from the survey was analysed using the concept of ‘fit for purpose’ and the six tenets of assessment set out by the Higher Education Academy \(HEA\) in its paper ‘A Marked Improvement: Transforming Assessment’ \( [2012](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/A_Marked_Improvement.pdf)\), as reaffirmed in ‘The case for transforming assessment in higher education’ \( [2016](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/downloads/assessment_viewpoint_aug16.pdf)\). Huertas Barros and Vine’s analysis indicates that the use of translation competence as a pedagogical model increases the probability that assessment practices are fit for purpose, and that there is a need to increase awareness of all the HEA tenets of assessment and, particularly, assessment literacy \(outputs \[2\], \[3\], \[4\]\). 

 One of the aims of the above research was to provide an overview of practices and changes in practices that could inform individual universities in their designing of assessment and courses. This has been built upon by Huertas Barros and Vine in their most recent research, which recommends ways to embed the tenets of assessment, especially assessment literacy, into module design and delivery. By introducing a case study on module design with a collaborative transcreation \(the translation of advertising material for use in a different cultural and/or linguistic environment\) project at its core, the researchers were able to identify a set of concepts that can be applied to the curricular needs of translation trainers in order to future proof students in the changing employment market \[4\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  4.1 Changes to practice in the translation industry 

 Huertas Barros and Vine adapted the components of best practice identified in their research into adoptable techniques for embedding into an industry context. The researchers then organised and led a joint academia and industry workshop \(June 2017\) for 25 stakeholders which **provided practical methods for enhancing translator competence and quality assessment**, emphasising the importance of the process of translation to the success of the product. 

 Follow up testimony collected two years after the workshop has recorded Huertas Barros and Vine’s direct impact on these industry stakeholders’ practices. These changes – and their related benefits – are outlined in the table below. 

| **Stakeholder**:  [Translator Training](https://www.translator-training.com/about/about-us), an online training provider which has helped more than 1000 students take a professional qualification in translation and employs 45 tutors from industry and education. The following testimony is from the Course Director at Translator Training \[a1\]. |
| --- | --- |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “reviewed our provision of feedback and attendant documentation. After consultation with key staff I decided to make specific changes in line with the ideas discussed at the workshop, to the wording of our feedback sheet, which is provided by translation tutors to students on the distance learning course”; -  the feedback sheet “included further explanation and contextualisation” e.g. Performance Aspects were given definitions, Error Categories were “updated to facilitate a reflective post\-analysis on the part of the student”. |-  “help\[s\] both teachers and students in analysing areas needing more attention”; -  “the diagrammatic/visual layout enables both teachers and students to ‘see’ and chart progress. This can then provide an important starting point for discussion in telephone tutorials or Skype sessions”. |
| **Stakeholder:**  [Hogarth Worldwide](https://www.hogarthww.com/), a leading marketing consultancy firm with over 4,000 employees across 28 cities worldwide that provides language services to clients, including transcreation. The following testimony is from an Account Director at Hogarth Worldwide \[a2\]. |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “created a specific client relevant translation test for new freelance translators. These tests are assessed using our ‘Translator Performance Review Tool’ by our existing specialised and trusted translators”; -  “introduced the Translator Training Pack which is now sent to all new translators”, consisting of client relevant facets: brand background and company profile; glossary in local language; style guide for local language; reference materials; -  “introduced a new approach when it comes to provid\[ing\] feedback to our translators. After each project, we share client feedback with the talents when relevant”; -  “introduced a periodic assessment in case of an internal complaint or in case of an external complaint \(from other talent or client\)”. |-  “before joining our database, all our translators are fully vetted to test their writing skills and subject matter expertise. Only the best are selected”; -  “make\[s\] sure there is consistency across the account and avoid numerous emails to Project managers asking for guidelines on the above subjects”; -  “the translators get familiar with the style and terminology requested by the client \[…\] avoiding future changes or complaints from the client”; -  “keep\[s\] our database always updated with the best talents by stopping any collaboration with those talents that do not meet our quality requirements”. |
| **Stakeholder**:  [Deluxe Media](https://www.bydeluxe.com/en/), a world leading video creation company, encompassing the production of subtitle files for digital cinema releases. The following testimony is from the Team Lead at Deluxe Media \[a3\]. |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “gave rise to thinking about how to achieve more quality in the quality control team \[…\] at the time, I had little direct experience with translator or translation quality evaluation”; -  “putting in place regular group feedback sessions on client rejections and proactive work quality monitoring”. |-  “the awareness of quality procedures and the use of software has been raised and the number of rejections for obvious errors has decreased” partly because of strategies stimulated by the workshop. |

 The impact of the researchers’ work – through output \[3\] and the surveys described below – has also extended to further language service providers within industry via the Association of Translation Companies \( [ATC](https://atc.org.uk/)\); the language sector’s leading professional body in the UK. The researchers were commissioned to produce an in\-depth industry briefing informed by the data collected in their surveys to **enable language service providers to better understand the nature of the trained workforce**. The ATC’s CEO states: “The briefing was welcomed by the ATC and the language service companies it represents, as it provided up\-to\-date insights into the academic provision undertaken by current and future staff members and freelancers employed or commissioned by the ATC. \[…\] These insights help direct further on\-the\-job training needs, and form a solid basis for understanding new candidates’ academic backgrounds” \[a4\]. The detailed industry briefing authored by Huertas Barros and Vine \[a5\] was published on the ATC website on Dec 1 2020 and was promoted in the ATC Newsletter December 2020 \[a6\], reaching “some 3,500 language services industry recipients” \[a4\]. 

#  4.2 Impact on Translator Training within UK Higher Education 

 The President of the Association of Programmes in Translation and Interpreting Studies in the UK and Ireland \( [APTIS](https://www.aptis-translation-interpreting.org/)\) explains that Huertas Barros and Vine’s 2015 UK\-wide survey on assessment practices on MA T&I programmes, which underpinned output \[3\] above, “was an important undertaking that **made many T&I colleagues across the UK realise the importance of looking at the specifics of translator training provision in the UK**. Their research into T&I provision and the different approaches to translator training in the UK also **acted as a platform through which colleagues have been able to share and inform good practice**” \[b1\]. 

 In this way, Huertas Barros and Vine’s survey stimulated improvements in T&I across the UK, and these impacts were **consolidated by** **the formation of APTIS in response to the survey** having highlighted the need for a peer\-support network of T&I researchers: “This first survey coincided with and contributed to the desire for T&I programmes in the UK to collaborate more closely in order to be in position to face the many challenges facing translator training. To this end, my colleague Dr Castro \(Warwick University\) and I set about creating an association for T&I programmes in the UK in 2016” \[b1\]. This association of 24 HEIs works “to improve the quality of learning and teaching as well as research on translation and interpreting programmes at Higher Education institutions” through knowledge exchange amongst members via newsletters, webinars, a forum, and an annual conference \[b2\]. 

 To this end, the President states APTIS invited Huertas Barros and Vine “to present their cutting\-edge research on translation assessment in a dedicated Workshop at our first annual conference \(APTIS 2018, Aston University\)”, delivered to representatives of 15 HEI institutions \[b1\]. The President adds: “Based on their research, this workshop was extremely successful in **challenging participants’ views on assessment on T&I programmes** and will no doubt have had an impact on the way colleagues think about the assessment strategy on their own translator training programmes” \[b1\]. 

 At the third annual Conference in Nov 2019, APTIS officially endorsed Huertas Barros and Vine’s proposed second iteration of the survey of UK university programmes, this time encompassing 30 institutions \[b3\]. As 5 years had passed since the first survey, the April 2020 follow\-up survey provided richer data reflecting the last 10 years of T&I training and captured changes in HEI and in the related industry \(employers of the trained students\), thus providing an opportunity for educators across the UK to share their best practice and to therefore identify and adopt improvements as found in the practice of others. As the President of APTIS confirms, the researchers’ “initial survey was so **useful to APTIS in gathering and disseminating information about existing T&I courses \(and, therefore, informing best practice\)** that we decided to officially support the second iteration of the survey” \[b1\]. 

#  4.3 Impact on Translator Training in Spain 

 The above impacts created through Huertas Barros and Vine’s surveys and related outputs have also extended into Spain via the “Evaluation in the Acquisition of Translation Competence” \( [EACT](https://pagines.uab.cat/eact/en)\) project, which aims to establish evaluation procedures for different levels of acquisition of translation competence and is led by Procés d'Adquisició de la Competència Traductora i Avaluació \( [PACTE](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en)\); a world\-leading research group in translation training comprising academics from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. 

 According to the EACT Principal Researcher, the project’s first phase “is a replication of Huertas Barros’ and Vine’s \(2016, 2018, 2019\) objective but in the context of translation training in Spain” \[c1\]. As such, Huertas Barros was engaged as an external consultant with “a key role in the design” of the EACT survey of BA Translation programmes in Spain, for which “Huertas Barros and Vine’s surveys \[…\] served as a basis” \[c1\]. 

 Huertas Barros provided advice “in terms of its structure, sections and content as well as the methodological design, including the survey items and response scales, and a first internal validation test of the survey” \[c1\]. Her engagement resulted in the reorganisation of questions, their rewording to avoid ambiguity, the narrowing of their scope, and the replication of 12 questions that had been included in Huertas Barros and Vine’s own surveys \[c1\]. 

 The impact of this EACT survey, finalised in July 2020, replicates that of the one undertaken in the UK **.** The survey provides insight into the current assessment practices in translation training programmes in Spain and **enables identification of the main issues and gaps that need to be addressed to improve translation training and students’ learning experience**, specifically in relation to assessment practices. As such, the survey results “benefit students and tutors given their direct application to translation training material and curriculum design” and also benefits “translators and translation companies by informing guidelines for quality control in translation practice” \[c1\]. 

 The impact of this intervention on the work of PACTE is that the survey outcomes are **vital to their creation of “standardised evaluation procedures” that will validate the accuracy and appropriateness of pioneering competence descriptors** \[c1\]. Previously established in their “Establishing Competence Levels in the Acquisition of Translation Competence” \( [NACT](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en/collaboratinginstitutions)\) project, upon which EACT builds, these competence descriptors provided, for the first time, translation competence levels that function as equivalents to the widely used A\-C Common European Framework of Reference for Languages \(CEFR\), ensuring the quality of translation by enabling consistency between universities and service providers. 

 Huertas Barros and Vine were part of the  [panel](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en/evaluators) of external expert advisors for the 2015\-2018 NACT project, with the former providing consultancy on the initial proposed framework of competence levels \[c2\]. Both then took part in the appraisal of the revised competence framework by evaluating the appropriateness of each category and proposed level, as well as the text genres associated with each category and their level of progression. The researchers also evaluated and advised on the main abilities and requirements of the different levels \[c3\]. 

 Huertas Barros and Vine thus significantly contributed to both NACT and EACT, the success of which has enabled PACTE to access a €253,280 EU grant for a project that will provide final validation for these descriptors and result in such standardisation in translation training: “ [EFFORT](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/): Towards a European Framework of Reference for Translation”.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Attribution:** Research carried out at The University of Edinburgh led by Professor Mutapi, in close collaboration with The University of Zimbabwe, led to a reduction in schistosomiasis \(Bilharzia\) and has influenced national control policies. 

 **Impact on health and welfare:** The treatment program has reached 100% of the target population, and reduced infection and disease level from a national level of 32% to 0% for Schistosomiasis and Soil Transmitted Helminthiasis \(STH\) in Zimbabwe. 

 **Impact on public policy:** Professor Mutapi implemented a mapping strategy for Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\) in Zimbabwe, which then informed appropriate treatment policies. As a result of the mapping strategy conducted by Mutapi, treatment and resources were focussed on endemic areas. This strategy was subsequently adopted by many other African countries. Preschool aged children are now included in the ongoing 2012 Zimbabwe NTD control policy. 

 **Beneficiaries:** 5,000,000 Zimbabwean school and preschool aged children at risk of disease by NTDs in Africa; cost savings through safe and integrated Mass Drug Administration \(MDA\) programmes. 

 **Significance and reach:** Decrease in infection and disease from Schistosomiasis and STH in Zimbabwe. Mapping of NTDs has been completed in approximately 87% of countries in Africa encompassing an estimated 620,000,000 people at risk of disease by NTDs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Schistosomiasis \( *S. haematobium* and *S. mansoni*\) and soil transmitted helminthiasis \(STH\) are among the most widely distributed neglected tropical diseases \(NTDs\) that affect people living in vulnerable communities with poor and limited access to safe water, sanitary facilities and inadequate health facilities. Approximately 200,000,000 people are affected by schistosomes worldwide, with over 90% of the cases occurring in Africa. 

 Professor Francisca Mutapi, a leading researcher in the field of schistosomiasis and Global Health, has run a collaborative research program in Zimbabwe for the past 20 years. She collaborated with colleagues from the University of Zimbabwe to carry out a nationwide cross\-sectional survey to map schistosomiasis and STH in 2010 and 2011, among 13,195 primary school children in 280 primary schools from 68 rural and urban districts in Zimbabwe to represent infection in the country’s >5 million children exposed to schistosomiasis \[3.1\].The team used the gold standard parasitology diagnostics techniques available at the time to determine schistosome and STH infection prevalence and intensity. 

 Professor Mutapi and her group have shown the detrimental health impact of schistosomiasis in children \[3.2\] and demonstrated that treatment with praziquantel, the drug of choice, is safe and efficacious not only in treating primary school children, but also preschool children \[3.3\]. Prior to the work, there was no schistosome control program in Zimbabwe. Following the recommendations of the World Health Assembly \(WHA\), resolution 54.19 advocated for the control of schistosomiasis morbidity in highly endemic areas, and urged countries to attain a target of regular treatment of “at least 75% and up to 100% of all school\-age children at risk of morbidity by 2010”. Zimbabwe needed a national control programme, however, WHO indicated that countries needed to know their baseline infection levels in order to implement the appropriate control strategy. 

 Overall, the national schistosomiasis prevalence was 22.7% \(range 0%–62%\) and that of STH was 5.5% \(range 0%–45%\). Based on the results of this study that confirm nationwide predominance in distribution of schistosomiasis and STH, the team contributed to the development of preventive chemotherapy strategies and implementation in the country \[3.4\]. In addition to the population impact based on this mapping study, the national control program, which targets individuals, also had a significant positive impact on reducing infection and improving health.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

####  Background and pathway to impact 

 The World Health Organisation has a roadmap \(2020 Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Disease\) for member states to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030. 

 Based on the results of Professor Mutapi’s research that confirmed nationwide predominance in distribution of schistosomiasis and a lesser extent of STH, preventive chemotherapy strategies were determined and recommended for the elimination of these two specific NTDs in Zimbabwe. 

 “On a national scale, Professor Mutapi has been involved in the genesis, planning and implementation of Zimbabwe’s helminth control programme started in 2012.”  \[5.1\] 

 In September 2012, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health formulated a national NTD control policy, 5\-year action plan and implemented school\-based mass drug administration, including schistosomiasis treatment, targeting primary and secondary school children across the country based on this mapping exercise. Five of the six annual **m**ass **d**rug **a**dministrations \(MDAs\) occurred within the REF2021 impact period \[5.1\]. 

 Crucially, Zimbabwe’s control programme recommended **treating all children annually irrespective of the regional prevalence of infection**. This is in contrast to the WHO preventive chemotherapy guidelines that recommend the frequency of treatment based on community/regional infection level, *i.e.* high risk communities should be treated annually, whereas those at lower risk should be treated every two years or twice within a child’s school career. 

 “This work provided the evidence base leading to the WHO recommendations, thus correcting a significant and long\-standing health inequity, and making \~50 million pre\-school African children eligible for schistosomiasis treatment.” \[5.1\]. 

####  Impact on health and welfare 

 **Disease:** The treatment program has not only reached 100% of the target population, but has reduced infection and disease level in school children from a national level of 32% to 0% \[5.1\]. 

 **Figure 1 Changes in prevalence at national level from MDA 1 to MDA 6.** 



Annual MDAs were carried out in Zimbabwe from September 2012. Five of the six annual MDAs occurred within the REF2021 impact period \(10/2013, 01/2015, 11/2015, 11/2016, 11/2017\). For the six years of annual MDA, monitoring and evaluation of the treatments were conducted \[3.4\]. After six rounds of annual MDA, Zimbabwe surpassed the WHO recommended 75% coverage to over 90% coverage and decreased national prevalence of schistosomiasis \(infection and disease\) from 32% to <1% in school children \[5.1\]. The treatment coverage increased each year peaking at 90% in 2016, well above the 75% coverage for schoolchildren set by the WHO for the “2020 Roadmap” for schistosomiasis \[5.2\]. Annual assessment in sentinel sites throughout the country showed that schistosome infection and disease level decreased significantly after each round of treatment from the pre\-treatment levels in the same year. Most notably, both urogenital schistosomiasis infection and morbidity prevalence reduced from 32% at baseline in 2012 to 0% in 2017, and infection intensity reduced and 28.75 eggs/10ml urine to 0 in the same time period. Intestinal schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity reduced from 4.6% and 0.28 eggs/25mg of stool to 0% and 0 eggs respectively \[3.4\], \[all the treatment coverage data are publicly available on the ESPEN database 5.3, 5.4 & 5.5\]. Thus, the control programme significantly reduced schistosome infection and morbidity in the school children, illustrated in Figure 1 \[3.4\], moving the national schistosome prevalence in school\-aged children from moderate to low by WHO classification. 

 In 2018, Zimbabwe spent USD15,392,840.14, on drugs to treat NTDs \(intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and trachoma\) as part of the MDA programmes \[5.6, pg14\], placing Zimbabwe in the top 8 African countries based on the value of treatments. In 2018, 95,300,000 people received preventative chemotherapy for schistosomiasis, 76,200,000 million were school\-aged children and the remaining 19,100,000 were adults \[5.7 i\-iii\]. 

 Due to the success of the MDAs, the need for an integrated strategy for eliminating schistosomiasis in Zimbabwe involving treatment, sanitation and education was highlighted in The End Fund, “Breaking the Cycle of neglect” review. 

 “To develop robust elimination strategies it is vital for Zimbabwe to gain a better understanding of the distribution of these diseases in adults and preschool\-age children.” \[5.8\] 

 “There is also an urgent need to improve education on NTDs within the primary school curriculum on hygiene and sanitation practices.” \[5.8\] 

 **Daily life:** To capture impact at the individual child level as well as overall impact in schools, a community impact evaluation \[5.9\] was carried out in late October 2019. Perception of the MDA programmes for helminth control by the affected populations influences compliance and future designs of the programmes. Public perception of Zimbabwe’s National Helminth Control Program \(2012\-2017\) was determined with a specific focus on schistosomiasis in the school children treated with praziquantel, school teachers and village health workers \(VHW\). 

 The study enrolled 409 children from Grades 6 and 7 who had the full benefit of the 6 years of MDA from 2012 to 2017. 36 schoolteachers and 22 VHW serving the schools were also recruited. The evaluation focused on the perceived impact on heath, school attendance and performance and Knowledge Attitudes and Practice \(KAP\).  Overall, 84% of the children responded that their awareness of schistosomiasis \(transmission, disease, treatment and infection avoidance\) had improved because of participating in the MDAs. Of the 151 children self\-diagnosed with schistosomiasis, 74% reported that their health had improved following treatment with praziquantel. This included resolution of haematuria, painful urination, sore stomach, tiredness and falling asleep during class lessons. The children and teachers reported improvements in both pupil school attendance and performance at school as well as an increase in health seeking behaviour for schistosomiasis treatment in\-between MDAs. 

 The majority of VHW \(96%\) reported improvement in handwashing behaviour, schistosomiasis awareness \(96%\) and treatment uptake \(91%\) within the community. However, only 59% and 50% of the VHW reported improvement in toilet use and clean water use respectively, within their communities. 

 This study indicated that the community perceived that the MDA programme had improved the health of children, their school attendance, school performance and awareness of schistosomiasis. The VHW also perceived that the MDA program had improved the community KAP. Perception of helminth MDA programs by the affected populations influences compliance and therefore, affects the success of the programme. This evaluation determined the perception of Zimbabwe’s National Helminth Control Program with a specific focus on schistosomiasis in the school children treated with praziquantel, schoolteachers and village health workers \(VHWs\) \[5.9\]. 

 **NTD Mapping in Zimbabwe and elsewhere:** Due to the success of the Zimbabwe National NTD programme, other countries in Africa have adopted the mapping strategy \[3.3\] and subsequent implementation of control programmes for schistosomiasis, STH and other NTDs \[5.1\]. 

 “We conducted a national survey to map the current distribution of schistosomiasis and for the first time, to map the  distribution of STH in Zimbabwe” \[3.3\]. 

 Mapping of NTDs is now complete in 41 \(87%\) countries in the African region \[5.7, pg 5\]. In the REF impact period \(2014 & 2015\), 22 African countries including Mauritiana, Liberia, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Benin, Namibia, Madagascar & DR Congo were mapped for NTDs by the WHO\-AFRO mapping project. 

 “A total of 75 million school aged children \(SAC\) were treated in 2017, representing an unprecedented coverage of 69.4% from 29 countries that reported data in a timely manner.” \[5.10, pg 5\]. 

 Mapping was ongoing in Ethiopia and Angola and was soon to start in South Africa, South Sudan and Algeria. The AFRO Mapping project, a joint effort of WHO's African Regional Office and NTD Support Centre, is nearing completion of Phase I: the district\-wide assessments for preventative chemotherapy against NTDs \(lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil\-transmitted helminthiasis, schistosomiasis and trachoma\). Building on countries' earlier mapping efforts, 85% of districts in the AFRO region now are fully mapped for these diseases. 

 This impact covers over 87% of countries in Africa and an estimated 620 Million people at risk of disease by NTDs in Africa. The mapping of NTDs across Africa has allowed countries to works towards effective regional elimination programmes and improve accuracy of the incidence of NTDs. There will be cost savings through safe and integrated mass drug administration, and through ending of unnecessary treatments. 

 More recently, Professor Mutapi’s group extended the findings of the mapping exercise to develop a strategy for mapping schistosome infection in preschool children, a current knowledge gap identified by the WHO. The strategy developed by Professor Mutapi and her group uses data from the surveys in school age children such as that highlighted here for an inexpensive approach applicable in poor resource settings obviating the need for surveying young children \[3.6\]. 

####  Impact on public policy: 

 As a direct result of the Mutapi group’s research \[3.2\], preschool aged children are included in the 2012 Zimbabwe NTD control policy. Zimbabwe implemented this policy throughout the REF period, and consequently these children have been treated annually in local clinics out with the MDAs \[3.5\] \[5.1\]. 

 “Professor Mutapi and her team showed that pre\-school children are exposed, infected and suffer from schistosome morbidity. She also showed that treatment with praziquantel was safe and efficacious in this age group. This work provided the evidence base leading to the WHO recommendations, thus correcting a significant and long\-standing health inequity, and making \~50 million pre\-school African children eligible for schistosomiasis treatment.” Director Epidemiology and Disease Control, Ministry for Health and Child Welfare, Zimbabwe \[5.1\]

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Professor Liam Campling has produced a body of research on the role of labour rights and provisions in international trade agreements. His Economic and Social Research Council\-funded project, ‘Working Beyond the Border: European Union Trade Agreements and International Labour Standards’ \(WBB\) has shaped debate and policy regarding the European Union’s \(EU’s\) approach to Trade and Sustainable Development \(TSD\) in its Free Trade Agreements \(FTAs\). In particular, it has: \(a\) informed the European Commission’s TSD reform agenda and critical debate in the European Parliament; \(b\) informed the position of international trade union organisations and Members of the European Parliament on the EU’s approach to TSD; \(c\) contributed to the reform of EU trade policy through the creation of a civil society network; and \(d\) contributed evidence\-based analysis that fed into the December 2018 EU triggering of a TSD chapter to establish consultations with South Korea on its non\-ratification of four International Labour Organisation Core Labour Standards. 
","
# 1.  Underpinning research 

 Since 2011, the EU has used a framework of Trade and Sustainable Development \(TSD\) chapters in all its Free Trade Agreements \(FTAs\) as part of its commitment to including what it calls ‘European values’ and enhanced worker rights in its trade agreements. TSD chapters are vital to current and future EU trade policy and are regularly cited in key policy documents and by important EU officials \(e.g. EU President and EU Trade Commissioner\) as critical for ensuring that economic growth goes hand in hand with better environmental standards and working conditions in the EU and its trading partners. Between September 2015 and December 2017 Professor Campling was Co\-Investigator on an Economic and Social Research Council\-funded project entitled ‘Working Beyond the Border: European Union Trade Agreements and International Labour Standards’ \(WBB\). The project involved an inter\-disciplinary team of researchers at Queen Mary University of London and the University of Warwick in an investigation of the negotiation, implementation and effectiveness of the EU’s framework for labour provisions in its Free Trade Agreements \(FTAs\). 

 This research project, the most comprehensive examination to date of the EU’s approach, produced three primary insights. 

 First, it identified significant limitations in the institutional structures established by the EU’s TSD framework and in its operationalisation \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\]. The limitations are: 

-  trade partner governments have not prioritised labour issues in the implementation of trade agreements with the EU; 

-  EU trade officials have limited knowledge and understanding of labour relations in trade partner countries; 

-  the institutional mechanisms set up for monitoring the provisions and labour standards in trade agreements are hampered by unclear aims, inadequate resourcing and limited influence on the government\-led committees to which they ultimately report; and 

-  monitoring mechanisms, centred on civil society groups, are weak. 

 Second, labour standards were perceived and institutionalised as secondary in relation to the commercial aspects of EU FTAs with trading partners \[3.2, 3.3, 3.5\]. For example, one of the WBB case studies led by Campling found that the EU downplayed labour abuses in South Korea so as to not endanger the objective of negotiating an investment agreement with this country \[3.1\]. Further, the EU placed a comparatively higher emphasis on the harmonisation of standards in the automotive industry in the institutional design of the FTA with Korea where recourse was available to a ‘hard’ dispute mechanism as this would ultimately make European auto exports to Korea more competitive, while, in contrast, only a ‘soft’ consultation process was established under the TSD chapter \[3.5\]. 

 Third, the research identified the limited reach of the EU’s labour provisions into the leading export sectors impacted by the EU’s trade agreements \[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]. Entire segments of Korea’s auto workforce \(e.g. irregular and migrant workers\) do not have a voice in the TSD process \[3.5\]. This is because of an important mismatch in the design of labour standards in EU FTAs who tend to privilege formally organised workers in strategic positions of production networks over those in more precarious positions, and thus in most potential need of the protections that the TSD chapter purports to offer. The research also shows how commercial pressures exerted by lead firms down the supply chain constrain the space for enhancing working conditions in supplier firms \[3.2, 3.5\]. 

 When the European Commission subsequently sought to reform its TSD chapters to tackle the issues identified in the research, Professor Campling co\-authored an article involving nine leading scholars from across Europe. The article critically evaluated key aspects of the reform process, identified the importance of ongoing monitoring of how the reforms were enacted, and made proposals for how trade agreements could be harnessed more effectively to improve workers’ welfare \[3.4\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Through a variety of activities related to the Working Beyond the Border \(WBB\) project, Campling has contributed to the reform of trade policy in Europe. This has led to enhanced trade policy provisions, improved agreements between the EU and trading partners, and the further development of sustainability goals in international trade. 

#  Research shaped the European Commission’s TSD reform agenda and informed critical debate in the European Parliament 

 In 2017, Campling organised a stakeholder meeting in Brussels attended by European Commission officials, which led to a co\-authored response paper to the Commission’s consultation on TSD reform. The response paper included several policy proposals based on Campling’s research findings \[5.5\]. Following this, Commission officials invited the WBB project team to further discuss policy reform. The Trade Policy Officer at the International Trade Union Confederation \(ITUC\) noted that this response ‘gave many civil society organisations a framework to use for their own submissions’ to the consultation \[5.4\]. The submission to the European Commission’s consultation process was also cited by the Swedish Board of Trade in its submission in December 2017 \[5.8\]. 

 Several of the recommendations in Campling and co\-author’s response were ultimately mirrored in the Commission’s ‘way forward’ document of February 2018 \[5.7\], and reflected to some degree in future EU trade agreements, including the need to: 

 \(i\) adequately resource the institutional structures of the TSD process; 

 \(ii\) widen the remit for civil society engagement and monitoring of EU trade agreements; 

 \(iii\) move away from a standard template TSD chapter to one that recognises the specific labour issues and priority areas in each context; and 

 \(iv\) achieve early ratification of international labour conventions to maximise leverage on trade partners to ensure policy change. 

 For example, the EU\-Mercosur 2019 trade agreement includes a new article 11, specifically focused on ‘trade and the responsible management of supply chains’ \[5.14\], an issue highlighted as a key limit in previous TSD approaches by Campling’s research. 

 Additionally, Campling and the WBB team gave two invited presentations at the European Parliament, which fed into the policy reform process. The first in June 2017 was to a European Parliament International Trade Committee working group. The event’s organiser said the research presented gave a ‘fresh impetus and new ideas on how our members \[of the European Parliament\] can push the \[European\] commission to develop a more effective monitoring process, improve scrutiny and consider new mechanisms for implementation of FTAs’ \[5.1\]. 

 In November 2017 Campling and the WBB team presented the research to a conference on the Future of EU Trade Policy, which Members of the European Parliament \(MEPs\) and representatives from 12 EU national parliaments attended \[5.2, 5.3\]. A former MEP who participated said the research ‘was particularly helpful in identifying the root causes of the inefficiencies of \[the\] EU’s trade policy and proposed action for policy change’ \[5.2\]. This led to a ‘plenary debate in the European Parliament in January 2018 on the basis of a parliamentary question drafted by our Group’, which raised, ‘in particular the shortcomings in civil society monitoring mechanisms’ that the research identified \[5.2\]. The presentations therefore informed debates in the European Parliament, and recommendations from the research contributed to the adoption by the European Commission of its reform to the TSD model \[5.2\]. 

#  Research shaped debate and policies of international trade union organisations on the EU’s TSD approach and put pressure on the European Commission for reform 

 In September 2017, Campling and colleagues co\-organised an event with the European Trade Union Institute to present the WBB’s key findings to European Trade Union Confederation \(ETUC\) and ITUC staff and delegates attending an ETUC meeting. In December 2017, the research team organised a dissemination workshop for trade union participants from EU trade partner countries \(Korea, Moldova, Columbia\), and ran a public discussion on the European Commission’s reform proposals involving 40 participants from key EU institutions and civil society groups in Brussels with these trade union representatives. The International Director of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions \(KCTU\), drew on the WWB findings to make a case for TSD reform \[5.6\] 

 The team also engaged in ongoing discussions with the ITUC, assisting in shaping its position on the effectiveness and potential reform of the Commission’s TSD approach. A key member of ITUC staff stated that: 

 ‘I found this project to be of particular importance to my and other colleagues’ work because it provided \[…\] new insight on the nexus between trade and sustainable development \[…\] The project was impressive in identifying possible roots of the inefficiencies of EU’s trade policy and it proposed action for policy change \[…\] \[T\]he project has been outstanding \[…\] both in terms of the quality of its outcomes and the catalytic role it played in organising civil society in Brussels to engage on the trade\-sustainable development agenda with a fresh look’ \[5.4\]. 

#  Research led to a new civil society network aimed at reform of EU trade policy 

 Campling and WBB colleagues, in partnership with the ITUC and ActAlliance in Brussels, established Domestic Advisory Groups \(DAGs\) for Change, a civil society/academic group with members of trade agreement labour monitoring mechanisms. The team’s research and policy advice influenced the DAGs for Change discussions and informed its response to the European Commission’s July 2017 reform consultation. An ITUC member of the group stated that: 

 \[t\]he ideas from the WBB project \[…\] have been important to the work of that group and have been used in the development of common positions \[…\] on what reforms should be made to TSD chapters \[…\] Partly as a result of pressure from the trade union and civil society groups who are involved in DAGS for Change, the European Commission is now itself recognising the limitations of TSD chapters within EU trade agreements \[5.4\]. 

 Other members of the international NGO community have also drawn on the WBB findings, including Action Aid \[5.9\] and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung \[5.10\]. 

#  The research fed into the EU’s first ever triggering of dispute settlement procedures under a trade agreement to challenge alleged TSD violations 

 The WBB research provided evidence \[5.5\] that fed into the EU triggering the TSD chapter to initiate consultations with South Korea in December 2018 \[5.11, 5.13\] on their failure ‘to make continued and sustained efforts towards ratifying the fundamental ILO Conventions’ \( [EUKOR FTA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:22011A0514(01)) Article 13.4 \(3\)\). This led to the EU’s subsequent request for the establishment of a Panel of Experts on Korea’s lack of compliance with obligations under the TSD chapter in July 2019, and establishment of a Panel on 30 December 2019 \[5.12\]. 

 The contributory influence of the WBB research can be inferred from the inaction of prior attempts to trigger this mechanism \(i.e. before WBB work was disseminated\). A 2014 letter from the EU DAG to the European Commission to initiate formal consultations with South Korea on labour abuses was rejected, and informal intergovernmental dialogue was opted for instead \[3.1, 3.5\]. In 2016 the WBB team submitted written \[3.1 in pre\-publication draft\] and oral evidence \(Campling and another\) to an independent  [five\-year review of the implementation of the EU\-Korea FTA](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/june/tradoc_155673.pdf) \(published June 2017\). The report noted that the WBB research documented failings in the implementation of the TSD chapter in relation to labour standards in Korea but rejected \(p. 345\) the WBB claim without counter\-evidence. Instead, it sought to counter the WBB findings by noting compliance with institutional procedures \(i.e. meetings had been held and reports written\). Yet it was precisely this focus on form over content – procedure over action – that the WBB research had highlighted, as pointed out by MEP Dr. Joachim Schuster \[5.13\]. Indeed, the WBB findings were supported by the European Commission *itself*, which only one month later in its ‘Non\-paper…’ \(2017\) admitted to problems with the design and implementation of its TSD chapters \(in part in response to the WBB work disseminated in Impact \(1\) above\) and launched a wide\-ranging consultation process for TSD reform \(which the WBB influenced\). 

 A March 2017 WBB policy workshop in Brussels ‘provided helpful supporting information’ to MEPs when they ‘resolved to submit in May 2017 a formal implementation report to the European Commission \(A8\-0123/2017\)’, which ‘called on the Commission ... to investigate Korea’s failure to implement the labour standards provisions in the TSD chapter’. MEP Dr. Joachim Schuster states that WBB ‘research findings have provided useful information and analysis in my office’s work to push the European Commission to trigger the TSD dispute settlement process with the launch of a Panel of Experts in the EU\-Korea FTA’ \[5.13\]. Further, the WBB analysis is being used by trade unions in South Korea ‘to help prioritise our work on the EU TSD chapter’, including in relation to the eventual findings of the Panel of Experts \[5.6\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Literature Wales, the national organisation for literary participation and promotion, historically delivered activities for a largely privileged audience. Cardiff research analysed Roald Dahl’s fiction for children and adults, and revealed the author’s complex Welsh identity; the formative place of Wales in his imagination; and Welsh\-related issues of class, diversity and social justice in his work. Through Walford Davies’s role as Chair of Literature Wales between 2012 and 2018, these findings influenced a shift in Literature Wales’s delivery model from 2013, allowing the organisation to engage with more diverse audiences. The new outreach model was embedded in Literature Wales’s strategies in 2016 and 2019. The research also enabled Literature Wales’s leading role in the ‘Roald Dahl 100’ centenary celebrations in 2016, which engaged over 43,000 participants through outreach events across Wales. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Roald Dahl is often seen either as an English cultural marker or as an ‘Anglo\-American’ writer. *Roald Dahl: Wales of the Unexpected* **\[3.1\]**, edited by Walford Davies, asserts the seminal importance of Wales – the country of Dahl’s birth and early life – for both the author and his fiction. Reading Dahl through a Welsh lens and identifying the Welsh lenses through which Dahl saw the world are a means of contesting and nuancing the received image of him. 

 The book was published in 2016 to coincide with the centenary of Dahl’s birth in Llandaff, Cardiff, with the research undertaken from 2013 onwards. There had previously been no sustained scholarly engagement with the forms and importance of Dahl’s \(Anglo\-\)Welshness in his published fiction and manuscript drafts. In addition to conceptualising and curating the volume, Walford Davies contributed an Introduction **\[3.1a\]** and one of the book’s nine chapters **\[3.1b\]**, with Smith **\[3.1c\]**, Worthington **\[3.1d\]** and Rosser **\[3.1e\]** also contributing chapters. 

 **2.1 Bringing Dahl back to Wales** 

 Although Dahl’s transnational identities were recognised by his most recent biographer, Donald Sturrock, the importance of Wales in his imagination and social outlook had not been noted prior to the research conducted at Cardiff. Walford Davies’s collection shows that, despite the fact that Dahl was only permanently resident in Wales for the first nine years of his life, his work reveals a complex Anglo\-Welsh orientation, and, relatedly, a privileging of marginalised groups in society **\[3.1a**, **3.1d\]**. 

 Inspired by the Dahlesque notion of the ‘unexpected’, the collection defamiliarises Dahl and brings him back to Wales by revealing the country’s significance across the full range of his literary output. The research highlighted the following: 

-  Wales as a troubling concept for Dahl, registered in complex – seldom explicit – ways across his fiction **\[3.1a\]**; 

-  Dahl’s outlook and principles were shaped by Wales’s communities, geographies, culture and history, and by his pivotal experiences of cultural and class difference, and cross\-class and cross\-cultural relationships **\[3.1a**, **3.1c**, **3.1d\]**; 

-  The South Wales industrial experience is an important theme in Dahl’s fiction, revealed more explicitly in manuscript drafts than in the published work **\[3.1c**, **3.1d\]**; 

-  The translation of Dahl’s fiction from English into Welsh produces both an uncanny ‘Dahl\-in\-Welsh’ and, through particular Welsh phrases and idioms, a distinctive ‘Welsh Dahl’. The translated work therefore embodies Wales’s two literary languages and the nation’s hybrid identities **\[3.1e\]**; 

-  Dahl’s work promotes the marginalised and underprivileged through ironic commentary on his anglocentric social and cultural allegiances **\[3.1a**, **3.1b**, **3.1c 3.1d**, **3.1e\]**. 

 Walford Davies’s decision to include holistic analysis of Dahl’s fiction for children alongside his fiction for adults – categories hitherto analysed separately – invests Dahl’s output for children with a new status and with new meanings. Cardiff research on place\-based readings of the children’s fiction \(such as *Matilda, The BFG,* and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* **\[3.1b**, **3.1d\]**\) confirm the importance of Wales in Dahl’s work and his championing of the underprivileged by identifying the following: 

-  Linguistic innovations forged by Welsh environments and experiences. For example, the hybrid English of *The BFG* can be seen to be derived from Wenglish, a new form of primarily spoken language that emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from a fusion of South Wales Welsh and various forms of English **\[3.1d\]**; 

-  Welsh markers in the texts – for example, the ways in which Dahl transforms a real\-life, pseudo\-parental relationship with his family’s Welsh gardener \(a former miner in the industrial Welsh valleys\) into a variety of fictional forms across his work for children **\[3.1c\]**; 

-  How Welsh\-language translations of Dahl’s fiction for children make Dahl ‘not quite himself’ – a voice both foreign and familiar, resisted and naturalised **\[3.1e\]**; 

-  Dahl’s resistance to ‘cultural institutionalisation’ and ‘assimilation’ by dominant cultures, which underpins his championing of the disempowered and vulnerable throughout the fiction for children **\[3.1a**, **3.1c**, **3.1d\]**; 

-  Dahl’s complex acts of resistance and his refusal to be *fully* assimilated into the dominant \(English\) culture – articulated for example through the imperfect absorption of the BFG into the Establishment ending of Dahl’s novel **\[3.1d\]**. 

 Reviewer Jeni Williams \(in *Gwales*\) described the collection as *“\[A\] complete revelation . . . Each of these essays changed my reading . . . I gained an enhanced understanding of the overarching significance of cross\-class and cross\-cultural relationships in \[Dahl’s\] work”*. 

 In summary, the research undertaken from 2013 and published in the 2016 collection provided new interpretations of Dahl as a Welsh writer and highlighted the representation of marginalised Welsh groups and communities in his work for both adults and children. Walford Davies, as editor of the collection, used this expertise in his role as Chair of Literature Wales. The insights into Dahl’s work as an inclusive author who privileged marginalised communities transformed Literature Wales’s strategy and practice, as described below.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words \- 1600\) 

 Literature Wales’s \(LW\) mission is to increase the accessibility and impact of imaginative writing; provide early\-career writers with opportunities to hone and diversify their skills; and strengthen the range, reach and reputation of Welsh writers and writing. Cardiff research on Roald Dahl **\[3.1\]** was used to shape the delivery model and activities of LW, leading to engagement with more diverse audiences and marginalised groups. Walford Davies’s expertise on Roald Dahl – in particular, his identification of the author’s Wales\-based inclusive social vision – shaped and continues to shape the priorities and decisions of LW, informed by his period as Chair between 2012 and 2018. Cardiff research influenced LW in three key phases: 

-  Changing the ethos and strategic approach of LW \(2013–2016\); 

-  Implementing the new strategy during the Roald Dahl centenary \(2016\); 

-  Embedding the strategic changes in LW’s business as usual \(2016 onwards\). 

 **4.1 Changing the delivery model at Literature Wales** 

 The research findings relating to Welsh identity and themes of inclusivity in *Roald Dahl: Wales of the Unexpected* **\[3.1\]** were central to a change in LW’s delivery model. Lleucu Siencyn, LW’s CEO, confirmed that prior to 2013, the organisation had not proactively or purposefully engaged with disenfranchised and marginalised groups. Activities were “ *crafted for a largely privileged market*” and “ *the location and cost of these activities were beyond the means of many individuals and communities in Wales*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 Elinor Robinson, former Deputy CEO of LW, stated that the Cardiff research “ *set out to ‘devolve’ Roald Dahl in various Welsh contexts, break down barriers between the work for children and the writing for adults, and reveal how Dahl’s imagination was formed by Welsh communities, places and class experiences. This prompted a change in our ethos increasingly towards artist\- and participant\-led activity, with a bottom\-up rather than a top\-down approach to planning, development and delivery*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 The way Cardiff research shaped LW’s activities can be seen in the company’s 2013–16 Business Plan **\[5.2\]**. The new, more inclusive outreach model drew on the research themes outlined above to include the following **\[5.1**, **5.2\]**: 

-  *a 'devolved’ Dahl, formed by specific communities, places and class experiences:* 

  -  taking literature to new audiences in unexpected locations; 

  -  seeking new partners to enhance LW’s reach and diversify its audience; 

  -  placing literature at the heart of the wellbeing, literacy, employment and skills agendas through work with partners in non\-arts sectors; 

-  *breaking down barriers between writing for children and for adults:* 

  -  encouraging children and young people to raise their voices and tell their stories, using the new Young People’s Laureate and Bardd Plant Cymru \(Wales’s Children’s Poet\). LW’s CEO notes that *“at the time, very little academic research on children’s literature was published in Wales; Damian’s book demonstrated how many forms of writing could be deemed ‘literature’; this directly informed LW’s programming in this area*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 Describing this move to more inclusive activities as “ *a once\-in\-a\-generation, radical repositioning*”, LW’s Deputy CEO stated that it “ *was crucial in bringing LW into the 21<sup>st</sup>\-century public arts\-funding climate . . . Without it, LW would almost certainly have found its role and function increasingly difficult to justify*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 The new model allowed the organisation to increase the cultural participation of “ *some of the most vulnerable people and communities in Wales, including young carers, prisoners and LGBTQ\+ individuals living in rural locations, knowing that they would benefit most from the many personal, socio\-economic and cultural outcomes literary participation can engender \(e.g. increased employability, resilience to mental illness and empathetic ability\)”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Implementing the delivery model through the 2016 Roald Dahl Centenary in Wales** 

 LW identified the 2016 Roald Dahl centenary as a unique opportunity to test the viability of their new activities and approach. The organisation \(with the Wales Millennium Centre and the Roald Dahl Estate\) used the key themes identified by the Cardiff research **\[3.1\]** in the bid to secure £100,000 of Welsh Government Major Events Funding to coordinate a year\-long outreach programme – *Invent Your Event*. The programme, which ran January–December 2016 as part of the ‘Roald Dahl 100’ activities, aimed to engage the whole of Wales in reading and multi\-genre creative writing activity. It also provided funding for which communities and organisations could bid to create their own events **\[5.3\]**. 

 The research findings on Dahl’s Welsh identity were central to securing Welsh Government support for *Invent Your Event.* LW had previously encountered opinions of Dahl among decision makers as “ *not really Welsh*” **\[5.1\]**. LW’s CEO confirmed, however, that Cardiff’s analysis of “ *the ways in which \[Dahl’s\] work for children and adults is informed in unmistakable ways by Welsh places, people and experiences strengthened LW’s lobbying*” **\[5.1\]**. The importance of Cardiff’s research insights into the seminal place of Wales in Dahl’s imagination was clear when the Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Infrastructure and Skills publicly announced the intention to “ *bring Dahl back to Wales*”. 

 This phrase, which was part of Walford\-Davies’s initial proposal for his collection, and which figures prominently in the final introduction **\[3.1\]**, was repeated by LW throughout negotiations with Welsh Government and underpinned the planning of the year\-long programme of celebrations **\[5.3**, **5.1\]**. LW’s shift to a more participatory, facilitatory and devolved approach was also trialled through the event. Branwen Llewellyn, LW’s Communications Manager, stated: “ *The ethos, breadth and reach of Invent your Event were directly influenced by Damian’s research, which revealed how Dahl had been formed by Welsh communities, cultures and places and which returned Dahl ‘home’ to Wales*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 *Invent Your Event* engaged with more than 43,000 people through 183 individual events, workshops and projects run across Wales by community groups with support from LW **\[5.4\]**. For example: 

-  **Daubscribblish Doodlesagas: These** workshops with prisoners in Parc Prison, Bridgend won an Arts & Business Award in 2017 for engaging prisoners and their families in performance, creative writing and visual arts. Participants noted the benefits for their children, and their enjoyment of the event.  **\[5.4**, p.4 **\]**; 

-  Clowns and Twits: Enabled young adults with learning disabilities in Monmouthshire to bring Dahl’s work to life through physical movement and the art of clowning **\[5.4**, p.14 **\]**; 

-  Majoricalistic Mischief March: Families in ‘Communities First’ areas \(some of the most deprived areas of Wales\) worked with poet Sophie McKeand and artist Rhi Moxon to explore their surroundings using Dahl’s imagination as inspiration **\[5.4**, p.13 **\]**. 

 Feedback from children, young people and adults showed that taking part in the events led to “ *improvements in confidence, communication, group activity, literacy, creativity and problem solving*” **\[5.4**, p.16 **\]**. For example: “ *The writing took me out of myself and helped me write my thoughts*” \(participant supported by mental health practitioner\); and “ *Really enjoyed the experience, \[which\] gave my son an opportunity to see things that he normally wouldn’t see. It has been fantastic*” \(Cardiff City Community Foundation Dads & Lads project\) **\[5.4**, p.18 **\]**. 

 LW’s broader, more diverse engagement model meant that more than ten times as many people took part in Dahl centenary events compared with events run by the organisation for the Dylan Thomas centenary in 2014. LW’s CEO stated that “ *The Dahl 100 celebrations were important for LW as they allowed us to put into practice, on a large scale, the new, inclusive mission and vision that Damian’s research had helped to form. Our programme of activity during the celebrations enabled us to connect with a far larger and broader demographic in new ways that gave the participants themselves creative agency*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.3 Embedding the delivery model in Literature Wales’s current and future strategy** 

 The model and activities put into practice during the Dahl centenary have been embedded in LW’s subsequent 2016–19 and 2019–23 strategies. Inclusivity has been further enhanced by supporting groups and communities to develop local literature programmes and events, thereby leaving knowledge and skills as a practical legacy alongside a creative one **\[5.5\]**. One new example is the Literature & Wellbeing Funding Scheme, which funds writers to devise and deliver literary activity in their communities. In 2017/18, the project supported nine writers in English and Welsh to run 48 creative sessions with LGBTQ\+ groups, prisoners, homeless people, people in a palliative care unit and older people aged 60\+ based in seven communities across Wales. Participants produced spoken word videos, pamphlets, showcase performances and individual creative pieces **\[5.1\]**. 

 The success of the Dahl centenary proved that LW’s new delivery model generated substantive outcomes for participants and supported the organisation’s new way of thinking. Walford Davies stepped down as Chair in 2018, but the organisation continues to build on the key themes revealed by Cardiff researchers. LW’s Communications Manager states that “ *LW confidently embedded a more inclusive approach and an ongoing commitment to providing creative writing and reading experiences for children and young people from Wales – as now outlined in our Strategic Plan, 2019–23”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 LW’s remit now includes a focus on “ *inspiring some of our most marginalised individuals and communities through active participation in literature*”, including individuals on low incomes, people with disabilities or long\-term illness, and BAME participants **\[5.6\]**. A further focus directly traceable to the Cardiff research is on the quality and reach of children’s literature in both English and Welsh. Examples of new activities include: 

-  a new Children’s Literature Category for LW’s flagship *Wales Book of the Year* *Award* in 2020, and LW’s commitment to improving the quality and sales of literature for children – particularly in Welsh – through partnership with the Welsh Books Council, S4C \(the national Welsh\-language channel\) and the Welsh Joint Education Committee; 

-  a ‘Writers on Tour’ scheme to enable more targeted interaction between children/young people and established writers; 

-  the introduction of a Children’s Laureate Wales position. 

 The former Deputy CEO of LW stated: “ *Such initiatives respond directly to the enhanced status of children’s writing claimed by Damian in his research . . . they demonstrate our commitment to delivering tangible wellbeing outcomes for people who have not previously accessed literary experience. They therefore enable us quantitatively and qualitatively to justify continued taxpayer support. This is important for the people of Wales and our new audiences because it releases and accelerates the power of literature to improve lives*” **\[5.1\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Immigration is a perennially contentious issue in most relatively high\-income countries. This impact case study relates to tussles over immigration policy in the context of debates about constitutional change in Scotland and the UK. This issue is important because population growth in Scotland has specifically been identified as a key contributor to, and consequence of, a more vibrant society and a more dynamic economy. This research examined Scotland’s migration ‘needs’ and the extent to which policy could potentially better respond to them. Our research demonstrates that Scotland faces demographic challenges that are distinct to those in the rest of the UK. As such it argues that a ‘Scottish’ migration policy is merited. 

 The research has shaped and **substantiated the policies and policy stance of policymakers and other stakeholders** with regards to immigration policy and other migration\-related issues. It has formed a distinctive and significant part of the evidence base that has been used to support claims for the devolution of immigration policy by institutions such as The Scottish Government, the Migration Advisory Committee and the Convention Of Scottish Local Authorities. Related to this, our research has **influenced political debates around immigration policy** towards labour and international student migration \(in the Scottish Parliament and the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee\) and has **informed citizen understanding of issues relating to migration and Scottish constitutional change** through our extensive public knowledge exchange activities.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The chief focus of this body of research has been to **critically assess the highly policy relevant issue of migration and immigration policy in Scotland in the context of constitutional change**. Much of the work was funded through the ESRC Future of the UK and Scotland programme, an extensive suite of research which examined various economic and political aspects of constitutional change and their implications for the future of the UK and Scotland. Our research was notable in that it was one of the few studies that consistently examined these issues through a migration and demography lens. The research was mainly carried out in the run up to the September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, the Smith Commission which followed it \(to examine which further legislative powers should be devolved from the UK to Scottish Parliaments\) and reported in November 2014, and more recently debates about migration and immigration policy in Scotland in the context of Brexit \(between 2016 and 2020\). The research examined labour market \(R1, R2\) and international student aspects \(R3\) of international migration, analysed public opinion \(R4\) and local authority perspectives \(R5\) and modelled population changes in order to determine Scotland’s migration ‘needs’ and the extent to which policy could potentially respond to them \(R6\). 

 The key insights emerging from this body of research are that Scotland’s experience of and attitudes towards immigration are distinctive \(R4\) and that Scotland faces specific demographic challenges, which will have considerable economic implications \(R1, R2\). Specifically, due to modest fertility rates, Scotland is much more reliant on immigration for demographic stability and growth, there is somewhat less public hostility to immigration, and international students are more important to the financial sustainability of Scotland’s tertiary education sector \(R3\). The research contends that immigration policies that are specifically suited to Scotland’s needs are merited, and that there is \(qualified\) support for this amongst policymakers, practitioners and \(to an extent\) the public in Scotland \(R5\). Critically, the research demonstrates that this is feasible in practical terms and under various constitutional scenarios. The research also finds that these issues are ever more pressing in the context of Scotland’s demographic and economic vulnerabilities within a more restrictive post\-Brexit UK immigration policy \(R6\). The papers cited in section 3 below are representative of our larger body of work on these issues.

 **Section 4. Details of the impact** 

 Our research focus has primarily been on the immigration policies that are best suited to Scotland. Whilst control over immigration policy has largely been retained by the UK Government, the Scottish Government and key stakeholders in Scotland and the wider UK \(supported by our research\) have consistently argued for greater autonomy in this respect. Our research has shaped and **substantiated the specific policies and policy stance** of Scottish policymakers and a diverse range of stakeholders in Scotland and the rest of the UK with regards to migration issues. Related to this, our research has spearheaded wider **political debates around immigration policy** towards labour and international student migration **.** It has also informed **citizen understanding of issues relating to migration and constitutional change.** Our impact in each of these areas is detailed below. 

1.  <ins>Informing the public of Scottish immigration issues</ins> 

 We have widely promoted our research insights \(R2, R4, R5\) into the opportunities and challenges associated with a ‘Scottish’ immigration policy to a diverse audience. This includes the popular media  such as *BBC Sunday Politics* programme, *The Guardian* Live Chat; debates attended by the general public and journalists, including the Edinburgh Festival of Politics, David Hume Institute, Spring seminar The Politicians and Professionals series; and popular outputs orientated towards informing citizen understanding of social issues and democratic participation, including *The Conversation* \(readership: approximately 27,000,000\) and the *ESRC Society Today* magazine \(readership: approximately 17,000\). Our Centre for Population Change \(CPC\) Working and Briefing papers on these issues feature in the ‘top three’ most downloaded lists for the research centre since its inception in 2009 \(600,000 downloads for CPC outputs in this period, S1, p. 5\). Likewise, our invited chapter in the e\-book *Scotland’s Decision: 16 Questions to think about before the Referendum* was downloaded more than 100,000 times in the 6\-week period \(S1, p. 2\) leading up to the Scottish independence vote. 

1.  <ins>Enriching Scottish policies and policy stances on migration</ins> 

 Based on established and ongoing dialogues, as well as working with knowledge exchange professionals in the CPC and Future of the UK and Scotland programmes, we have been able to maximise the impact of our findings in the policy realm. Our research findings demonstrated that Scotland merits a distinct immigration policy. Illustration of how this could work in practice was discussed by Prof Findlay at his invited appearance at the House of Commons’ Scottish Affairs Committee on Demography of Scotland and the Implications of Devolution in 2016 \(S2\). His recommendations were cited in the Final Report of the UK Parliamentary Inquiry, in which the Committee called on the UK and Scottish Governments to continue to work together to tackle Scotland's demographic challenges \(S2\). Our research \(R1, R2, R4, R6\) has been cited in numerous migration policy reports by and for the Scottish Government \(S3\). Accordingly, the Scottish Government has confirmed that: *“such evidence and insight has helped inform the Scottish Government’s thinking and development of its policy positions on and how best to meet Scotland’s migration needs.”* \(S4\) 

 Our assertation that Scotland is ‘different’ from other parts of the UK with regards to migration has been widely used to make the political case for supporting the reintroduction of the post\-work study visa for international students in Scotland. It was directly quoted by Jayne Baxter, MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, and James Dornan, MSP Glasgow Cathcart, to support these calls in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on the Post\-Study Work Visa \(PSWV\) on 24<sup>th</sup> March 2015. Baxter said, “ *In Scotland, we have a different way of looking at immigration. David McCollum from the University of St Andrews said:* ‘ *The character of immigration in Scotland is distinctive in terms of both the nature of immigration flows and social attitudes to immigration ... Scotland is dependent on migration for demographic stability and growth to a greater extent than the other constituent countries of the UK.’* *\[So\] The UK Government’s policy is coming at much too high a cost across the whole of the UK and has an even worse effect in Scotland”* \(S5, pp. 77\-78\). 

 Calls for the reintroduction of the PSWV \(since reinstated in the form of the new Graduate Immigration Route\), based on and citing our research \(R3\), have since been consistently echoed by a broad coalition of research users. These diverse beneficiaries include learned societies such as The Royal Society of Edinburgh, Universities UK, the Scottish Government, the National Union of Students and the Migration Advisory Committee. For example, the Royal Society of Edinburgh said *“your research\-based contributions have helped to inform and strengthen our responses to the Migration Advisory Committee’s \(MAC\) calls for evidence, including on the international impacts on international students in the UK \(January 2019\) and on a points\-based immigration system and salary threshold \(November 2019\).”* \(S6\) 

1.  <ins>Providing evidence for policy makers and practitioners on migration</ins> 

 Enabled by our reputation as leading ‘go to’ experts in Scotland on migration, our team has had frequent collaborations with policy stakeholders aimed at directly communicating the practical lessons and implications of our research. For example, in May 2017 Prof. Findlay and Dr McCollum were amongst a small group of invited experts to an all\-day Scottish Government \- Europa Institute roundtable event on “Meeting Scotland’s Immigration Needs in the Context of Brexit”. The meeting directly informed the Scottish Governments position on EU migrants and free movement post\-Brexit \(S4\). We have worked closely with the COSLA Strategic Migration Partnership concerning our research findings and their implications, which they have used to help local authorities prepare for and respond to migration *: “Our collaborative work \[with St Andrews\] has provided local authorities with a better understanding of migration in their local areas, which has influenced integration policy and service provision.”* \(Chief Officer of the COSLA Migration, Population and Diversity Team\) \(S7\). 

 One of these lessons concerned the impact on international students in the UK and our research has been utilised in a wide range of policy arenas addressing this issue. It directly informed the MAC’s 2018 recommendations to the UK Government with regards its policy on international students \(S8, p. 37\). Our work was also quoted in Call for Evidence submissions to this MAC report from the Greater London Authority \(S8, pp. 283 & 286\) and the Royal Society of Edinburgh \(S8, pp. 498 & 506\) to warn that the UK risks becoming less competitive in the market for international students due to restrictive immigration policy and rhetoric. Our research is also used in the 2014 MAC report on Migrants in Low Skilled Work to evidence the role of migration and recruitment agencies in the functioning of the low\-wage economy, with the MAC calling for enhanced regulation of recruitment practices in these sectors based on our findings \(S8 pp.118, 136, 138, 142 & 166\). These contributions are significant because the MAC is the Public Body that is sponsored by the Home Office to directly advise the UK Government on immigration policy. Our work was also cited in the Unite 2015 submission to the Scottish Government’s consultation on the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board, which is a Public Body which sets minimum standards of pay and conditions in the sector, including for \(often seasonal\) migrant workers. This and other evidence were successfully used to argue for the preservation of this Board: “ *The evidence in favour of retaining the Scottish Agriculture Wages Board is compelling*” \(Rural Affairs Secretary, December 2015, S9\). 

 


Prof. Kulu has served on the Scottish Government’s influential 5\-member Expert Advisory Group on Migration and Population since its inception in 2018. It directly advises the Scottish Government on immigration policy and their evidence has helped them to argue that the UK’s proposed immigration policy post\-Brexit poses specific demographic and economic risks to Scotland \(S4\). For example, the Scottish Government’s Public Finance and Migration Minister, Ben Macpherson, said: *“Evidence from our Expert Advisory Group on Population formed the basis of our February policy paper Migration Helping Scotland Prosper, which irrefutably shows that Scotland’s migration needs are distinct from the rest of the UK.”* \(S10\). This high\-profile policy paper details how a tailored migration policy would operate to meet Scotland's distinct demographic needs and effectively forms the basis of the Scottish Government’s immigration policy. It was showcased by the First Minister for Scotland at a launch event in Edinburgh on 27<sup>th</sup> January 2020 to widespread political, public and media attention \(S11\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest challenges of the modern era. The major driver of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is exposure to antibiotics. Therefore, reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is one of the main interventions needed to address the problem of resistance. Research undertaken in the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge identified a previously unknown MRSA \( *mecC*\) and generated epidemiological evidence of the burden of livestock\-associated MRSA in the UK and internationally. The findings informed policy makers in the UK and Europe, resulting in policies to improve antibiotic stewardship. This contributed to a 45% reduction in antibiotic use in agriculture in the UK, with a 90% reduction in the use of third\- and fourth\-generation cephalosporins, the antibiotic class to which the *mecC* variant of MRSA is most resistant. UK sampling in 2017, 2018 and 2019 found no occurrence of the resistant strains *mecC* and *mecA* in food\-producing animals.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A substantial body of research undertaken in the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge has identified a previously unknown MRSA and generated epidemiological evidence of the burden of livestock\-associated MRSA in the UK. 

 **Discovery of **mecC** MRSA** 

 In 2012, Holmes and Maskell published their discovery of *mecC* MRSA, a novel variant of methicillin\-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* \(MRSA\) found in both livestock and people \(R1\). The *mecC* MRSA found in people was found in cases of clinical disease, ranging from skin and soft tissue infections, to bacteraemia and in asymptomatic carriers. Their findings represented a previously unidentified reservoir of infection, which had impact on our understanding of the epidemiology of MRSA and its management \( *REF 2014*\). Molecular studies of the PBP2a protein product of *mecC* identified a differential resistance to cephalosporins compared to other beta\-lactam antibiotics \(R2\). Cephalosporin antibiotics, including third\-generation cephalosporins, are commonly used in the treatment of bovine mastitis and this use is likely to be selecting for *mecC* MRSA. 

 **Measuring the levels of **mecC** MRSA in UK livestock and human populations** 

 Between 2011 and 2012, Holmes led formal epidemiological studies to determine the farm\-level prevalence and the human prevalence of *mecC* MRSA in the UK. The farm level prevalence study found that *mecC* MRSA was present in the bulk milk from 10 of 465 dairy farms sampled in England and Wales, i.e. 2.15% \(R3\). With 8,310 dairy producers in the UK \(source: AHDB 2020\) this translates to approximately 178 farms with *mecC* MRSA. A study of human MRSA isolates from hospitals revealed that *mecC* MRSA accounted for 1 in 200 of all MRSA, a small but significant proportion, arising from strains that are believed to have originated from farms \(R4\). 

 **Detection of livestock\-associated **\(mecA\)** MRSA in dairy milk** 

 Most of the MRSA leading to human disease is caused by *mecA* MRSA. Prior to Holmes’ investigations it was believed that UK livestock were almost entirely free of this type of MRSA\*, livestock\-associated MRSA \(LA\-MRSA also known as ST398 MRSA\), which has been a problem in continental Europe. A study undertaken on British dairy farms identified the presence of LA\-MRSA in five of the farms surveyed \(R5\). Although pasteurisation of milk helps to reduce levels of ST398 MRSA entering the food chain, previous studies have shown that individuals with regular contact with infected livestock are likely to have a higher risk of colonisation or infection with LA\-MRSA compared to the general population. 

 **Detection of livestock\-associated **\(mecA\)** MRSA in pork meat** 

 In 2015 Holmes undertook a study of retail meat from supermarkets in six different regions of the UK. Over 100 pre\-packaged fresh meat products, labelled as being of UK farm origin were analysed, and three pork products were found to contain isolates of ST398 LA MRSA with phylogenetic analysis indicating widespread infection within the UK pig herd \(R6\). 

 These formal epidemiological studies have provided baseline prevalence estimates of MRSA that have been used to identify changes in these rates. This body of work has provided objective information about the characteristics and the distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria, of human medical importance, in livestock, and led to improved antibiotic stewardship in animal farming. 

 *\*There are 3 epidemiological patterns of conventional \(mecA\) MRSA. Hospital\-acquired \(HA\-MRSA\), Community\-acquired \(CA\-MRSA\) and Livestock\-associated \(LA\-MRSA\)*

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Antimicrobial resistance is a global human and animal health concern. The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance commissioned by the UK Prime Minister, led by Jim O’Neill, reported in 2016 that approximately 9.3 million additional human deaths a year will be attributable to AMR by 2050 if nothing is done to address this problem, and identified agriculture as an area where intervention was required. 

 The research undertaken by Holmes and colleagues at the University of Cambridge has informed policy and contributed to improved antibiotic stewardship by a reduction of inappropriate use of antibiotics. This has led to a reduction in antibiotic use in livestock agriculture, and reductions in antibiotic resistance in bacteria. 

 **Raised public awareness and development of new legislation** 

 The discovery of *mecC* MRSA and the presence of LA\-MRSA in the UK pig herd was published in articles in national newspapers, leading to public interest and concern \[E1\]. This publicity led to the submission of a written question in the UK Parliament to the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by Kerry McCarthy MP \(Bristol NE\) on 7<sup>th</sup> October 2016 about the problem \(E2\); the minister responded that Defra were working with Public Health England to investigate the occurrence of LA\-MRSA in veterinarians and farm workers. 

 Holmes’ research was included in a motion discussed at a forum of European politicians, 19\-21 November 2015, which contributed to the development of new legislation on the use of antibiotics in farming \[E3\]. A former UK Member of the European Parliament \(MEP\), who was part of the Alliance and Democrats for Europe \(now Renew Europe\)  testifies to this: *“The research published by Holmes’ group between 2011 and 2015…informed our discussions prior to our 2015 congress… This work helped us develop our response to the issue that was documented in a motion that the ALDE Party then pursued in the European Parliament. As a result of the campaigning new regulations on veterinary medicines \(Regulation \(EU\) 2019/6\) and medicated feed \(Regulation \(EU\) 2019/4\) were passed by the European Parliament and Council in late 2018.”* The new legislation prohibits the prophylactic use of antibiotics other than in exceptional cases \(E4, page 6 \(schedule 44, page L 4/48\)\). As a farmer themselves, the former MEP commented that the resolution which was passed avoids undue bureaucracy and cost for farmers \[E3\]. 

 **Improved antibiotic stewardship** 

 Research from Holmes’ group has been part of a knowledge exchange relationship with the British Cattle Veterinary Association \(BCVA\) and British Veterinary Association \(BVA\) since 2011. An officer who has been Past President of both the BCVA and BVA states that Holmes’ research provided evidence that helped inform the BCVA’s position on antimicrobial use in cattle practice, which was published in 2016, and also work undertaken by the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture \(RUMA\) to reduce antibiotic use \(details below\). The BCVA now runs courses on prescribing practices to better support vets in decision\-making. He says that Holmes’ “active engagement with the profession…has led to improved antibiotic stewardship, creating a positive impact on the farming sector” \[E5\]. 

 Prior to the systematic survey of UK retail pork published by Holmes in 2015 \(R6\) there was only a single case report of ST398 LA\-MRSA from Northern Ireland, and the UK pig herd was believed to be free from this MRSA strain. Following the work, Holmes was a named individual contributor to the Food Standards Agency report “Risk Assessment on Methicillin\-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus \(MRSA\), with a focus on Livestock\-associated MRSA, in the UK Food Chain”, published in February 2017 \[E6\], which also references earlier research from the University of Cambridge \(\(R5\) cited in points 106/107, page 30/31\). This assessment states the high level of uncertainty around the role of agricultural transmission in infection sources and routes of transmission \[E6, page 50\]. 

 In 2018, Holmes contributed to a workshop organised by the Pig Health and Welfare Council \(PHWC\) and the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board \(AHDB\) which represents farmers, growers and others in the supply chain and have also worked directly with pig companies. He presented his research findings and suggested changes to practice with other experts in the field, and with key implementation stakeholders, i.e. those involved in pig farming and the food supply chain \[E7\]. Subsequently, in September 2018, the PHWC Antimicrobial Usage subgroup published new guidelines on the responsible use of antibiotics on pig farms. These clearly state that antibiotics should only be used on prescription, should only be used if/until alternative approaches are implemented, and that numbers of pigs receiving antibiotics should be kept to a minimum \[E8\]. As a key organisation leading professional practice in the sector, this guidance hold considerable influence for stakeholders and has led to reductions in antibiotic usage, detailed below. 

 **Reduction in antibiotic use in livestock in the UK** 

 The heightened awareness of antibiotic\-resistant bacteria in animals farmed for food, along with the changes in policy and guidance described above have had significant impact on the use of antibiotics in pig and cattle farming. Official figures published by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate \(VMD, an executive agency of Defra\) on 18 November 2020 show that from 2014 to 2019, the amount of antibiotics sold for use in food\-producing animal species was reduced by 45%. The largest single annual reduction, of 30% was seen between 2015 and 2016, which is after the publication of Holmes’ group’s paper on the detection of MRSA in pork \(R6\) \[E9, page 13\]. The VMD report also documents a reduction in use of all antibiotics in pigs of 60% from 2015 to 2019 \[E9, page 32\]. 

 These data are from the VMD UK Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance and Sales Surveillance Report \(UK\-VARSS\) 2019, which also cites Holmes’ research into MRSA in bovine populations \[E9, \(1\) cited on page 32\]. Following the stakeholder engagement described above, Holmes’ research provided evidence that helped inform the British Cattle Veterinary Association \(BCVA\)'s position paper on antimicrobial use in cattle practice \[E5\], published in December 2016. This recommended reducing the overall amount of antibiotics used in cattle practice, with minimal use of third\- and fourth\-generation cephalosporins \(the antibiotic class to which *mecC* MRSA is most resistant\), and that that prophylactic use of antibiotics is to be avoided wherever possible \[E10\]. Holmes’ research also informed the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture \(RUMA\) Alliance Targets Task Force Report 2017, which set focus areas for the sector in order to target reduction of antibiotic usage, the first of these being overall reduction in the use of highest priority critically important antibiotics \[E11, pages 14\-17, involvement confirmed by E5\]. 

 The effect of this influence on change in practice can be seen in the latest figures published in UK\-VARSS 2019, which shows that in dairy cows the use of third\- and fourth\-generation cephalosporins, was reduced by 90% \[E9, page 42\]. 

 **Reduction in prevalence of antibiotic resistance** 

 Following the use of Holmes’ research to inform the changes in recommended practice as described above, reduction in levels of antibiotic resistance in livestock pathogens has already been observed. The data in UK\-VARSS 2019 on AMR in bovine *S. aureus* isolates reports that no *mecC* or *mecA* MRSA were found in 2017, 2018 or 2019; similarly, no LA\-MRSA was found in food\-producing animals in England, Scotland and Wales in 2019, with only four occurrences in Northern Ireland \[E9, pages 64 and 72\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The World Health Organization \(WHO\) has issued targets to eliminate Hepatitis C Virus \(HCV\) by 2030 and Queen Mary’s Prof. Foster is the national clinical lead for achieving these. Foster’s work has revealed the aggressive nature of genotype 3 HCV, previously thought of as being ‘easy to cure’. To address this, he led bespoke treatment trials that successfully defined optimal and effective regimes and have helped shape both national and international guidelines on a\) HCV treatment and b\) which subgroups to prioritise in HCV screening. In England, this led to an Expanded Access Programme, followed by general access, with Foster as national clinical lead. The policy is the largest ever single NHS investment in specialist services. The programme has mobilised 22 Operational Delivery Networks and successfully treated over 50,000 patients. The Public Health England HCV annual report for 2020 indicates a 20% and 44% fall in deaths and transplant listings for HCV respectively, and a 95% success rate in ‘curing’ patients of the virus. Foster’s team has also developed a screening test for novel mutations that reduce the effectiveness of antiviral treatments, further improving HCV outcomes. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Hepatitis C virus \(HCV\) is one of the most common forms of viral hepatitis in the UK, and can cause liver scarring \(cirrhosis\) and failure. It has developed genetic mutations — categorised as different genotypes — over time, leading to several different manifestations of the infection. These genotypes have varying rates of prevalence in different populations, and not all respond well to treatment. ‘Genotype 3’ comprises of 22\-30% of all HCV, and therefore is the second commonest genotype, and is even more prevalent in England and South Central Asia, at 47% and 71.6% respectively. 

 Prof. Foster’s work on the natural history and prevalence of genotype 3 HCV has shown that: 

##  Immigrants, not previously considered a high\-risk group for this virus, have a high prevalence of infection and cirrhosis 

1.  *Novel viral mutations, which reduce the effectiveness of antiviral treatments, can be identified through screening* \[3.1\]. Foster’s team, which included the PhD students Michelle Cheung and Peter Wing, has developed a test for mutations to the variant and now show that the genotype 3 mutation is associated with cellular changes associated with malignancy. This work led to a GBP2,700,000 Wellcome Trust grant to study, among other areas, this variant \[EQR.1\]. 

1.  *Genotype 3 is a more aggressive strain than previously thought*. Prior to Foster’s research, genotype 3 infection was regarded as ‘easy to cure’. In 2013, therapy for HCV infection involved injectable ‘interferon’ and tablets with a high incidence of side effects. The team found that genotype 3 HCV and cirrhosis responded poorly to standard HCV interferon\-based treatments, highlighting the need for genotype\-specific HCV trials. 

 As a result of these findings, biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc., who hold the licence for the latest HCV treatment sofosbuvir, approached Foster to lead an exploratory UK\-based study into overcoming the reduced response to the treatment seen in genotype 3 HCV. This study identified possible combinations of treatments alongside sofosbuvir that could improve treatment response \[3.2\]. Foster then led an international phase 3 trial in genotype 3 HCV with a newly developed combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasivir, which achieved a far greater response rate in patients \[3.3\]. Foster also led trials for the alternative therapeutic glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, which achieved a high response rate in patients with genotype 3 HCV without cirrhosis \[3.4, 3.5\]. 

 Led by Foster, the English Expanded Access Programme achieved the first real\-world confirmation that these treatments are effective and can improve life expectancy in patients with severe \(decompensated\) cirrhosis. Data for this programme were collected from the Medical Research Foundation \(MRF\)\-funded HCV Research UK registry and biobank \[EQR.2, 3.6\]. Eligible patients were those at significant risk of death or irreversible damage from HCV infection within 12 months, irrespective of genotype. As a result, Foster’s research has not only identified the most effective regimes for treatment of genotype 3 HCV, but also forms the basis of current treatment recommendations globally.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 WHO has issued targets to eliminate HCV by 2030. Queen Mary’s Prof. Foster is the national clinical lead for achieving these targets. Foster and his team at Queen Mary have led successful clinical trials to define optimal and effective treatment regimes for HCV, and developed a screening test to identify novel mutations that reduce the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. Foster’s work has improved HCV treatment for patients, influenced national and international guidelines for clinical practice, informed NHS commissioning and investment, and helped make HCV treatment available and cost\-effective throughout the NHS, with the overall aim of eliminating the disease in England. 

#  Improving HCV treatment for tens of thousands of patients — and targeting elimination 

 Foster is the national clinical lead for NHS England’s HCV policy, which aims to eliminate HCV and has been a success as evidenced in 2020 with over 50,000 patients treated, a 20% fall in the number of deaths from HCV\-related disease, a 44% reduction in the number of liver transplants, and a 95% success rate in ‘curing’ people of the virus \[5.1\]. 

 NHS England’s HCV elimination policy has achieved… 



#  Influencing national and international clinical guidelines for HCV 

##  For management of genotype 3 HCV 

 Foster designed and led the UK\-centred BOSON trial \[3.2\], which informed international guidelines — such as those of India and Iran in 2016 \[5.2, 5.3\] — for the management of difficult\-to\-cure genotype 3 HCV. Foster also led the international phase 3 trial in this genotype with the newly developed treatment combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir \[3.3\], which was approved by the European and American Associations for the Study of the Liver in 2016 and 2018 respectively \[5.4, 5.5\]. It was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in 2017 \[5.6\]. Foster also led the successful trials for the alternative therapeutic glecaprevir/pibrentasvir; his work \[3.5\] was used in the clinical and economic assessment of the combined therapy and was approved by NICE in 2018 \[5.7\]. 

##  For primary care screening programs 

 Foster’s team has influenced NICE guidelines on who to test for HCV; these now include screening migrants from high\-risk countries in primary care settings \[5.8\], with other NHS initiatives including screening of South Asian subgroups. 

#  Informing NHS commissioning policy and guiding annual investment 

 In 2014, Foster co\-authored a UK consensus statement as a representative of the British Association for Study of the Liver; this informed NHS England’s commissioning policy \[5.9\] and led to the largest ever single NHS investment in specialist services. Sponsored by the Scottish government, the statement represented the opinions of the British Society of Gastroenterology Liver Committee, British Association for the Study of Liver, Scottish Society of Gastroenterology, Scottish Viral Hepatitis group, Scottish Viral Hepatitis Nurses group and British Viral Hepatitis group. NHS England’s HCV policy is based on NICE recommendations of patient prioritisation \[5.10\], and involves 22 Operational Delivery Networks. 

#  Making HCV medication accessible and cost\-effective through the NHS 

 To eliminate HCV in England, NHS England undertook a unique procurement tender in which pharmaceutical companies competed to provide medication and ‘case\-finding’ initiatives for patients with HCV. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said “It’s not often that the opportunity arises to completely eradicate a disease, but now the NHS is taking practical action to achieve exactly that *”* \[5.11\].  Foster helped develop the partnership between the pharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences Inc., and the Addiction Services Provider,  [ChangeGrowLive](https://www.changegrowlive.org/), as clinical expert. The partnership was awarded the Health Service Journal’s ‘Best Pharmaceutical Partnership with the NHS’ award in 2019 \(HSJ monthly unique users: 168,000\) \[5.12\], which celebrates the most effective private or third\-sector partnerships with the NHS that bring benefit to patients and NHS organisations. According to Sir Stevens, “the NHS’s sophisticated and unashamedly rigorous negotiation on behalf of both patients and taxpayers means we’ve now been able to strike affordable deals with our life sciences partners to save many more lives and meaningfully cut health inequalities” \[5.11\]. Foster also helped facilitate the partnership between NHS England, the three major pharmaceutical companies Gilead, MSD and AbbVie, and The Hepatitis C Trust, of which he was formerly a trustee. The addition of the Hepatitis C Trust is critical to eliminating the disease nationally due to its network of trained peer volunteers, who help local treatment groups identify and engage with high risk individuals \[5.13\]. 

 The deal offered a unique opportunity for all stakeholders — patient organisations, pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, prison healthcare and drug misuse services — to work together to *“*reach the most marginalised and hardest\-to\-engage; we will ensure that no one is left behind and stop unnecessary deaths *,”* said Rachel Halford, chief executive of The Hepatitis C Trust \[5.11\]. She added, “the Hepatitis C Trust is delighted with this development. 69 per cent of people who have the virus are currently undiagnosed so the funding in the deal to help find those with hepatitis C and support them into treatment is groundbreaking *.*”

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr Clarke’s practice as research has pioneered interactive ways of experiencing history where it happened. The award\-winning collaboration with Historic Royal Palaces \(HRP\), *The Lost Palace,* impacted the public, museum professionals, and creative industry partners. It attracted over 20,000 visitors to Banqueting House, enriching their cultural experience and engagement with the history of Whitehall, London. The collaboration shaped HRP’s approach to interpretation, leading to the development of their new R&D Studio and new business opportunities. Creative technology collaborators have applied these innovations to other commercial projects, and the success of *The Lost Palace* has enabled them to promote and grow their business. It has influenced other international museums and heritage organisations to change their digital interpretation practices. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Through a series of practice as research enquiries, Dr Clarke has used site\-specific storytelling and creative technologies to explore relationships between place, history and memory. These projects have developed ongoing collaborations with creative industry partners, experimented with new forms of guided tours, and explored potential applications of theatre, binaural audio and location\-sensitive mobile devices in heritage contexts. 

##  Piloting location\-based storytelling 

 In 2010, Clarke worked with app developers Calvium to create *Give Me Back My Broken Night* **\[3.1\]**, a guided tour of the future of a place, using GPS devices and mobile projectors. In 2011, Tate Britain commissioned a *son et lumière* by Clarke’s company Uninvited Guests and sound designer Lewis Gibson as part of the *John Martin: Apocalypse* exhibition \(September 2011 \- January 2012\). This pioneering approach to interpretation used theatre, surround sound and projections mapped onto Martin’s *Last Judgement* **\[3.2\]** triptych to animate the paintings and ‘push at the boundaries of conventional gallery experience’ \(Martin Myrone, Tate curator, *Daily Telegraph*, 2011\). In their *Talking Objects* publication, The British Museum used it as an example of ‘successful collaboration’ and an inspiring approach to ‘animating museums’, ‘breathing new life into a collection, changing cultures and behaviours in relation to collections’. This led to *Memory of Theatre* \(2012\) **\[3.3\]** *,* Clarke’s REACT Heritage Sandbox project, a collaboration with Gibson, Calvium and Tom Morris, Artistic Director of Bristol Old Vic \(BOV\). A new oral history archive was created of audiences' memories of BOV, which were recorded binaurally and made publicly accessible in the theatre using an innovative indoor, location\-based app. Knowledge from these projects was brought together by Clarke in *The Good Neighbour* **\[3.4\]**, a theatrical guided tour of Lavender Hill and nearby streets \(Battersea Arts Centre, October \- November 2012\), which drew on local archives and documentary interviews. 

##  Pioneering immersive experiences in heritage buildings and sites 

 The partnerships Clarke developed led to collaborative work on a prototype for Historic Royal Palaces \(HRP, 2015\), chosen from among 90 proposals for production as a full visitor experience for Banqueting House, the last remaining building of Whitehall Palace. This commission addressed the problem of how to offer a tour of historic buildings that no longer exist, as the palace burnt down in 1698. It was also an experiment into how rich a digital experience can be without the use of screens, and whether multi\-sensory technology, including haptics, could enable felt connections with the past. The research output, *The Lost Palace* \(2016\-17\) **\[3.5\]**, which Clarke wrote, directed and co\-designed, was a new visitor experience commissioned by HRP, developed in collaboration with Calvium, Gibson and theatre producers Fuel, along with designers Chomko & Rosier and multimedia design studio Limbic Cinema. 

 The conceptual and technical approaches were informed by learning from the pilot projects outlined above. Clarke dramatised historic events, based on archival documents, which were delivered in situ on the streets of Whitehall, using theatre and emerging technologies to enable visitors to experience history where it happened. The method developed employed binaural recording techniques to reproduce the acoustics of the absent buildings and produce a 3D, augmented audio experience, such that visitors were immersed in the historic scenes. In terms of technical development, Clarke co\-conceived a bespoke, handheld, wooden device, with no screen or buttons, which worked like a “historical surveillance device”, and co\-designed a range of novel interactions, including gestural triggers and haptic responses, which gave the users roles in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>\-century narratives.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Through the creation of a new visitor experience, *The Lost Palace* **\[3.5\]**, Dr Clarke’s research has produced cultural and economic impacts, benefitting museum professionals, the public, and digital creatives. 

##  Changing Historic Royal Palaces’ approach to immersive technology and visitor engagement 

 Museums and heritage sites have often struggled to create engaging digital content. By using theatre and innovative technologies, Clarke enabled Historic Royal Palaces \(HRP\) to create an immersive experience for visitors to engage with history where it happened. HRP ‘learnt vast amounts from *The Lost Palace* that will be able to inform how Banqueting House is developed as a visitor attraction and how we can tell the story of this palace that’s no longer there’ **\[5.1\]**. It transformed their interpretation strategy at Banqueting House, understanding of the potential of technology, and creative partnerships. 

 *The Lost Palace* ran every 20 minutes for 16 weeks across summer 2016 and 2017, for audiences of around 20, attracting over 20,000 visitors to Banqueting House, some of whom had not visited HRP before. 37% of *The Lost Palace* visitors were between the ages of 25\-34, which is rare for a heritage attraction **\[5.4\]**. A family\-friendly version with stories and interactions specially designed for 7\-14\-year\-olds resulted in high engagement from young audiences, plus there were out\-of\-hours ‘lates’ with content specifically targeted at adults. Furthermore, HRP benefitted economically from additional ticket sales of GBP12 for the adult tour and GBP7 for children. 

 Following successful collaboration, prototyping and production of *The Lost Palace*, HRP established a new R&D Studio in late 2016, which incorporated lessons from Clarke’s research and the iterative, user\-centred design process \( [https://www.hrp.org.uk/research\-and\-development\-studio/\#gs.jinpej](https://www.hrp.org.uk/research-and-development-studio/)\). This in\-house creative development studio provides opportunities for artists in residence to explore new forms of public engagement with heritage. It has led to commissions of performance, digital installations, and immersive storytelling at other HRP locations \(e.g. *The People’s Revolt* with East London Dance and Hofesh Shechter’s *East Wall: Storm the Tower*, Tower of London\). *Lost Palace* partners Chomko & Rosier subsequently took part in these residencies, developing two further multisensory visitor experiences in the form of permanent installations for Henry VIII’s Kitchens and Base Court at Hampton Court Palace \( [https://chomkorosier.com/kitchens.php](https://chomkorosier.com/kitchens.php); https://chomkorosier.com/base\-court.php\). 

 According to the Head of the R&D Studio at HRP, *The Lost Palace* was ‘innovative in its approach to collaborating with creative partners and shows a huge leap in the use of digital technologies within a heritage environment’ **\[5.1\]**. The founder of MuseumNext states ‘The result is a triumph and shows the benefits of both collaboration and investing in R&D. What could have been another unremarkable museum app \[was\] instead something truly memorable and immersive’. For him, it was ‘pioneering’, ‘one of the best executed digital experiences I’ve seen from a museum’, and ‘has a ton of lessons for those trying to make magic happen with digital in a heritage or cultural setting’ **\[5.2\]**. 

 The project significantly raised HRP’s and creative partners’ reputations in the area of digital heritage/interaction and led to international awards, including the IMAGINES Project of Influence award at The Best In Heritage awarded by ICOM \(International Council of Museums\) and Europa Nostra \(Dubrovnik 2018\). This recognises the multimedia/technology project judged to have made the best impact on global museum professionals and to have the ‘potential to produce change and advance professional practices by their power of inspiration’. *The Lost Palace* also received Best Achievement and Interactive and Games Awards at European Heritage in Motion \(2017\), and the Museums \+ Heritage award for Innovation \(2017\), the judges of which wrote, ‘a genuinely innovative project which successfully harnessed new technology to bring to life the history which surrounds us in a new multi\-sensory, tangible way’. It was also shortlisted for a 2017 IXDA award \(global network for interaction design\) **\[5.3\].** 

 *The Lost Palace* was critically acclaimed in professional museum and technology publications, and in the popular press. *Museums Journal* wrote that, ‘both the technology and the content are of high quality and, just as importantly, are used together effectively to bring the past to life. Buzzwords such as immersive, innovative and intuitive can be overused, but in this instance, they feel justified’. *BBC Click* described it as ‘a really thrilling experience... beautifully constructed & well put together... neither the theatre nor the tech unbalanced each other’ and *Time Out London* as ‘Funny, moving and fascinating, it’s a brilliantly created tour with plenty of smart surprises… more attractions should be creating experiences like this’. Mar Dixon, of Teens in Museums, the multinational CultureThemes and Twitter's Ask a Curator Day, said it was the ‘perfect marriage of storytelling and technology’. It ‘Brings history to life in an immersive way. Great for all ages. Even my teen loved it\!’ **\[5.5\].** 

##  Inspiring digital innovation in the wider museum and heritage sectors 

 *The Lost Palace* created a new approach to digital interpretation in historic buildings and museums, an approach that has been shared widely within the sector. It has been used as a point of reference in the field of museum interaction and digital heritage and led to invitations to present at professional conferences internationally over 2017\-2020: MuseumsNext, New York 2019 and Rotterdam 2017; MTI2017, Paris; Digital Design Weekend, V&A; REMIX Summit Sydney; Culture Technology Entrepreneurship, Oxford University; Digikult, Heritage Istanbul 2018; keynote at The Best in Heritage 2019, Dubrovnik; Exponatec, Cologne 2019; StoryFutures AHRC Creative Cluster Story Lab, National Gallery; National Lottery Heritage Funded Inspiration Day at Battersea Arts Centre; 5G and Smart Tourism Workshop, The Roman Baths, Bath. 

 The project’s method of recording dramatised accounts in immersive 3D has been taken up by New York’s Met Museum in the production of a binaural audio experience as part of *Visitors to Versailles* \(2018\). For the Managing Editor and Producer of the Met’s Digital Department, when researching a solution for creating a “you\-are\-here” audio experience, ‘the key turned in the lock when I attended a museum conference and learned about \[ *The Lost Palace*, a\] walking tour produced in London that mimicked the 3D sound we experience naturally \[by using\] binaural sound recordings’ **\[5.6\]**. *The Lost Palace* is cited as an exemplary ‘audio journey’, a ‘form of audio augmented reality’, in *Immersive Content Formats for Future Audiences*, a report produced for Digital Catapult, 2018, and is used as a case study in *Inspiring Creativity, Heritage & The Creative Industries*, a report on fruitful collaborations between creative industries and the heritage sector, produced for the Heritage Alliance, the biggest national coalition of heritage organisations. It is also the case study for the ‘Social Experiences’ theme in *Immersive Experiences in Museums, Galleries and Heritage Sites*, a discussion paper for the AHRC Policy and Evidence Centre, led by Nesta, 2019 **\[5.7\]**. 

##  Enhancing visitors’ experience, engagement with history, and connection to place 

 *The Lost Palace* enabled visitors to experience historical events in the exact locations where they happened in an accessible, multisensory way that engaged them emotionally with people and stories from Whitehall’s past. 93% of visitors agreed that ‘the experience was unique to others I’ve had at visitor attractions’, noting how different it felt to the simple museum audio guides they had previously tried. For 92% of those surveyed it ‘brought the history of this time and place to life’ and 90% agreed that it ‘made me feel more connected to the past’ **\[5.4\].** The Nesta discussion paper **\[5.7\]** argues that *The Lost Palace* shows ‘how powerful social interactions can be during immersive experiences’, which ‘can seed strong connections not only between people and place, but from person to person also’. Visitors said, I ‘definitely haven’t connected to history like that before’, that it gave them a ‘whole new understanding of \[the\] history of Whitehall\!’ and, ‘if history had been taught this way, I might not have become a scientist\!’ One wrote, ‘I was amazed how easily modern life drifted to the background whilst the past became more vivid and alive around me’. They had ‘never experienced anything like’ it, found *The Lost Palace* to be ‘an incredible immersive experience’, ‘such an imaginative venture’, ‘evocative’, ‘innovative, informative \+ fun’, ‘exceptional, playful and very moving\!’ **\[5.8\]**. 

##  Creating new business opportunities for creative industry partners 

 *The Lost Palace* has led to additional economic benefits for the creative industry partners involved. The methods, applications, and technologies developed have been transferred to other contexts and enabled them to successfully bid for new commissions totalling GBP350,000. Calvium stated that ‘funders liking *Lost Palace*’ and its ‘resounding success’ has led to opportunities to tender. It has ‘helped with brand building’ and ‘as a case study for general sales pitches’, specifically ‘to demonstrate \[their\] capability for working on novel uses of technology’ **\[5.10\].** Their White Paper, ‘Optimising Digital Innovation for Cultural Heritage Institutions’ focuses on *The Lost Palace*, shares the approach and makes ‘recommendations for other heritage organisations’ on how to deliver ‘new, richer, and more engaging visitor experiences’ **\[5.9\].** *The Lost Palace* directly led to theatre sound designer Gibson being involved with many other heritage projects \(totalling GBP74,100\). Gibson was approached by ATS Heritage, who design audio and multimedia guides, after they saw *The Lost Palace,* and together they commissioned binaural content for numerous other historic sites, including The Cutty Sark, Orford Castle, The Royal Hospital Chelsea, Osborne House, Canterbury Cathedral, The Painted Hall \(Old Royal Naval College\), and Hever Castle. Gibson is also producing an audio\-led exhibition, using cutting edge locative technology developed by NOUS \(Austria\) for the new Hans Christian Andersen Museum in Denmark opening in Summer 2021 \(GBP50,000\). Gibson added ‘this commission came about because the creative directors of the project saw *The Lost Palace* and it involves a great deal of skills… developed on the project’ **\[5.10\]**. For partners Limbic Cinema, ‘having a small part in the award\-winning project… has definitely added some calibre to our pitch documents’. They have since won several commissions locally for education and historic institutions, including: five new permanent installations for Bristol’s We The Curious \(GBP70,000\); four pieces of digital heritage interpretation for Bristol Old Vic, including an AR collaboration with Zubr and projection\-mapping with Aardman \(GBP70,000\); and the SS Great Britain’s anniversary event \(GBP15,000\) **\[5.10\]**. Newly established company Chomko & Rosier commented that the industry attention from the success of *The Lost Palace*, its experimental nature and ambition, led to further projects within the heritage sector for clients including National Trust, and further work for HRP at Hampton Court. For them, the value of earnings resulting from *The Lost Palace* is within the region of GBP60,000\-GBP80,000. For Rosier it ‘informed how we manage collaborations and gave us the confidence to work with creatives and professionals from a wide range of disciplines’ **\[5.10\]**. It also ‘gave other institutions and commissioners confidence in our ability to collaborate in such ways’ and ‘to deliver large scale public work’. ‘There is continued interest in *The Lost Palace* within the heritage sector and beyond’, which ‘continues to lead to invitations’ and create ‘opportunities’ **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Curriculum policy and practice are fundamental to modernising education systems; curriculum making is how curriculum policies, support infrastructure and school\-based practice are developed across different system levels.  Our research and knowledge exchange, in the areas of curriculum theory, policy and practice, have had a major impact on curriculum making in the national education systems of Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, including: 

1.  revised approaches to implementing Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence \(CfE\); 

1.  the development of processes to support curriculum making in Welsh schools; and 

1.  the development of new curricular policy in Ireland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research focuses on curriculum making in three countries: Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland. Curriculum making is defined as the development of curriculum policies, support infrastructure and school\-based practice, across different system levels \(e.g. government, national and local agencies, schools\). The research comprises the following strands \(numbers refer to publications listed in section 3\): 

1.  *Conceptual analysis of new curricular policies.* This includes critique of policy \( **R4**\), analysis and comparison of worldwide trends in curricula \( **R2**\), and analysis about the framing of curricular policy \( **R3**\). This research has, for example, identified contradictions in Scottish policy \( **R4**\) that have created conceptual and implementation tensions for teachers \( **R5**\). It has led to the development of a purposes\-led approach to curriculum making that focuses on understanding of ‘big ideas’, and the development of fit\-for\-purpose practices. 

1.  *Empirical case study research in schools, exploring the effects of new curricular policy.* This includes research around teacher professional engagement with policy and research \( **R1, R3**\), curriculum implementation \( **R1, R5, R6**\) and teacher agency in curriculum making \( **R1, R3, R6**\). The research has revealed difficulties in schools implementing policy, often caused by competing policy agendas, and has informed the processes that drive curriculum planning \(including the development of curriculum infrastructure\) in the three countries. 

1.  *Curriculum development programmes*; action research with teachers and school leaders to develop understanding of curriculum concepts and facilitate curriculum making \( **R1**\). The research has built understanding of the tensions between system dynamics and local imperatives that shape curriculum making in schools. 

 This is important research in a changing educational context; recent years have seen a policy shift internationally, from centralisation to local flexibility in curriculum making, with teachers as supposedly autonomous curriculum makers. Yet, such curricular policies are problematic. Importantly, they are subject to tensions between a policy rhetoric of teacher autonomy and a continued recourse to output regulation, including detailed specification of learning outcomes and comparison of schools using statistical data from testing. These approaches undermine teachers’ professional agency as curriculum makers, at a time when new policy increasingly demands an active curriculum making role from them. 

 The case study focuses on curriculum making across multiple layers of the three education systems, primarily focusing on the macro\-level \(national policymaking\) and meso\-level \(e.g., regional infrastructure and support\) contexts where curriculum is made and remade. The research has generated a significant body of work – conceptual and practical – in the field of curriculum making. It includes work by Priestley \(policy analysis, curriculum implementation and teacher agency\), Drew and Michael \(curriculum development and professional enquiry\), Biesta \(teacher agency\) and Edwards \(curriculum making\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has had a major impact on macro\-level national policy formation and within meso\-level fields of curricular policy interpretation and support \(e.g. the work of national agencies, local and regional governance\). Additional impacts are occurring within the micro\-level fields of educational practice \(e.g. schools\), although the case study focuses on the macro\- and meso\-levels. Note that the impact in this case study relates to curriculum making; a separate impact case study in this submission \(REF3.UoS.C23.1\), while drawing upon some of a complementary body of work by the same researchers \(Priestley and Drew\), relates to teacher professional learning. Thus, the two case studies apply to quite distinct areas of impact. 

 **Macro impacts \(national policy making\)** 

 Our research has significant reach, in that it has shaped the development of policy in Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland. 

 *Scotland* 

 In Scotland, research on teacher agency \( **R3, R6**\) and curriculum\-making \( **R1, R2, R5**\) **led to improvements in curriculum policy**. The Scottish Government provided the following assessment of the impact of the research: 

 “\[Testimonial redacted from publication at request of testimonial provider\]” **\(S2\)** 

 The research has also **underpinned the development of the ‘Refreshed Narrative’ for the Curriculum for Excellence** \(CfE\) \( **S1, S2, S3**\), as recommended by the 2015 OECD report on Scottish education \( **S8**\), which extensively cited Priestley’s publications, and was critical of the complexity of the curriculum. Priestley was a member of the national working group that developed the Refreshed Narrative \(2019\), and its structuring around ‘why’, ‘what’ and ‘how’ questions, is **explicitly based upon Priestley’s conceptual purposes\-led model for curriculum making**. The narrative has also adopted some of the key terminology and concepts in the research \(e.g. ‘the process of engaging with the core principles of CfE and the development of practices that are fit for purpose’; ‘curriculum making’\), which were absent from previous iterations of the curriculum. According to the Scottish Government: 

 “\[Testimonial redacted from publication at request of testimonial provider\]” \( **S2**\) 

 *Wales* 

 In Wales, the development of national policy and the thinking that underpins it has been significantly influenced by our research. For example, **the strong emphasis in Welsh curriculum policy and guidance on purposes\-led curriculum making largely stem from Priestley’s research** \( **R1, R4**\). His membership of the national Curriculum and Assessment Group, which advises the government, invited workshops for national curriculum developers on curriculum concepts and practices, and commissioned papers on emerging policy specification were important pathways to maximise this impact. Additionally, the Welsh Government produced a podcast featuring Priestley, designed to stimulate new thinking about the curriculum \( **S4**\). **Our research also underpins key national approaches for fostering curriculum making**. According to Kevin Palmer \(Deputy Director, Pedagogy, Leadership and Professional Learning, Welsh Government\), the curriculum making approach developed by Drew and Priestley \( **R1**\) has been fundamental to the development of: 

-  “our understanding of the criticality of teacher agency in the realisation of the new curriculum, where published work from Stirling informed our approach to teacher agency as a key feature of successful curriculum realisation at school level; 

-  \[and\] our understanding of enquiry\-based approaches to curriculum making at school and practitioner level, leading to a national project to support Welsh universities to work with our school improvement regions and groups of schools.” \( **S5**\) 

 *Republic of Ireland* 

 Major elements of the Irish school curriculum In Ireland have relied on Priestley’s research, including commissioned papers. This has led to a **reduction in both the number and emphasis of learning outcomes** in the curriculum specification for the Junior Cycle curriculum. His purposes\-led model for curriculum making has been a major driver of national curriculum policy \( **S6**\). According to Ben Murray \(National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, Ireland\): 

 “The research on curriculum making has had a significant impact on the development of curriculum policy. \[For example,\] Teacher Agency: An Ecological Approach \(R3\) informed the Brief for the Review of Junior Cycle subjects.” \( **S6**\) 

 **Meso impacts \(support for curriculum making\)** 

 Meso\-level infrastructure and activity to support curriculum making in Scotland, Wales and Ireland have relied on our research. 

 *Scotland* 

 **Scotland’s national programmes of curriculum capacity\-building amongst school leaders** were underpinned by **R1, R2, R3,** and **R5**. Drew’s role as Consultant to Education Scotland on the Teacher Leadership Prototype programme has been pivotal to this. These programmes include Excellence in Headship, on which Drew and Priestley have been invited by Education Scotland for the past three years to deliver series of three full\-day workshops to experienced headteachers on curriculum concepts and practices. According to Gayle Gorman \(Chief Executive, Education Scotland\): 

 “The research from Professor Mark Priestley has influenced thinking around the design and content of the EiH programme with regard to the programme overview as a whole, as well as professional learning sessions that contain content related to curriculum, learning and teaching and teacher agency.” \( **S7**\) 

 Research by Priestley and Drew \( **R1, R2, R3, R5**\) is significantly shaping the new national conversation on curriculum \(2020\) by Education Scotland \( **S7**\). Gayle Gorman states that: 

 “Research from Professor Mark Priestley is currently being built into the emerging work plans of the Curriculum Innovation function in Education Scotland. An example would be the contribution to the current design work on Interdisciplinary Learning.” \( **S7**\) 

 At a regional level \(in two of Scotland’s six Regional Improvement Collaboratives \[RICs\]\), research by Drew and Priestley on professional enquiry and teacher agency \( **R1**\) has led to **the development of large scale programmes to build capacity in curriculum making** amongst middle and senior school leaders, and Priestley has been co\-opted onto the curriculum leadership group of the Forth Valley and West Lothian RIC. 

 *Wales* 

 Research by Priestley and Drew \( **R1, R3**\) has been fundamental to **the development of resources and activities by Wales’s South East regional consortium to support curriculum making in schools**. The Stirling approach has been explicitly adopted as the model for curriculum making, reinforced by regionally funded programmes to build capacity amongst curriculum leaders, led by Drew and Priestley, and the development of support materials, which explicitly reference the approach \( **S10**\). According to James Kent \(Assistant Director: Professional Learning \(Curriculum, Collaboration & Research\) Education Achievement Service for South East Wales\): 

 “Working with Professor Mark Priestley and Dr Valerie Drew has been invaluable in supporting pioneer schools in southeast Wales to frame their thinking in terms of the ongoing curriculum reform programme. \[…\] The practice interruption phase of the programme ensured that practitioners were able to put their ideas in to practice in a manageable way, then evaluate and reflect upon the impact of their work. Above all, this approach has given practitioners a framework and the professional confidence to take forward exciting curricular innovations in their schools and begin to support other practitioners as they embark upon their own curriculum reform journey.” \( **S9**\) 

 *Republic of Ireland* 

 Priestley’s research on teacher agency \( **R3, R6**\) has been of critical importance to **the development of Ireland’s national support infrastructure for curriculum making** since 2015, including the work of the national Professional Development for Teachers \(PDST\) and Junior Cycle for Teachers \(JCT\) organisations, which work directly to support curriculum development in schools. Ben Murray \(Director, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, Ireland\) points to ongoing engagement in 2020 with national groups supporting the development of new curricula in Ireland: 

 “\[Mark led\] a collaborative learning day attended by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment \(NCCA\), Junior Cycle for Teachers \(JCT\), National Council for Special Education \(NCSE\) and the lead partner for the day the Professional Development Service for Teachers \(PDST\). This day, rooted in the research quoted above, was focused on developing an awareness, a shared understanding, and a critical look at curriculum design, concepts and teacher agency.” \( **S6**\) 

 **Impact on curriculum making** 

 In summary, our research on curriculum policy and practice, especially the theoretical and empirical work around teacher agency and curriculum making, has been enormously influential in Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland. The impact is evident in changed emphases in policy development, and in new approaches to supporting schools as they make the curriculum in their local settings. This work in curriculum making is both ongoing and increasing in scope: our networking has expanded across a greater number of country contexts \(for example, the production of a new conceptual framing for curriculum making in an edited collection, *Curriculum making in Europe: policy and practice within and across diverse contexts*, published January 2021\); and our expertise in curriculum making continues to be sought by governments \(e.g. the recent Rapid Review of National Qualification in Scotland, led by Priestley\), national agencies \(e.g. the greater emphasis on curriculum thinking in Scotland’s newly developed teacher standards, advocated by Drew\) and local/regional authorities \(e.g. a request for the development of curriculum\-focused materials for professional learning in a second Welsh regional consortium\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mobile connectivity is truly pervasive and underpins a wide range of commercial and societal applications. Telco has thus become a trillion\-pound industry with 2G\-4G mobile networks serving more than eight billion connections today. 5G systems were seven years in the making and are now being deployed with an expected market value of GBP500,000,000,000 by 2030. 

 A key factor in the success to acquire parts of this market is the ability to enter the 5G market early with innovative offerings, and to cut operational costs through standardised solutions. To this end, King’s fundamental research contributions on 5G telecommunication systems impacted industry and standards developments alike: 

-  **Ericsson** \(5G market leader\): King’s impacted **\[text removed for publication\]**. 

-  **Konica Minolta** \(enterprise printing market leader\): King’s impacted **\[text removed for publication\]**. 

-  **3GPP** \(global telecommunications standards body, 700 industry members\): King’s provided standards\-essential contributions to two standards on converged 5G architectures, which provide significant benefits in terms of customer experience and affects all network and broadband providers globally. 

-  **GSMA** \(global operator alliance with 750 operator members\): King’s introduced cost\-saving Generic 5G Slice Templates, initially included in the de\-facto industry guidebook and which are now being adopted by **\[text removed for publication\]** telecoms operators globally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 5G provides significant improvements in performance over 4G in that capacity \(data rate in bits/s\), reliability \(number of dropped calls\) and latency \(e.g. time for a website to load\) are improved by several orders of magnitudes. This enables unprecedented applications, such as untethered industrial control for Industry 4.0 or remote robotic surgery. The improved performance is achieved through a departure from legacy design principles, some of which King’s has contributed to through pioneering research. 

 Notably, 2G – 4G telecommunications systems are cell/network\-centric in that capacity and quality of experience \(QoE\) are dictated by the location of the basestation. Departing from this design approach, King’s has contributed to fundamental research enabling the transition to device\-centric architectures where capacity and QoE are dictated by the degree of connectivity experienced from the mobile terminal’s point of view. This has become the guiding architecture approach for 5G systems. Specifically, King’s pioneered and contributed to i\) decoupled up and downlinks; ii\) fixed\-mobile convergence; iii\) application\-centric edge\-cloud design; and iv\) software\-enabled network slicing: 

 **2.1 Decoupled up and downlink architecture** 

 In 2014, we introduced a paradigm shift in cell\-centric telecommunication networks by allowing up and downlinks to terminate at different basestations. We showed significant capacity gains but also reliability and latency gains. One research contribution was to design a viable protocol allowing for two prior non\-related basestations to handle the same call flow; this has been achieved through a complete decoupling of both data and control channels. The biggest challenge was to formally analyse the new system, since analytical models to represent this system were entirely missing. We had thus introduced a novel analytical framework quantifying the gains of decoupling in the lower frequencies but, surprisingly, showing that gains for higher frequencies such as millimetre wave systems eroded unless highly directional antennas were used \[1\]. This fundamental body of research resulted in several milestone publications, including a Best Paper Award at IEEE’s flagship conference which laid the groundwork for \[1\], with many citations indicating the opening of a new field of research. **\[text removed for publication\]**. 

 **2.2 Fixed and 5G mobile convergence** 

 Another important transition in 5G is reconciling the different wireless technologies under the same network management. We made a prominent contribution in changing the way fixed and mobile broadband networks operate by converging their capacity and enabling them to *jointly* deliver critical services. Given these networks follow different protocols and often reside on different infrastructures, the main challenge was how to seamlessly bring them together. Through theoretical research and experimentation, we have shown how aggregating the two networks at higher layers, and using Multi\-Path TCP \(MPTCP\), can result in better performance and QoE than the combined capacity of two separate streams \[2\]. **\[text removed for publication\]**. 

 **2.3 Multi\-tier 5G edge\-clouds** 

 We have pioneered the notion of an application\-centric caching\-as\-a\-service in cloud and edge\-cloud 5G networks. We have formulated the service delivery as a formal trade\-off between cost and performance \[3\]. The result was a clear multi\-tier cloud strategy with analysis supporting a strong case for edge\-cloud deployments. **\[text removed for publication\]**. 

 **2.4 Generic 5G slice templates** 

 Another area of significance in the transition from 4G to 5G is moving to softwarised, virtualised, and cloud\-supported systems. One of our major contributions in this area has been the development of a programmable multi\-domain and national scale testbed \[4,5\]. That allowed us to research and contribute to the definition of network slicing. Network slicing is a means to establish and guaranteeing personalised end\-to\-end services through re\-programming the 5G network. Our main research contribution was the introduction of Slicing Templates, as a solution to addressing technical and business aspects of network slicing over an infrastructure with *multiple* ownerships \[6\]. **\[text removed for publication\]**. 

 **2.5 Co\-creation of 5G use\-cases** 

 The ensemble of above research contributions enabled a fresh look at mobile architectures able to deliver 5G applications. Enabled by \[4,5\], King’s engaged in interdisciplinary co\-creation research in health, transport and the arts. This has inspired numerous societal 5G applications at global scale and has led to ample media coverage. Furthermore, it stimulated research in King’s pioneering concept of the Internet of Skills, a next\-generation internet powered by 5G, AI and robotics, able to execute physical skills remotely. **\[text removed for publication\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 King’s research has enabled a departure from legacy protocol and architecture design principles with significant impact on global telecoms industries and standards: 

 **4.1 Impact on Ericsson’s \[text removed for publication\]:** 

 Ericsson is the world’s second largest vendor in telco services, software and infrastructure, and 5G market leader with an annual revenue of USD28,000,000,000. “ *2.5bn subscribers and 40% of the world’s mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson’s networks*” \[A, page 1\], thus powering half of the world’s mobile commercial and societal services. Ericsson and King’s have engaged in close joint research, innovation and deployment/experimentation over the past seven years. The underpinning research 2.1 and 2.5 achieved impact in four areas: 

-  **\[text removed for publication\] **use\-case developments:** “ *King’s played an instrumental role in gauging early 5G architecture capabilities and translating them into viable societal use cases. As a result, Ericsson has spearheaded many use cases* **\[text removed for publication\]** *. These have been documented on Ericsson’s website with specific mention of King’s inception; notably in health, education and gaming, and the arts and culture*” \[A, p.2\]. Important world’s first were the output of King’s work: “ *the world’s first robotic surgery over 5G \[…\] which impacted the industry vision in the use of 5G for medical interventions \[…\]”* and “ *UK’s first 5G 3.5GHz deployment with Vodafone, 5G sliced drone using EE’s and Verizon’s networks, or the world’s first 5G music lesson with Jamie Cullum*”. \[A p.3, B, C\] 

-  **Impact on** \[text removed for publication\] **:** “Based on the pioneering use case developments and 5G prototyping, the work of King’s College London has* **\[text removed for publication\]** *to address novel 5G use cases”* \[A, p.3\] and *“it \[…\] is* **\[text removed for publication\]** *”* \[A, p.2\]. As a result: “ *In confidence,* **\[text removed for publication\]** *”* \[A, p.3\]. 

-  **Skills development** \[text removed for publication\] **:** *“Ericsson was able to* **\[text removed for publication\]** *”* \[A, p.2\]. 

-  **Marketing, branding and societal outreach:** “The work conducted by King’s \[…\] has led to significant press and media coverage* \[C\] *. Notably outlets, such as CNN, BBC, Wired, FT, have continuously reported on the technical advances of this work.* **\[text removed for publication\]** *”* \[A, p.3\]. 

 **4.2 Impact on Konica Minolta \[text removed for publication\]:** 

 Konica Minolta \(KM\) offers a large variety of products in the form of office equipment, medical imaging, graphic imaging, optical devices and measuring instruments at a GBP7,400,000,000 annual revenue. It is market leader in enterprise printing products. King’s has engaged with KM over a years\-long engagement via **\[text removed for publication\]**: 

-  **Establishment** \[text removed for publication\] **:** *“The roadmap developed by Prof M Dohler in 2014\-2015 outlined a set of opportunities for Konica Minolta around* **\[text removed for publication\]** *capabilities. Furthermore, King’s College London \[…\] advocated for a* **\[text removed for publication\]** *. \[…\] Following the KCL report, Konica Minolta focused on* **\[text removed for publication\]** *known as Distributed Cloud Intelligence \(DCI\)”* \[D, E\]. Further, *“the ongoing collaboration has been specifically useful for DCI and has helped* **\[text removed for publication\]** *”* \[D\].

The **\[text removed for publication\]** benefits are reported **\[text removed for publication\]** \[D\]; thus, giving an increased competitive **\[text removed for publication\]** \[D\]. 

 **4.3 Impact \[text removed for publication\] via 3GPP standards contributions:** 

 The 3rd Generation Partnership Project \(3GPP\) is the world’s largest umbrella of seven standards organizations which develop cellular telecommunications technologies, including radio access, core network and service capabilities. More than 700 industry partners contribute to 3GPP, making it the largest standards body shaping the £\-trillion telco market. King’s research on converged 5G telecommunications architectures was integrated into 3GPP with the support of BT. The standards contributions underpinned by the research have been fed directly into Release 16 and 17 Technical specifications \[G\], i.e. 3GPP TS 23.501 Sections 4.2.10. \(Architecture Reference Model for ATSSS Support\) and 5.32 \(Support for ATSSS\) as well as 3GPP TS 23.502 Section 4.22 \(ATSSS procedures\). The underpinning research 2.2 achieved impact in two areas: 

-  **\[text removed for publication\] **5G technical specifications:** “The work that King’s and BT carried out on 5G convergence has been* **\[text removed for publication\]** *to support both fixed and mobile access technologies, and in particular the ability for operators to make dynamic decisions to route traffic to customers to optimise quality of experience in the most efficient manner”* \[H\]. The contributions are specification standards, and essential to be implemented, hence confirmed to impact all broadband providers who have both fixed and mobile network infrastructure \[H\]. 

-  **\[text removed for publication\] **5G feature rollouts:** *“This \[convergence\] feature is expected to be incorporated into vendor roadmaps and operator network deployments across the globe as 5G solutions evolve and mature towards a fully converged architecture, delivering significant benefits to customer experience”* \[G\]. 

 **4.4 Development of cost\-efficient slicing template for largest telco association:**The Global System for Mobile Communications Association \(GSMA\) is the world’s largest telco association representing and influencing the business practice of more than 750 mobile network operators worldwide. 

 King’s underpinning research 2.4 impacted the pioneering concept of a *Generic Slice Template* that allows multiple operators to exchange the basic information of their network slice without revealing their technical details that could expose their competitive advantage. Hence, for the first time, user services can go across multiple operator domains with the exchange of slice templates between the involved operators. *“These insights have provided independent thought\-leadership for the GSMA to push for the creation of the Generic Slice Template \(GST\)”* \[H\]. 

 King’s work was thus included in the *“The ‘5G Guide: a reference for operators’ \[which\] is the de\-facto industry guidebook on the commercial, policy and technical considerations for the 5G business case. Following its completion, it was distributed to the GSMA Board for adoption at the February 2019 Board meeting and subsequently distributed to the CEOs of the 750 mobile operators in the world in April 2019” \[H\].* Importantly, *“all the GSMA Board member companies, i.e. the **\[text removed for publication\]** largest telcos in the world, have now incorporated or are considering incorporating slicing into their 5G network plans, following a similar strategy as outlined in the document”* \[H\]. 

 King’s work *“has impacted the industry’s position on how to optimise the creation and management of slices. Two speciﬁc recommendations from KCL stand out: i\) optimise granularity of network slices so as to balance the need for more differentiation versus the costs of provisioning slices; ii\) and \[the creation of\] standardised slice templates with predeﬁned and optional ﬁelds that could bring down the cost and time to deploy of network slices signiﬁcantly, guaranteeing interoperability and enabling automation of slice management on global scale”* \[H\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Dr Gearoid Millar at the University of Aberdeen’s Institute for Conflict Transition and Peace Research has examined the role and impact of external interventions in post\-conflict societies. Millar has made an important contribution to better understanding how external actors in post\-conflict societies can hinder the prospects of long\-term peace. Millar has shown both how external organisations can negatively affect local communities, contrary to their intended goal, and how scholarly work can better understand these errors and contribute to better policy. As such, the research has impacted the advocacy work of international organizations and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) attempting to inform policy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Aiming to promote job creation and sustainable economic growth, Development Finance Institutions \(DFIs\) invest heavily in private sector projects in low, middle\-income, and often conflict affected countries. Despite their intentions to create productive employment and facilitate peace, particularly in post\-conflict societies, these development projects can also adversely affect local communities when they fail to recognize the complex sociocultural, political, and economic environments into which they intervene. As such, a gap exists in the development finance sector in the lack of methodologies for assessing the long\-term impacts of development interventions and the lived experience of DFI\-funded projects on the communities they seek to support. 

 Dr Gearoid Millar’s work has addressed these problems in two ways. The first is by providing an in\-depth examination of one case \(Addax Bioenergy\) in Sierra Leone that has led to substantial contributions to the understandings and advocacy work of a number of Land Rights and Food Security NGOs \[2\-7\]. And the second is through the development of the Ethnographic Peace Research \(EPR\) approach, which is a means of assessing the impact of international interventions from the perspective of local individuals and communities in post\-conflict societies \[1\]. Both of these elements are intertwined and exhibit the contribution Millar has made to this important field of policy and intervention practice \[6\]. 

 Through the former, for example, and by focusing on the role and impact of the Addax project in Sierra Leone, Millar has demonstrated how a corporation sought to produce ethanol in rural Sierra Leone for export to Europe, claimed that the project would be a ‘positive social actor’, and engaged with local communities in order to employ local labour whilst claiming to protect local livelihoods and food security \[3\-5\]. Millar’s work however, illustrates the highly damaging impacts of the project on the customary order and structures of authority within the area of the project \[3, 7\], on women’s livelihoods and security \[4\], and through the generation of new conflicts over the resources the company inject into this highly unequal and impoverished economy \[5\]. His work shows that the investment landscape in conflict affected societies is far more complex than appreciated and that a substantial level of unpredictability results from the interaction between global and local actors. As a result, the powerful interveners often fail to understand the potential fallout of their actions and very often that their interventions do not contribute to sustainable peace \[5\]. 

 The EPR approach Millar has developed and promoted is central to overcoming this failure on the part of DFIs and the projects they fund. This approach is widely cited as a tool by which to understand the complex interaction of global and local actors in peacebuilding interventions \(Kreikemeyer, 2020,  [<ins>Pingeot</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13533312.2019.1673739), 2019,  [<ins>Richmond</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2019.1637729), 2018;  [<ins>Brauchler</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21647259.2017.1368158?scroll=top&needAccess=true), 2017\). His EPR method deviates from the standard practice in the field and encourages semi\-structured interviews, participant observation and extensive qualitative field notes to generate grounded understandings of how local individuals and communities perceive and experience international interventions. It acts as a methodological roadmap for developing relevant and accessible forms of data that can bring to the fore local voices and local contexts, and encourages knowledge exchange between scholars and peace practitioners \[1, 6\]. These two contributions together have impacted on the advocacy efforts and achievements of international organizations and NGOs which seek to influence how DFIs approach post\-conflict and development investments.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Dr Millar at the University of Aberdeen has directly impacted the advocacy efforts of international and domestic NGOs in their attempts to inform policy discussions regarding DFI\-funded investments in post\-conflict societies. In addition, his work has introduced a roadmap by which DFIs and the projects they fund can be held accountable in order to limit the corporate deployment of power in rural Africa that has already negatively impacted communities. 

 **Providing an evidence base for NGO advocacy** 

 Millar’s research in Sierra Leone has provided a detailed evidence base that has enabled NGOs to analyse the developmental impact of European and other DFIs and to advocate for changes based on those impacts. Swedwatch, for example, a Swedish NGO dedicated to investigating the extent to which companies take responsibility for human rights and the environment through responsible investment, used an early draft of Millar’s paper titled ‘We have no voice for that’ \(published in the *Journal of Human Rights* in 2015\), as the basis for a high\-profile 2013 report titled ‘ [<ins>Utan Mark, Utan Makt’</ins>](https://swedwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/swedwatch_-_utan_mark_utan_makt.pdf), \(translated as ‘ [No land no power](https://swedwatch.org/en/regions/africa-south-of-the-sahara/no-land-no-power/)’\) \[S1\]. The report argues that; despite Addax’s ambitious sustainability targets, they needed a ‘clearer rights perspective’ in the investment venture, so that women could participate and benefit from the project. The lead researcher from Swedwatch stated that: 

 \(Millar’s research\) *strengthened our focus on and understanding of the gendered impacts and the need to highlight them both as human rights impacts in themselves but also to see the linkages between gendered impacts and conflict* \[S2\]. 

 Sweden’s national broadcaster, SverigesRadio, then highlighted the new focus enabled by Millar’s ethnographic research. As they noted when discussing the Swedwatch report: 

 *According to a report presented today, it is mainly the women in the area who have been affected…The report has focused on women’s rights – as it is a stated goal of Swedish aid policy… according to the report, the communication works poorly between Addax Bioenergy and the locals* \[S3\]. 

 Following on from these early uses of Millar’s research findings, a 2017 briefing paper released by the Dutch NGO, Fern – commissioned to track European Union involvement in forested regions and the rights of people who depend on them – drew heavily on Millar’s research and used the bioenergy project \(now controlled by Sunbird Bioenergy Mabilafu\) as one of the primary case studies \[S4\]. As well as concluding that the project had an overall negative impact on the local population, the briefing advocated for a set of recommendations that align with Millar’s findings; evidencing how Millar’s research directly informed Fern’s advocacy efforts. 

 This impact can be seen most directly in the 2020 monitoring report \[S5\] jointly prepared by one national NGO \(the Sierra Leone Network on the Right to Food – SiLNoRF, Austria\), and one international NGO \(Brot Für Alle \- Bread for All\), a Swiss\-based organisation and member of a multi\-partner network\). This report draws directly on Millar’s research and culminates in recommendations to Sunbird, to the government of Sierra Leone, and to local stakeholders, again based on Millar’s findings.  As the author of the report, Land Rights Expert in Sierra Leone has stated \[S6\]: 

 *Dr Miller’s research has provided valuable insights to the lived experiences of communities affected by the project, strengthening the argument that large scale monocultures are by no means ‘sustainable’ developments. Dr Millar’s research publications have underpinned a number of the central arguments of our report and providing evidence that clarifies which lands were used, the cost of these negotiations and gendered impacts of the negotiations*. 

 The author goes on to note that: 

 *Dr Millar’s findings have contributed towards our efforts to begin addressing the knowledge gap that exists and communicating findings to the current company involved at the project site, to policymakers, and to the DFIs in order to create a platform to facilitate much needed dialogue as well as raising awareness amongst stakeholders of the ongoing issues facing communities and providing a voice to those disadvantaged by operations*. 

 Bread For All Agricultural and Land Rights Expert \(Sierra Leon and Liberia\) corroborated the value of Millar’s research to the report, highlighting Millar’s role in ‘clarifying which lands were used, the cost of these negotiations’ stating \[S7\]: 

 *The work of Dr Millar supported Bread For All in defining a strong position on large\-scale land acquisitions based on scientific evidence. This kind of evidence also helps us in our lobby work towards the governments in Sierra Leone, towards the DFIs and also the company*. 

 **Enhancing understanding of the challenges surrounding foreign direct investment in post\-conflict societies** 

 While the narrative above evidences Millar’s impact on NGO advocacy work regarding DFI supported projects in Sierra Leone, his larger effort to develop the EPR approach to better allow peace studies scholars to contribute to advocacy and policy formation has impacted on how scholars contribute to policy and practice. Millar’s work has also been widely shared for public readership, including through *The Conversation*, farmlandgrab.org in 2016 \( [https://bit.ly/2OzSFdt](https://bit.ly/2OzSFdt)\) and in the *Huffington Post* in 2016 \( [https://bit.ly/3cjDeyn](https://bit.ly/3cjDeyn)\) \[S8\]. Aimed primarily at a targeted audience of NGOs, journalists, and social activists, the articles explore the role of DFIs in funding international projects that fail to uphold humanitarian and environmental sustainability goals; goals that DFIs explicitly cite as their raison d’etre. 

 As noted above, the EPR approach is widely cited by scholars as a tool by which to understand the complex interaction of global and local actors in peacebuilding interventions \(Kreikemeyer, 2020,  [<ins>Pingeot</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13533312.2019.1673739), 2019,  [<ins>Richmond</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2019.1637729), 2018;  [<ins>Brauchler</ins>](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21647259.2017.1368158?scroll=top&needAccess=true), 2017\), but in 2018, the Peace Science Digest also undertook an analysis of Millar’s research and found something similar \[S9\]. Peace Science Digest is a project of the  [War Prevention Initiative](https://warpreventioninitiative.org/) of the  [Jubitz Family Foundation](https://www.jubitz.org/) and it acts as a tool to facilitate change by translating academic texts for policy audiences and increasing the visibility and application of academic knowledge. As a result of their review, Peace Science Digest  stated that Millar’s work: 

 *examines one of the very concerns the Peace Science Digest was created to address: the difficult of making academic scholarship accessible and useful to peace practitioners*. 

 They further note that the research: 

 *brings up big, philosophical questions about the extent to which our actions can influence the world in the ways intended—with practical implications for how we understand our role in the world and the usefulness and value of our interventions* \[S9\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of York research on enteral feeding for very preterm or very low birth weight \(VLBW\) infants has informed national and international guidelines, influenced policy and practice, and underpinned initiatives to improve care and outcomes globally. Our work is cited as evidence for the use of donor human milk and progressive enteral feeding to reduce necrotising enterocolitis and severe infection and sepsis, optimise growth, and improve long\-term outcomes in very preterm or VLBW infants. These benefits are associated with substantial cost savings by reducing the duration of hospitalisation and resource use in the long\-term. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 One\-in\-fifty infants is born “very preterm” \(< 32 weeks’ gestation\) or VLBW \(< 1,500g\). The commonest causes of morbidity and late\-neonatal mortality in this vulnerable population are necrotising enterocolitis \(intestinal inflammation and failure\), and bloodstream infection and sepsis. These conditions affect about 20% of very preterm or VLBW infants and are associated with neuro\-disabilities requiring life\-long care and support. 

 Enteral feeding strategies such as 1\) the type of milk that infants receive \(human milk versus cow milk\-formula\) and 2\) how and when it is given \(since very preterm infants do not regulate their own intake\), are major modifiable risk factors for necrotising enterocolitis, infection and sepsis. High\-quality evidence is needed to guide policy and practice to improve care and outcomes for very preterm or VLBW infants and their families. 

 With NIHR support since 2013, McGuire, Brown, and colleagues at York’s Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, have led a programme of work to generate a suite of Cochrane systematic reviews that have synthesised the evidence\-base for the key feeding and nutritional interventions for very preterm or VLBW infants: 

 **Donor human milk:** Our meta\-analysis of 11 randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) showed that feeding with donor human milk rather than cow milk\-formula \(when sufficient maternal milk is not available\) halved the risk of necrotising enterocolitis **\[B\]**. Feeding with donor human milk, which typically contains less energy and protein than cow milk\-formula, was associated with slower growth. Our review of 14 RCTs showed that human milk enriched with ‘multi\-nutrient fortifier’ increased growth rates to recommended levels. Meta\-analysis, furthermore, provided clinicians and families with reassurance that fortifying human milk was not associated with a rebound increase in the risk of necrotising enterocolitis **\[D\]**. 

 **Timing of introduction and advancement of enteral feeds:** Our Cochrane reviews refuted the long\-established practice of ‘conservative’ enteral feeding for very preterm or VLBW infants **\[A\]\[C\]\[E\]**. Historically, concern existed that ‘progressive’ enteral feeding \(early introduction of milk feeds, and rapid advancement of feed volumes\) might stress the immature gastrointestinal tract sufficiently to cause necrotising enterocolitis, infection and sepsis. Our meta\-analyses of 28 RCTs \(> 5,600 participants\) showed that \(i\) early exposure to small volumes of enteral milk **\[A\]** and advancing enteral feeds within the first few days after birth **\[C\]** was feasible and was well\-tolerated by very preterm or VLBW infants, and that \(ii\) rapid advancement of feed volumes was safe for even the smallest and most fragile infants, and was associated with a reduction in the risk of bloodstream infection and sepsis **\[E\]**. This review included data from 2,800 infants who participated in the UK multi\-centre RCT of different rates of enteral feeding \(co\-led by McGuire\), the largest trial to\-date in this population **\[F\]**\).

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

##  Impact on policy statements, guidelines, toolkits and care pathways 

 Research undertaken at York has informed international and national guidelines on enteral feeding strategies for very preterm and VLBW infants. 

 Three sets of World Health Organisation \(WHO\) guidelines cite York research: 

-  “Donor Human Milk for Low Birth Weight Infants”; 

-  “Feeding of Very Low Birth Weight Infants”; and 

-  “Standard Formula for Low Birth Weight Infants”. 

 All are subsets of the WHO’s guidance on feeding of low birth weight infants **\[1\]**. 

 Research output **\[B\]** is cited as the underpinning evidence for recommending that VLBW infants “ *who cannot be fed mother's own milk should be fed donor human milk \[in\] settings where safe and affordable milk\-banking facilities are available or can be set up*”. Seven outputs authored by McGuire \(including **\[D\]\[E\]\[F\]**\) are cited as informing feeding guidelines for VLBW infants, including specific recommendations on the rate of enteral feeding and the use of nutrient fortifiers. 

 York research is cited in other national and international guidelines and policy documents by the American Academy of Pediatrics \(AAP\), the Canadian Consensus Group \(CCG\), and the European Association of Perinatal Medicine \(EAPM\) **\[2\]**: 

-  The AAP 2017 policy statement cites output **\[B\]** in recommending the use of donor human milk: “ *recent studies support health benefits for its use in \[VLBW\] infants, especially in decreasing rates of necrotizing enterocolitis*”. 

-  The CCG 2015 guidelines refer to output **\[E\]** to underpin key recommendations for VLBW infants, including to “ *start trophic feeds preferably within 24h of life*”; and “… *if the feeds are tolerated for around 2\-3 days, consider increasing faster*”. 

-  The EAPM 2017 consensus guidelines recommend early initiation of human milk feeds, and their rapid advancement, for VLBW infants, stating that “ *there is no evidence of increased NEC \[necrotising enterocolitis\] with early initiation of feeds or advancing feeds more rapidly*”, based on McGuire’s finding **\[C\]\[E\]**. Output **\[B\]** is cited to support the recommendation that “ *donor breast milk is better than formula as it reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis*”. 

##  Impact on training and education 

 Through its underpinning of WHO and other guidance and policy statements, York research has informed training and education in enteral feeding for very preterm and VLBW infants in the UK and internationally, leading to the wider use of donor human milk and progressive enteral feeding. For example: 

-  The Interpractice 21st project \(Oxford Maternal and Perinatal Health Institute\) provides training for healthcare professionals to promote the best international standards in nutrition for preterm infants. The online module, “Feeding Recommendations for the Routine Care of Preterm Infants”, available in English, Spanish, Italian, Russian and Portuguese, cites output **\[E\]** as the evidence for recommendations on the initiation, advancement, and volume and frequency of enteral feeds **\[3\]**. 

-  The European Standards of Care for Newborn Health, a practical standards\-based resource for neonatal healthcare practitioners, cites outputs **\[B\]\[C\]\[E\]** in its advice on establishment of enteral feeding in preterm infants **\[4\]**. 

##  Impact on adoption and practice 

 The volume and use of donor human milk, and establishment of donor milk banks, has increased substantially in the UK and internationally during the past decade **\[5\]**. For example, Human Milk Banking Association of North America data indicate an expansion from 16 non\-profit milk banks in 2013 to 30 as of 2020. Collectively, these processed about 85,000L of milk in 2013, rising to \~210,000L in 2019 **\[5\]**. The expansion is predicated on research including the York Cochrane reviews, and the WHO guidance that draw on these. Milk banks internationally base their existence and practice on the WHO guidance, as evidenced in sources such as the Australian Government’s healthcare resource pages, and official recommendations for the adoption of milk banks in Spain which cite both the recent WHO guidance and York research **\[5\]**. The Health Scotland 2017 report for NHS practitioners and policy makers notes that “ *access to donor breast milk in all neonatal units has resolved some of the issues of making breast milk equally available to all babies who need it*” **\[5\]**. 

 Further evidence of impact in neonatal care facilities is provided by recent studies in North America. A quality improvement project in Massachusetts \(USA\) that examined the effect of newly\-introduced feeding regimens on growth for very preterm infants cites outputs **\[C\]** and **\[E\]** as underpinning two of its key elements: *“earlier initiation of trophic feeds \[and\] accelerated daily feeding”* **\[6\]**. A study examining the expansion in US neonatal units using donor human milk for supplemental feeding of very preterm or VLBW infants \(74% increase since 2011\) cited output **\[B\]** as the unpinning evidence that allowed practitioners to become more confident in recommending adopting this practice **\[7a\]**. 

##  Impact on patient outcomes and cost savings 

 The changes in practice based on York research have improved care and outcomes for very preterm and VLBW infants. The Massachusetts initiative concluded that the new enteral feeding regimens reduced time to establish feeds and reduced central vascular catheter use, a major risk factor for infection and sepsis in very preterm infants **\[6\]**. Another US study showed that “ *a progressive standardized, evidence\-based feeding protocol was associated with improved growth without increased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis*” in VLBW infants **\[7b\]**. In the UK, the Human Milk Foundation, a charitable umbrella organisation for NHS milk banks, connects increased use of donor human milk with reduction in necrotising enterocolitis and the saving of preterm infants’ lives **\[5\]**. 

 Cost savings may be associated with adopting enteral feeding regimens informed by the York reviews **\[8\]**. The Massachusetts study concluded that “ *the change in practice also resulted in cost savings*” because infants spend a shorter time spent in neonatal intensive care units **\[6\]**. Economic modelling from a UK NHS perspective suggests that interventions to reduce the use of formula for feeding preterm infants are likely to achieve substantial cost savings for the UK NHS \(lifetime quality\-adjusted life year gain >10,000\), principally by reducing rates of necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, and neurodevelopmental impairment **\[9\]**. In Southern Africa, analysis suggests that donor human milk is a highly cost\-effective intervention for very preterm infants, costing \(""worst case""\) USD619 per Disability Adjusted Life Year averted. This analysis concluded that there is a “ *compelling argument to increase the supply of donor milk in middle\-income countries*” **\[10\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sykes’s research underpinned the decision by the Catholic Diocese of Cairns, Australia, to establish a drop\-in centre in 2015 in this seaport city, which is a hub for large multi\- residential Papua New Guinean \(PNG\) households. Sykes described how households comprise a mutually dependent network spread across Australian and Papua New Guinean towns and villages, including cities in southeast Asia. Members move easily between several dwellings over the course of a year, but become vulnerable upon leaving their network. 

 A proposal by priest **\[Text removed for publication\]** to the Diocese used Sykes’s data to advise that a centrally\-located shopping mall near his church could be the location for a family centre to meet social needs, enhance wellbeing, and build the PNG community by linking together numerous household networks. The resultant Papua New Guinean Catholic Centre \(PNGCC\) is addressing these fundamental goals by providing members of PNG households with an essential point of contact for meeting and message\-carrying. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Sykes carried out ESRC\-funded ethnographic research into Papua New Guinean households in Far North Queensland \(FNQ\) and North Queensland \(NQ\) \[1\]. The research was undertaken January–December 2012 and October–December 2014, in the wake of a moral panic about the flood of Papua New Guinean economic migrants into Queensland. The study allowed her and her two local PNG research assistants to better assess the distribution and the habits of residence and association of Papua New Guineans in Queensland state. The study clarified confusing 2011 census data, which recorded 25,000 PNG\-born residents in Australia, of which 15,000 resided in Queensland, with many of these in the FNQ and NQ regions of the State. The census did not yield more exact region\-level figures and warned against making inferences from the published data. Sykes and her RAs found that the census office cautioned wisely. Despite the census data for numbers of Papua New Guineans in Queensland, accurate figures are hard to determine by conventional census methods. Sykes’s ethnographic moral economy approach showed that the population of a large network of PNG people in FNQ and NQ might swell from 5000 to 8000, were all the transnational household members to be present in those two regions during one month, and not in residences they possess in PNG, southern Queensland, other Australian States, or Manila, Singapore and New Zealand. 

 Sykes’s research \[2\] discusses the failure of the conceptual apparatus of standard political economy approaches to accurately identify the number of Papua New Guineans living in Australia. The 2011 census data recorded PNG ancestry by birthplace of parent or grandparent, which might include in the census data many ‘white settlers’ who had chosen to move to Australia before PNG Independence in 1975, after residing more than one generation in PNG. Furthermore, Sykes’s critical assessment of the usual measures of the PNG population, such as data derived from the property register, as well as school and health registers, exposed the inadequacy of these indicators for capturing the reticulating mode of settlement that typifies PNG households, with multiple residences in Queensland and PNG. 

 Sykes and her RAs \(Nalisa Neuendorf and Vincent Backhaus\) collected an ethnographic record of the moral economy of the PNG presence from accounts of life in 60\+ households and histories of household composition and settlement over three generations. Extended case studies, ethnographic interviews in family kitchens, qualitative surveys, and social network maps revealed a reticular migration pattern over two generations. Ethnography allowed Sykes to show that PNG identity was determined by a moral economy of people’s habits of association, rather than by measures of ancestral descent and property ownership. Data on the use of money and household provisioning evidenced the supportive linkages across many residences, revealing the character of the multi\-residence PNG household and its habit of connecting members across great distances in the Asia Pacific region. Families mobilise multiple residences in Australia and PNG to act as one transnational household to provide care for aged parents over the course of a year and to support education for children from the village. In Queensland, PNG people disperse themselves as homeowners, choosing to settle at distance from other PNG people and not cluster together in one neighbourhood, yet they encounter each other in farmers’ markets, at church gatherings, at their children’s school and sporting events, and in the comfort of air\-conditioned shopping malls. Therefore, Sykes defined the PNG household broadly \(mixed race, loose and changing membership, multi\-residential\) and made visible the scale of the community created by their interactions and transactions over both great distances and protracted times. The discussion of this domestic moral economy is published in a book chapter \[2\] and a series of journal articles \[3, 4, 5\]. Project RA, Nalisa Neuendorf co\-authored an article in *GeoForum* \[6\]. 

  

 The findings of Sykes and her RAs suggested that access to the PNG population in Queensland would be more successful if government services, church officers, and businesses contacted any of the numerous women who are well connected within the multi\-residential transnational households, than if they tried to contact \(non\-existent\) neighbourhoods, settlements, or enclaves of Papua New Guineans. These women carried news of comings and goings of people in different households, and thereby moved individuals to seek each other out while they were in the same town. The permanence of the Papua New Guinean Catholic Centre \(PNGCC\), directed by a committee of PNG women, created a reliable point of contact for the community by facilitating and even intensifying this kind of message carrying. It has become a vehicle to support PNG people in building community and supporting their mutual well\-being.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Sykes’s research into PNG household composition led to the founding of the PNGCC in Cairns, the largest city in the northern regions of Queensland. PNG families do not form an enclave or neighbourhood in Cairns. Instead their residences are widely spread throughout the small towns of the city’s hinterlands. They do not connect by internet in this region where broadband provision is weak, but it is common to meet with other families while shopping in the city. The PNGCC is located in Raintrees Shopping Centre with its affordable shops and medical and dental services. It is a short drive to the government offices of Cairns and very near to St Francis Xavier’s Church where news of the Centre’s activities is shared through the Catholic community and PNGCC directors use the church office facilities to support their work. 

 Sykes’s research into the wide dispersal of PNG residences was used first to draft a policy for PNG people written by **\[Text removed for publication\]**, whose ardent interest in the well\-being of the Papua New Guineans in Australia shaped his work as a Diocesan priest at St Francis Xavier’s Church. When he relocated from PNG to Australia, he sought support from his Bishop for the large mobile community of unknown numbers of PNGs, now on his doorstep in the north of Queensland. The Diocese of Cairns chose to support the proposal and open a PNG community centre. 

  

 **Pathways to Impact** 

 **Development of the proposal for a PNG Catholic Centre** 

 Sykes shared key research findings over three public presentations in 2014, all to larger groups of PNG men and women who were members of different churches in the area \(Catholic, Seventh\-Day Adventist, United\-Methodist, and Salvation Army\). These presentations addressed: a meeting of 30 PNG women who represented various social groups in the region \(including popular clubs and sports\); a meeting of 8 church leaders working with PNG families; and a meeting of 60 PNG women and men from the wider PNG community. In these meetings, Sykes discussed PNG transnational households and their multi\-residential composition across Australia and PNG, and sometimes into the South Pacific, southeast Asia, Europe and North America. She highlighted the ways that people moved between the households, and the urban lifestyle of Cairns and Australia more widely, which created the need for a strong PNG community beyond the immediate family unit. 

 Additional meetings were held in 2014 to discuss Sykes’s findings in more detail, with aged care providers and several local government civil servants who knew the challenges facing the most vulnerable PNG people, such as the PNG widows of white Australian men who lacked support from their husband’s family and friends, and had only weak or no connections with members of other PNG families. These PNG individuals might ‘fall through the cracks’ between PNG households, and be overlooked by organizations that typically support mostly elderly white Australian women. Sykes’s research created the opportunity to speak about the issues raised by her research more generally and recognise the need for preliminary reports pertaining to the problem of care for the aged. During late 2014, Sykes held three one\-to\-one meetings with **\[Text removed for publication\]** in order to discuss her research findings in more depth. He used these discussions to develop his proposal to the Diocese of Cairns for a PNG Centre. The **\[Text removed for publication\]**, states that ‘ *together \[Sykes and* **\[Text removed for publication\]** *\] recognized that the research evidence pointed to a need for a PNG Centre to draw people into a community’* \[A\] in order to support the wellbeing of all members. 

 **Impact** 

 **Opening of the PNG Catholic Centre** 

 The Centre was envisaged as a meeting point for all PNGs in the region. The Diocese’s support included: 

1.  Allocating a portion of **\[Text removed for publication\]** time to assist the PNGCC Director. 

1.  Dedicating office space and administrative support at St Francis Xavier’s Church to support the Centre; and funding the refurbishment of the physical space at Raintrees shopping mall. 

1.  Making a formal commitment to the saying of a ‘PNG’ mass once a month to strengthen the spiritual community. The mass is said in Tok Pisin \(one of PNG’s three official languages\) and is attended regularly by 150–200 people in St Francis Xavier’s Church. 

 **Continuing impact of the Centre for the PNG population** 

 The significance of the Centre is felt today in the role it plays as a physical space bringing PNG families into a community of mutual support. **\[Text removed for publication\]** describes the vision of the PNGCC ‘ *to help the PNG community more broadly, simply by providing a space to meet for all Papua New Guineans. The Centre supports families who might attend regular events, and other Papua New Guineans who might simply drop in for a friendly chat’* \[A\]. This significance can be evidenced in various ways: 

1.  Daily community events hosted by the Centre: Arts and Crafts Groups; PNG Music Groups, PNG Mother’s Group, as well as groups that offer spiritual community \(such as Friday rosary\). **\[Text removed for publication\]** notes that regular attendance is upwards of 40 people in some of these events, but they also welcome drop\-in guests. Although the Centre does not keep a formal membership, its Facebook website is followed by 690 members of the community, and is used to share details of events, community discussions, videos and photos \[B\]. 

1.  The reach of the PNGCC is extended by the work of Centacare, the Social Services agency of the Catholic Diocese of Cairns, whose communications between other service providers and the wider network of PNG families support community building at a wider level \[C\]. 

1.  For example, project RA Nalisa Neuendorf \[F\] used the PNGCC to organise a 2018 workshop for the Centacare programme, ‘Our Place’, because it is the only space dedicated to hosting regular PNG community meetings. Neuendorf returns regularly to help out at the Centre, and to support what is now a successful community\-building programme \[C\]. 

1.  The casual style of the PNGCC \[B\] helps to solidify the PNG families into a community of mutual support. The Centre welcomes anyone that drops by, offering them informal casual conversations and referrals. For example, widowed PNG women began to drop into the Centre for companionship in the different mid\-week groups, often on recommendation of funeral directors and health care professionals and workers who knew they needed friends. 

 The PNGCC nurtures general wellbeing in all these ways. In their work, the Centre’s leaders focus on key issues for sustaining, supporting and building community. 

 **Capacity building** 

 Sykes’s research enhanced the capacities of the community to research its own interests. Each of the two Research Assistants in Cairns completed doctorates and found employment in research and higher education. While working with Sykes, the Research Assistants learned techniques for mapping social networks, as well as interviewing skills. Later they were both re\-employed on an ARC grant to study ageing amongst PNG expats in Australia \[D\]. Vincent Backhaus turned to questions of second\-generation migrant socialisation and education, and completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge. He now heads the Centre for Indigenous Education at James Cook University \(JCU\), having first established a programme to facilitate retention of second generation Indigenous and Pacific Islander students in secondary education \[E\]. Nalisa Neuendorf received her PhD \(JCU, 2020\) with Sykes as an external supervisor, becoming the second PNG woman to complete a PhD in Anthropology \[F\]. Neuendorf worked in the community services sector throughout the project and facilitated community\-building workshops for Centacare in Cairns. She is now employed as a researcher at the PNG International Medical Research Institute in Goroka, conducting projects on community\-based responses to domestic violence as a health crisis.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 To achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal 1 of ending poverty everywhere, we first need to know where the poor are located. Countering previous assumptions, research at King’s has demonstrated that most of the world’s poorest people now live in middle\-income countries rather than low\-income countries. The research has changed the understanding of policy\-making staff in key organisations working to end poverty, such as international NGOs, the United Nations and the World Bank, who now recognise the changing location of global poverty and the importance of addressing national inequality to end global poverty. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Approximately 700 million people around the world are estimated to live in extreme poverty. The eradication of poverty in all its forms by 2030 is the first of the UN Sustainable Development Goals \(SDG1\). To eradicate poverty, it is vital to know where in the world people in poverty are living, understand the causes of persistent poverty and be able to measure it accurately. Only then can international aid organisations, NGOs and governments implement effective poverty\-reduction policies. 

 King’s research has led to a change in understanding about the location and persistence of global poverty and the importance of connecting the measurement of inequality with poverty: 

#  \(i\) The location of global poverty 

 Countries are classified by the World Bank according to their average gross national income \(GNI\) per person as either low, lower\-middle, upper\-middle or high income. A country’s classification determines \(together with other indicators\) how they are supported by global aid funds. In 1990 some 90% of the world’s poor lived in low\-income countries; this understanding of the location of poverty continued to dominate into the 2010s. Research at King’s carried out a statistical analysis of the World Bank’s global poverty data from 2008 to show that the majority of the world’s poor now lived in countries classified by the World Bank as middle\-income countries \[1\]. The figure was 70% for the extreme poor \(defined as those living on less than USD1.25 per capita per day\) and 80% for those living below the general international poverty line of USD2.00 per capita per day \[1\]. A key factor in this shift has been that a few countries like India and China have witnessed dramatic growth and as a consequence have been re\-classified from low\-income to lower\-middle income countries. Despite this economic growth, King’s research identified that there remain large pockets of poverty in middle\-income countries. To model how these poverty distributions might change over time, King’s researchers created a custom\-built model of ‘Growth, Inequality and Poverty’ \(or ‘GrIP’\), representing 97% of the global population in 2010 \[2\]. This was an improvement over previous models because it allowed for the ready comparison of national poverty distributions based on different assumptions \(e.g., the use of poverty data from surveys versus national accounts, or use of varying poverty lines\). Modelling future scenarios to 2030 showed that, even on the most favourable assumptions, there was no strongly compelling case for assuming poverty in middle income countries would easily disappear as countries became better off \[2\]. This research is significant because it means that focusing only on the poorest countries – low\-income countries – will not eradicate absolute poverty \[1,2,4\]. 

#  \(ii\) The importance of national income inequality in understanding the persistence of global poverty 

 King’s research highlighted the ‘poverty paradox’: namely, that when a country’s average GNI per capita rises this does not automatically pull the poorest out of poverty and, in spite of rapid growth, for many countries poverty levels have not fallen substantially in absolute terms \[1,2\]. By demonstrating the link between persistent poverty and rising inequality between the richest and poorest people within countries, King’s research spelled out the need to take into account national inequality in the study of global poverty. This suggests a reframing of the solutions to global poverty away from ‘traditional aid’ based on resource transfer towards policies of national redistribution \[1\]. Further, research at King’s tested in\-depth a new measure of inequality connecting inequality with poverty, called the ‘Palma Ratio’ after Chilean economist Gabriel Palma, who identified that differences in inequality between countries are largely about the share of national income accruing to the richest 10% and the poorest 40% \(this is known as the ‘Palma Proposition’\) \[3\]. King’s research demonstrated that the new measure is much more sensitive to changes at the top and bottom of the distribution, and therefore more useful to policy\-makers, than the Gini coefficient \(the most commonly\-used measure of national inequality\) which partially obscures the changes in the shares of the richest and poorest within a country \[3,4\]. Through successfully advocating for the Palma Ratio, King’s research has prompted an increased focus in the global development community on the persistence of poverty in middle\-income countries and on the role of national economic inequality in poverty reduction.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 King’s research \[1\-4\] has had a substantial impact on how international governmental and NGOs understand the location of poverty and the crucial role of inequality in explaining its persistence. This impact has been achieved through dissemination and engagement with policy\-makers and practitioners both in person and through blogs, social media and working papers. As a result, the research has been used in flagship reports by key international development organisations such as the World Bank \[F\], Oxfam \[H\] and Save the Children \[I\] and has led to changes in activities in two areas: 

#  \(i\) Instead of reducing their poverty alleviation activities in Middle\-Income Countries, international agencies are applying more careful spatial and social targeting. 

 International agencies, notably the World Bank \(with 10,000 staff in 120 countries\) and UN agencies, are responsible for global poverty monitoring and reduction. King’s research has had an impact on the way these agencies are thinking about the location of poverty and tackling poverty \[A\] by demonstrating that the majority of the world’s poor now live in countries classified by the World Bank as middle\-income countries \[1,2,4\]. A former World Bank board member explained that “Our assumptions until then had been that development was about addressing the poorest people in the poorest countries. But, because of the work of King’s researchers, we became aware that ¾ of world’s poorest people are in middle\-income countries. This recognition led to an immediate adjustment in the thinking of official development agencies and made us think about how we should address poverty in middle\-income countries over the next 20 years” \[A\]. 

 For staff at the World Bank this change in understanding led them to place greater emphasis on poverty analysis in middle\-income countries \(MICs\) rather than pursuing strategies to reduce their development activities in MICs. As elaborated by a senior staff member, it forced the World Bank to maintain a poverty agenda in MICs: “Ten years ago, the World Bank attitude was that when these countries graduate from low\-income countries to MICs, it’s no longer about poverty. King’s research on the location of the poor has really changed the strategy. Now we have poverty alleviation strategies in MICs. This type of work made us focus on particular regions within MICs, like the central states of India or northern Nigeria, and think more carefully about who ‘the poor’ are and how best to support them” \[B\]. 

 Further, King’s research which demonstrated the utility of the Palma Ratio in assessing the impact of policies on national inequalities \[3,4\] has contributed to the Palma Ratio being adopted in the statistical databases of international institutions. It is now used in the UN’s annual UNDP Human Development report \[G1\], the UNU\-WIDER World Income Inequality Database \[G2\], the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization reports \[G3\] and by the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) \[G4\]. Using the Palma Ratio rather than the Gini coefficient ensures “that national attention is more clearly focused on what is happening to the income share of the richest as compared to the poorest in the country” \[H:p15\]. 

#  \(ii\) International NGOs refreshed their poverty reduction policy advocacy to incorporate inequality 

 International NGOs including Oxfam \(5,000 staff in 90 countries\), Action Aid \(2,600 staff in 45 countries\) and Save the Children \(1,000 staff in 120 countries\) campaign globally for policies which reduce poverty. Based on King’s research \[1\], their approach has evolved from a focus solely on advocating policies on poverty reduction to one advocating policies to reduce national inequality to better fulfil their goal of ending poverty. 

 As explained by a senior staff member at Action Aid, “Organisations needed a demonstration of the relationship between the necessity of tackling inequality and the ability to reduce poverty. The rigorous quantitative analysis undertaken by King’s provided a real breakthrough in the debate and made the difference in changing the policy position” \[C\]. This is exemplified by Oxfam’s flagship Inequality Guide 2017 \[H\], which references King’s research \[2,3\] and mirrors the 2016 World Bank report ‘Taking on Inequality’ \(which draws on King’s research \[3\]\) and stresses “the importance of inequality reduction in ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity by 2030” \[F\]. 

 In re\-framing the debate around inequality \[1\-4\], King’s research has enabled NGOs to refine nationally\-specific institutional strategies in MICs. Oxfam’s ex\-head of research stated, “The Palma Ratio made us think about the different kinds of inequality and gave us a more sophisticated way to understand it, it really influenced our inequality campaigns” \[E\]. Similarly, the 2016 Save the Children ‘Child Poverty Report’ \[I\] repeatedly cited King’s research as evidence for its insights into the links between child poverty and inequality, using the Palma Ratio as the key inequality measure. A senior member of staff at Save the Children explained that King’s research “is used in the ongoing discussion about how to reduce poverty, and the Palma Ratio supports strategic decisions about which regions and groups \(like ethnic minority children\) to focus on in MICs such as India, Mexico, Nigeria and Indonesia” \[D\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Tony **Kay** has contributed to research on various forms of stretching and their acute and chronic impact on performance and injury risk. He has provided stakeholders in public health a new evidence\-base for the efficacy of different types of stretching, and corrected the common misinterpretation of the negative impact of static stretching on performance and injury risk. Through broad public dissemination to international media \(the BBC, New York Times, and the Guardian, among others\), athletic governing bodies \(Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, American National Academy of Sports Medicine\) and health bodies \(NHS \(National Health Services\) England\), **Kay** has promoted the positive impact of stretching and refuted previous incorrect negative assumptions. This has resulted in national and international health care bodies’ best practice recommendations ensuring stretching is used within a warm\-up routine. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Tony Kay**, Professor of Biomechanics at the University of Northampton, has conducted research on the neurological, neuromuscular, and mechanical properties of whole muscle and tendon structures following various types of stretching \(the most common activity in sport and clinical physiotherapy practices\). **Kay** has specifically examined their effect on force production, range of motion and injury risk, factors vital to athletic and clinical populations. 

 **Kay** has conducted the first systematic review examining the dose\-response characteristics of the stretch\-induced force\-loss phenomenon **\[3.1\]**. This extensive review of over 100 studies, demonstrated that the detrimental effects of static stretching are limited to durations outside of the standard use patterns of both athletic and general populations. A comprehensive review was undertaken that clarified several misconceptions reported within the literature that influenced governing body recommendations and media coverage on the use and effects of static stretching. 

 A larger follow\-up meta\-analytic review by **Kay** compared the effects of the 3 most common types of muscle stretching; static, dynamic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation \(PNF\), on range of motion, performance, and injury risk **\[3.2\]**. **Kay’s** research rectified the growing assertion in some areas that stretching did not reduce muscle strain injury risk. The review concluded that, contrary to previous assumptions, stretching had a protective effect against muscle strain injury, the most common injury in sport, as well as psychological benefits, such as making people feel better prepared for exercise, and when used in the correct \(applied\) dosage, did not decrease their physical performance **\[3.3\].** 

 Further research demonstrated that the most effective type of stretching is proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation \(PNF\) stretching, which commonly results in greater increases in range of motion **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. PNF stretching involves holding the muscle in a stretched position and then performing alternating bouts of contraction and relaxation.  Despite PNF’s greater ability to increase range of motion, the practical limitation of needing a partner during the stretch limits its wider use. However, **Kay’s** research clarified the misconceptions of the mechanism underpinning PNFs superior ability to increase range of motion **\[3.4\].** The name PNF is misleading as it assumes neuromuscular proprioceptors influence increased range of motion following this type of stretch. Using robust methods to examine potential neurological, neuromuscular, and mechanical mechanisms, **Kay** confirmed mechanical and neurological mechanisms, but not neuromuscular proprioceptors, were associated with the changes in range of motion \[3.4\]. This finding enabled **Kay** to develop, test and validate a novel form of PNF that was equally effective but removed the practical limitations of needing a partner **\[3.5\]**. 

 **Kay** has examined the mechanisms, developed novel forms of stretch to improve practicality, and identified common misconceptions on the impact of stretch on performance and injury risk within the literature published by the wider media to influence public perception and practice. The original research and comprehensive systematic reviews culminated in writing a Position Stand on stretching for the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology **\[3.6\]**.  **Kay** has called for an evidence\-based approach to exercise guidelines related to stretching protocols, citing a paucity of high\-quality studies in the field. **Kay’s** research highlighted the common misinterpretation of the findings for athletic practice by researchers that has pervaded into mainstream media and public perception. Through the research discussed above, he has addressed these misconceptions and changed the understanding of stretching for a variety of stakeholders in public health, e.g., NHS.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Kay’s** research has helped to challenge the notion that static stretching durations used in athletic environments has detrimental effects and should be removed from warm\-up practices, and clarified the dose\-response effects of stretch and the maximum safe duration for stretching during warm\-up. His research has also put to rest one of the most contentious issues and confirmed that static muscle stretching exercises can reduce the risk of muscle strain injury, the most common injury in sport. The research findings have been disseminated among key stakeholders leading to a change in both guidance and practice on the effects of stretch. These findings have also been propagated through international media, to increase public awareness of the benefits of this research. 

 **Changing International Coverage and Promotion of Best Practices for Stretching** 

 The dominant media narrative until recently has focused on studies reporting the potentially detrimental effects of static stretching before exercise including negative effects on performance and no injury preventative benefit **\[5.1.1\]**. Four of **Kay’s** studies **\[3.1 – 3.4\]** and his Position Stand **\[3.6\]** have challenged this narrative and having been widely cited in the international media, changing media coverage of stretching practices in exercise, and increasing public understanding of the benefits of stretching and the different types of stretching. **Kay’s** systematic review of the acute effects of several types of muscle stretching techniques on physical performance, flexibility, and injury prevention **\[3.2\]** has been cited in 35 news stories from 28 international news outlets including the *New York Times* **\[5.1.2\]** and *The Guardian* **\[5.1.3\]**. **Kay’s** research on PNF stretching **\[3.4, 3.5\]** was highlighted in *Shape Magazine* **\[5.1.4\]**, bringing attention to the benefits of this type of stretching, something that was not widely known by the general public.  His subsequent research **\[3.3\]** clarifies that there is no negative effect of several types of muscle stretching, when used within a full, dynamic warm\-up on athletic performance.  This has also been widely cited by 11 international news sources including the New York Times **\[5.1.5\]** and ABC Life **\[5.1.6\]**.  For a more comprehensive list of media coverage see **\[5.1.7\]**. 

 **Increasing Public Engagement with Motor Imagery Techniques** 

 **Kay** clarified the misconceptions reported in the media about the negative effect of muscle stretching on muscle strength and further increased public awareness of ways to improve muscle strength through a study he conducted with the BBC 2's Trust Me I'm a Doctor programme based on his research, which had viewing figures of 2,300,000 **\[5.2.1\]**. The study looked at the possibility of increasing muscle strength simply by thinking about exercise \(something called 'motor imagery'\). The study directly impacted participants, who improved their muscle strength on average by 8% \(with one participant increasing their strength by 33.9%\). It introduced viewers to new scientific research on stretching and muscle strength in an accessible way. **Kay** produced two 'Think Yourself Stronger' audio\-guides to complement the programme, which focused on lower and upper body strength. These are available to download free, increasing the public’s access to these techniques **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 **Impact on Stretching Protocol Guidelines for National and International Bodies** 

 **Kay’s** findings on the limited detrimental effects of static stretching for both athletic and general populations have helped clarify common misconceptions that were reported to the general public through the wider media. Prior to **Kay’s** research, some governing bodies, such as The American College of Sports Medicine, recommended the removal of static stretching in warm\-up routines due to the belief that it would cause performance impairments in strength\-, speed\- and power\-related activities, and no injury preventative benefit. **Kay’s** research has been instrumental in identifying the limitations within the research. His systematic and meta\-analytical reviews have clarified the actual effects of stretch within a warm\-up.  His research has corrected previous misconceptions, provided evidence\-based guidance to health bodies and has clarified for governing bodies and athletes misleading information that had previously been inconsistent. This informed new Position Stands and public health guidance on previously contentious subjects: 

-  **England's National Health Service \(NHS\)** approached **Kay** to help develop, write and edit their NHS Choices health advice section on stretching and flexibility **\[5.3.1\]**. This guidance quotes **Kay**, “It is likely that durations of stretch used in the warm\-up routines of most recreational exercisers produce negligible and transient reductions in strength.”  It further cites **Kay’s** research reporting “the reduction in performance from pre\-exercise stretching has been overstated.” **\[5.3.2\]** This was the first guidance the NHS released on stretching and flexibility, and **Kay’s** research was key to the development of their recommendations. According to a Freedom of Information Act request, the page has been viewed 62,061 times since November 2018 **\[5.3.3\]**. 

-  **The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology \(CSEP\)**, Canada's leading authority in exercise science, focused on promoting research and evidence\-based fitness, performance and health outcomes to all Canadians, approved and directly cites **Kay’s** research in their first position stand on the topic that was co\-authored by **Kay** **\[3.6\]**. The CSEP Chair states, ""The recommendation in the CSEP Position Stand is that all components of a warm\-up be included with appropriate duration of stretching. The inclusion of static, or Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation \(PNF\), stretching is recommended and has the potential to positively influence the standard warm\-up routines of a large number of athletes."" **\[5.4\]** This position stand has used **Kay’s** extensive research to enable a change of position stand of CESP, which has informed the National Academy of Sports Medicine \(NASM\) in providing athletic guidance on how and why to stretch from the ACSM \(American College of Sports Medicine\). 

 **The** **National Academy of Sports Medicine \(NASM\)** in the United States, a leading authority in personal training certification worldwide, directly cites **Kay’s** research **\[3.1, 3.2\]** in regard to best practices for stretching. **Kay’s** research is used to inform the narrative including “static stretches of <45 seconds can be used in a pre\-exercise protocol without significant decreases in “strength, power, or speed\-dependent task performances” **\[3.1\]** and that “static stretching <60 seconds is considered an effective method for increasing joint range of motion \(ROM\), and is often thought to improve performance and reduce the incidence of activity\-related injuries” **\[3.2\]**. NASM conclude that “Static stretching can be beneficial in many ways, such as correcting muscle imbalances, decreasing muscle hypertonicity, increasing joint ROM, relieving joint stress, improving the extensibility of the musculotendinous junction, maintaining the normal functional length of a muscle \(length\-tension relationships\), decreasing the chance of injury and in turn enhancing power and strength.” These recommendations use **Kay’s** research to provide an evidence\-based exercise prescription guide to the use of stretching within a warm\-up **\[5.5\].**

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Soil erosion is a global challenge that has serious socio\-economic consequences for food, water, energy and environmental security. Blake and Taylor have developed environmental forensic techniques that reveal linkages between unsustainable farming and forestry practices and soil erosion and downstream sedimentation. Working with the *Joint UN FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture*, they have developed tools that generate tangible evidence, which has been applied to change soil conservation policy and practice, to the benefit of soil conservation and socio\-economic wellbeing in the Global South. Blake, Kelly and collaborators have also developed and implemented an interdisciplinary methodology that measures the social and cultural impacts of soil erosion, which has facilitated co\-production of community\-owned change to more sustainable land management practices on the international stage.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Soil is a fundamental resource that is being lost from cropland at a rate of 12 million hectares p.a. world\-wide, as a consequence of unsustainable agricultural and forestry practices. Erosion and downstream sedimentation have a major impact on food, water and energy security, and yet the linkages between these are poorly understood, and often not clearly defined or recognised in land management strategies. Closing this gap is a key focus of our research \[3.1\]. 

  

 Environmental forensic tools using isotopic soil and sediment tracers can be used to identify soil erosion hotspots. Cultivation and other land management practices alter isotopic properties of topsoil and such differences can be used as ‘fingerprints’ to track and trace soil movement through land\-water systems. These ‘nuclear techniques’ have been promoted by the *UN Food and Agricultural Organisation* in partnership with the *International Atomic Energy Agency \(UN FAO/IAEA\)* to be used both as a decision support tool and a vehicle to develop capacity for land management change in the Global South. Blake and Taylor played a lead role in developing the focus and direction of specific techniques, creating tangible science policy development and soil conservation policy impacts in the Global South, through: 

  

1.  developing new techniques to identify land\-use specific erosion hotspots \[3.2\]; 

1.  developing tools to quantify erosion patterns and amounts \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]; 

1.  delivering specialist training to developing country scientists \[3.1, 3.3\]; 

  

 Most recently, Blake and Kelly further recognised that influencing soil management through a ‘top\-down’ approach i.e. via government policy is not always sufficient/effective to deliver changes to soil conservation practices in situ, particularly in the erosion\-prone and degraded landscapes in the Global South. In these environments, a complex interplay of environmental, political, governance and socio\-cultural factors place huge pressures on natural resources. In response, Blake, Kelly and collaborators: 

  

1.  developed an interdisciplinary research methodology to enable co\-design of changes to land management practices between natural and social scientists and the local community \[3.6\] which overcomes common implementation gaps 

  

 On the technical side \(i\-iii above\), the team has led innovative work around the short\-lived fallout radionuclide, beryllium\-7 \(Be\-7\) \(summarised in 3.4\), which comes down with rainfall and can be used to detect soil movement, export or loss. Through specialist training provision synthesised in an IAEA publication \[3.3\], they harmonised the application of this approach to support soil conservation strategies, exemplified in national forestry management policy change in Morocco \[3.3\]. 

  

 Blake provided the first real\-world research application of Compound\-Specific Stable Isotope \(CSSI\) markers in an agricultural river basin context \[3.2\], a concept promoted by the Joint UNFAO/IAEA programme, in 2012. The research demonstrated how isotopic biomarkers transferred from plant to soil can be used to identify crop\-specific soil erosion hotspots, in this case identifying the disproportional impact of eroding grazing land damaged by livestock. 

  

 Blake has actively enhanced the impact of nuclear forensic techniques for food and water security through targeted training courses \[3.2\] for African, south east Asian and Latin American UN FAO/IAEA networks, both in the IAEA Laboratories at Seibersdorf, Austria, and through hosting UN\-sponsored Research Fellows at Plymouth’s ISO\-certified Consolidated Radioisotope Facility. 

  

 Recent UKRI GCRF\-funded interdisciplinary research \[3.6\] in Tanzania has merged environmental forensics evidence into a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to co\-create change. Working with resident Maasai and local council officers, research demonstrated that extreme drought and focussing of livestock have increased susceptibility to soil erosion. Interviews revealed barriers to change, such as lack of resources and motivation for a community\-based approach to land protection. The findings informed a solution that puts the Maasai at the centre of decision\-making, and helped co\-create a new land management policy designed to adapt to the needs of different communities and locations. This work is ongoing through a GCRF NERC\-BBSRC ‘Research Translation’ third phase. The project was ‘runner up’ in the Guardian Universities Award 2020 for ‘Internationalisation’ and is a finalist in the Green Gown Awards 2020 in the ‘Research with Impact’ category. 

  

 From 2016 to present, Plymouth scientists have been expert members of the Co\-ordinated Research Programme \(CRP\) *Nuclear Techniques for a Better Understanding of the Impact of Climate Change on Soil Erosion in Upland Agro\-Ecosystems*, and have written specific Be\-7 guidelines. Capacity building within this CRP was augmented by the European Commission IMIXSED project \[3.1\] which brought together EU isotopic techniques with US Bayesian modelling for improved assessment and management of global sedimentation problems.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Through their direct contribution to the three components of the Joint UN FAO/IAEA research\-to\-practice framework \(i.e. research development, practical application, capacity building\), Plymouth scientists have made a fundamental contribution to delivering changes in soil management policy and practice at the catchment scale. As stated by the Section Head at UN FAO/IAEA, *“Your research has made a major contribution to the focus and direction of nuclear techniques to support soil conservation policy, and has contributed to fundamental changes in soil management policy and practice at the catchment scale within three of our Member states: Vietnam, Malaysia and Morocco. These success stories highlight the importance of the research\-to\-practice framework in helping to address the global challenge of soil erosion.”* \[5.1\]. 

  

 The impact of these contributions on soil conservation are evidenced in four of the Joint UN FAO/IAEA Member state countries: from top\-down science\-into\-policy impact in Morocco, Vietnam, Malaysia to bottom\-up community\-driven change in Tanzania. 

  

 **4.1 Changed soil management policy and practice at the government level: Vietnam, Malaysia and Morocco** 

 Drawing on his research, Blake led two training programmes in 2014 \[5.2\] and 2016 \[5.3\] for visiting Research Fellows from Member states of the UN FAO/IAEA. These two programmes engaged 46 Fellows from Member states across South America, Africa, South East Asia and Eastern Europe. The IAEA highlighted the significance of the 2014 training event in new techniques and approaches for soil conservation management that led to impact: “ *Through this training, the integrated and combined use of FRNs and CSSI techniques was introduced for the first time on a world wide scale … \[to improve\] the cost\-effectiveness of soil conservation at catchment level, and placing soil erosion control measures where most needed \(precision soil conservation\)*” \[5.2\]. The success and influence of this training has been significant, leading directly to changes in policy and practice at the government level in the three Member states of Vietnam, Malaysia and Morocco, with resultant  benefits for soil conservation and water resource management on the ground, as evidenced by the following case studies: 

  

1.  *Southeast Asia:* Blake’s pioneering work on CSSI tracers and dissemination activities was applied to deliver changes in soil conservation practices in Vietnam and Malaysia \[5.4\], to the benefit of soil and water resource management in both countries. In Vietnam, trained scientists used CSSI tools to assess the influence of land use practices on lowland water quality and identify hotspots of land degradation enabling implementation of cost\-effective conservation strategies \(2013\-2014\) that reduced soil erosion in uplands by 90% and retained sufficient runoff water for lowland rice production. This change in land management practice and reduction in soil erosion has had important socio\-economic impacts at the scale of the individual farmer. One farmer reported an increase in income of over 20%: *“Thanks to nuclear techniques used in determining the exact cause and source of soil erosion, his land is now stable, and his coffee plantation profitable”* \[4\]. In Malaysia, attempts to tackle sedimentation rates in lakes were hampered by lack of information on dominant sediment sources; however, the CSSI tool enabled scientists to identify the exact source of the sediments, allowing for proper soil erosion mitigation measures to be undertaken in cooperation with the State Agriculture Department \[5.4\]. 

  

 *4.1.2*  *Morocco:* Blake’s development and provision of training support in the use of Be\-7 as an isotopic tracing tool \[1, 6\] enabled Moroccan scientists to change forestry management practice in Morocco: *""Using isotopic techniques, we were able to accurately assess soil erosion and the effectiveness of soil conservation practices and make concrete recommendations to policymakers.”* \(Head of the Forestry Research Centre of Morocco's High Commission of Forest and Water and Combating Desertification \[5.5, 5.6\]\). This has had a significant positive affect on soil conservation: *“We have now reduced soil loss in the Tangier\-Tétouan region by 40% and by around 60% in the Casablanca\-Settat region.”* \[5.5\]. These reductions in soil loss in the Tangier\-Tétouan region have been responsible for increasing the economic productivity of individual farmers, again highlighting the impact of Blake’s research and training in socio\-economic as well as soil conservation terms: “ *Since the scientists \[trained by Blake\] helped me to conserve my soil, my farm has been producing 20 to 30% more with less input, and my income has gone up”* \[5.6\]. Much of this extra income is now going toward schooling of the farmer’s four children: *“I am determined to offer them the education I could never get.”* \[ibid\]. 

  

 **4.2 Pioneering change in land management practices at the community\-level: northern Tanzania** 

  

 While land management policy in East Africa is traditionally top\-down, there has long been a history of local governance at the community level that is not necessarily formalised or entrained into state governance mechanisms. The ‘Jali Ardhi’ project \(funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund\) led by Blake tapped into this potential to bring change in land management practice, overcoming implementation gaps between policy and practice. Blake, Kelly and team applied their interdisciplinary and participatory methodology to enable a ‘bottom\-up’ approach to changing land management practices to support soil conservation in remote Maasai communities in the degraded pastoral land of the Lake Manyara catchment of northern Tanzania \[5.7\]. During 2017, this team held 17 interviews and a workshop with pastoralists, farmers, community leaders, representatives from farmer organisations, and local government officials. This enabled the forensic analytical tools to be coupled with social science expertise and local community knowledge, to understand the complexity and barriers to implementation of soil conservation measures, and led to the co\-design of changes to land management practices with the local community. 

  

 Through continued community engagement funded by an NERC Follow\-on grant, Emaerete Village \(a cornerstone study site\) undertook pioneering change in land management practices. This involved: \(i\) new and locally enforced grazing regimes with restriction and exclusion of cattle from severely eroded and gullied communal grazing land around the village from July 2019: *“The plot has helped in managing soil erosion and water run\-offs. The approach of reserving and setting out grazing areas have been used elsewhere in the village, for example, the area around where the demo plot is and in individual areas, people have respect to such places, and they have started seen differences happening at their lands”.* \[5.7 \- Gustav Joachim, Emaerete Village Chairman\] *;* \(ii\) strategic planting of 200 trees in December 2019 to slow down runoff in hydrologically vulnerable hot spots act and trap sediment \- workshop participants from Emaerete have acknowledged that the village have already started witnessing benefits to the land after the trees were planted including prevention of further soil erosion and water run\-off, with the tree\-planting program have extended to individuals households too \[5.7\]; and \(iii\) the formation of a village environment committee to plan future initiatives. The success of the initial tree planting programme has led to further investment by CORDS \[Community Research and Development Service\], an NGO working in the region: *“…they \[CORDS\] came and see that the village have already started doing something about their land…they provided Emaerete with more trees and education”* \[5.7 – Daniel Sokoine, Chairman Emaerete Environment Committee\]. In addition, Monduli District Council wants to extend this programme to other villages in the district, as the problem of soil erosion still poses a challenge to communities in this area \[5.7\]. 

  

 A specific workshop run by the project team in November 2019 with Monduli District Council and all 3 of the ‘Jali Ardhi’ project communities identified the need for, and importance of, new byelaws to improve the governance and protection of degraded and vulnerable land. As a direct result of this workshop, all 3 communities have now established a set of new bye\-laws to support sustainable land use, which centre on \(i\) management of cattle through rotational grazing; \(ii\) fines for grazing cattle in reserved areas; and \(iii\) mandatory planting of up to 10 trees per year by each household: *“At the village level, we have established by\-laws that guides management of cattle grazing and laws that foster tree planting initiatives. We have reserved areas for grazing during different seasons of the year \(rotational grazing\) and if found grazing on one of these reserved areas, a fine of 50,000 TZS will be placed upon. We also have laws that instructs every house/family to plant 10 trees at their residence per year”* \[5.7 – Olais Tayai, Lendikinya Village Chairman\]. 

  

 For Monduli District Council, the overall impact of ‘Jali Ardhi’ is multi\-faceted: *“Experiences from Jali Ardhi project has helped the district in many ways in land use plans and on sustainable land management and agricultural practices including technical education it provided on contour farming practices and the use of terraces at Emaerete and Enguiki villages to prevent soil erosion”* \[5.7 – Roy Mruma, Agriculture Extension Officer, Monduli District Council\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Prof. Agénor at the University of Manchester on the interactions between monetary and macroprudential policies since the global financial crisis \(GFC\), and the extent to which these policies should be combined to promote macroeconomic and financial stability in middle\-income countries \(MICs\), has had a significant impact on central banks in these countries, and several international financial institutions, by: 

-  Building analytical capacity within central banking institutions in MICs and providing a better understanding of key aspects of the transmission mechanisms of monetary and macroprudential policies, and how these policies interact; 

-  Improving the operational macroeconomic models that several MIC central banks use for policy analysis and policy advice; 

-  Influencing the agenda of central banks and international institutions with respect to rethinking the design of macroeconomic policy frameworks, especially as it relates to institutional policy delegation and the combination of monetary and macroprudential policies with other short\-term instruments of macroeconomic management. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research underpinning this case study was led by Prof. Agénor and has focused on the development of theoretical and quantitative macroeconomic models to study how monetary and macroprudential policies interact in an environment where frictions in financial markets are pervasive, and how these policies should be combined to promote macroeconomic and financial stability. Research was undertaken in direct collaboration with several central banks \(Brazil, Morocco, and Turkey\), a leading international financial institution \(the Bank for International Settlements, BIS\), and the Financial Stability and Development \(FSD\) Group – a research network established by major Latin American central banks. One of Agénor’s main collaborators, Dr L. Pereira da Silva, was initially Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil and is currently Deputy General Manager of the BIS. Another close collaborator, Dr K. Alper, was a PhD student at Manchester when the research agenda was initiated. 

  

 The underpinning research focused on \(a\) previously unaddressed modelling issues related to the transmission mechanisms of monetary and macroprudential policies, and interactions between these policies \(\[1\], \[2\], \[3\], \[4\] and \[6\]\); and \(b\) specific policy challenges facing MICs, such as building and maintaining credibility \[5\], and managing large capital inflows \(\[1\], \[2\], \[6\] and \[7\]\). It has provided a range of technical contributions \(summarized in \[1\] for the most part\) related to the specification of financial frictions, the performance of monetary and macroprudential policy rules in macroeconomic models, and how these models should be used to calibrate joint policy responses. In addition, it has brought new understanding of the post\-GFC design of macroeconomic policy frameworks in MICs, concerning institutional reforms pertaining to policy delegation, and the integration of monetary and macroprudential policies with other instruments of macroeconomic management. 

  

 The research shows that to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability, monetary and countercyclical macroprudential policies are largely complementary – even though there are conditions under which they can be in conflict in terms of their respective objectives. At the same time, under some circumstances, monetary policy may need to be more proactive and address directly systemic risks to the financial system through changes in interest rates. Given the difficulty of establishing and maintaining policy credibility in MICs, this means that institutional reforms aimed at delegating a contingent but explicit financial stability mandate to the central bank may be necessary \(\[1\], \[5\]\). 

  

 In addition, the fundamental complementarity between monetary and countercyclical macroprudential policies implies that greater coordination between central banks and regulators is crucial. These policies should be calibrated jointly to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability, using macroeconomic models that account for the pervasive frictions that characterize financial markets in MICs. Coordination helps to internalize trade\-offs and can generate significant gains, compared to non\-cooperation \(\[1\], \[3\], \[4\], \[6\]\). In practice, this means that Monetary Policy Committees and Financial Stability Committees \(which often operate with different time horizons and objectives\) should collaborate more closely to ensure timely decisions and avoid short\-run policy conflicts. 

  

 These insights led to a thorough re\-examination of a widely used macroeconomic policy framework in MICs – and in some advanced economies – inflation targeting \(IT\). While IT has performed relatively well in these countries, in the post\-GFC world it has proved to be in need of serious rethinking. To highlight the operational implications of the complementarity between monetary and macroprudential policies for policy delegation, and their links with other policy instruments \(such as foreign exchange intervention and capital controls\), a new policy framework, *integrated inflation targeting* \(IIT\), was proposed \(\[5\]\). This proposal is the third major insight from the underpinning research.

","
#  4. Details of the impact 

 Evidence of impact relates to the three dimensions in which the research has produced new results and insights: \(i\) improved understanding of key aspects of the transmission mechanisms of monetary and macroprudential policies, and how these policies interact; \(ii\) practical guidance and training for, central bank economists in MICs on the specification of macroeconomic models aimed at integrating financial frictions and regulatory regimes, and how countercyclical monetary and macroprudential policies should be calibrated to promote stability; and \(iii\) the design of macroeconomic policy frameworks in the post\-GFC world, especially as it relates to institutional policy delegation and the combination of short\-term policy instruments. 

  

 The impact described under \(i\) and \(ii\) was achieved through training activities, which covered both theoretical and practical modelling aspects related to monetary and macroprudential policies. With the support of the FSD Group, Agénor provided training, based on the academic contributions mentioned earlier, to central bank researchers in Latin America; regional events were held in Colombia and Brazil \(\[A\]\). Similar events were held for staff at the Central Bank of Morocco \(\[C\]\). In addition, Agénor was invited by the IMF to provide training to its economists based on contribution \[5\]. Regional conferences organized by the FSD Group also helped to promote these dimensions of impact by encouraging knowledge sharing among researchers in Latin America \(\[A\]\).  A large ESRC\-DfID funded project, “Financial Volatility, Macroprudential Regulation and Economic Growth in Low\-Income Countries”, led by Prof Agénor \(Principal Investigator\) and Dr Neanidis \(Lead Co\-Investigator\) also provided extensive training and advice. A key partner in this project was the Financial Stability Department of Western Africa’s common central bank \(BCEAO\). Through this project, Neanidis provided specialized training to staff of BCEAO’s Financial Stability Department in Senegal \[D\]. The final meeting of this collaboration was attended by 60\+ researchers from African central banks and included onsite specialized training on macroprudential regulation, and on the econometric methods used in some of the project’s papers, as well as on the use of the national and international datasets and relevant computer code prepared in the context of that research. 

  

 The impact described under \(iii\) was achieved through participation by Agénor and some of his collaborators in high\-level policy\-oriented seminars and conferences, during which the research material underlying \[5\], and \[5\] itself, was presented. These activities, which all took place between 2011 and 2020, include presentations in central banks \(specifically, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic, the Central Bank of Brazil, the Central Bank of Turkey, and the Central Bank of Uruguay\), at international organizations \(the European Central Bank, BIS, Inter\-American Development Bank, IMF, OECD, World Bank\), meetings of the G20 Central Banks, the Financial Stability Board \(FSB\), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \(BCBS\), the 2018 IMF\-World Bank Annual Meetings, and the 2019 Meeting of the Chief Economists of Central Banks and Ministries of Finance of Latin America, amongst other venues. 

  

 *i **\) Building a better understanding of key aspects of the transmission mechanisms of monetary and macroprudential policies in MICs, and how these policies interact** 

 The research findings have helped to build a better understanding of a range of issues associated with the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the presence of financial frictions, including \(i\) the process through which specific macroprudential instruments \(especially capital requirements, required reserves, and taxes on foreign borrowing\) are transmitted to the economy; \(ii\) the interactions between monetary and macroprudential policies; \(iii\) the need to coordinate and jointly calibrate numerically these policies; and \(iv\) the reasons why integrated macroeconomic policy frameworks are needed to promote economic stability. As evidenced in the testimonials, these findings had direct impact on the central banks of several MICs, as well as a prominent regional financial institution, namely, the BCEAO.  The Director of Research at the Central Bank of Brazil, for instance, states that Agénor’s research papers \[2\] and \[3\] showed *“that countercyclical macroprudential policies, in the form of adjustments in required reserves, capital buffers, or restrictions on bank foreign borrowing, could play a significant role in promoting macroeconomic and financial stability. These insights have played an important role in the way BCB staff think about the combination of monetary and macroprudential policies and the design of the BCB’s new macroprudential stability department”* \[B\]. 

 Other central banks in Latin America have also found the research to be *“highly beneficial in terms of understanding the importance of combining instruments, especially macroprudential tools among themselves, to promote macroeconomic and financial stability”* \[A\]. The Director of Research at the Central Bank of Morocco notes that *“research on excess liquidity… has helped to understand and study the implications of interest rate policy and changes in reserve requirements on bank liquidity and macroeconomic stability”* \[C\]. The former Director of BCEAO’s Financial Stability Department states that the research helped its staff *“better understand the need for policy coordination – not only among macroprudential instruments themselves, but also between macroprudential and monetary policies”* and *“has been critical in determining the set of tools that we should consider in our macroprudential policy framework”* \[D\]. The Director of Research at the Central Bank of Turkey states that *“insights \[from the research\] have helped us to recognize the importance of combining monetary and countercyclical macroprudential policies”* \[E\]. Finally, official publications by the BIS and the IMF refer specifically to the policy prescriptions detailed in \[5\] stating that “ *there are good arguments for including both macroprudential measures and FX intervention as part of an integrated macro\-financial stability framework*” \[F\]. 

  

 **ii\) Improving the operational macroeconomic models that central banks use for policy analysis and policy advice** 

 The underpinning research has helped central banks to improve the operational macroeconomic models that are used for policy analysis and to provide policy advice to senior decision makers in their institutions. The specific technical contributions that have been referred to in the testimonials relate to: the incorporation of financial frictions \(Morocco \[C\], Turkey \[E\]\); the introduction of specific macroprudential policy instruments and their transmission channels \(FSD Group \[A\], Morocco \[C\], BCEAO \[D\]\); and interactions between these instruments and monetary policy \(FSD Group \[A\], Brazil \[B\]\). For instance, the Central Bank of Turkey has incorporated several technical contributions \(discussed in \[2\] and \[3\]\) focusing on combining monetary and countercyclical macroprudential policies in the operational models that it uses to *“provide advice to senior management”* \[E\]. As stated by the Director of Research of the Central Bank of Morocco, the work on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy with financial frictions has served as a *“direct analytical underpinning”* for the specification of the VAR\-X forecasting model that the institution uses *“to establish quarterly macroeconomic forecasts and conduct policy analysis… Results have been published regularly in \[the institution’s\] Monetary Policy Report and used in background policy documents prepared for meetings of the… Monetary Policy Committee”* \[C\]. In addition, as noted by the former Manager of the FSD Group, the research findings on the performance of reserve requirements and dynamic provisions, two instruments that are widely used in Latin America \(\[1\], \[3\], \[4\], \[6\]\) *, “have helped several central banks in the region in their effort to rethink and redesign their policy\-oriented macroeconomic models in a context where both macroeconomic and financial stability matter”* including Chile and Colombia \(\[A\]\). 

  

 **iii\) Improving the design of macroeconomic policy frameworks** 

 At a broader level, the research has contributed to the international debate on how macroeconomic policy frameworks should be designed in the post\-GFC world in order to promote macroeconomic and financial stability. As stated by the BIS Deputy General Manager, the proposal presented in \[4\], which highlights the importance of policy combinations – involving not only monetary and macroprudential policies but also other short\-term instruments of macroeconomic management, such as foreign exchange intervention and capital controls – is viewed as *“influential in the field”* and important for its *“ongoing work on how monetary policy frameworks, and macroeconomic policy frameworks in general, should be re\-evaluated and thought over in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.”* He also states that it will *“significantly help the BIS to promote… the analytical and policy debate on the design and performance of monetary policy frameworks, and \[to\] provide sound policy advice to its members”* \[G\]. The Director General of the Research and Training Centre for Banking Studies \(COFEB\) at BCEAO has stated that the underlying research has *“has helped us at a practical level to rethink and redesign our macroprudential regulatory framework”,* with particular consideration given to *“the role of dynamic loan loss provisions”* \[D\]. Meanwhile, the national central banks of Morocco and Brazil have drawn on the underpinning research in \[5\] to redesign respectively *“their monetary policy framework”* \[C\], and their *“overall macroeconomic policy framework”* \[B\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Due to her research and expertise on the law relating to management of museum collections, from 2011, Ulph led or was centrally involved in a series of significant initiatives concerning guidance and law reform for museum collections. Her distinct contribution has three separate strands: \(1\) changing the guidance and practice on disposals from museum collections in the United Kingdom \(2\) developing guidance on museum closures in the United Kingdom; and \(3\) putting proposals for law reform relating to museum collections in England and Wales on to the policy agenda. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Starting in 2011, Ulph drew upon her extensive expertise in the field of heritage law and personal property law to research the management of museum collections in the United Kingdom. In 2011/12 she held an AHRC/ESRC Placement Fellowship with the Museums Association, for a research project on ‘The Ethical and Legal Aspects of Sales from Museum Collections’. That research led to an academic paper on establishing a due diligence process prior to the sale of collection items **\[R1\]** and to her development of Museums Association guidance on ‘financially motivated’ sales, where a museum sells a collection item with an intention to raise funds **\[E1**, discussed below **\]**. 

 Ulph went on to hold an AHRC Leadership Fellowship in 2014 and 2015 for a research project on ‘The Status of Museum Collections’. Arising out of this project, she published journal articles on the law and ethics of dealing with museum collections **\[R2\]**, on the Museums Association’s Code of Ethics of 2015 **\[R3\]**, and on museum items whose ownership is uncertain **\[R4\]**. She also developed the Museums Association’s ‘Guidance on curatorially motivated disposal in England, Wales and Northern Ireland’ \[ **E2**, discussed below\]. 

 Ulph’s research focused upon responsible management of museum collections. This included analysis of the relationship between law and ethics in relation to acquisitions **\[R5\]** and disposals **\[R1, R2, R4\]** and discussion of whether ethical principles can provide effective guidance in situations where the law may not **\[R3\]**. Her research explored how the need for financial sustainability has created tensions when balanced against an ethical obligation to recognise and protect the special cultural value of heritage items held for the public benefit. The research followed an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon legal and ethical sources, as well as museological, archaeological and palaeontological literature and debates. 

 Ulph’s research led to two key recommendations concerning the law relating to museum collections thatwould set the agenda for policy in the area. First, as her research showed that the law governing local authorities’ museum collections was highly uncertain, she recommended that legislation be adopted to clarify the powers of local authorities in relation to their collections, especially in relation to sales and other disposals **\[R1, R2\]**. Secondly, she recommended that accredited museums, archives and libraries should be able to obtain legal ownership of objects if they have had them in their possession for a minimum of 30 years, and reasonable efforts have been made to locate any possible owner **\[R4\]**. This was intended to address the common situation that museums may not know the owner of certain collection items, so that they cannot confidently dispose of or repair the items concerned or transfer them to other museums \(including in cases of repatriation\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *Changing guidance and practice relating to disposals in the heritage sector* 

 The main purpose of Ulph’s AHRC/ ESRC Placement Fellowship in 2011\-2012 was to collaborate with the Museums Association in developing its guidance on the sale of items from collections. The Museums Association and the Arts Council decided that, with Ulph’s assistance, the general guidance on disposals in *The Disposal Toolkit: Guidelines for Museums* \[ **E1**\]  should be updated . Ulph advised on key aspects of this document – including obtaining the advice of the Charity Commission to the effect that minor items such as medals or wedding dresses could be returned to owners where that was possible, and beneficial to the museum and in the public interest. 

 Ulph was also the main author of a separate Appendix 4 to the *Disposal* *Toolkit* entitled *Additional Guidance on Financially Motivated Disposal*, which relates to sales of collection items \[Appendix to **E2**: Ulph recognised as lead author at p 3\] **.** This guidance was entirely novel, as no equivalent provision had previously been made for sales from collections. Appendix 4 sets out key points that museums should reflect upon at each stage of the process, including legal issues relating to ownership, the obligations of a seller, export laws, and practical ethical matters, such as early con *sultation with public bodies. To quote the policy officer of the Museums Association “Ulph introduced the concept of a due diligence process for all disposals*” **\[E8\].** 

 The significance of the *Disposal Toolkit*, including its Appendix 4, is that the Museums Association’s Code of Ethics requires all museums to follow this guidance. In March 2015, the Museums Association, Arts Council England and other stakeholder bodies issued a formal Joint Statement condemning unethical sales and declaring that museums engaged in financially motivated sales were required to follow the procedure set out in the *Disposal Toolkit*. Arts Council England museum accreditation guidance \( **\[E3\]**, 2019\) includes requirements that all accredited organisations follow processes set out in the Museums Associations Disposal Toolkit and includes a section on financially\-motivated disposal. To quote a senior manager at the Arts Council England, the guidance on disposal and sale “ *are embedded and well\-used across the museum sector*” **\[E13\].** 

 If a sale was viewed as unethical, a museum’s reputation would be damaged, and it would risk losing its accreditation, and thereby the opportunity to apply for government grants. Prior to the publication of Appendix 4 in 2014, unethical sales had been an increasing problem: for example, Croydon Museum was publicly stripped of its accreditation for this reason in 2013, followed by Northampton Museums Service in 2014. Since 2015, however, no museum has been found to have been involved in an unethical sale, and that change can be attributed to the guidance. 

 Ulph went on to work with Arts Council England and the Museums Association in 2014\-2015, when she held an AHRC Leadership Fellowship to enable further research on the legal and ethical status of museum collections. In 2015, she was sole author of a 59\-page document entitled *Guidance on Curatorially Motivated Disposal in England, Wales and Northern Ireland* **\[E2\]**. The guidance is wide\-ranging in scope and advises on key issues for museums, such as how to distinguish between a gift, a loan and a trust, the implications for the museum if it does not clearly own a collection item and dealing with competing claims regarding a collection item *.* According to the Association’s policy officer “ *The Museums Association publishes this guidance on its website as part of our core suite of advice on disposal from collections, and it has been downloaded thousands of times since publication*” **\[E8\]**. 

 The 2015 guidance has frequently proven indispensable to museums seeking to resolve problems with other museums and with benefactors **\[E8\]**. Individual museums have sought direct assistance from Ulph: for example, the Norfolk Museums Development Officer sought advice when the museum was struggling to persuade the owner to take back a railway carriage, and Ulph’s assistance led to important cost savings for the museum **\[E11\].** 

 Since 2011, Ulph has been involved in some 30 workshops organised by the UK Registrars Group, the Collections Trust, and national museums, or regional groups, such as the Museum of London, Museums East and Museums Development North West \(MDNW\). The workshops primarily involved discussion of curatorially motivated and financially motivated disposals, acquisitions, and museum closures. Evidence of the practical effect of these workshops is provided by a museum curator who had worked for Fylde Council in Lancashire: in her words, as a result of Ulph’s advice on disposals at a workshop in 2017, “ *there had been an about\-turn in the views of Council leaders and the idea of selling from the collection had been dropped*” **\[E12\].** 

 *Influencing sector\-wide guidance on museums facing closure* 

 In 2016, Ulph was invited to be a member of a team convened by Arts Council England to consider the response to the High Court judgment in *R \(Hall\)* v. *Leicestershire County Council* \[2015\] EWHC 2985, a judicial review challenge to a planned museum closure. In his judgment, Mr Justice Blake had remarked upon the absence of policy guidance concerning museum closures from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund and the Museums Association. The Arts Council England group produced novel guidance, first published by the Museums Association in 2017, entitled *Museums Facing Closure: Legal and Ethical Issues* **\[E4\]**. To quote a senior manager at Arts Council England, Ulph “ *had a leading and highly influential role as the only legal representative and expert in cultural property law*” **\[E13\].** Her contributions addressed the implications of insolvency, of the public sector equality duty, charity law, and the ownership of collections. 

 The guidance concerning closures has continued to be highly relevant to the sector. To quote the Museum Association, “ *In 2016\-17, Prof Ulph advised the Museums Association on the production of guidance on Museums Facing Closure – an issue that has unfortunately been at the forefront of the sector’s concerns during austerity and more recently Covid\-19. Indeed, this document has become a key part of the sector’s response to the challenges of the pandemic*” **\[E8\]**. The Collections Trust noted the value of the guidance in its June 2020 evidence on the impact of COVID\-19 to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee **\[E7\]**. 

 Ulph’s expertise in relation to museum closures also led to an invitation from Lancashire County Council to a meeting on 3 August 2016 to discuss its plans to close five museums, and to disperse thousands of heritage objects. Participants at the meeting included a council member, representatives of the council legal department, and professionals from the museums concerned. As a result of Ulph’s advice, the local authority changed its disposal plans and Ulph was informed that her input was “crucial” to the decision to retain ownership of certain collections **\[E10\].** 

 *Putting the need for museums law reform* *on the policy agenda* 

 Through her research published in 2013 **\[R1\]**, 2015 **\[R2\]** and 2017 **\[R4\]**, Ulph has advocated for new legislation for England, Wales and Northern Ireland concerning museum collections, to clarify the powers of local authorities, and to address the highly uncertain legal regime relating to ownership of collections. 

 In 2016, she responded to the call by the Law Commission for England and Wales for suggestions for law reform, making the case for the legal regime relating to museum collections to be reformed. Relying on her published research **\[R1–R4\]**, she persuaded the Law Commission that law reform was needed and would serve the public benefit \(see testimonial of Law Commissioner **\[E9\]**\). The Law Commission then consulted the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport, which accepted the need for law reform on behalf of the Government **\[E9\]**. The Commission went on to include museum collections as a confirmed project in its *13<sup>th</sup> Programme of Law Reform*, published in December 2017 *.* It identified the two issues flagged by Ulph – uncertainty as to legal ownership, and the powers of local authorities over collections \- as the main ones it planned to examine \[ **E5**, paras 2.27 and 2.28\] *.* 

 The law reform project outlined by Ulph in 2016 has remained high on the policy agenda in the cultural heritage sector. In February 2017, she gave a presentation on it to a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. At that meeting the APPG agreed that local authority powers in relation to museum collections needed further examination and that there should be new legislation to deal with uncertainty regarding ownership. At the APPG meeting the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced its own independent review into museums by Neil Mendoza, whose report in November 2017 supported an exploration of “how museums might acquire legal ownership of these objects where no owner can be traced after an appropriate length of time” \[ **E6**, at p. 45\]. More recently, the Collections Trust’s June 2020 evidence on the impact of COVID\-19 stated that “ *in view of the fact that proving title to the collections of insolvent museums is about to become very pressing indeed, we ask that the Law Commission be supported to fast\-track this investigation”* **\[E7\].** 

  

 *The public benefit of new guidance and law on museum collections* 

 There are approximately 2,500 museums in the UK of which about 1,800 have become accredited \[see **E8**\]. According to the Museums Association, visitors are likely to exceed 100 million each year \[ [https://www.museumsassociation.org/about/faqs/](https://www.museumsassociation.org/about/faqs/)\]. 

 Ulph’s research is therefore of wide public benefit, in that it recognises and protects the special cultural value of heritage items, by promoting responsible management of museums through the development of guidance and law reform proposals relating to museum collections.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Beeline, a children’s storytelling festival, was established in 2004 by Professor Jean Webb and has since run annually. The festival has impacted on primary school curricula and classroom practice in the region, by promoting the use of children’s own story\-telling, writing as a means of exploring personal and social issues, as well as improving general literacy; it has created opportunities for university students, particularly trainee teachers, to develop skills and knowledge, and has contributed positively to the practice of the authors and artists who deliver the festival. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Jean Webb has a long\-established international reputation in the field of Children’s Literature. She was Executive Board Member of the Children’s Literature Association \(2010\-13\) and of the International Research Society for Children’s Literature \(2013\-17\). She has supervised 19 PhDs, including that of renowned children’s author Michael Rosen, and has examined 35 PhDs in the field. 

 In 1998, Webb set up a research centre at the University of Worcester, The *Centre for Children’s Literature, Literacy and Creativity,* that brought her own expertise in literary criticism of children’s literature together with that of education researchers and practitioners focused on using children’s stories, in both their written and oral form, to develop children’s literacy skills but also to develop their citizenship. 

 In this interdisciplinary context, three key strands emerged in Webb’s \(and the Centre’s\) work: 

-  the first focused on examining the ways in which contemporary literary texts for children engage with key social issues 

-  the second on how children’s literature could be used to engage children with issues of direct relevance to them 

-  the third on how children’s literature could be utilised in teaching literacy to primary aged children. 

 Under the first strand, two key “issues” emerge in Webb’s research: 

-  Children’s health with a particular focus on obesity \(Reference 1\) and children’s relationship with food \(Reference 5\) 

-  Environment including environmental awareness \(Reference 2\) and climate change \(Reference 6\). 

 Reference 3 presents an example of the second strand. The paper explores the ways in which children’s fiction can be used to develop environmental agency in children, highlighting the educational potential of children’s literature to deepen understanding of place and environment, encouraging the belief in young people that they can be and can become agents for change. 

 Under the third strand, Webb worked closely with colleagues in educational research contributing chapters to books exploring pedagogical principles for English Language Teaching  widening children's and teenagers' literacy competences as well as their horizons through insightful engagement with texts \(Reference 6\) and exploring new initiatives in primary language teaching \(Reference 4\). 

 Against this background, Webb established a small children’s literature and storytelling festival in 2004 to carry the Centre’s research into practice. The first iteration ran for a single day and brought 100 pupils from local schools, focused on those children for whom such opportunities were rare, to engage in a series of events with Webb and her team, but also with children’s author Michael Rosen. The festival became a core part of the Centre’s engagement strategy over the next 8 years gradually growing in scale and scope before being expanded further by the University in 2012 when it became a week\-long event. 

 Webb has remained central to the development of the festival, both in terms of vision and content, sitting on the Festival Steering Group since the Festival’s expansion in 2012. Her knowledge and understanding and indeed personal relationships have been key to attracting major children’s authors, whilst her research focus on environmental and health issues in children’s literature have contributed to themes running through the festival programme. Further the Festival’s fundamental and continuing focus on children’s literacy and creativity remains true to Webb’s original vision.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact claimed here arises from a children’s literature and storytelling festival, Beeline. The festival has run every year from 2004 to 2019, halted only in 2020 by the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 The festival has grown significantly over those 15 years in structure, scope and attendance. Since 2012, it has run as a week\-long event in October hosted on the University campus but with a significant outreach element, with components of the festival, specific events and workshops being taken into schools across Worcestershire and into venues off campus. It has increasingly focused on telling stories in all their forms, through the written word \(the festival has hosted many significant authors of children’s literature, e.g. Anne Fine, Kevin Crossley Holland., Michael Rosen, Jacqueline Wilson\), through the spoken word \(e.g. storytellers such as Michael Kerins\), through illustration \(e.g. Petr Horacek, Axel Scheffler\) and through performance, reflecting the research centre’s wider focus on the link between literacy and creativity. 

 The festival is primarily targeted at schoolchildren and at schools in Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Warwickshire and into Birmingham, for the most part primary age but also secondary, although since 2012 there has also been a “public” arm of the festival targeted at families. Data presented in table 1 shows there has been a steady growth in attendance, with around 30,000 children and their teachers taking part in the festival over the period \(Source A\).

 The primary impact of the festival has been on children: 

-  This is firstly through their direct engagement with the festival. The festival always attracts fulsome praise from the children themselves. It brings them into contact with the written word, with the process of storytelling in all its forms and with key social and environmental issues presented through the stories. An independent evaluation of the festival undertaken in 2016 which surveyed teacher’s views on the benefits of the festival highlighted its inspirational value, in particular inspiring children to write, its impact on their learning experience, and on their attainment \(Source B\). 

-  It is secondly through the contribution of the festival to primary school curricula and classroom practice. Many schools visit the festival every year and build it into their lesson planning and overall literacy and orality strategies for the Autumn term. This is highlighted by testimonies from schools who have attended the festival over a number of a years \(Source C\). These testimonies set out the simple but fundamental value of the festival in engaging children with reading and writing; a number of teachers note that many children do not experience reading outside of school and emphasise the centrality of the festival in helping them understand that reading is valued and is fun. They highlight how the festival enriches their curriculum: for example, themes explored at the festival, such as environment, have been used as the jumping off point for class literacy topics on conservation and climate change. 

 The festival has also brought benefits to the University’s own students: 

-  Since 2012, the University’s School of Education has worked with the Festival to provide storytelling workshops to 150 students per annum on the BA Primary Initial Teacher Education. These festival workshops have become a key component of the curriculum for this course recognising the centrality of storytelling to developing children’s comprehension skills and thus the need to develop trainee teacher’s knowledge, understanding and practice in this area. The benefits for the students’ own development but also for their future pupils have been articulated by the Course Leader for Initial Teacher Education \(Source D\). She highlights that feedback from students on these workshops has stressed their value in developing their confidence and their practice. 

-  The festival also offers a Graduate Commission to students in the School of Arts \(UG and PG\). This is an opportunity for a group of students to produce and present their work at a festival for the first time. Students who have been given this commission have gone on to tour their show after the festival and have stated that it has been a critical stepping\-stone in the journey from University to professional practice \(Source B\). 

 The value of the Festival is clearly articulated by the authors, artists and performers themselves \(Source E\). For example, Michael Rosen writes passionately about the impact the festival has on children, matched by Kevin Crossley\-Holland, whilst Michael Kerrins speaks articulately about the same thing but also how it has benefited him as a storyteller. Indeed, there is evidence that the festival has had reciprocal benefits for the authors, artists and performers themselves. This is set out by Anne Fine who speaks about how the festival has provided her with ideas and opportunities to develop her work.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘Land Lines: British Nature Writing, 1789–2014’, a collaborative research project funded by the AHRC \(2017\-19\), produced impacts in three key areas: \(1\) increased engagement with nature writing; \(2\) developed amateur nature writers; and \(3\) deepened public engagement with and concern for the natural world. Two follow\-on projects, also AHRC\-funded, centred on two of Natural England’s nature reserves, Lower Derwent Valley and Humberhead Peatlands, and Castle Howard Estate, a national cultural heritage site. These led to a fourth impact: extended opportunities for access to the natural world, which has improved public awareness of, and involvement in, local and national conservation initiatives amongst schoolchildren and older adults. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Funded by the AHRC **\[RG1\]**, ‘Land Lines’ encompassed three University of Leeds researchers – PI Professor Graham **Huggan**, Co\-I Professor David **Higgins,** and PDRA Dr Pippa **Marland** – alongside two other researchers **,** Dr Will Abberley \(University of Sussex\) and Dr Christina Alt \(University of St Andrews\). 

 The research aims were to explore how nature writing has changed over the last two hundred years or so, and to see what contemporary examples might reveal about our relationship with the natural world today, particularly in the contexts of global warming and rapid biodiversity loss. More specifically, the research involved a pioneering critical investigation of modern British nature writing, from Gilbert White’s seminal study *The Natural History* *of Selborne* \(1789\) to Helen Macdonald’s award\-winning memoir, *H is for Hawk* \(2014\). The investigation was significant in overturning the orthodox Romantic view of nature writing as a *celebratory* form, concerned with giving lyrical voice to the wonder and beauty of nature, arguing instead that it is a quintessentially *conflict\-ridden* form which articulates a linked set of modern crises: environmental crisis, the crisis of representation, the crisis of the alienated self. Also significant was its view of nature writing as an emotionally wrought, intensely *personal* form that reflects individual experiences of nature but, in seeking to share these experiences, opens up opportunities for non\-specialist engagement with an increasingly threatened natural world. 

 **Higgins**’ research, in particular, revealed that Romantic\-period authors were self\-conscious about the inherent problems of representing the natural world in verbal language. Romantic nature memoirs generate a creative tension between writing’s capacity to express the inner self and its capacity to evoke plants and animals through intense observation and description. This tension continues to trouble and inspire authors to this day **\[1\]**. **Huggan** argued in the contemporary context that animal writing, while revealing our \(human\) interdependency with animals, is less likely to reach out to non\-human others than to reveal our otherness to ourselves **\[2\]**. In stressing the importance of modern nature writing as an ecological form involving the complex entanglement of human and non\-human agencies, the project also built on a longstanding body of humanities\-based environmental and human\-animal research at the University of Leeds, represented by **Huggan**, **Higgins** and **Marland.** **Huggan** has published extensively on environmental topics that range from the relationship of the ‘new nature writing’ to earlier literary/cultural traditions, to the rise of today’s animal\-endorsing ‘celebrity conservationists’ **\[3, 4\]**.  **Higgins** has explored how representations of ‘English nature’ in Romantic writing reveal conflicting ideas around personal identity, and how even the most apparently parochial texts are inflected by imperial, global contexts **\[1\]**. 

 **Marland**’s most recent work has exposed the blindness to difference that is a legacy of class\-bound, able\-bodied paradigms of encounters with nature \(e.g. the ‘solitary walker’\), while examining both early and more recent egalitarian alternatives **\[5\]**. Finally, through their own reflective writing, interviews and blog posts **\[6\]**, **Huggan, Higgins** and **Marland** have stimulated important public debates around the politics and ethics of nature writing, and human relationships with the natural world. The ‘Land Lines’ website, and particularly its associated blog, have created an informal dialogue with the public, allowing researchers to communicate their findings beyond a traditional academic context in innovative ways, and providing key public platforms for disseminating project research.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research increased engagement with British nature writing and developed amateur nature writers. It also deepened public engagement with the natural world and opened up new opportunities for access to it. 

 **\(i\) Increased engagement with nature writing** 

 The ‘Land Lines’ project aimed to discover what British nature writing means to people, to ask why they read it, and to consider how it might influence the way they think about – and act upon – an increasingly threatened natural world. Given the contemporary democratisation of nature writing – its opening up to an increasing range of writers and readers – it also examined why nature writing is such a popular form today. Between October 2017 and January 2018, the research team collaborated with the AHRC to design and administer an online public poll to find Britain’s favourite nature writer, with **Huggan**’s research on the ‘new nature writing’ **\[3\]** – a modern form of the literature of conscience that responds to the current environmental crisis – feeding directly into it. Most shortlisted writers were contemporary, and the crisis\-ridden nature of their work was noted by many voters and by members of the adjudicating panel, including **Huggan** himself. **Higgins**’ research on nature writing as an autobiographical form also contributed to the poll, which both encouraged and attracted a wide variety of personal responses.  **Marland**’s work on equality and inclusion was also reflected in some of the choices made, including that of the winning author, Chris Packham, who has explicitly linked his autism to his championing of the diversity to be discovered in the natural world. 

 The poll attracted 770 nominations from the public, comprising 278 titles by 213 different writers, and its online reach was matched by a similarly high level of broadcast media coverage, including the BBC Radio 4 Today programme and BBC2’s Winterwatch, resulting in a total reach of over 30 million people **\[A\]**. A shortlist of 10 titles was drawn up and 7300 public votes were cast. The poll’s result was revealed on the BBC2 programme Winterwatch \(31.1.18\) and was subsequently widely reported in local and national press and social media platforms. Two books in particular came to prominence in the poll. The announcement of Chris Packham’s *Fingers in the Sparkle Jar* as the winning publication triggered a 1107% increase in UK customer orders **\[C\]**, generating economic impacts for its publisher, Penguin, and evidence of increased readership. Packham himself acknowledged the value of the poll in recognising his work, observing that ‘until this point, all of the attention on the book was about the Asperger’s. I put an enormous amount more effort into the nature writing than the Asperger’s. I worked really hard on all of the analogies and similes, making sure they were unique, that they were in a style that was novel’ \( *Guardian* 31.1.18\). The book also entered the top 10 best\-selling non\-fiction paperbacks in the UK for the following three weeks \( *Sunday Times* 11.2.18; 18.2.18; 25.2.18\). Packham’s book, a mixed narrative form that shifts time frames and is witty, profound and heart\-breaking all at once, encapsulates project research findings highlighting the complexity of nature writing as a literary form. The poll continues to be used as a marketing tool by publishers Penguin and also by Hutchinson, the publisher of Rob Cowen’s *Common Ground*, which came third. An additional 3000 copies of *Common Ground* were printed in January 2018 alone, and the publisher has since amended the book’s subtitle to reflect its selection in the poll and the media coverage it attracted at the time **\[C\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Developing amateur nature writers** 

 Since the ‘Land Lines’ project began, its website has received over 50,382 views from 138 countries, with 26,884 in 2020 alone. Its blog \( [https://landlines.project.wordpress.com/blog/](https://landlines.project.wordpress.com/blog/)\) has helped to re\-awaken concern for the natural world among a wide range of amateur contributors and emboldened them to express and share their views, many of them for the first time. Reflecting project research by **Marland** among others, that shows that nature writing has always had a demotic strand, the blog has explicitly encouraged non\-specialists to try their hand at nature writing. As one contributor wrote, ‘I had never really thought of myself as a nature writer \[and the blog\] has given me the confidence in my voice in this area of writing’ **\[B\]**. Another asserted that although she had not yet been prompted to do anything differently, contributing to the blog had opened her eyes to the importance of addressing the global environmental crisis, giving her fresh hope of changing things, ‘respecting nature, like indigenous people do, as sacred’, rather than succumbing to resignation or despair **\[B\]**. In keeping with project research by **Higgins** and others that sees nature writing as an important, ethically charged mode of personal self\-expression, the ongoing development of amateur writers through the guest blog has helped participants shape an understanding of their own personal connections to nature and consider their behaviour in relation to it. In line with the aims of the project, the website has also been used more generally as a resource to stimulate nature writing in a wide range of contexts.  This includes supporting emerging nature writers from underrepresented backgrounds in the context of the new Nan Shepherd Prize \( [https://nanshepherdprize.com/resources/what\-is\-nature\-writing/](https://nanshepherdprize.com/resources/what-is-nature-writing/)\), where the ‘Land Lines’ website is cited as a valuable resource. 

 **\(iii\) Deepening public engagement with the natural world** 

 In March 2019, and in partnership with the AHRC and Natural England, the ‘Land Lines’ team orchestrated a crowd\-sourced Spring Nature Diary, which drew 420 entries from across the UK and is estimated to have reached more than 5 million people worldwide via the Twitter \#SpringNatureDiary hashtag **\[A\]**. In an attempt to return nature writing to its popular roots, the initiative revived the democratising format of the personal diary, drawing on **Higgins**’ work on nature memoir and **Marland**’s wide\-ranging research into early forms of non\-specialist nature writing. Entries were made available as a 73\-page e\-book, with some selected for publication in spring 2020 in a book edited by nature writer Abi Andrews. The diary continues to grow, with the 2020 edition attracting even greater media attention: 1433 page views on the blog; a full\-page *Guardian* article \(17.4.20\); coverage on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme; and 61 media mentions reaching a global audience of 23 million **\[A\]**. In 2020 alone, **Marland** was invited to discuss the project’s enduring themes in 19 radio interviews, including for the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking programme \(July 2020\), and was interviewed for the Danish newspaper Jyllands\-Posten \(20.8.20\) and the US conservation online platform Mongabay \(4.5.20\). Such widespread interest shows nature’s value in the context of the Covid\-19 virus, which has re\-awakened public interest in reconnecting with, but also protecting, the natural world  [https://landlinesproject.wordpress.com/2020/04/17/the\-crowd\-sourced\-diary\-and\-the\-covid\-19\-spring/](https://landlinesproject.wordpress.com/2020/04/17/the-crowd-sourced-diary-and-the-covid-19-spring/). The Spring Nature Diary is now an annual event, hosted by the National Trust, whose Communications Director recently confirmed that the Trust, which is keen to ‘help people access the \[physical and mental\] benefits’ of encounters with nature, is proud to ‘support a lasting legacy of amateur nature writing in the UK’ through continued engagement with the Spring Nature Diary **\[D\]**. 

 **\(iv\) Extending opportunities for access to the natural world** 

 ‘Land Lines’ and its subsequent follow\-on projects reached new audiences through an extensive public engagement programme that offered researchers opportunities to disseminate their findings. In the original project, these included a panel discussion chaired by **Marland** \(23.1.18\) at Redland Library, Bristol \(50\+ audience\); a public talk by **Higgins** \(10.8.17\) outlining his research on Romantic poets’ responses to birds at the Booth Museum, Brighton \(50 participants\); a public reading at Leeds City Library \(28.2.19\) that reflected **Huggan**’s research into contemporary nature writing and the phenomenon of writers focusing on particular iconic animals \(90 participants\); and a sea\-themed family weekend \(14/15.9.17\) at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Living Seas Centre in Flamborough, hosted by **Huggan** and featuring a beach clean\-up by a group of 120 scouts from Barnsley, who would later write about their experiences, and a public reading and children’s workshop, both of them acknowledging **Huggan**’s and **Marland**’s research, by the maritime writer Philip Hoare. 

 Some families attending the sea\-themed workshop subsequently signed up as members of the YWT, while the Living Seas Centre Manager declared an interest in running nature\-writing workshops in the future **\[E\]**. Attendees of the Leeds Library reading stated that the event had inspired them to ‘read more books on nature’, ‘go fearlessly into wild places’, and ‘start a watercolour/nature diary of my local area’ **\[F\]**. The Marketing and Communications Officer confirmed that the reading had ‘helped bring the Leeds Library to a new academic audience’ and had cemented a ‘true partnership between Land Lines, the Leeds Library, and the Leeds Big Bookend’, a local literary festival **\[G\]**. 

 In 2019, **Huggan**, **Higgins** and **Marland** were awarded AHRC follow\-on funding to work with Natural England on a 12\-month project **\[RG2**: October 2019–October 2020, since extended by 3 months as a result of Covid\-19 disruptions **\]**. This project explored ways of encouraging Yorkshire\-based primary schoolchildren and older adults to revive increasingly lost connections with the natural world. Taking **Higgins**’ work on Romantic birdwatching and **Huggan**’s on modern conservation as starting points **,** the project engaged new audiences with the natural world with activities ranging from bird\-tagging and tracking at the Lower Derwent Valley \(LDV\) nature reserve to co\-devised, conservation\-conscious educational materials on birds. These activities provided new experiences of nature \(nocturnal birdwatching, illuminated nature trails\) with demonstrable educational benefits **.** As the Principal of one of the participating schools, Hatfield Woodhouse Primary, Doncaster \(HWP\), remarked, seeing the animals first\-hand at LDV as well as researching them online ‘brought to the children’s attention the dangers of litter to our wildlife. \[The children in\] Year 4 \[were all\] keen to take a more active role in changing this and have taken part in a litter\-pick outside the immediate locality of the school. As a school, we are using the children’s enthusiasm to learn more about the natural world to develop a Forest School area at the bottom of the playing field’ **\[H\]**. Ties to HWP were maintained during the Covid\-19 crisis through artwork featured in ‘Nightjar Nights’ \(June 8–13 2020\), a week\-long programme of virtual events and activities involving British nature writer, Stephen Moss, alongside providing development opportunities for emerging nature writers Sara Hudston and Anita Roy. The programme attracted more than 3000 views on the ‘Land Lines’ website, for which interest peaked during the lockdown months, representing a 150% increase on the previous year. 

 Enthusiasm for the project was shared by Natural England staff at the two participating reserves, LDV and Humberhead Peatlands \(HP\). An illustrated children’s book on the nightjar, *The Mysterious Bird in the Moonlight* \[ISBN 978\-1\-5272\-7829\-5\], co\-produced with the participating schools and now in the process of being commercialised, has become a model that will be copied in other NE reserves, while the educational materials developed together with the schools will be used in other parts of the county. As the LDV Senior Reserve Manager remarked, ‘we are excited by the potential to roll out \[a book series\] across the Yorkshire region’ and have ‘already identified four sites … each featuring an iconic species that could be highlighted in a new book’. Moreover, he said, working together with the ‘Land Lines’ team had generated ‘renewed interest among visitors to our reserves in elusive avian species’, while its greatest benefit had been ‘the multiple opportunities it has given us to fulfil our joint aims to empower old and young alike to learn more about the natural world’ **\[I\]**. 

 A second Yorkshire\-based follow\-on project **\[RG3\]**, equally embedded in ‘Land Lines’ research, is ongoing at the time of submission \(December 2020\), having likewise been given an extension of 3 months. This project revolves around contemporary conservation and land\-use initiatives, with a key role being played by the Castle Howard Estate \(CHE\). The estate, a major cultural heritage attraction, recently committed itself to the rewilding of some of its land and, at the time of writing, former ‘Land Lines’ researchers, notably **Huggan** and **Marland**, are in the process of organising a series of Covid\-delayed art\-based activities designed to draw attention to these new conservation initiatives and the democratising principles on which they are based \(e.g. the idea, explored in **Marland**’s research, that even privately owned land can at least in part be shared\). As with the first follow\-on project, these activities are designed to consolidate conservation work at the estate and other fledgling rewilding sites while also expanding the demographic involved in it. As the Curator of CHE confirmed, ‘\[Our\] collaboration \[with the ‘Land Lines’ team\] has been a valuable opportunity for us to review our contemporary understanding of the estate as \[both\] an amenity and a working landscape’. This has allowed ‘wider audiences to respond to the variety of experiences in the landscape’, while also leading to an enriched awareness of ‘the complementarity between built and natural heritage, \[which\] has been central to our drive for greater public understanding of Castle Howard, past, present and future’ **\[J\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Stroke survivors feel abandoned and uncertain after in\-patient discharge. National policy requires six month and annual reviews of survivors’ needs but lacked guidance on which tools to use to: 1. review all survivors and 2. support those with specific impairments \(communication/cognition\). Working with survivors, University of Manchester \(UoM\) researchers developed, disseminated and evaluated: review and action\-planning toolkits \(GM\-SAT/GM\-SAT2\) and specific outcome measures \(COAST/PRECiS\). GM\-SAT/GM\-SAT2 was recommended in national policy \(e.g. NICE, NHS England\) and used in >20,000 patients, doubling the reviews previously conducted. Impact included alerting GPs on risk of another stroke \(e.g. 11,465 with atrial fibrillation\) and improving quality of life. Worldwide, 600 clinicians/educators registered as licensees of COAST/PRECiS, enabling ‘person\-centred care’ for the most vulnerable survivors with stroke\-related communication/cognitive impairments. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Fortunately, many of the 100,000 people who have a stroke in the UK each year survive and live long lives, often supported by informal caregivers. To ensure high quality life after stroke, and reduce the risk of a subsequent stroke, healthcare providers must: review all survivors’ and caregivers’ needs \(physical, psychological and social\) at six months and annually thereafter, implement action plans, and monitor specific outcomes for vulnerable subgroups with cognitive and communication difficulties. 

 Nationally, clinicians’ compliance with mandated six month reviews was poor, most likely due to a lack of appropriate clinical tools. Existing approaches tended to be clinicians’ assessments of symptom severity/frequency which don’t always reflect impact of disability and survivors’ needs. UoM research aimed to equip service providers with toolkits \(to review patient needs and measure outcomes\) that were psychometrically robust yet feasible for use in everyday practice, and acceptable to survivors and caregivers. The team ensured service users’ priorities were central to care processes to maximise impact, increasing the likelihood of uptake of the clinical tools and adherence to policy. 

 Through interdisciplinary, mixed methods research, with strong involvement from stakeholders including survivors and clinicians, the team led on the co\-development of tools and approaches that elicited individuals’ priorities, identified needs, and evaluated outcomes. These tools contrasted with existing clinicians’ assessments. The key steps were: 

 <ins> **GM\-SAT2</ins>:** Together, the team and stakeholders developed and evaluated a multi\-component toolkit for supporting post\-stroke reviews \(GM\-SAT, GM\-SAT2\) covering common, long\-term needs across health, social and emotional care domains, regardless of whether the individual lives in their own home or a care home. 

 Tyrrell and Boaden selected the components of the original toolkit \- the Greater Manchester Stroke Assessment Tool \(GM\-SAT\) \- through consultation with patients, carers and professionals, and published literature. GM\-SAT was feasibility tested in an observational and questionnaire study of 137 community\-dwelling survivors who participated in a review by trained voluntary sector staff across ten community services in England \[1\]. The study found that the original GM\-SAT was feasible for staff to deliver and acceptable to survivors and caregivers. It identified the types and frequency of unmet needs and that 50% of needs could be met through information\-giving rather than requiring referral on. 

 The toolkit, implemented into routine practice nationwide, was subsequently modified by Bowen and Patchwood through informal feedback and expert consensus meetings, and its reach extended to marginalised care home residents. It was tested across 51 care homes in a mixed methods observational study and via qualitative interviews \[2\]. It proved to be a useful, comprehensive tool that identified important needs, although assessors required clearer guidance on how to use it and suggested further modifications to the toolkit. These ideas were incorporated into the current version \(GM\-SAT2\) which was disseminated nationwide. 

 <ins> **COAST, Carer COAST,</ins> <ins>PRECiS</ins>:** Bowen, Patchwood, Hesketh, Tyrrell, Vail and service users co\-developed and evaluated novel outcome measures for supporting people with post\-stroke communication or cognitive difficulties through literature appraisal, stakeholder involvement to generate content, rigorous psychometric testing and qualitative interviewing: 

-  Communication Outcomes after Stroke \(COAST\) measures self\-rated communication difficulties and their impact. The COAST was interviewer\-administered in community settings with 102 stroke survivors twice in two\-weeks to explore acceptability, feasibility of delivery, and psychometric qualities \[3\]. The companion Carer COAST was validated with 58 informal caregivers \(e.g. partners\) \[4\]. 

-  Patient Reported Evaluation of Cognitive State \(PRECiS\) measures the impact of self\-rated cognitive difficulties. PRECiS was interview\-administered in community settings to 164 stroke survivors, with 66 participants re\-visited to explore test\-retest reliability \[5\]. 

 These studies showed that the COAST, Carer COAST and PRECiS were psychometrically sound, feasible to deliver and acceptable to stroke survivors and informal caregivers \[3\-5\]. They have been made freely available on licence to clinicians and clinical educators locally, nationally and internationally, and to stroke rehabilitation researchers.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Context** 

 Stroke is a life\-changing event affecting approximately 100,000 individuals in the UK every year, many of whom experience long\-term disability and feel “abandoned” after discharge from hospital. Despite national policy to provide six month reviews of *all* stroke survivors’ needs, the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme \(SSNAP\) national audit of stroke care provision repeatedly found that very few survivors received a review. Similarly, a high priority for service users was improved care and outcomes for vulnerable people with specific post\-stroke psychological \(e.g. cognitive\) and communication \(e.g. aphasia\) difficulties. The team used research to: produce tools to improve care, influence national policy and guidance, increase the number of reviews conducted nationally and regionally, and improve outcomes regionally, nationally and internationally. 

##  \(i\) Pathways to impact \- GM\-SAT2 

 The team raised awareness of the original GM\-SAT and expanded GM\-SAT2 toolkits for conducting mandated six month reviews of needs, presenting at key national conferences such as the annual UK Stroke Forum attended by approximately 1,400 professionals, making the toolkit freely available for download from the team’s website and publishing in a leading multidisciplinary journal accessible to service providers. This exposure generated significant interest evidenced by promotion of the toolkit by influential bodies \(e.g. NHS England, British Association of Stroke Physicians\) and policy\-makers \(e.g. NICE, Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party\) to service providers including the national organisation representing stroke survivors \(Stroke Association\). Regionally across Greater Manchester the team worked closely with the Stroke Operational Delivery Network \(GM\-SODN\), supporting them in their roll\-out and auditing of use of GM\-SAT2 as part of their service improvement plan. The research team collaborated in training over 250 service providers in the use of the GM\-SAT2. 

 **Reach and significance of the impact \- GM\-SAT and GM\-SAT2** directly influenced: 

 **National policy and guidance** for Patient\-Centred Care after stroke including: 

-  British Association of Stroke Physicians’ \(BASP\) six\-month review policy \[A\]. 

-  NICE Stroke in Adults, Quality Standards 2, QS7, priorities for quality improvements \[B\]. 

-  The NHS England CQUIN, Commissioning for Quality & Innovation framework supports improvements in the quality of NHS services and patterns of care \[C\]. 

 **National implementation into clinical practice –** GM\-SAT2 is now commissioned for six month reviews by Stroke Association staff in 42 services across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. More than 20,000 stroke survivors have had a GM\-SAT review and annual review performance has almost doubled since 2013 \[D\]. 

 In 2019 Stroke Association said the tool is: “ *helping our staff to work with the person to identify any unmet needs… and to put in place any support they need to continue to rebuild their lives after stroke*” \[D\]. 

 **Transforming care in Greater Manchester –** The collaborative development of the GM\-SAT2 resulted in exceptional uptake in Greater Manchester where it was implemented routinely across all 12 clinical commissioning groups. Annual review performance increased 2.5 fold regionally since 2013 to around 1200 per annum. 

 In 2019 the Greater Manchester Stroke Operational Delivery Network said: *“The exclusive use of GM\-SAT by all providers of 6 month reviews in the region’s stroke pathway has enabled… service evaluation to better identify and understand patterns of unmet needs of patients in the longer term. These data will inform improvements to the provision and commissioning of life after stroke support for all our residents*” \[E\]. 

 **Improving service provider competence –** Clinicians value the use of the GM\-SAT2: “You are better at doing your job, you are more effective….and you can help people to recover more, that’s what we’re here for, isn’t it.” * Quote from an NHS Assistant Practitioner \[F\]. 

 **Improving patient outcomes \-** For 23,000 stroke survivors who received a review by Stroke Association using the GM\-SAT/GM\-SAT2, 150,000 unmet needs were identified and reported to GPs to: reduce recurrence of stroke \(e.g. 11,000 people with atrial fibrillation\) and improve independence \(mobility needs 7,000\) and quality of life \(fatigue 12,000 *\)* \[D\]. 

##  **\(ii\) Pathways to impact** \- COAST, Carer\-COAST and PRECiS 

 The team raised awareness of these person\-centred outcome measures for people with specific psychological and communication difficulties, presenting at leading national conferences, publishing in accessible journals and making them free to download through the UoM’s Intellectual Property team via the former *Click2Go* platform \(now *Innovation Factory*\). This exposure led to collaborations for translations into several languages and generated significant interest e.g. 600 licenses awarded to clinicians/clinical educators worldwide. 

##  **Reach and Significance of the impact** \- COAST, Carer\-COAST and PRECiS 

 Half the 600 registered licensees were from outside the UK. Respondents to a request for feedback reported the measures were instrumental in improving care and recovery: 

###  Improving clinical care and communication with patients 

 *“… invaluable... the COAST is accessible, enabling stroke survivors to respond, even if they have difficulty speaking. … allows patients and their families to let us know how the stroke is affecting their communication and quality of life in daily, real life situations. As such the COAST is an improvement upon … existing assessment tools…. It allows the voices and the needs of stroke survivors to be better heard.”* Professor of Speech and Language Pathology, Canada \[G\]. 

 *“…* *impact of… COAST is increased understanding of the effect of the communication difficulties on the individual’s life. It can… help with identifying functional goals for therapy. With the carer COAST …it has helped … them to open up… This has then led to helping them access support*.” Speech and Language Therapist, UK \[G\]. 

###  Evaluating interventions from a person\-centred perspective 

 “*I really enjoy using the COAST to gauge my patients’ perceptions of improvement. I also like to use it as tangible evidence that they are improving. A lot of times my patients don’t feel like they’ve improved and then after they retake the COAST they report that they do feel they have.”* Speech and Language Therapist, Bermuda \[G\]. 

###  Improving patient recovery 

 Importantly the team solicited feedback on impact directly from a stroke survivor *“Using these tools on the journey of recovery from stroke validated my individual perspective on the difficulties I was still facing. It engaged me to continue working as much as possible to recover and find ways around those difficulties.”* Stroke Survivor \[H\]. 

 **“**We have been able to demonstrate a clinically and statistically significant reduction in PRECiS scores over the period of our 10 week program.”* Senior Lecturer Occupational Therapy, Australia \[G\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

  

 Research by Professor Bale has shaped how political party membership in Britain is represented within news media and by parties themselves. The project has enabled a more accurate representation of the views of party members with regards to key social and political issues, and of the record and conduct of their leaderships accordingly. This has directly informed the discourse of the news media and political parties themselves in two key respects: \(a\) understanding of who joins \(and leaves\) political parties and why; and \(b\) considering what members’ views are on crucial political developments, including the Brexit process and its impact on members’ relationship with party leaderships. The project’s data and analyses have also served to shape politicians’ and parties’ own responses to key issues facing their membership subsequently, including reports of anti\-Semitism and Islamophobia, the contribution members make to campaigning, and attitudes on Brexit. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Bale’s ESRC\-funded research – the Party Members Project \(PMP\) \- has coincided with a dramatic period of upheaval in British politics. Jointly developed with Paul Webb \(Sussex\) and Monica Poletti \(Queen Mary\) and preceded by a pilot project with Conservative Party members in 2013, it initially sought to explain why party membership was declining, but the surge of several parties’ memberships presented a new puzzle to solve \[3.1, 3.2\]. The EU referendum outcome provoked new questions about members’ views on Brexit. Growing concern on key issues also led the PMP to explore the extent of Islamophobia and anti\-Semitism among members and to probe members’ preferences in a number of leadership contests that determined the economic, social and diplomatic policy direction of the parties involved \[3.2\]. The PMP initially ran from 2015\-18, before continuing with a second extension of ESRC funding into 2019\-2020 to cover the 2019 general election. 

 Prior to the PMP, no scholars had been able to undertake research on the members of several parties simultaneously. The PMP has therefore undertaken hitherto unparalleled, survey\-based research on the nature, attitudes, and behaviour of the members of six parties: The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, UKIP \(and later the registered supporters of the Brexit Party\), the Greens, and the SNP \[3.3\]. The PMP is built on pioneering work from the 1990s, but also draws on comparative research insights \(from the *Members and Activists of Political Parties* project based at ULB in Belgium\).  It has pioneered the use of internet panels in order to survey party members simultaneously and – crucially – independently of the parties themselves. In addition, Bale and colleagues also conducted interviews with party managers and politicians in order to look at the demand as well as the supply\-side of membership \[3.3, 3.4\]. Key goals included understanding the characteristics of party members, why people join and leave parties, what members do during election campaigns, and members’ views and expectations of how parties are and should be run, including their views on leadership and candidate selection \[3.4, 3.5\]. The 2015 surveys were supplemented by voter surveys of partisans who were not party members, as well as surveys of members of unions affiliated to the Labour Party. 

 Evidence produced by the PMP has at times lent empirical support to otherwise ‘common sense’ perceptions about party members, but it has also generated findings that have run contrary to the expectations of professional journalists and policymakers. Some key results include: 

-  Members’ demographic characteristics sometimes differed from widely held expectations, with implications for inclusion, diversity and sustainability, as well as leadership contest outcomes. For example, Conservative Party members were found to be overwhelming male \(70/30\), while Labour Party members were much older and middle\-class than discussion of the “Corbyn youthquake” suggested. The surge of new Labour members may in part have been driven by the ‘educated left\-behind,’ but they were accompanied by a lot of re\-joiners who felt they had ‘got their party back’ \[3.2, 3.4, 3.5\]. 

-  Members’ views on Brexit differed sharply from both voters’ views and parties’ policies. Conservative members became increasingly keen on a hard or no\-deal Brexit \(which contributed to Johnson provoking and winning the 2019 leadership contest\), while Labour members were intensely pro\-Remain and Second Referendum \(which had a bearing on Keir Starmer winning the leadership in 2020\) \[3.3\]. 

-  Anti\-Semitism, and the dismissal of such, in the Labour Party was a serious problem, as was Islamophobia in the Conservative Party \[3.3, 3.7\]. 

-  Members’ \(offline\) activism is often related to feeling part of a local party’s social network and/or career ambition, although non\-member supporters do a lot of \(less intensive\) campaigning and could perhaps be persuaded to join if parties cleared up some misperceptions about the commitment involved \[3.7\]. 

-  The primarily ideological, but to some extent social, reasons people join parties nowadays differ little from those first revealed three decades ago \[3.1\]. 

-  Political parties lose as well as gain lots of members. This is mainly attributable to disagreement with the ideological direction their leaders are pursuing, meaning administrative approaches to retention have their limitations \[3.1, 3.3\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

#  Direct influence on journalistic reporting and public understanding of UK party membership 

 Bale’s research has directly affected how British political party membership is reported on, and understood, across national and international news media. This has in turn affected the reception of and engagement with British political party membership in the public sphere at large. PMP has provided an essential empirical basis for evidence\-based journalism in the UK and internationally across a range of issues affecting British political parties \[5.1\]. PMP’s findings have directly influenced how key journalists and commentators – and their readers \- understand the country’s party memberships in reporting on political developments \[5.1.2, 5.1.3\]. Analysis of PMP’s media reach shows that since the project’s inception at least 31 articles referencing PMP findings have been published in *The Guardian/Observer*, 17 in *The Independent*, 3 in the *Financial Times*, 7 in *The Telegraph*, 6 in *The Times* \(including Red Box\), 2 in the *Washington Post*, 4 in the *Daily Mail*, 5 in the *Daily Express*, 4 in the *Daily Mirror* and 6 in *The Sun*. In addition, BBC News and Sky News have posted at least 6 and 3 articles, respectively, using PMP findings. Many articles have also been published in alternative publications such as Huffington Post, *New Statesman*, LSE Blogs and partisan sites such as Labour List and ConservativeHome \[5.3\]. Bale and his colleagues have also been able to trail a significant amount of the project’s findings \[3.1\-3.7\] across a range of media outlets in advance of their \(conventionally slower\) academic publication, doing so 7 times in *The Guardian* \(print readership: 3,600,000; circulation: 111,953\), *The Independent*, *New Statesman* \(circulation: 37,828\), and the *Washington Post*, among others \[5.2\]. 

 PMP’s findings about the demographics \(relatively middle\-aged, well\-heeled, and well\-educated\) and attitudes \(even more socially\-liberal than left\-wing\) of Labour Party members – especially newer members who turned out, for instance, not to be so young – helped to explain and even predict Corbyn’s re\-election as party leader in 2016. As Tom Edgington, Senior Broadcast Journalist for BBC News attests, PMP ‘has proved to be a highly valuable resource for engaging storytelling. It’s offered audiences a unique insight into attitudes toward party membership – something that would have otherwise been very difficult to capture. This has been especially important in providing greater context and understanding to the leadership victor\[y\] of Jeremy Corbyn’ \[5.1.13\]. Similarly, the project’s findings about the demographics \(relatively old and well\-off, not so well educated\) and attitudes \(even more socially conservative than they were economically Thatcherite\) of Conservative Party members helped to explain and even predict Johnson’s election in 2019. As Heather Stewart, Political Editor of *The Guardian* has stated: ‘when the Project's research revealed that Conservative grassroots members rejected Theresa May's ""Chequers"" Brexit deal, preferring to run the gauntlet of no deal. It was that tide of opinion that eventually propelled Boris Johnson to the premiership’ \[5.1.4\]. 

 From the summer of 2017 onwards, the project showed that Labour Party members were overwhelmingly pro\-Remain and pro\-Referendum, and much more so than Labour voters and the Labour leadership, helping to explain and to intensify the latter’s dilemma over Brexit. The empirical basis of this finding had a significant influence on journalists’ reporting, as Anushka Asthana of ITV’s Peston has explained: ‘The stand\-out example of the Project making a difference would be the teams’ findings in the summer of 2017 pointing to just how pro\-EU Labour’s membership really was – something many guessed but until then had no hard data on’ \[5.1.5\]. In addition, the finding released in January 2019, that Conservative supporters had swung dramatically towards not just a hard Brexit but actually favoured a “no deal” was something of a game\-changer, as Sam Coates, Deputy Political Editor of Sky News explains: ‘the Project showing in January 2019 that most of Theresa May’s own rank and file preferred no deal to her deal had a big impact on Tory MPs’ \[5.1.6\]. 

 In January 2020, when many members were still reserving their judgement when asked unprompted, media \(not least SkyNews and *The Guardian*\) reported the projects’ discovery that Keir Starmer was the standout front\-runner in the Labour Party leadership contest. Until that point, much media reporting had assumed that a continuity Corbyn candidate would be performing more strongly. There was also a presumption that different leadership qualities were valued more highly by the supporters of particular candidates and that Momentum members were not as keen on the organisation’s preferred candidate as its executive.  PMP research on the Lib Dems also made it clear that Ed Davey was the clear front runner among members in the contest, which would take place later that year, even to the point of getting very close to the actual result \(see supporting statements from journalists \[5.1.6\-5.1.9\]; see also \[5.4\]\). 

 With respect to anti\-Semitism, the project showed that the problem within the Labour Party – at the grassroots level – was a real one, although one about which a substantial proportion of members were effectively in denial, choosing instead to see the issue as an attack on their leader. The project’s discovery of previous levels of Islamophobic prejudice among a substantial minority of Conservative Party members, at least in terms of their willingness to see more Muslim candidates selected, suggested that concerns voiced by, among others, Sayeeda Warsi, were borne out in reality \[3.1\]. The import of this finding is reflected in the testimony of several leading journalists, including Nick Cohen of *The Observer*, who writes, ‘I have found the Party Members Project to be an incredibly useful reference point.  In writing about racism, it has given me real data rather than anecdotal observations on the extent of Islamophobia on the right and anti\-Semitism on the left. At a time when party members have so much power over MPs and leaders, it provides an anchor in fact for anyone discussing Westminster politics’ \[5.1.11\]. 

 In February 2020, media reported the project’s finding that a very substantial minority of Labour members blamed not only Brexit for the party’s defeat, but a supposedly biased mainstream media. For Sienna Rodgers, the editor of LabourList, PMP has been ‘incredibly useful to us in helping to provide our already well\-informed readers with some research\-backed evidence on what the party at the grassroots is thinking, whether it be about particular issues, like Brexit, or about the leadership’ \[5.1.12\]. 

 Based on the evidence and its reach, the project’s extensive media engagement has thus shaped and advanced public understanding. Key outlets on which the research has been featured heavily reach millions of people, including ITV’s Peston, where Bale and his colleague were the first to be awarded “geek of the week” three times, which has a live\-TV audience of over half a million \[5.1.14\]. Journalists tweeting about PMP’s research have on average 181,000 followers, and social media analysis suggests that the project’s research findings appeared nearly 25 million times on users’ feeds as a result \[5.3\]. The project made two contributions to the BBC’s news website on the Tory members who would be electing the next leader, which received well over 1 million hits. As the senior BBC journalist Tom Edgington attests in respect of the first website contribution, there were ‘total page views: 1,141,413 and total engagement: 1:00.  Engagement is how long someone stays on the page before they click away. Typically, we’d be happy with anything over 30 seconds. So, to get a full 1:00 is incredibly strong and very rare. It shows that most readers were really engaged with your story and many got to the end of the article. In terms of youth reach, 33.2% of readers were between 18\-34 years old. Anything over is 30% good. And to get 33%, especially for a politics story, is excellent’ \[5.1.13\]. 

#  Improving understanding of party membership amongst Politicians, Political Parties and Parliament, and enhancing their engagement with members 

 Bale’s research has transformed how political parties understand the views of their membership, and how they engage with them accordingly. The project team was invited to give direct, face\-to\-face briefings and presentations at the party HQs of four of the six parties surveyed: Labour, the Conservatives, the Lib Dems and the Greens. The briefings/consultancy for political parties also allowed party managers to better understand their own members and improve the way they engaged with them \[see statements from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives \[5.4.1\-5.4.5\]. As Anita Boateng, former Special Advisor to the Chairman of the Conservative Party makes clear, ‘at a time when the party was looking closely at recruitment and retention of members, I was particularly interested in the work of the Party Members Project.  We invited one of the members of the team to come in and present to us in CCHQ on the demographics, attitudes and motivations of Conservative Party members. The presentation proved a really useful additional contribution to our understanding of our members and potential members and helped inform our strategy going forward’ \[5.4.1\]. 

 The PMP’s findings on anti\-Semitism in the Labour Party, initially submitted to \(but not – perhaps significantly – quoted in\) the Chakrabati Inquiry, informed a parliamentary inquiry. The Home Affairs Select Committee \(HASC\) Report on Antisemitism in the UK \(HC136, 16 October 2016\) cited the research, and it clearly informed the serious criticism of the party’s handling of the issue in addition to the recommendation that parties use the suggested reforms in their training and disciplining of activists and members \[5.5\]. The Committee on Standards in Public Life’s Report on Intimidation in Public Life \(Cm9543, December 2017\) also cited PMP’s research on social media use by party members, which informed the Committee’s recommendations that both platforms and parties seek to regulate and discourage such behaviour far more rigorously than they have in the past \[5.6\]. 

 Finally, the research findings also directly shaped the authoritative House of Commons Library Research Briefings on Membership of UK Political Parties \(SN05125\). Each of these periodic reports, which breakdown developments in and the demographics of party membership throughout the country, cited the research over five full pages with graphics \[5.7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The effectiveness and efficiency of university\-level mathematics teaching and the training of teachers and researchers was increased by new algorithms, data and software developed in St Andrews which enhanced the performance, mathematical scope and usability of software systems widely used in teaching.  This had an impact on courses given to at least 5,700 people \(students\) at least 27 institutions in 23 countries, as well as weekly on many of the 20,000 people \(users\) of the CoCalc web\-based  [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) and  [course management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) platform for  [computational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics). 

 Advanced mathematics, and mathematical topics in related disciplines, are an essential, but pedagogically challenging, part of Higher Education teaching in programmes of study ranging from pure mathematics through computer science to physics, chemistry and engineering. The use of software that automates routine calculations is an established technique in mathematics education at all levels. The software allows learners to “come to grips” with the concepts directly without becoming “bogged down” in technical details of calculation. The GAP system, which encapsulates our research, is widely used for this purpose, both directly and through other systems and online services that incorporate it. 

 The specific research results listed in section 2 extend GAP’s capabilities into new mathematical areas, which were the main topics of courses delivered to over 700 people \(students\), speed up critical aspects of the system allowing students to explore larger and more informative examples, add databases which are a valued source of examples for teaching, and link GAP to other systems providing a better experience for teachers and students. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research insights from the School of Computer Science can be loosely divided into four groups: 

 **1. Algorithms for semigroups:** St Andrews research on algorithms for semigroups enabled practically usable software for wide\-ranging computation in this important mathematical area. **Semigroups** are a key mathematical structure, used to describe sets of transformations of physical and abstract objects and the ways in which they combine. \[R1\] is a foundational paper in the area, which has led to at least 30 published research papers \(2000\-2018\) from St Andrews, 14 St Andrews PhD theses and 5 GAP extension packages with authors from St Andrews. 

 **2. New and faster algorithms for algebraic problems:** St Andrews research in algorithms for permutation groups and minimal polynomials sped up these calculations dramatically. **Permutation groups** are ubiquitous in mathematics, describing symmetries of objects and structures. Jefferson et al. \[R2\] developed, implemented and released a family of new algorithms for some central problems in the area, outperforming the best existing implementations massively in some cases. On one test suite in \[R2\], it completed three times as many examples as the previous state of the art, in one\-fifth of the time. These algorithms are widely used “behind the scenes” in mathematical software systems, so improving them speeds up user calculations in areas such as matrix groups, combinatorics and semigroups, not just those directly involving permutation groups. Computing **minimal polynomials** is a similarly fundamental problem for matrices. In 2008, Neunhöffer and Praeger \(Western Australia\) developed \[R3\] and implemented a new efficient algorithm, up to 200 times faster on difficult cases from real\-world problems \(examples in \[R3\]\). This algorithm speeds up many common computations used in areas such as error\-correcting codes and cryptography as well purely mathematical applications. 

 **3. New Classification Results:** St Andrews researchers led by Kelsey in 2012 classified all **the 12,418,001,077,381,302,684 non\-equivalent semigroups** of order 10 and constructed a searchable library of the 1,843,973,431 of orders up to 8 \[R4\]. Roney\-Dougal extended the classification of **all primitive permutation groups** from degree 1000 to degree 4095, adding 16,692 new groups \[R5\]. Permutation groups are ubiquitous mathematical objects, describing ways in which a collection can be reordered while preserving some property, and primitive permutation groups are foundational ones from which all others are built. 

 **4. Linking Mathematical Software Systems Together:** St Andrews researchers \(with collaborators\) developed new approaches to linking mathematical software systems to each other and to associated tools such as modern user interfaces. Doing this, without compromising speed of computation or correctness of results, is a challenging and long\-standing problem. St Andrews researchers made major progress on this problem in two European projects: SCIEnce \(2006\-2011\) and OpenDreamKit \(2015\-2019\) \[R6\]. Our research has made major contributions to efficient, mathematically correct and reliable links between diverse mathematical systems and popular user interface tools, such as the Jupyter Notebook system. 

 These results form part of a much larger body of ongoing research in algorithms, systems and applications around computational algebra, hosted since 2000 in an interdisciplinary research centre \(CIRCA – the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra\) which bridges the University’s School of Mathematics and Statistics and the School of Computer Science. One pillar of that research is our ongoing role as a major centre for the development of the GAP \(Groups, Algorithms, Programming\) system described below. Twenty\-five St Andrews researchers have contributed directly to the project, publishing 34 journal and conference papers featuring improved algorithms or system features incorporated in GAP.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\).** 

 By adding new capabilities for computing with semigroups, new and faster algorithms for key problems, new databases and new links to other systems, our research insights have enhanced software widely used in teaching and learning of advanced mathematics. Through this, our research has changed the practices of advanced mathematics teaching at more than 27 institutions in 23 countries, affecting courses taken by over 5,700 people \(students\), improving the students' learning and understanding.  Specifically, more teachers are using computational algebra software to teach advanced mathematics, enabling them to make their courses more investigative and student\-centred, leading to improved learning and understanding in their students. Our research has also improved the experience, learning and understanding of the approximately 20,000 weekly users of the CoCalc web\-based  [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) and  [course management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) platform for  [computational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics). 

 **Pathway from Research to Impact** 

 The pathway from our research to this impact runs through an open\-source software system called  [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) \(Groups, Algorithms, Programming\) \[S1\]. GAP is a software package which allows the user to calculate interactively with complex mathematical objects, such as groups, semigroups, permutations, matrices and so on. It is highly extensible and, with appropriate extension packages, has functionality covering much of abstract algebra, combinatorics, representation theory and other key disciplines in pure mathematics. Our research insights are realised as algorithms, databases and software technologies, which are distributed as part of GAP, which is itself used for teaching. 

 Our development of new algorithms for computing with semigroups has expanded GAPs capabilities in semigroup theory from almost nothing, making it possible to use GAP for teaching \(as well as researching\) this key topic. As one measure of the scale of this expansion, since 2012 \(the oldest version available, but already including some of our work\) the number of documentation entries containing “semigroup” in their names increased from 700 to over 2,000 \[S2\]. This expanded capability provided the basis for subsequent changes in teaching practice and student learning. 

 Our new algorithms for permutation groups and linear algebra increased the speed of key computations across the whole system. This allows students to work flexibly and interactively with more and larger examples of the mathematical objects they are studying. This is especially important as the smallest examples in these fields \(the only ones accessible to hand computation or with previous generations of software\) are often atypical and can mislead students. A professor of mathematics at Colorado State University \(Fort Collins\) emphasised this in his letter, writing "" *The use of computation makes it feasible to \[study examples\] in cases that are significantly larger than what could be done by hand, and allows \[students\] to study not only individual phenomena, but also to avoid misguided intuition, based on the availability of only small examples*"" \[S3, p. 5\]. A professor of algebra from the University of Granada wrote, "" *fast and responsive performance benefits their educational use, for example by allowing students to experiment with larger examples gaining deeper understanding*"" \[S3, p. 4\]. 

 Adding databases to the system builds still further on the ability of students to work with examples, allowing them to systematically study all examples and to look for patterns. It also increases the efficiency of teaching by making it trivial for the teacher to identify and supply examples for the students. A lecturer at Vrije Universiteit, Brussels, wrote "" *Through the study of examples using the databases available in GAP... a natural approach to the formulation of general theorems can be developed.""* \[S3, p. 6\]. 

 Finally, thanks to our research on linking mathematical software, GAP is now also part of the broader SageMath mathematics software system \[S4\] and the CoCalc on\-line scientific collaboration and teaching system \[S5\], enabling thousands of additional students to benefit from its capabilities. As a direct output of our research \[R6\], GAP can now be used though the Jupyter notebook user interface, which many students and teachers are familiar with from the popular Python programming language and which is widely used in data science and scientific data analysis. 

 **Reach of Impact** 

 Both GAP and SageMath are open\-source software systems, which anyone is free to download and use, without informing the authors. Evidence for the reach of the impact through their direct use is thus unavoidably incomplete, based on surveys, requests for support and publications. Our most recent survey of the use of GAP, SageMath and CoCalc in teaching \[S6\] received 46 responses between 22 September 2020 and 01 December 2020, describing teaching in 23 countries to a total of 5,757 people \(students\) between August 2013 and December 2020. Of particular note are courses delivered to over 2,500 people \(students\) in at least seven African countries. Teaching included undergraduate \(26 reports\), postgraduate \(26 reports\) and professional development courses \(10 reports\). Among these are 740 people \(students\) taking computer supported courses in semigroup theory, something that would have been impossible without our research. Earlier data collections through the GAP website \[S7\] and GitHub \[S8\] definitively identify 7 additional sites, in 7 additional countries where GAP has been used in teaching between August 2013 and December 2020. 

 GAP and SageMath are key components of the CoCalc online service \[S5\] which provides additional tools for teaching, course management, assessment, etc. As of February 2020, CoCalc had over 20,000 unique weekly logins, growing at about 20% per year \[S9\]. 

 **Significance of impact** 

 Evidence for the significance of the specific changes flowing from our insights is found in our survey \[S6\]. As well as the 740 students whose semigroup theory courses would simply have been impossible without our algorithms and software, 88% of responses agreed that the ability to explore larger examples was an important or very important benefit of using the systems, and 72% said that the performance and responsiveness of the software was a significant factor in delivering the benefits of the software for their teaching. These benefits flow from our new and faster algorithms. Mathematical databases were rated “very” or “extremely” important by 50%. The significance of our work on linking software is seen in the extent of use of GAP via SageMath and CoCalc \(52% of those who responded to our survey use it this way, and we know \[S9\] that the majority of CoCalc users use SageMath\). 

 Evidence of widespread use and high value placed on computational tools for teaching in this area is found in the publication by independent authors, of textbooks for courses relying on the use of GAP and SageMath.  We know of 8 editions of textbooks published between August 2013 and December 2020 which rely on GAP \[S7\] and 24 which rely on SageMath \[S10\]. In France, SageMath \(under its previous name “Sage”\) is on the national list of software permitted for the “Aggregation”, the qualifying examination for secondary school teachers \[S11\]. 

 A pedagogical research project in 2018 at the Universitat d’Alacant and Universitat Politècnica  de València studied the use of GAP in courses on Group Theory and Coding Theory. It reported a positive experience and included a recommendation that the University "" *Integrate GAP classes into the subject from the beginning, thus giving time to ... see more examples and applications of the program*"" \[S12, p. 8, our translation\]. 

 Further evidence is found in the letters \[S3\] submitted as part of the follow\-up to the survey: 

 ""*I have made the experience that by giving the students the possibility to work concretely with the new algebraic objects they have seen in the courses the motivation to confront abstract algebraic problems hugely increases. .....* 

 *The interplay of theory with the calculations of more complex examples, for which manual computations are overly technical or simply not feasible, allows a much deeper insight into the underlying algebra*."" \[S3, p. 6\] 

 *“ … the possibility of using structures as groups, rings and fields either finite or infinite allows the student to implement cryptographic protocols in platforms which the students could not construct themselves in a computer without an extraordinary effort.”* \[S3, p. 3\] *\(*describing teaching a cryptography course\). 

 ""*The combination of Sagemath with Jupyterlab is a useful tool that makes possible to combine GAP with other mathematical tools, for both the use of students \(for teamwork and labs\) and for the use of teachers in the class room. It offers a learning by experimentation which would be hardly achieved without these tools. ..... the inclusion of GAP in Sagemath has allowed to interact groups with other mathematical objects* "" \[S3, p. 2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Excessive teacher workload is linked to challenges with teacher recruitment, retention, job satisfaction and mental health. Until recently there has been little robust evidence illustrating how many hours teachers work per week, what they spend time upon, how this has changed over time and how England compares with other countries’ education systems. Research by Jerrim and colleagues has foregrounded the issue, underpinned national debate and resulted in substantial policy action, including the Department for Education establishing independent review groups; committing to measuring teacher workload biannually; publishing advice and guidance to schools on how workload can be reduced; and funding collaborative projects to reduce workload. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Initial research on teacher workload was based upon the Teaching and Learning International Study \(TALIS\) 2013 project. This was a collaboration between the UCL Institute of Education \(IOE\) and RM Education \(survey provider\), commissioned by the Department for Education **\(R1\)**. The work involved collecting questionnaire data from a nationally\-representative sample of around 150 schools and 2,500 lower secondary school teachers in England. The same survey was also conducted in over 30 other countries. Teachers were asked various questions about their workload, including total working hours as well as time spent on tasks such as planning and marking. The key finding underpinning the impact was that lower secondary teachers in England work longer hours each week than teachers in most other developed countries **\(R1\)**. Moreover, this difference in workload was not due to teachers in England having more contact teaching time with their pupils. It was driven by their having more marking, lesson preparation, management and administrative duties than teachers in other parts of the world **\(R1\)**. 

 Jerrim and colleagues assisted in designing the survey, including adapting the questions for use within the context of the English education system, as well as developing and testing a set of additional questions \(many about teacher\-workload\) that were added to the TALIS survey for England **\(R2, R3\)**. They then analysed the data to produce the TALIS 2013 national report for England, published in June 2014. This Department for Education Research Report, written by Micklewright, Jerrim, Allen and Jenkins, is where the key findings detailed above were first documented **\(R1\)**. Moreover, several of the new questions that the IOE researchers initially developed have been adapted and integrated to be asked in other countries in the 2018 edition of the OECD’s TALIS survey **\(R2\)**. 

 The team also evidenced the impact of excessive workload on teacher wellbeing and job satisfaction **\(R4\)**, highlighting how workload is not simply about number of hours worked; it is also about teachers feeling in control of their work. Teachers who report their workload as ‘ *unmanageable*’ have lower levels of job satisfaction. 

 Sims and Jerrim were then commissioned by the Department for Education to produce a follow\-up analysis, using data from the 2018 wave of TALIS \(GBP102,600\). The main output from this project was a 240\-page report released in June 2019. This provided new evidence about teacher workload, and whether progress had been made in reducing the workload of lower\-secondary teachers between 2013 and 2018, including the first international comparative evidence on primary teacher workload. It showed that as for secondary teachers, the workload of primary teachers in England is high by international standards **\(R2\)**. 

 In January 2020, Jerrim and colleagues published a report, based on research funded by the Nuffield Foundation \(GBP232,810\), which extends their research by adding new sources of information. These include the UK Labour Force Survey and the UK Time Use Diaries as well as the Teacher Tapp phone app. Analysis of these rich data resources suggests that teachers were working about as many hours in 2015 as they were in 2000. In addition, the time they spend on non\-teaching tasks still exceeds that spent teaching by the same margin, suggesting that policy initiatives have so far failed to reduce teachers’ working hours and that more radical action may need to be taken in order to fix this problem **\(R5\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 It has long been accepted that teaching is a demanding, if rewarding, profession. Yet for a long time there was little robust, nationally representative evidence for England illustrating just how many hours teachers work per week, the activities that they spend this time upon, how this has \(or has not\) changed over time and how this compares to other education systems across the world. Over the past seven years, Jerrim and colleagues have been filling this gap in the evidence base via quantitative analysis of several large\-scale data sources, resulting in important changes to government policy and significant impact on public discourse as a result of widespread media coverage in specialist and general channels. 

 The initial breakthrough came in 2014 when the IOE team authored the national Teaching and Learning International Study \(TALIS\) 2013 report for England which highlighted the striking finding that lower secondary school teachers in England were working much longer hours than teachers in other countries **\(R1\)**. This was the first time that this had been established using internationally comparable data. Evidence of the impact of the research within the Department of Education can be found in the 2016 report on Teacher Workload by The Education Policy Institute **\(S1\)**. The lead author of this government report is a former Government Economist who was head of the Teachers and Teaching Analysis team at the time the TALIS 2013 report was written and released. He summarises the chain of events in the introduction: 

 *‘\[TALIS 2013\] showed that \[England’s\] lower secondary \(key stage 3\) teachers worked significantly longer hours than their counterparts in most other jurisdictions \(OECD, 2014a\). In response, the then Secretary of State for Education Nicky Morgan launched the Workload Challenge in 2014. This obtained views from over 40,000 school staff on the causes of, and solutions to, the problem of unnecessary workload \(Gibson et al., 2015\). In response to the concerns raised, the Government announced a new protocol to prevent hasty implementation of curriculum changes \(Department for Education, 2015b\), and Ofsted provided guidance to make clear that they did not expect teachers to be carrying out specific and burdensome activities for the sake of satisfying inspectors \(Ofsted, 2015\). It also launched three profession\-led policy reviews into lesson planning, marking policies and data management. These reported in March 2016 with recommendations for school leaders on good practice in preventing unnecessary workload’* **\(S1**, p. 11 **\)**. 

 The report evidences the direct instrumental impact achieved by the research, with the Department for Education and other key agencies taking decisive action to reduce teacher workload in direct response to the research findings. This includes \(a\) setting up three independent review groups; \(b\) developing a bi\-annual teacher workload survey based upon the TALIS questions; \(c\) reducing schools’ data burden; \(d\) improving guidance to schools on the issue of workload; \(e\) funding groups of schools to carry out collaborative projects into reducing workload and \(f\) publishing advice and guidance to initial teacher educators on how to reduce workload. The influence on government policy went in tandem with substantial attention to the research findings from the media, think\-tanks and teaching unions upon its public release. This generated substantial conceptual impact, galvanising and informing debate by highlighting the long hours teachers in England work and the impact of this on the profession. This is confirmed in testimony from the National Education Union \(NEU\): 

 ‘*Your research has significantly increased the National Education Union’s understanding about the key issue of teachers’ working hours and has helped us to understand the limitations with current approaches the government are using to measure the working hours of teachers. It has brought to our attention the critical role that working hours – particularly the time teachers spend on marking and lesson planning – has upon teacher wellbeing’* **\(S2\)**. 

 Further evidence of the link between the research and the Department for Education’s policy action is the letter provided by a former MP who was Minister for Schools when our TALIS 2013 report was produced. He noted the impact it had **\(S3\)** within the Department for Education: 

 *‘…the research results from TALIS 2013, first discovered in the Institute of Education’s 2014 report, had significant impact within the Department for Education and subsequent policy interventions. The finding about teacher workload was particularly striking. It helped lead to the Department for Education launching the ‘workload challenge’ of 2014. ...this then led to a number of tangible policy responses, including the department setting up numerous policy reviews into different aspects of teacher workload, renewed guidance from Ofsted and influenced protocols around the changes that were being made to the national curriculum at the time’*. 

 This is confirmed on the TALIS website **\(S4\)**, where the Department for Education’s endorsement of the survey states that: ‘ *Findings from the previous TALIS survey in 2013 influenced the Standard for Teachers’ Professional Development and were a key driver of the 2014 Workload Challenge*’. 

 Since the production of the initial research report, the research team  has continued to build the evidence base on teacher workload and to generate impact. Allen, who was Director of the Centre for Education Improvement Science at the time, chaired the Department for Education’s teacher workload advisory group in 2018 **\(S5\)**. This group produced a series of recommendations to government on how workload can be reduced for schools by addressing the ‘audit culture’ and stripping out data management activity that doesn’t add value, and leads to teacher burnout and anxiety. These recommendations were accepted by the government in full, demonstrating the lasting instrumental impact of the research **\(S6\)**. The work has also had impact internationally. As evidenced within the letter provided by the lead analyst for the TALIS 2013 study at the OECD, the report written by the team had significant impact on the international development of the TALIS study, including the questions and topics to be including in future rounds of the study **\(S7\)**. This letter highlights the IOE’s work as an example of how an effective national report can influence policy development: 

 ‘*First, the IOE team developed a number of additional national questions that were included in the TALIS 2013 study including several about teacher workload. These provided important additional information that was not gathered in other countries and had a significant impact upon the future development of the TALIS study. This included the development of topics and questions that could be included in future TALIS waves.*’ 

 Further analysis of the TALIS 2013 data by Dr Sam Sims has contributed to the Department for Education’s Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy **\(S8\)**, which highlights how unmanageable workloads are leading teachers to become less satisfied in their jobs. The strategy directly references the IOE’s research **\(R4\)**, noting that ‘ *less than half of teachers’ working time is spent directly on teaching*’ and committing to reforming the accountability system that ‘ *distracts teachers from teaching*’. This influence on policy has been significantly helped by interventions from professional bodies, who have used the research to underpin their policy ‘asks’ of government, as confirmed by the NEU: 

 ‘*Your work has been vital to provide the necessary evidence to underpin our arguments when discussing teacher workload issues with the Department for Education and the government. Workload is a huge issue for our members and your comprehensive data analysis, using robust methods, clearly illustrates the points that need to be addressed.* **\(R3\)** *. We have used your research evidence in our policy development and responses to the Department for Education’s Workload Advisory Group. This includes our development of a Life Balance for Teachers Model Policy Checklist, our calls for a teacher time budget and how we have responded to results from the 2019 DfE Teacher Workload Survey*’ **\(S2\)**. 

 The Department for Education commissioned Jerrim and Sims to conduct follow\-up research using the TALIS 2018 study \(published in June 2019\). This was the first attempt to re\-measure teacher workload using comparable data since the TALIS 2013 study, making it the first piece of evidence as to whether the policies put in place by the Department for Education have led to a reduction in workload **\(R2\)**. It also provided the first internationally comparable evidence on the workload of primary school staff. This work has already had significant reach within the education community. In the week the results were released, blogs and tweets by Sims and Jerrim made over 40,000 Twitter impressions and received over 250 media engagements. It is currently playing a central role in policy development within the Department for Education. 

 Follow up research reviewing four different datasets **\(R5\)** confirmed that five years of government initiatives to reduce workloads have had little impact on the total number of hours worked. This galvanised very significant media coverage and was highlighted by influential organisations such as the Institute for Government and Education Support, and in media outlets such as FE News, Croner\-i, Schoolsimprovement.net and Mr Jones’s Whiteboard. The Guardian ran two articles about the research, including an editorial **\(S9\)**, which noted ‘ *No other school system in the industrial world gouges so many hours out of its staff*’. The research was also highlighted by the National Education Union in an opinion piece **\(S10\)** ‘ *Last month, the UCL published a compelling historical study of teacher workload which showed that one in four teachers work 60\-hour weeks. This is completely unacceptable. That study also cast doubt on whether the most recent DfE workload surveys were accurate*’, further evidence of how the team has ensured discussion of teacher workload is kept at the forefront of education policy and debate. 

 In summary, the research conducted by Jerrim and colleagues since 2013 has had substantial conceptual and instrumental impact. The work has been used for policy development both by education unions and within the Department for Education. It has helped to underpin many of the key policies around teacher workload implemented by the Department for Education over the last five years, while also stimulating much media interest and public debate. The work of the IOE team has also had impact outside of the UK, including having a significant impact on the international development of the TALIS study.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A 20\-year programme of research on play in the early years of primary schooling, by Stranmillis University College and Queen’s University, Belfast, has informed a programme of educational reform for all 4\-6\-year\-old children in Northern Ireland \(NI\) i.e. approximately 650,000 children since 2007 and 720,000 children since 2015 in the Republic of Ireland \(RoI\). Extending the impacts detailed in 2014, and drawing on new and sophisticated understanding about the synergy between playfulness, teaching and learning, this case study reports on three key impacts: shaping national policy; enhancing teacher knowledge of play as pedagogy through an intense programme of professional development and support; and making a positive change to classroom practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A programme of educational reform in the early years of primary schooling in NI and the RoI arises from a 20\-year body of ground\-breaking  [research](https://ccea.org.uk/learning-resources/early-years-enriched-curriculum-evaluation-project) by Walsh at Stranmillis University College \(SUC\) and Sproule and McGuinness at Queen’s University, Belfast \(QUB\). The research has been reported in 64 publications since 2000: 1 book, 14 book chapters, 25 research reports, 11 peer\-reviewed journal articles, 10 professional journal articles and 4 web\-based tools. 

 Enduring concerns about the inappropriateness of a formal curriculum for children as young as 4 years \(NI has the youngest statutory school starting age in Europe\) led to a substantive strand of research enquiry \- a large\-scale, quasi\-experimental, longitudinal  [evaluation](https://ccea.org.uk/downloads/docs/ccea-asset/Curriculum/EYECEP%20End-of-Phase%202%20Report%201%3A%20Overview%3A%20Evaluation%20Strategy%20and%20Curriculum%20Implementation.pdf), funded by the Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment in NI \(£850,000\) from 2000\-2009, of a play\-based curriculum for 4\-6 year old children, known as the Early Years Enriched Curriculum \(EC\) Evaluation Project in 24 schools \(with approximately 1000 children, 24 principals, 150 teachers and 1500 parents\). 

 Findings revealed a positive picture of this play\-based curriculum in terms of children’s learning dispositions, social development and emotional well\-being \( [**RI**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09575140600760003)\).Despite depressed scores on reading and mathematics in Years 1 and 2, by the end of Year 7, the EC children’s scores mainly matched those of the children following the traditional curriculum. Yet the research evidence highlighted pedagogical challenges around advancing children’s academic learning through play, while still maintaining a high level of children’s interest, confidence and well\-being \( [**R2**](https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3117)\). 

 The findings and associated recommendations from the EC evaluation were “pivotal” \(R3, page 21\) in the introduction of a statutory play\-based curriculum \- the Foundation Stage \(FS\) for all Year 1 \(2007\) and Year 2 children \(2008\) across all NI primary schools. FS teachers were now obliged to change their practice to ensure that children “experience much of their learning through well planned and challenging play” \( [NI Primary Curriculum](https://ccea.org.uk/downloads/docs/ccea-asset/Curriculum/The%20Northern%20Ireland%20Curriculum%20-%20Primary.pdf), page 9\). 

 However, further evidence revealed that the pedagogical dilemmas experienced by some EC teachers had not been fully resolved with the introduction of the FS curriculum. The findings pointed to the need for more radical thinking about the meaning of play as pedagogy in EY classes. \( [**R3**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09669760.2013.830561)\). 

 For the past 10 years, we have delved deeper into the EC data which has brought to the fore new thinking about the importance of playfulness as a central characteristic of quality teaching and learning in the early years classroom \( [**R4**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2011.579070)\).  Additional scrutiny of the data pointed to the need to move beyond the boundaries of play and teaching as separate entities, towards a more expansive and integrated early years pedagogy where playfulness, teaching and learning are more fully fused – an original pedagogical concept which has become known as Playful Teaching and Learning \(PTL\) \( [**R5**](https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2017.1369977)\). 

 Further elaborations have informed an innovative early years pedagogical framework, based on three key dimensions: the degree of playfulness, the locus of control and the nature of the learning taking place \( [**R6**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09669760.2019.1628011)\). Upskilling practitioners on these underpinning principles of PTL has been noted to impact positively on professional knowledge and practice \( [**R7**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2019.1581731)\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Shaping Policy** 

 Walsh’s research has been “instrumental” \( **S1**\) in informing the design and development of the statutory play\-based Foundation Stage \(FS\) curriculum in NI, impacting the playful experiences of almost 650,000 4\-6 year olds since 2007. Walsh continues to significantly influence policy: “a familiar face at regular meetings and seminars with key NI EYE policymakers and stakeholders” and provides “regular updates at meetings with DE representatives” \( **S1**\).  The significance of Walsh’s research led to invited presentations at the Chief Inspector’s Report dissemination conferences on 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> May, 2017 to NI stakeholders and primary principals \(n= 250\), presentations which the ETI Chief Inspector \(2017\) described as “invaluable”, “inspiring” and “very worthwhile sharing of best practice” \( **S2**\). 

 The impact of Walsh’s research has extended beyond NI, “informing the work of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment \(NCCA\) across a range of policy and practice developments in the Republic of Ireland for much of the last decade” \( **S3**\). Walsh’s presentation to NCCA’s Early Childhood and Primary Team in September 2014 on playful pedagogy informed the new statutory EYs Primary Language Curriculum, impacting over 6000 infant teachers and 180,000 children on an annual basis since 2015. Walsh’s research has informed the design of the  [draft Primary Curriculum framework](https://ncca.ie/media/4456/ncca-primary-curriculum-framework-2020.pdf). A playful pedagogical approach is recommended across the Key Stages, with the potential to impact all primary teachers \(approximately 23000\) and in turn all primary pupils \(approximately 560,000\) on an annual basis \( **S3**\). 

 Walsh was appointed by RoI Ministers for her  “knowledge and experience in the field” to the influential  [Qualifications Advisory Board](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/c2e6b-qualifications-advisory-board-qab-for-the-early-learning-and-care-elc-sector/) for the Department of Education and Skills, March 2020,  with a focus on upskilling the Early Years workforce across the entire sector\( **S4**\). 

 **Influencing Professional Development** 

 Underpinned by the EC research on play and playful pedagogies, Walsh designed and implemented a bespoke professional development programme for FS teachers across NI: **31** \(6/12 hour\) Playful Learning hubs/courses were completed 2013\-2019, reaching some **930** teachers. 

 Having **“**gained much respect and trust among the teachers” \( **S1**\), the Education Authority in NI invited Walsh from June 2017 to develop these PL hubs into a series of three day courses as part of the Signature Project \(2017\-2019\) and Collaborating and Sharing in Education project \(2019 \- 2022\). **18** courses have been delivered to date, reaching a further **540** FS teachers \(on average 30 teachers per course\).   The impact on teacher knowledge is significant as almost **1500** FS teachers have been trained \( **S1**\), accounting for over half of all NI FS teachers, with further courses scheduled up until 2022. 

 Such training “has no doubt led to the upskilling of teachers to ensure the theory and recent research is put into practice in a sustainable and enjoyable way with positive outcomes for the children” \( **S1**\). Such feedback is corroborated by the ETI’s  [Shared Education Signature Project Evaluation Report](https://www.etini.gov.uk/sites/etini.gov.uk/files/publications/shared-education-signature-project-evaluation-report.pdf) \(March 2018: 37\), where the Stranmillis Playful Learning course is highlighted as an Example of Good Practice: “Staff now feel empowered to confidently deliver activity\-based learning and have the capacity to sustain this improvement” \( **S5**\). 

 Walsh has also worked closely with CCEA over 20 years, developing a  [repository](https://ccea.org.uk/learning-resources/early-years-enriched-curriculum-evaluation-project) of high quality professional development  [resources](https://training.ccea.org.uk/login/index.php) \(password protected\) and informing the  [Mixed\-Age Play at Parkhall](https://ccea.org.uk/learning-resources/mixed-age-play-parkhall-primary) project \( **S6**\) underpinned  by research on play and playful pedagogies to support delivery of the FS Curriculum which practising teachers deem “as extremely valuable learning and teaching tools” \( **S1**\). 

 In RoI, “Given Dr Walsh’s expertise and research activity in relation to teaching and learning through play” Walsh was invited by NCCA to present to, and work with the national group of tutors, 2015\-2018, as part of the Aistear Tutor Initiative \(ATI\) reaching over 20,000 teachers \( **S3**\). She has also been responsible for developing a series of professional development  [resources](https://curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/bb9ac07f-2eeb-46d2-a130-0abb0aa74cf6/ORW_InfusingPlayfulness_1.pdf?ext=.pdf) \(2015\-2016\) for NCCA’s online Primary Language Teacher Toolkit, accessible to all RoI primary teachers \( **S3**, **S7**\). 

 Walsh’s edited book \( [*Playful Teaching and Learning*](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/playful-teaching-and-learning/book245867)\) with McMillan and McGuinness \( **S8**\) is a “key resource for all early years practitioners” \( **S1**\) and “has informed policy advice developed by NCCA for the Department of Education” \( **S3**\). It has been well\-received by teacher educators and practitioners across RoI and the UK \(see  [reviews](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/mst/playful-teaching-and-learning/book245867)\). The initial chapter of PTL was translated into Danish for  [Leg I Skolen](https://u-p.dk/vare/leg-i-skolen/) and led to Walsh contributing \(by invitation\) a chapter for a Norwegian  [anthology on Play in Primary classrooms](https://www.universitetsforlaget.no/lek-i-begynneropplaeringen-1) \( **S9**\). 

 **Impact on Practice** 

 “The impact of Glenda’s research activity on practice cannot be underestimated” where “learning through play in the NI FS has evolved greatly over the years” \( **S1**\). Such thinking has been corroborated by the latest  [Chief Inspector’s Report](https://www.etini.gov.uk/sites/etini.gov.uk/files/publications/cir-2016-2018_1.pdf) \(2018\): ‘there are \(now\) more opportunities for open\-ended research, investigation and child\-led enquiry through activity\-based learning” in FS classrooms \( **S10**\).   The influence of Walsh’s research on practice remains significant throughout the Covid\-19 pandemic. Walsh developed a  [repository of playful learning resources](https://www.stran.ac.uk/resource-centre/ideas-for-active-minds/) for teacher and parental use during lockdown, reaching 33,000 unique visitors 08/04/20\- 30/06/20. Walsh’s research has created positive change that has had “a lasting impact on the views and attitudes of key stakeholders to create playful approaches to teaching and learning in practice… for the benefit of our children” \( **S1**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Covid\-19 pandemic is also a pandemic of grief, having caused over one million deaths. Grief and bereavement damages people’s physical and mental wellbeing and NHS services are stretched to the limit. There is an urgent need for resources to help people cope with loss. Reddick founded the Poetry, Grief and Healing project in 2017 to support people’s wellbeing and creativity through writing. Collaborating with psychologists, counsellors, poets and the poetry journal *Magma,* Reddick published an array of poetry and articles about loss from around the world in the *Loss Issue* of *Magma* \(2019\).  A poem Reddick commissioned and published in *Magma*, by poet Malika Booker, won the 2020 Forward Prize for Best Single Poem. The winning poem, ‘The Little Miracles’, tells the story of Booker’s mother’s declining health and the moments of hope that can nevertheless sustain us in times of loss.  Reddick ran highly successful writing workshops with hospices, museums and literary festivals in Lancashire and nationwide. As the pandemic struck, the NHS Lancashire Recovery College \(NHS\-LRC\) asked Reddick to run online writing workshops and create digital writing resources for NHS practitioners and the public. In 2020 Reddick brought together poets from *Magma*’s *Loss Issue* with her writing workshop resources and original poems written in memory of her father, publishing *Poetry, Grief and Healing*, a textbook taken up nationwide by the NHS Recovery College network and distributed to practitioners in India and South Africa.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Reddick is an experienced poet and critic, author of the monograph *Ted Hughes: Environmentalist and Ecopoet* \(2017\) \[1\] and articles on poetry in leading literary journals. Reddick’s award\-winning publication *Translating Mountains* \(2017\) \[2\], a poetic memorial to her mountaineer father, began her exploration of grief and healing. It won the 2017 Women’s Poetry Pamphlet Prize from women’s literary magazine *Mslexia.*  It was selected as a favourite poetry pamphlet of 2017 by the *Times Literary Supplement*. It has gained international recognition and reach, with poems translated into Swedish, Greek \( *Chromata*\), French \( *Agenda*\), Chinese \( *Smoke* magazine\) and Italian \( *British and Irish Women Poets*\).  Reddick is an editor and board member of *Magma*.  A special issue of *Magma*, *The Loss Issue,* was funded by an Arts Council England grant and developed from Reddick’s editorial expertise and critical research. *Magma* has contributors across the Caribbean, Australia, India, Europe and Anglophone Africa, attracting both established authors and emerging poets. 

 The literary significance and emotional resonance of Reddick’s writing about loss have won her multiple prizes and fellowships. In 2016 \[2\] won her a Northern Writer’s Award. This was followed by a Hawthornden Fellowship, which enabled Reddick to continue researching the project in Scotland. Reddick received a commendation in the 2018 National Poetry Competition, one of the most prestigious poetry competitions in the world, for her poem ‘Muirburn.’ The same poem won the Poetry Society’s Peggy Poole Award for its exploration of personal and ecological grief. Further poems on the theme of loss received a Creative Futures Literary Award and first prize in *Ambit* poetry journal’s poetry competition \(2019\). These prizes laid the foundations for Reddick to secure a major GBP93,000 AHRC Leadership Fellowship enabling her to write poetry exploring environmental and societal loss. Her latest creative work *Spikenard* \(2019\) \[4\] uses her oil engineer father’s career as a lens to explore the global losses brought by climate change and oil conflict. 

 The call for submissions to *Magma*’s *Loss Issue* aimed to encourage poets to intervene in the literary canon by expanding the ambitions of the elegy to explore political, historical and environmental losses.  This was the first time that a poetry magazine had dedicated a special issue to loss, in all its forms \[3\]. The issue combines poems selected from public submissions with commissioned poems that poets wrote during a unique collaboration with counsellors and psychologists. Existing anthologies about loss are USA\-focused and out of date. Other poetry and mental health collaborations focus on psychoanalysis from the early 1900s, which is not clinically proven to aid wellbeing. *The Loss Issue* is unique for the range of losses it explores and for its focus on contemporary, cutting\-edge poetry. *The Loss Issue* developed from an innovative collaboration that brought together eight poets with eight therapists, with expertise ranging from neuropsychology to counselling and positive psychology. The poets wrote commissioned poems, developing new insights on the theme of loss. The commissioned poets were Jackie Kay MBE, Zaffar Kunial, Nick Makoha, Jhilmil Breckenridge, Jennifer Lee Tsai, Khadijah Ibrahiim, Malika Booker and Romalyn Ante.  Reddick co\-edited the issue with author and publisher Adam Lowe, also selecting 50 poems from 8,000 submissions from the public. These were published in the magazine alongside the commissioned work.  2020 Forward Prize winner Malika Booker praised the research collaboration for its contribution to her winning poem.  Poems from *The Loss Issue* are reproduced in Reddick’s textbook, *Poetry, Grief and Healing* \[5\]. The textbook developed from several series of writing workshops that Reddick ran from 2017 to 2020, in collaboration with counsellors, psychologists and NHS practitioners from the NHS\-LRC. Narrative interviews and questionnaires captured participants’ feedback, aiming to assess benefits to their wellbeing and creativity. After co\-editing *Magma*’s *Loss Issue* with Reddick, Adam Lowe wrote a new poem for the textbook.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Poets have a great deal to say about grief; many people read poems at funerals and poetry is the only kind of writing to have a special form devoted to mourning, the elegy. The Poetry, Grief and Healing project has led to transformative career impacts for poets engaging with health and loss, to the publication of a global array of poets engaging with grief, and to the development of writing and wellbeing resources with local, national and international impact. 

 <ins> **Creative, Literary and Wellbeing Benefits from Magma’s Loss Issue**</ins> 

 *Magma*’s *Loss Issue* and its unique collaborative approach had a profound and significant impact on participating poets, counsellors and psychologists. Poet Jackie Kay MBE said about writing in collaboration with a neuropsychologist: **“I treasure the experience of this kind of collaboration…where you find yourself drawn to something that you might not have otherwise written about.”** \[3\]  The poet Malika Booker wrote in *Magma* that **“My collaboration with Lowri Dowthwaite, a lecturer in Psychological Interventions…had a profound effect on me as both a daughter and a poet**” \[3\], inspiring her poem ‘The Little Miracles.’ The poem captures moments of hope that Booker experienced while caring for her mother, who had suffered a stroke. The poem offered comfort and solace to readers who were looking after sick relatives during the pandemic. In 2020 Reddick submitted the poem for the highly prestigious Forward Prize for Best Single Poem, with the outstanding result that Booker won the prize. This coveted literary award provided a transformative impact on her literary career. In her acceptance speech, Booker commented that **“The collaboration…. for **Magma**’s **Loss Issue**, captures the way light moments can and do manifest in the midst of extreme grief and/or upheaval, and interestingly resonates during this time of Covid, lockdown, revolution and social/economical upheaval and loss.”** \[A1\]  She stressed the crucial impacts of the prize to her as a poet of the Caribbean Diaspora: a group that has historically been excluded by the literary establishment. She described the award as **“testimony to the long journey I’ve made in this British poetic landscape, from being ostracized and marginalized to creating emotional and powerful work on my own terms that enabled this great acknowledgement tonight.”** \[A1\]  Booker was contacted by members of the public who were profoundly moved by the way the poem resonated with their experiences of caring for sick relatives during the pandemic. Readers **“wept”** as they **“felt moved when they heard it because it resonated with them caring for their family.”** Readers told Booker that the poem gave them **“solace and peace”** \[A4\]. In recognition of the way Booker’s winning poem inspires Black and female\-identifying authors, organisations such as Peepal Tree Press \(publishing Caribbean and Black British authors\) commented on the significance of the win \[A2\]. This is important as BAME and women authors have historically experienced discrimination in literary circles. Seven poets and two article writers from the USA, Nigeria, Jamaica, Canada, India and Trinidad benefited by gaining new readers through *Magma*. Delroy McGregor \(Jamaica\) said that **“ **Magma** is the first time my poetry has been exposed to the U.K, and yes I am truly grateful that this opportunity has allowed my work to be seen through a different lens.**” \[B1\] McGregor also had his poem reprinted in \[5\]. Poets see *Magma* as a publication that boosts their careers, as it provides emerging poets and editors with access to coveted literary opportunities. Reddick had poetry commissioned for *The Guardian Review* by outgoing Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.  For poet Jessica Sneddon, publication in *Magma* was a threshold in her literary career that led to important opportunities: **“The magazine’s reach and reputation has made it a really important milestone in my writing career.”** \[D\]  Her publishing track record progressed from small online magazines to high\-calibre literary publications such as the Leeds University\-based magazine *Stand* \[D\].  Poets who read poems for the launch of *Magma The Loss Issue* in London reported the empowering and cathartic experience of sharing poetry around grief, a subject so often associated with silence and taboo. Poet Alice Hiller Tweeted: **“Thank you Yvonne Reddick and Magma Poetry for giving me the space to perform ‘Brussels’ about the day my father died when I was 8 – you gave back the voice which was taken from me when I lost him.”** \[E\] 

 The *Loss Issue* received over 8,000 poems. This is the highest number of submissions that *Magma* has ever received: twice as many as typical issues. The arts sector also suffered severe losses due to the COVID\-19 pandemic. Thus, the Arts Council grant that funded this issue became especially important to poets and to *Magma* journal. *Magma* is a charity with an annual turnover of GBP30,000/annum: the GBP11,800 grant represented a third of its annual turnover. The grant enabled *Magma* to branch out into innovative online events during the pandemic, such as the launch of the *Loss Issue* with Leeds\-based poets. These digital methods were taken up by other *Magma* editors during the Covid\-19 crisis, a productive model that offers *Magma* great resilience at a time of austerity for the arts \[F\]. 

 The *Loss Issue*, the Arts Council grant, and Reddick’s facilitation of Booker’s Forward Prize win, have all had a transformative and enduring impact on *Magma* itself. *Magma* has now published three times as many Forward Prize\-winning poems as the *Times Literary Supplement*. Two editors who have chaired *Magma*’s editorial board over the years, Lisa Kelly and Laurie Smith, commented that Booker’s win was **“great”** for both **“poetry and **Magma.**”** \[A3\]  At the magazine’s launch events in London, Manchester, the University of Central Lancashire and Preston’s Harris Museum, Gallery and Library, 76% of survey respondents said that *Magma* introduced them to new ideas about poetry and loss, or helped them to approach a new theme in their writing \[C\]. *The Loss Issue* was praised as particularly ‘diverse’ \[C\]: 40% of authors published were BAME, compared to 17% in the previous issue, and LGBTQ\+ participation was strong \(12% against a UK national average of 2%\). *The State of Poetry and Poetry Criticism* report on diversity in publishing singled out the issue’s championing of diversity, reporting that the issue published more poets of colour than any other single poetry journal issue in their data set \[G\]. 

 <ins> **Helping writing workshop participants to cope with grief**</ins>Reddick led Writing for Wellbeing workshops at Preston’s Harris Museum \(2017\-18\), at Poetry in Aldeburgh festival \(2018\) and St Catherine’s Hospice \(2019\) and the NHS Lancashire Recovery College \(NHS\-LRC\) \(2019, 2020\). Reddick’s workshops have helped 65 individuals and 17 participants write poems for the first time in their lives. Participants in the Harris Museum workshops commented that the social support provided by the workshops was **“really useful because I think a lot of people are quite isolated with grief.”** The participant commented that **“meeting other people, even if you’re not going to explain all of those things to them – you feel a comfort from that.”** \[H1\]  She had one of her poems published in *Poetry, Grief and Healing*. Another participant corroborated the importance of the social support provided by writing workshops, saying that they were **“most certainly good for me, in that it was not great for me to isolate myself.”** \[H1\] Survey comments from participants at the Hospice included: **“A way to express my thoughts & feelings in a safe environment… To reflect on the person I am, which has been lost over the last few years.”** \[H2\]  A hospice counsellor noted that: **“writings were extremely thought provoking and captured how grief is unique for each person.”** \[H3\] The counsellor and two of her colleagues continued to share the learning by participating enthusiastically in the collaboration with poets for *Magma*. All participants at the NHS\-LRC sessions reported improvements to their wellbeing on the Warwick\-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale \[H4\]. Six months after the workshops at St Catherine’s Hospice, over 50% of writers said they had stayed in touch with other attendees and 50% were continuing to write creatively. One commented on how this had helped: **“During the night, a very windy night, when I couldn’t sleep & was anxious, I started to write a poem.”** \[H5\]  The workshop at Poetry in Aldeburgh festival sold out, attracting 17 participants, two of whom were published in *Magma*. Poet Kostya Tsolakis wrote a blog entry about the festival for the Poetry School, commenting: **“Yvonne helped us approach the difficult topic of grief, be it over a person, object, country or the environment, with sensitivity but also humour.”** \[I\]  A poem that he wrote about LGBTQ\+ perspectives on loss was published in *Magma*’s *Loss Issue.* 

 <ins> **Impact on NHS, museums and charities**</ins> 

 The NHS\-LRC serves a population of 1.5 million. Reddick ran trial workshops in Preston \(July – August 2019\), a four\-session course \(January\-February 2020\) and a new online course on loss and life after Covid\-19 \(July\-August 2020\).  Jhilmil Breckenridge, writer and founder of India’s Bhor Foundation mental health charity, participated in both the Harris Museum and St Catherine’s Hospice workshops and shared the learning abroad, saying: “ **I will continue to write for myself as well as spread information on how writing helps with overcoming trauma and loss. In fact, I have given a talk on exactly that in Malaysia…. to 400 people.”** \[B2\]  Reddick has created a downloadable ‘Writing Loss’ worksheet to engage further participants. The worksheet guides participants in evoking loss by writing about an object. This has been taken up by the national writing charity The Arvon Foundation, Hospice UK’s website ehospice.com, *Magma* poetry magazine’s blog; the Living with Loss project, a counsellor at Pendleside Hospice, Burnley and a London\-based writing workshop series. The Arvon Foundation emailed the worksheet to its 581 subscribers. Reddick’s writing workshop resources were taken up by the Living with Loss retreats, which take place in Sussex, Devon and Yorkshire. Seven participants attended a retreat in August 2019. All participants who completed a follow\-up survey commented that they ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that the content was helpful \[B3\]. Reddick’s writing workshop resources were used by counsellor, writing therapist and writer Amy Tempest, at Pendleside Hospice, for 12 participants \[B4\]. Tempest’s work with Khadijah Ibrahiim was the beginning of this longer\-term collaboration as part of *Poetry, Grief and Healing*. 

 *Magma*’s *Loss Issue* is circulated in the NHS\-LRC’s mobile vehicle for hard\-to\-reach populations to use. The vehicle had reached 2800 people before the 2020 COVID\-19 lockdown \[J1\]. *Poetry, Grief and Healing* is now also available in the mobile library. As the COVID\-19 crisis struck, the NHS\-LRC again called upon Reddick to create new digital resources to help people cope with an unprecedented number of bereavements. An online writing workshop prompt to help people write about loss by focusing on an object they associate with a loved one was viewed 866 times after the NHS\-LRC circulated it on Twitter \[J2\]. Reddick’s final workshops for the NHS\-LRC encouraged participants to write not only about loss, but also resilience and healing after the pandemic. The three participants in the final workshops included an NHS psychologist who had worked on frontline COVID\-19 mental health wards, an art curator and an emerging writer. All of their lives and occupations have been profoundly affected by the virus. Participants were empowered to submit written evidence and send their poems to a House of Lords Special Committee on Life After COVID\-19. One participant sent two of her articles, while another participant and Reddick sent poems, following the Committee’s invitation for creative responses \[J3\]. The Recovery College shared a participant’s poem with other service users. One participant wrote: **“Thanks again Yvonne for your skilful and inspiring facilitation.  I wrote a short paragraph to the Lords including 2 articles as attachments… I included a link to the Recovery College as an example of good practice.”** \[J3\].  NHS\-LRC staff have nominated *Poetry, Grief and Healing* for use nationwide as a Recovery College Network bibliotherapy resource.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ulster research has transformed eyecare for children with developmental disability. Our research demonstrated that previously unrecognised visual impairments were prevalent among children with disability and that evidence\-based eyecare delivered to children in special education settings conveys visual and educational benefit. The research has raised clinical and therapeutic best practice worldwide \( **I1, I2, I4**\), through provision of an evidence base for the assessment, diagnosis, management and communication of eye and vision problems experienced by visually vulnerable children. As a consequence, children with developmental disability have benefited from an increased recognition of their eyecare needs and more targeted eyecare from clinicians and educators. Our research enabled the commissioning of a nationwide in\-school NHS eyecare service to comprehensively address the visual needs of <ins> **all**</ins> children in special educational settings in England \( **I3**\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Developmental disability refers to a diverse group of chronic physical and/or intellectual impairments that arise in childhood, such as Down syndrome, autism and cerebral palsy. Developmental disabilities affect nearly 53 million children worldwide \(nearly 1 in 20 children in the UK\). Our research has highlighted that visual problems in children with such disabilities are often diagnostically overshadowed by their primary systemic conditions, and that potentially treatable visual deficits may be overlooked to the detriment of quality of life and educational attainment. 

 Between 2006 and 2018, with charitable and NI HSC R&D funding, the paediatric vision team at Ulster University \(Little, McClelland, Saunders\) was the first to profile the visual characteristics of children with cerebral palsy \(CP\) **\(R1\)** and autism **\(R2\)** using large, population\-based samples. Previous information on visual status in these groups was derived from clinical samples and was inherently biased. Our research demonstrated significantly increased prevalence of focusing deficits in both conditions \(CP 58%; autism 19%\) compared to typically developing children \(5%\). We identified a clear link between poor focusing and more severe motor impairment in CP, but also found significant visual deficits among the mildest cases. 

 We found that, alarmingly, only 2% of children with CP whose focusing was impaired in 2006 had received appropriate recognition and management of this sight\-impairing condition. Our research identified a clinical imperative for routine assessment of focusing in children with developmental disabilities, in order to mitigate visual impairment \( **R1, R2**\). 

 Traditional clinical methods for assessing focusing are unsuitable for young children and those with impaired communication and/or understanding. Consequently, focusing in these populations has rarely been evaluated. To establish the clinical need for routine testing of focus in this patient group, we validated and established the repeatability of an objective child\- and clinician\-friendly ‘dynamic retinoscopy’ technique for assessing focusing accuracy **\(R3\)**. We published the first age\-normative data for the technique in 2004, allowing clinicians to easily identify focusing deficits in children with or without developmental disability **\(R4\)**. In collaboration with colleagues at Cardiff University we incorporated these research outcomes into a novel clinical tool for objectively measuring focusing accuracy: the Ulster\-Cardiff Cube \(UC\-Cube\). 

 Utilising long\-standing relationships with stakeholders including clinicians, parents and educators, we tested the degree to which those groups recognised the effect of visual impairment on a child’s ability to access educational material. We revealed discrepancies among clinicians’ understanding of a child’s visual status and needs, the knowledge held by parents and teachers, and the information included in statutory documents relating to the child’s educational, health and social needs \(Education Health and Care Plans \(EHCPs\)\). We measured these discrepancies for the first time \(2010–13\) by comparing information held in clinical records and EHCPs of children with developmental disability **\(R5\)**. 43% of clinical records documented significant visual impairment by World Health Organisation standards, but these educationally and socially relevant impairments were not acknowledged in 67% of the corresponding EHCPs, allowing visual impairment to go unsupported in the classroom. Parents and teachers reported that they routinely received only oral information about a child’s vision and that where written information was provided, it was invariably technical in nature and not translatable to the child’s circumstances or need for support. 

 Building on this evidence with funding from Action Medical Research, between 2016 and 2019 we \(i\) worked with service users and other stakeholders to co\-design and test a semi\-standardised ‘Vision Report’ proforma for translating visual assessment outcomes into actionable ‘plain English’ written information for non\-clinical audiences and \(ii\) researched the visual and educational benefits of accessible in\-school eyecare \(incorporating the Vision Report and the UC\-Cube\) for children in special educational settings. Our research demonstrated that unmet visual needs are common among children in special education settings \(45% with at least one unmet visual need\). Using evidence\-based methodologies, the research also measured for the first time the visual, behavioural and educational benefit of delivering in\-school eyecare **\(R6\)**. We found that in\-school vision assessment and reporting significantly improved children’s classroom engagement \(less time spent ‘off\-task’\) and visual status \(unmet visual need reduced from 45% to 18%\). Furthermore, parents and teachers agreed that the in\-school eyecare service conferred benefit to students \(83%\), that they understood and acted on the Vision Report \(88% found ‘information useful on a daily basis’; 33% found out ‘something new about the child’s vision’\), and that the implementation of the in\-school eyecare service resulted in positive change to the education setting \(88% of teachers made classroom modifications following receipt of the Vision Report\) \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Significance and Reach:** Our research has shaped clinical best\-practice guidance worldwide and improved the ability of clinicians to provide appropriately targeted care \( **I1, I2**\). Our research has triggered commissioning of new NHS eyecare services for children with developmental disability in England \( **I3**\). Furthermore, by providing clinicians with ‘plain English’ communication tools to enable effective reporting of children’s visual strengths and weaknesses to key supporters and educators, we have ensured that the findings from clinical assessments achieve maximum impact \( **I4**\). 

 **I1:  Clinical knowledge and best practice have changed, enabling alleviation of visually\-impairing focusing deficits in children with developmental disability.** 

 Our research is recognised and utilised nationally and internationally by educators, therapists and health professionals. Our research outcomes highlighting the prevalence of sight\-impairing visual deficits among children with CP and autism, and those validating an accessible method to diagnose poor focusing in children with developmental disability, have been used in key international eye and healthcare texts \( **C1; R1, R3, R4**\). The outcomes are also incorporated into national and global clinical guidance, such as that issued by the College of Optometrists, whose members comprise over 12,000 of the 14,000 optometrists registered in the UK \( **C2; R2, R6**\). North America’s leading professional organisation for optometrists, the American Optometric Association, which represents over 44,000 members, cites our work \( **R3**\) in its clinical practice guidance \( **C2**\) when identifying dynamic retinoscopy as a key assessment in paediatric eyecare. 

 Our research outcomes \( **R1, R3, R4**\) are used in the Brien Holden Foundation’s Global Optometry Resources, an open\-access curriculum curated to facilitate the implementation, delivery and advancement of optometric education in developing countries, and reflected in the curricula of the College of Optometrists’ Professional and Higher Professional Certificates in Paediatric Eye Care \( **C3**\). 

 Since 2013, the number of children issued with bifocal spectacles \(the primary means to correct focusing deficits\) has increased by 24% in UK NHS practice \( **C4**\). This change in eyecare practice in line with our research has enabled a greater number of children to experience better vision. 

 Our research is also used by Public Health England and third\-sector organisations to inform and empower parents and other stakeholders. Public Health England’s ‘plain English’ guidance on reasonable adjustments for eye care for people with learning disability links to Ulster’s Vision Report \( **R6**\), hosted by SeeAbility. In addition, the UK’s leading organisation promoting education, training, advancement and development of people with special/additional support needs, the National Association of Special Educational Needs \(nasen\), includes our research \( **R5**\) in its stakeholder resources \( **C5**\). 

  

 **I2: Successful commercial development of a research\-supported tool \(UC\-Cube\) provides a means by which clinicians can identify focusing deficits.** 

 In 2010 we translated our research outcomes \( **R3, R4**\) into a novel commercial tool for assessing focusing accuracy. Commercialised to prioritise clinical uptake through a not\-for\-profit agenda, the UC\-Cube provides clinicians with an accessible, objective method to quantify, diagnose and manage focusing difficulties in patients unable to communicate effectively and to contextualise outputs against our research\-derived normative data. Manufactured and distributed in collaboration with Cardiff University and PAVision Ltd, the UC\-Cube’s global sales \(approximately GBP20,000\) to practitioners and researchers, including in UK, Ireland, Sweden, South Africa, Antigua, India and the United States, have embedded the tool in clinical training programmes, hospital and primary eyecare services and specialist services for children with learning difficulties across the world. In a survey of NHS paediatric eyecare clinicians who introduced the UC\-Cube into their practice, 92% agreed or strongly agreed that using the UC\-Cube benefitted both their patients and their practice. Clinicians reported specifically that the UC\-Cube improved detection of focusing deficits and treatment of near visual impairment \( **C6**\). 

 **I3: Eyecare services for children with developmental disability in England are transformed.** 

 Our research outcomes \( **R5**\) have been used by campaigners as evidence of the need for improved eyecare services for children with developmental disability. SeeAbility, the oldest disability charity in the world and one of the largest in the UK, successfully used our research outcomes to lobby for the funding and implementation of a national evidence\-based eyecare service for children in special education settings \( **C7**\). In 2018, as a direct result of our research activity, Professor Saunders was invited to join a Department of Health project board tasked with designing and implementing a new evidence\-based eyecare service for children with learning disability. Our work demonstrating the measurable benefit of in\-school eyecare to children in special education settings \( **R6**\) provided key evidence needed to commission this targeted and accessible in\-school eyecare service for all \(over 110,000\) children educated in special schools in England. Our evidence\-derived validated tools, the UC\-Cube and Vision Report proforma, are embedded in the service specification of this new nationwide service \(2019\) \( **C8**\). The NHS England and NHS Improvement Programme Manager for Optical Services Commissioning acknowledges the pivotal role Ulster research outcomes played in the commissioning and design of the service: 

 “*The starting point for every new NHS England programme is the need to evidence positive outcomes for patients. This was a significant obstacle for the special school eyecare programme because the evidence simply didn’t exist until the research was undertaken by Ulster University.  Ulster University’s research not only helped to secure internal traction for the programme, but has informed our work throughout, contributing validated tools with which to optimise the delivery and impact of the service*.” \( **C8**\). 

 **I4: Research\-derived resources enable clinicians to communicate the visual needs of children with developmental disability and help parents and teachers to ensure that those needs are met.** 

 Our Vision Report proforma \( **R6**\), co\-designed with service users, industry, education and health stakeholders, is promoted by Public Health England \( **C5**\) and embedded in NHS England’s service specification for in\-school eyecare \( **C8**\). The Vision Report equips parents, teachers and other key supporters of children in special education settings with clearer understanding of children’s visual needs and, when integrated into EHCPs, ensures that appropriate support is in place to allow children to participate fully in the educational curriculum and enjoy the benefits of improved vision and better care. 

 The Vision Report proforma is one of the most downloaded resources offered by SeeAbility \( **C5**\) and is also available from the open\-access Ulster Vision Resources \(UVR\) \( **R1\-R6**; **C9**\). The UVR curate research\-based support tools for professionals, parents and lay people. These tools have been accessed by over 161,000 users across 75 countries since 2014. Google analytics provides evidence of consistent use/re\-use by visitors from Africa, Asia, Europe, America and Australia \( **C9**\). The Royal National Institute of Blind People and the College of Optometrists promote the UVR to parents and carers of children with visual impairment and to optometrists providing eyecare for patients with learning disability \( **C10**\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton \(UoS\) research into the development and optimisation of a new generation of highly efficient, smart High\-Power Fibre Lasers \(HPFLs\) is directly responsible for the significant growth and commercial success over the impact period of SPI Lasers Ltd, a UK company originally spun out of UoS and now among the world’s leading HPFL manufacturers. Over the seven\-year period, SPI has generated cumulative revenues of GBP436m and cumulative gross profits of GBP109.8m; annual revenues increased from GBP35.3m at the beginning of the census period to a peak of GBP78.7m and annual gross profits rose from GBP7.6m to a peak of GBP23.0m. The company has supported up to 303 jobs and created 47 new roles. SPI’s laser product ranges have benefitted companies across multiple industries, including the aerospace, automotive, energy and medical sectors, in 130 countries. Impact ‘downstream’ can be seen in substantial energy savings and emission reductions arising from the lasers’ efficiency gains, and improving the capabilities of SPI customers in addressing key societal challenges, including the manufacture of lightweight aircraft parts, batteries and fuel cells, and life\-enhancing medical devices such as pacemakers and synthetic bones.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Fibre lasers, in which the active medium being used is an optical fibre doped in rare\-earth elements, are one of the most recent entrants into the highly competitive laser market. Their strengths lie in their inherent stability, beam quality, compact size and their ability to achieve very high levels of power much more efficiently than conventional lasers. Use of fibre lasers across multiple industries including the automotive, medical, consumer electronics, materials processing and manufacturing sectors has increased rapidly in recent years, with Cambridge\-based technology market research specialists IDTechEx forecasting global sales of GBP8.9bn by 2028. 

 Extensive research spanning two decades within the Optoelectronics Research Centre \(ORC\) has pioneered the development and optimisation of commercially viable HPFL technologies. In the early 2000s, the Group developed optical fibres and laser concepts that allowed scaling in average output powers and extended the range of operating modes to include both short\-pulse and high\-power, single\-frequency operations. Practical all\-fibre techniques were developed to couple the required pumping light derived from laser diodes into the fibre laser structure in a scalable, robust and compact fashion. This patented technology was critical for the development of UoS spinout company SPI Lasers Ltd \(SPI\). In 2004, ORC researchers conducted the world's first demonstration of a fibre laser \(FL\) system that could emit powers of greater than 1 kW, convincingly showing for the first time that fibre lasers could compete favourably with existing laser technologies \[ **3.1**\]. A year later SPI was successfully floated on the Alternative Investment Market. Further work led to the development of a high\-performance, single\-frequency system that greatly extended the functionality and ultimate power scaling of fibre lasers \[ **3.2**\]. 

 SPI Lasers, now TRUMPF Lasers UK Ltd, funded the establishment of the ORC/SPI Advanced Laser Lab \(ALL\) at UoS in 2011 \[ **G1**\] to fully optimise the fibre laser technologies. Subsequent collaborative research, led by Professor Michalis Zervas, who in 2016 was awarded a SPI Lasers/Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair, has enabled the development of a new generation of smart HPFLs for advanced manufacturing that significantly outperform competing technologies. HPFLs now offer record wall\-plug efficiencies \(>35%\), power scalability \(10s of kW with near\-perfect beam quality & 100s of kW of process\-tailored beams\), extended wavelength coverage \(UV\-to\-green\-to\-mid\-IR\), beam delivery with unprecedented temporal and spatial control, as well as advanced process monitoring capabilities. Key research advances and technological ‘firsts’ that derived from ALL are summarised below; this research was transferred to SPI’s IP portfolio and adopted into the company’s production processes. It resulted in 8 patent filings, with the research publication following at a later date. 

 **2.1 HPFL efficiency, stability and power scalability:** Critical to the development of robust HPFLs for industrial use is the mechanically strong and low\-loss fusion splicing of dissimilar fibres \[ **P1**\]. The Group developed advanced fibre splicing techniques, resulting in an increase in optical\-to\-optical conversion efficiency from \~65% to >85%. It identified the power\-scaling limitations in HPFLs and defined the fibre and pumping technologies required to maximise the power of individual single\-mode FLs, which exceed current state\-of\-the\-art performance by a factor of four to five \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\]. 

 **2.2 Variable beam\-shape output:** The Group developed novel all\-fibre techniques for dynamic output beam shape control, which involve mechanically adjustable in\-fibre devices in standard power delivery fibres, enabling high\-quality cutting of thin and thick mild\-steel sheets at higher speeds \[ **3.5, P2**\]. This has resulted in >20% faster 10\-15mm mild steel cutting than multimode \(MM\) beams with same power and beam quality \(M<sup>2</sup>\).  It also succeeds in 20mm mild steel high quality cutting, which is not possible with same power MM beams. 

 **2.3 Non\-destructive preform characterisation:** The Group developed a novel non\-destructive optical technique for the rare\-earth\-doped optical fibre preform inspection. The technique can map the spatial distribution of ytterbium ions within the core, along the entire length of the preform \[ **3.6**\], thus enabling the most appropriate and in\-spec parts to be drawn into fibres. This increases the drawn fibre yield by 50\-60% and shortens the fibre and laser production cycles by 20\-30%, significantly reducing final product cost and increasing reliability. 

 **2.4 CO<sub>2</sub> laser milling:** A novel CO<sub>2</sub> laser milling technique for precise preform outer\-surface preparation for optimum pump mode mixing was developed, which resulted in \~40% shorter, more compact, stable and energy efficient fibre lasers \[ **3.7**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 ORC research into the development of a new generation of highly efficient, smart HPFLs is directly responsible for the significant growth and commercial success over the impact period of SPI Lasers Ltd. The processing applications offered by SPI’s HPFL technology platform have directly benefitted the company’s customers across a broad range of industry sectors in 130 countries; welding, cutting, marking and micro\-machining operations can be carried out faster and more accurately for better reliability, less waste and higher productivity. 

 **Commercial benefits to SPI Lasers Ltd – and the wider economic impact** 

 Early ORC research \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] formed the foundation of the fibre laser technology platform that SPI exclusively licenses from UoS. This platform underpins all of SPI’s lasers, comprising two product ranges that are unique to the market: redENERGY® Pulsed Fibre Lasers and redPOWER® CW Fibre Lasers \[ **5.1**\]. The former constitutes 20W\-250W nanosecond pulsed fibre lasers, which offer flexibility and speed for laser marking and pulsed micro\-machining; the latter is a range of continuous wave \(CW\) lasers that provide high levels of power and control while cutting, welding and drilling. Fundamental research within ALL to optimise the performance of HPFLs has developed in parallel with new market opportunities identified by SPI, facilitating rapid adoption of the underpinning science and technology by SPI’s R&D team \[ **5.1**\]. 

 This research output has resulted in a number of key technological breakthroughs that have further enhanced the SPI product portfolio throughout the impact period and added unique selling points to existing products. These include \[ **5.1**\]: 

 • GTWave<sup>TM</sup> pumping technology: unique cladding pumping technology, separating and “isolating” pump and signal paths and resulting in increased pump and fibre laser lifetime. 

 • Photo\-darkening free active fibres without laser output power decay: increases pump and fibre laser lifetime. 

 • Pulse\-shaping using semi\-conductor seed laser\-based nanosecond pulsed MOPA lasers, enabling a very broad operating range of pulse widths and pulse shapes, providing customers with class\-leading results. 

 • Pulsed laser seed Stimulated Brillouin Scattering mitigating technique: extends operation parameter space of pulsed lasers and ensuring very high reliability for large\-scale deployments. 

 • In\-fibre beam shaping technology: variMODE<sup>TM</sup> beam shaper, enabling high\-quality cutting of thin and thick mild\-steel sheets with lower power at higher speeds. 

 8 patents have been filed by the ORC during this period and licensed to SPI. This includes the research breakthroughs described in **2.1\-2.3** \[ **3.3**\- **3.6**\], which were transferred to SPI under exclusive licenses in the period 2014 to 2018 \[ **5.1**\]. The optical\-to\-optical conversion efficiency increases, secured through **2.1, 2.3** and **2.4** \[ **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.6** and **3.7**\], has allowed use of lower\-cost, lower\-brightness pump laser sources and resulted in a cumulative \~28% reduction in required pump power in the period 2014 to 2018. Introduced to the HPFL manufacturing process, this resulted in a \~75% cost saving of pumping for SPI, which in monetary terms equates to GBP7500/kW and will equate to GBP5\-10m saving in 2020 \[ **5.1**\]. The increased levels of efficiency have resulted in substantially lower heating of the fibre and other critical components, facilitating power scaling of single laser units in excess of 2kW in 2018  from 0.5kW in 2013, and beam combined multi\-kW laser sources to 20kW in 2018 from 3kW in 2013 \[ **5.1**\]. 

 The new fully automated splicing techniques introduced in SPI’s production line, enabled by research described in **2.1** and **P1**, along with high\-yield special fibres enabled through **2.3** \( **3.6\)**, resulted in a new range of 50W\-300W high\-power pulsed lasers of which SPI has shipped more than 10,000 units. These have enabled new micro\-processing applications in consumer electronics manufacturing, battery cell manufacturing and solar cell manufacturing \[ **5.1**\]. These new applications allowed SPI to transition from best\-in\-class laser marking to best\-in\-class pulsed welding and cutting from 2014 onwards \[ **5.1**\]. The innovations in **2.1\-2.4** \( **3.3**\- **3.7**\) also led to a new production line of low cost, multi\-kW fibre lasers for materials processing, targeting the extremely price\-sensitive East Asia market, with a dedicated applications and sales centre established in Shenzhen, China in 2016. SPI expanded its main UK manufacturing facility in the Southampton area by nearly double in 2018 \[ **5.2**\]. The technological breakthrough in **2.2** \( **3.5, P2**\) was transferred exclusively to SPI and formed a new range of HPFLs under the variMODE<sup>TM</sup> trademark, launched at the Laser World of Photonics show in Munich in 2019 \[ **5.3**\]. 

 Confirming the direct relationship between UoS research and the growth and commercial success of SPI as a whole over the impact period, SPI CEO’s said: “ *University of Southampton research, both in the early to mid\-2000s and since the establishment of our collaborative Advanced Laser Lab at the University in 2011, has been fundamental to the significant revenue and profit growth that the company has achieved between 2013 and 2020; without these technological breakthroughs this level of growth and commercial performance simply would not have been possible”* \[ **5.1**\] *.* As a result, there is a direct link between ORC research and the following indicators of commercial and wider economic impact. SPI’s cumulative revenues over the impact period were GBP436,000,000; annual revenues increased from GBP35,300,000 in 2013 \(as of June 30 \- the closest available records to the beginning of the impact period\) to a peak of GBP78,700,000 in 2018. Its gross profits totalled GBP109,800,000; annual profits increased from GBP7,600,000 in 2013 to a peak of GBP23,500,000 in 2018 \[ **5.4**\]. As of 2019, the company supports 303 jobs across its facilities in Southampton and Rugby, 36% of which are ‘high\-skilled’. In June 2013, 256 people were employed by the company, meaning 47 new jobs were created over the impact period \[ **5.4**\]. SPI has directly invested GBP1,787,000 in UoS research within ALL over the impact period \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **‘Downstream’ commercial benefits to SPI Ltd.’s customers, and the wider societal impact** 

 SPI’s customers span 130 countries and multiple industries including the aerospace, automotive, electronics health, sensor, energy and jewellery sectors. SPI’s CEO summarises the overarching benefit to the company’s customers as ‘ *having a volume\-deployable laser technology that is cost\-effective and operates repeatably and reliably, replacing traditional cutting and joining methods*’ \[ **5.1**\]. In addition to substantially improving the quality, reliability and productivity of established processes, SPI’s new generation of smart lasers require less total energy through allowing laser power to be correctly and efficiently deployed. This has resulted in a \~28% reduction in electricity running costs for the company’s customers, which equates to a monetary annual saving of GBP1,400 for a 4kW laser UK user \(based on average UK industrial electricity tariffs\) \[ **5.1**\]. SPI can achieve similar cut speed and quality with a smart 2kW fibre laser as can be achieved with a conventional 4kW fibre laser. In this case the electricity bill savings increase to GBP3,000. Similar gains are achieved in additive manufacturing, welding, ablation and micro\-hole drilling, which when combined they result in a total reduction in running costs of 50% for the company’s customers, equating to an annular saving of GBP2,000 over other laser technologies \[ **5.1**\]. 

 A series of case studies on SPI’s website provides an overview of how their smart HPFLs are deployed by their customers \[ **5.5**\]. For example, in the aerospace sector SPI’s lasers are used in laser metal deposition to repair aeroplane engine blades, in additive manufacturing to produce lighter aircraft parts and in laser engraving of aerospace parts. In the automotive sector they are deployed to enhance the precision and efficiency of battery production for electric vehicles. In the health sector they are used to coat dental implants, to 3D\-print teeth and spinal implants, and in the welding of medical devices. They are used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells and in bespoke jewellery design. SPI pulsed and continuous wave smart fibre lasers offer technological advantages, including wavelength agility as well as extended stability and reliability, in applications such as print roll engraving \[ **5.6**\]. Pulsed nanosecond fibre lasers have been used for marking and micromachining an extensive range of materials, uniquely offering pulse duration selection to enable a broad range of processes to be performed with a single laser, wide pulse frequency range allowing the selection of the optimum combination of average power, peak power and pulse energy, a variety of spatial profiles to further optimise the process and advanced control to allow sophisticated integration into processes and systems \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Environmental benefits** 

 The increase in laser efficiency through the optimisation of the HPFL technology has minimised electrical power consumption and increased manufacturing speed and quality. The overall SPI laser wall\-plug efficiency has increased from \~25% to \~35% over the impact period. This equates to a 28% reduction in electricity requirements \[ **5.1**\], which in the case of SPI’s heavy\-duty industrial lasers translates into a reduction of 10,500\-17,000 tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The lower limit is based on UK government greenhouse gas reporting conversion factors \(0.37kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh \[ **5.8**\]\), averaged over the case study period. The upper limit reflects fibre laser world\-wide usage in countries with higher conversion factors \(0.6kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Andrew Grainger’s research on, and conceptualisation of, the topic of trade facilitation has informed debate at global, regional and national policy levels surrounding how best to reduce friction between public and private sector stakeholders as well as improve upon the quality of controls for the benefit of wider society and business competitiveness. This includes informing the establishment of the World Trade Organisation’s ‘Trade Facilitation Agreement’ and the UK’s obligations, with regards to the private sector, under that agreement, including the formation of a national trade facilitation committee and developing content for the International Trade Centre’s training course for understanding and implementing the agreement. Other impacts include providing guidance to the World Bank\-funded implementation of National Trade Information Portals and informing the Brexit preparations of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\), the Office for Product Safety and Standard \(OPSS\) and HM Revenue and Customs \(HMRC\).

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Grainger’s research, conducted at the University of Nottingham, has explored and contributed to the conceptualisation of the field of trade facilitation, specifically by cutting across the disciplines of politics and international relations; law; public administration; business; information technology; as well as transport, logistics and operations management. Key findings from Grainger’s research include demonstrating the importance of cutting red tape in international trade and removing friction between businesses and government agencies. It has also shown the need to make borders work better whilst safeguarding business competitiveness and societal expectations. 

 In 2011, Grainger argued for a new understanding and conceptualisation of trade facilitation by taking a more operational, bottom\-up perspective of the topic alongside the traditional top\-down premise previously advocated **\[1\]**. This approach provided a strong case for an interdisciplinary research agenda and questioned whether current institutions, concerned with trade and border controls, had the necessary capabilities to apply themselves to the more operational aspects associated with international trade. Grainger continued this research in 2014 but with greater focus on the role of the private sector and how it can best be consulted. This research argued for the importance of developing suitable institutions to ensure that the friction experienced by business operators is adequately identified and remedied. This approach would guarantee that the resources invested into trade facilitation are put to optimal effect and that the quality of implemented trade facilitation measures are continuously monitored and assessed **\[4\]**. 

 Much of Grainger’s research has been commissioned by organisations seeking to gain a better understanding of both trade facilitation as a broad topic and specific operational and policy aspects of the field. For example, **\[2\]** was commissioned and published by the World Bank and demonstrated how dialogue between the private and public sectors can identify opportunities for reform, how a climate of shared responsibility can be encouraged, and can be used to gain a systemwide understanding of complex international trade operations. **\[2\]** also showed that the interests of particular communities can vary and, therefore, Grainger argued that guidance from dedicated trade facilitation committees, often with government sponsorship, and better substantiated research, can help identify best solutions and fine\-tune reform programs. 

 Grainger’s research continued by applying his bottom\-up approach to develop a methodology that engages public and private sector stakeholders across the supply chain. In 2013, Grainger used this method to examine the cost of importing meat into the UK with the support of the UK’s Association of Port Health Authorities \(APHA\) and the UK’s International Meat Trade Association \(IMTA\) **\[7\]**. The study, which was directly informed by businesses, involved a detailed review of current import procedures applicable to importing meat into the UK from outside of the EU and an in\-depth study of the trade and customs compliance costs. As such, it untangled the many legal and operational complexities associated with international trade compliance and measured the associated costs. 

 In 2015, Grainger was commissioned by the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade to address MEP questions about the significance of customs and trade facilitation type issues in contemporary trade policy and EU practices. **\[5\]** addresses those questions and, by examining the relation between EU trade and customs policies, demonstrates explicitly why customs and trade facilitation must be part of INTA’s formal remit. **\[5\]** argues that the development of Customs specific performance indicators could achieve much greater co\-ordination between stakeholders. The success of this project led to another commissioned piece, in 2017, examining ‘The role of border management in implementing trade policy goals’ **\[6\]**. This research demonstrated how trade facilitation principles help reduce the cost of cross\-border trade in goods while safeguarding regulatory control objectives and how appropriate border management practice is integral to trade facilitation. The study demonstrated how border management can be improved through coordination, cooperation and integration within the respective border agencies \(intra\-agency\), between the many border agencies \(interagency\) and internationally \(with colleagues across the border and EU trade partners\). Specific recommendations were made on the development of suitable EU institutions in aid of trade facilitation as well as for future research.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The work of Grainger has had significant impact on informing policy makers and practitioners, and thus helps them consider relevant measures to reduce friction between public and private sector stakeholders in the administration and control of national borders. The impact relates to multilateral, regional and bilateral \(FTA\) policy. 

 **World Trade Organisation** 

 Grainger’s conceptual research laid the foundation for his work with the World Trade Organisation \(WTO\) which led to many of the impacts detailed below. In the WTO’s 2015 World Trade Report, Grainger’s research **\[1, 4\]** was cited and used to define the concept of trade facilitation as well as the factors that would need to be considered in a prospective Trade Facilitation Agreement **\[A\]**. The WTO report, which thanks Grainger for his ‘useful comments on early drafts’, clearly demonstrates the expected benefits of the Trade Facilitation Agreement as reducing trade costs by an average of 14.3% and boosting global trade by up to USD1,000,000,000,000 per year, with the biggest gains in the poorest countries **\[A\].** The WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement was adopted by members of the WTO in February 2017 and binds member countries to adopting measures that help reduce transaction costs experienced at national borders. 

 In 2018, Grainger’s research and expertise continued to be utilised by the WTO as he produced the content for a free online eLearning course that is hosted on the website of the WTO and UNCTAD’s International Trade Centre \(ITC\) – a multilateral agency which has a joint mandate with the WTO and the UN to lend technical assistance to developing countries with focus on enabling business communities to participate fruitfully within international trade. The ITC note that they drew on Grainger’s expertise ‘on a number of occasions’ and draw particular attention to the WTO’s 2015 World Trade Report **\[A\]** which evidences that ‘much of Grainger’s conceptual work in trade facilitation is seminal’ **\[B\].** The ITC also specify that for the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement to boost global trade by USD1,000,000,000,000 per year, as is estimated, ‘a key requirement for the trade facilitation related economic benefits to be realised is that the business community in developing countries understands key trade facilitation principles and knows how to articulate its requirements to policy makers’ **\[B\]**. Therefore, Grainger’s research and expertise was used by the ITC ‘to develop the content of a dedicated online training module which aims to raise the understanding of the private sector on the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, assist businesses in developing countries to effectively advocate for trade facilitation reforms and build private sector capacity to benefit from a reformed cross\-border environment’ **\[B\].** The online course, “Introduction to the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement”, was made available in December 2018 \[ [https://learning.intracen.org/course/info.php?id=310](https://learning.intracen.org/course/info.php?id=310) *accessed 28/01/2020*\] and, as of December 2019, the course has been successfully completed by more than 593 participants from over 35 countries. The ITC note that ‘the participants feedback has been very positive and the increasing number of enrolments to each edition of the training demonstrate the relevance of this e\-learning course’ **\[B\].** 

 **World Bank** 

 From 2015 to 2017, Grainger, serving as an international project advisor, assisted World Bank funded trade facilitation projects including the implementation of National Trade Information Portals in Laos, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malawi, and Sri Lanka. Funding for these projects, as stated by PM Group’s Associate Director who oversaw the project, was provided by the World Bank as ‘all WTO members are encouraged to implement Trade Information Portals by reference to Article 1 of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. They serve as a centrally managed gateway for government agencies to publish all information necessary for businesses to be able to comply with applicable import and export procedures – this includes access to all trade tariff and customs information’ **\[G\].** 

 The PM group state that Grainger provided ‘strategic guidance’ and was relied upon ‘to run a workshop \[in Bangladesh\] with the business community and senior policy makers to advise on best practice trade facilitation principles’ **\[G\].** The guidance and expertise provided stemmed from Grainger’s conceptual research **\[2,4\].** The PM Group notes that Grainger’s ‘steer and guidance has subsequently helped shape our approach – as well as that of the World Bank – to implementing and operating the respective trade information portals. This has not only made trade compliance significantly easier for the business community, it also helped make regulatory complexity more visible. Subsequently, it became easier for policy makers \(along with donors, such as the World Bank\) to identify opportunities for further reform – for example by cutting down the volume of applicable trade and customs procedures or by implementing electronic systems to help automate and speed up border management operations’ **\[G\].** 

 **Brexit** 

 Grainger’s research informed the Brexit preparations of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) including their economic modelling to understand Brexit’s impact upon UK food supply chains and industries. This impact stemmed from Grainger’s research, **\[7\]**, which underpinned two research projects, commissioned by DEFRA, ‘to calculate Non\-Tariff Measures \(NTMs\) at the HS four\-digit level and their impact upon UK food supply chains and upon the UK fish industry once the UK departs from the European Union’ **\[F\]**.These projects were led by the Anderson’s Centre who specialise in producing economic, policy and market analysis of agriculture and collaborated closely with Grainger. They note that ‘in developing our methodology, we drew extensively on Andrew’s earlier work at the University of Nottingham. To date there is no other study within the public domain that is as comprehensive as his early work in 2013 about the cost of trade and customs procedures for goods within the agricultural domain’ **\[F\]**. The work led to the creation of specific economic models which DEFRA were able to use to input data and receive expected outcomes relating to Brexit and UK food supply chains. The specific findings of the commissioned research are subject to a non\-disclosure agreement, but the Anderson’s Centre have confirmed that the projects, which were ‘commissioned because the UK relies extensively on food imports and because non\-tariff barriers are a key feature in contemporary trade policy’ culminated in models which ‘covered all the main food categories and were used by DEFRA and other government agencies to inform their BREXIT related economic modelling’ **\[F\].** 

 Grainger’s research has also been utilised by The Institute for Government in its recommendations to the UK government regarding Brexit. In its 2017 paper, ‘Implementing Brexit: Customs’, The Institute for Government drew particular acknowledgement to Grainger’s involvement and cited his research **\[1, 8\]** to ultimately make recommendations to help the UK avoid ‘the customs cliff edge’ **\[C\].** Additionally, subsequent to the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, Grainger was requested to serve as witness in front of the Health Select Committee to advise upon the impact of Brexit on Health Supply Chains \(December 2017\) **\[D\]** and the International Trade Committee in support of its enquiry into Brexit and issues specific to Northern Ireland \(July 2018\) **\[E\]**. 

 **Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and HM Revenue and Customs** 

 Grainger’s research has been used in the activities of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy’s \(BEIS\) Regulatory Delivery, which is now superseded by the Office for Product Safety and Standards \(OPSS\) and has led to the establishment of a dedicated Trade Facilitation Expert Reference Panel \(the secretariat of which was provided by BEIS\) and subsequently the UK’s National Trade Facilitation Committee \(where the secretariat is provided by HMRC\). His research has also informed OPSS’s preparations for Brexit by informing their ideas and responses about UK product safety and market surveillance requirements and cited by HMRC in its statements to UK Parliament. 

 These impacts are evidenced in a testimonial from the CEO of the OPSS which states that Grainger’s conceptualisation of the topic of trade facilitation **\[1\]** led the BEIS to invite Grainger to share his research surrounding best practice trade facilitation measures with over 200 senior international policy makers and then with BEIS key staff members, therefore informing and providing essential understanding of the topic **\[H\].** The OPSS states that ‘concluding \[Grainger’s\] presentation and subsequent Q&A’s, a decision was taken by us to establish a dedicated Trade Facilitation Expert Refence Panel’ **\[H\].** This has involved more than 110 UK business interest associations and has ‘helped raise wider awareness of trade facilitation principles, such as those described by Dr Grainger in his work’ and engaged ‘HM Revenue and Customs, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and its Permeant Representation to the World Trade Organisation to engage in dialogue with the UK business community about how to improve regulations specific to international trade and cross\-border operations’ **\[H\]**. 

 More specifically, OPSS’s testimonial notes, ‘a particular output of the establishment of \[the\] Trade Panel was Dr Grainger’s academic work in assisting the panel members consider how to identify and address technical barriers to trade with Brazil and how this might provide a model for addressing bilateral issues with other countries. The existence of this panel helped collate UK business concerns about trade and border related procedures as well enable government to communicate with the UK business community on such matters in a more efficient way’ **\[H\]**. Furthermore, the OPSS notes that ‘following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, and the UK’s subsequent independent trade policy along with its obligations to the WTO, HMRC decided to set\-up a dedicated National Trade Facilitation Committee’ and ‘Dr Grainger also worked with OPSS in December 2017 and January 2018 to help inform ideas and responses about UK product safety and market surveillance requirements after the UK’s exit from the European Union’ **\[H\].** 

 The OPSS’ acknowledgement is referring to research, **\[1, 2, 4\],** which helped the Head of EU and International Relations, Customs ‘and other senior colleagues in familiarising \[them\]selves with: key trade facilitation principles, trade and customs related compliance costs, and the practicalities of running a National Trade Facilitation Committee in line with the expectations of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement’ **\[I\].** The Head of EU and International Relations, Customs’ testimonial also states that detailed studies, including **\[7\],** have fed into ‘our better understanding of trade compliance costs’ and were drawn upon ‘in our briefings to UK Parliament and elsewhere \(as was cited by our Chief Executive … on 23 May in his oral evidence to Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee\)’ **\[I,** **J\]**. Therefore, Dr Grainger’s research has provided essential knowledge and understanding to senior HMRC officials and, in turn, informed the information they provided to UK parliament surrounding trade compliance, specifically in regard to costings surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and what this would cost in customs declarations **\[J\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Insights from neuroscience, including the role of reward and ‘gamification’ for learning, are essential to inform effective approaches to education. Educational neuroscience research from the University of Bristol \(UoB\) \(i\) underpinned decisions by two UK NGOs to provide large\-scale, innovative funding to inform national teaching practice and education policy; and \(ii\) contributed directly to innovative continuing professional development and initial teacher development. Take\-up of these new approaches to teaching and learning has reduced misunderstanding about how the brain learns and raised the awareness of both practitioners, and the public, of the importance of neuroscientific evidence for education. Our UoB research has also informed international educational policy and practice regarding teacher education. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Myths about the brain – neuromyths – often persist in schools and colleges and can result in the use of ineffective approaches to teaching. Howard\-Jones has been an influential advocate of the establishment of a field of enquiry dedicated to bridging the gap between neuroscience and education \[3\]. A particular focus of his research has been the link between reward and learning, and the use of game\-based interventions, to motivate and improve the outcomes of learners. 

 The link between reward and learning has chiefly been studied in the context of learning to maximise reward. This type of learning, which we share with animals and relies on mid\-brain response, differs greatly from the learning valued by educators, which typically involves memory of knowledge and understanding that can be declared and explained. 

 Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \(fMRI\) to monitor brain activity Howard\-Jones demonstrated an association between gamification \(embedding learning in game\-like activities\) and deactivation of default mode network \(DMN\) regions in the brain \[5\], as well as increased engagement self\-reported by participants. An earlier classroom study revealed that electrodermal activity \(signalling emotional response\) is further increased in participants when reward is uncertain \[1\], and a behavioural study of adult learning showed the potential of reward\-based neurocomputational models of behaviour in the understanding and development of effective learning games \[2\]. 

 This scientific work identifying new links between reward and learning has been complemented by critical analysis of how ideas about neuroscience can be interpreted and sometimes misinterpreted in the classroom \[3, 4\]. A review of educational interventions and approaches informed by neuroscience \[4\] carried out on behalf of and funded by the Education Endowment Trust \[i\], highlighted challenges in bridging the neuroscience\-education gap using randomised controlled trials. A key issue encountered when implementing ideas from neuroscience in the classroom was the level of understanding possessed by teachers about the scientific basis of learning \[3\]. 

 To tackle the issue of neuromyths and improve scientific understanding of learning amongst teachers, Howard\-Jones spent three months \(October – December 2016\) as Senior Fellow at the International Bureau of Education \(IBE\), during which he developed and introduced novel concepts suitable for communicating with teachers about how learning proceeds, and how this may contribute to student engagement.

#  Informed innovative national neuroscience and education funding initiative 

 The notion that neuroscience can inform education has gained global traction in recent years, but there has been a dearth of research\-informed practice in this area. In 2014, The Education Endowment Foundation and Wellcome Trust jointly funded a GBP6 million initiative, spanning Neuroscience and Education that aimed to provide the practical evidence needed on how neuroscience might improve educational outcomes \[A\]. Howard\-Jones’s review \[4\], which included a rating of current ideas in terms of their evidence\-base and their distance to implementation was *“pivotal in \[the\] decision”* to fund this programme \[A\]. The review was also used to inform researchers applying for funds within this initiative. The programme funded six projects, including Howard\-Jones’ research \[i\], that focused on a large\-scale trial involving 44 schools using uncertain reward in Year 8 science lessons \[5, 6\]. Summaries of the outcomes from these six projects were circulated via the ‘Journal of the Chartered College of Teaching \(2018\). Issue 2: Science of Learning’ to all UK schools, thereby supporting teachers to make use of this research in their teaching. 

#  National and international teacher education and professional development 

 In May 2017, Howard\-Jones and Jay, drawing on their research on learning and reward \[5, 6\], were invited by the Wellcome Trust to act as consultants and presenters for a new MOOC \(Massive Open Online Course\) run by the National STEM Learning Centre and funded by Wellcome \[ii\]. The course, on the ‘Science of Learning’, has allowed teachers from around the world to improve their scientific understanding of reward and other concepts relevant to classroom teaching. The course has attracted 19,708 enrolled participants and 79 reviews, with a rating of 4.9 out of 5 \(December 2020\) \[B\]. The STEM Learning Centre evaluation \(April 2020\) found that 86% of teachers who pursue this course reported agreement with statement; *“My practice of using evidence critically to inform my teaching has changed”* \[Cii\]. Similarly, 98% of teachers reported an impact on themselves as a result of the course, and 81% reported an impact on their students \[Cii\]. In an earlier evaluation \(July 2018\), one participant noted the course had provided; *“More understanding of…the involvement of the reward system on working memory and long\-term memory”* and showed more than 60% of MOOC enrolments are non\-UK internationals \[Ci\]. One participant writing on STEM Learning centre blog said of the course: *""Doing this CPD has made me really think about lesson design and for that, I will become a better teacher”*, emphasising a key impact on improving teaching and thereby children’s learning \[D\]. 

 In 2017, Howard\-Jones was awarded funds from Wellcome Trust \[iii\], to incorporate concepts from neuroscience \[including 1\-6\], into the University of Bristol Post\-Graduate Certificate in Education \(PGCE\), reaching approximately 165 student teachers per year \[A\]. This project also developed guidelines for other teacher education institutions to follow Bristol’s example and, in 2019, the Wellcome Trust funded an extension to this work \[v\] to demonstrate its application in mentoring student teachers on school practice. Videos of mentors drawing on the concepts have now been published \[Ji\] as a resource for teachers when debriefing student teachers following classroom observation. From September 2019, Bath Spa University adopted the concepts for presentation to all their student teachers during the taught phase of their courses, training around 250 teachers each year \[Jii\], and another 10 teacher training institutions have invited the project team to present the concepts to their staff with a view to including these in their Initial Teacher Education courses. Additionally, the extension project team has been funded by the Wellcome trust \[iv\] to liaise with, and promote their work to, key stakeholders \(including OFSTED, DfE, Universities Council for the Education of Teachers \(UCET\) and the Chartered College of Teaching\). 

 Concepts and resources developed to tackle the issue of neuromyths are also being introduced into teacher education in developing countries. Howard\-Jones has undertaken five UNESCO\-IBE ‘missions’ \(2017\-2019\) to work with the Seychelles Institute of Education to incorporate the concepts into teacher education, reaching 107 students and 27 members to staff to date \[Ei\]. IBE see this as a testing ground for efforts to distribute the concepts more widely across Africa and beyond. In 2020\-2021, the IBE plan to pilot a teacher training course on the neuroscience of learning \[Eii\] using content from Howard\-Jones fellowship research and is exploring the possibility to pilot similar courses in Korea and South Africa \[Ei\]. A planned meeting went ahead online \(Oct 2020\) organised by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education with input from Howard\-Jones for the delivery of the concepts to teachers in Nicaragua \[Eiii\]. The IBE often refers to the research in this case study \[3, 6\], when participating in formal and informal discussions with policy makers and practitioners all over the world. The IBE Director highlights that *“Professor Howard\-Jones’ IBE work on translated neuroscience knowledge is integrated into the IBE’s training courses for teachers and curriculum specialists, placing them at the frontiers of knowledge and practice""* \[Ei\]. 

 Howard\-Jones has also engaged with practicing teachers from schools across the South\-West and Midlands to improve understanding and change attitudes regarding scientifically informed practice. Peer\-reviewed evaluation of the impact of 1.5 hours of continuing professional development \(CPD\) on 585 teachers’ underlying beliefs found that in comparison to ratings collected before the professional development, 71% of attendees increased the usefulness they attributed to scientific explanations, and 57% reduced the rated usefulness of performative, prescriptive and unscientific ideas \[Gi, Gii\]. A follow\-up within the study, showed this change in beliefs persisted after 6\-12 weeks of attendees having returned to work \[Gi, Gii\].  The Director of a Teaching School Alliance in Bristol, which acts a hub for sharing good practice, noted that research and engagement by Howard\-Jones, *‘will have an impact on school policies and practice and has inspired colleagues to undertake further study with the University’* \[F\]. 

#  Informed international education policy 

 During his IBE Fellowship, Howard\-Jones contributed knowledge and dissemination materials on using neuroscience to inform IBE’s work developing education policy and practice internationally and positively impacting on the understanding and awareness of key stakeholders in relation to education and neuroscience issues. This was achieved through the creation of a ‘clearinghouse’ for the Sciences of Learning \[Iii\]; this online portal was launched in 2019 by IBE Director \[Ii\]. The IBE Director noted that *“Professor Howard\-Jones was instrumental in the setting up of this clearinghouse, not only by producing* \[six\] *briefings to be added to the clearinghouse but also by quality assuring other briefings""* \[Ei\]. 

 Through his Fellowship, Howard\-Jones significantly enhanced the thinking of and debates between international education policy makers, interacting with United Nations senior officials and representatives of the UN Permanent Missions in Geneva and presenting his work at the International Biennial Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education in Seychelles \(2017\), attended by teachers, educational leaders and policy\-makers from across the state \[Ei\]. In 2019, Howard\-Jones presented his work to a High\-level Forum at Daegu \(South Korea\) which, for the first time, brought together over 200 participants from 14 countries, including ministers of education, senior experts on teaching and learning and neuroscientists. Following his presentation a Ministerial Roundtable, attended by ministers of education from Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, Seychelles, South Africa and Zimbabwe, emphasised the importance of using neuroscientific knowledge to guide teaching, learning and assessment, with specific reference to the importance of engaging teachers as presented by Howard\-Jones and discussed initiatives to achieve this \[Ii\]. 

 In recognition of his contribution to the work of the IBE, which the Director reports “ *has impacted with considerable and increasing reach and significance in relation to IBE’s vision""* \[Ei\], Howard\-Jones has been appointed as a Senior Fellow of the IBE, where he will continue to inform how neuroscience can feed into educational thinking, policy, and practice. 

#  Informed national education policy 

 Howard\-Jones’ research has also informed UK education policy debates, including generating “considerable interest” in his contribution at a policy debate on 6 September 2018 with selected researchers and representatives from the Department for Education and Ofsted that aimed to support evidence\-based policy making in education \[A\]. It has also informed the DfE’s development of the Early Career Framework for teachers \[H\] – which underpins an entitlement to a fully\-funded two\-year package of structured training and support for early career teachers. 

#  Increased public awareness and understanding 

 Howard\-Jones has undertaken a number of high\-profile engagement activities that have raised public awareness and understanding of the brain’s reward system and its relation to learning. He was a regular presenter on the award winning \(Broadcast Award, 2016\) and twice BAFTA\-nominated \(2016, 2017\), Secret Life of 4, 5 and 6 Year Olds \(developed with the Wellcome Trust and reaching up to 2,300,000 viewers\), and co\-authored the book of the series. The series \(and book\) refers to the research featured in this case study \[1, 2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Networks of ageing cast iron trunk mains are key in the supply of drinking water to millions of consumers worldwide, and any interruption in supply associated with pipe failure, catastrophic or otherwise, is undesirable operationally and problematic, both socially and environmentally. Consequently, network operators seek to reduce the occurrence of failure by proactively targeting and replacing high\-risk mains. Accurately determining where and when a pipe needs repair and where asset life may be prolonged for decades is a desired strategy for water utilities globally. Experimental data and the associated physical and empirical models from research at the University of Surrey are being used to inform asset and risk management and form a key part of Thames Water’s 2015\-2025 trunk main strategy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The UK water industry operates a supply and distribution network consisting of an ageing, predominantly cast iron infrastructure. Research at Surrey carried out by Professor Paul Smith, Dr Mike Mulheron, and others over more than 20 years \(1997\-present\), into both small diameter \(distribution main\) and large diameter \(trunk main\) cast iron water pipes, has led to a detailed understanding of how these assets behave after long periods in service. 

 Early work on distribution main pipes **\[R1, R2\]** was key to developing an understanding of the behaviour of cast iron and the role of aqueous corrosion \(graphitisation\) on material strength and pipe performance. An important insight was that there are two distinct defect populations present within cast iron pipes in service, one relating to the microstructure of the cast iron \(reflecting casting method and quality\) and the second arising from in\-service degradation processes, such as graphitisation **\[R1\]**. Subsequent work, with Dr Hal Belmonte, developed a \(Weibull\) statistical approach, based on the strength of small samples from the network, to inform the asset management of the distribution pipe network at both street and area level **\[R2\]**. 

 The underlying understanding of changes in material and pipe behaviour over time informed the work on trunk mains, which began in 2006 and was then supported further \(2011\) through a 4\-year, £1.2M project funded by industry and complemented by two EPRSC EngD studentships. This led to new insights into the morphology of cast iron corrosion and its spatial distribution in actual pipes in service **\[R3\]**. A key finding was that where the layer of graphitised material is of uniform thickness, the associated strength reduction is modest, but where the penetration is more localised, the strength reduction can be significant, e.g., a depth of graphitisation extending to 10% of the wall thickness can produce a 50% loss in strength. This was transformative, in terms of understanding, for a sector that has historically worked with a traditional loss\-of\-section approach to determining residual strength. It was also shown that the extent and morphology of the graphitisation can vary significantly \(at the sub\-metre level\) within a single section of pipe. Based on this knowledge, the appropriate application of simple strength\-of\-materials and fracture mechanics approaches were found to provide reasonable bounds for the residual strength data measured experimentally **\[R3\]**. 

 The models were refined in subsequent work, in particular through the more robust incorporation of the pipe geometry into the fracture mechanics analysis, and applied to representative pipe elements **\[R4\]**. The revised model has been shown to provide a useful assessment of the residual load capacity of pipe in a trunk main; this was demonstrated by generating failure envelopes based on assumed defects at particular locations around the circumference of a pipe. Further, a case study demonstrated the potential to apply this methodology to a specific example. Such an approach explains why a slowly deteriorating pipe can suddenly and catastrophically fail when neither the internal pressure nor external loading has changed. 

 The understanding developed in these studies has influenced the asset management tools used by the industry. Critically, this work has led to a growing realisation that there is a significant technical challenge to be addressed in developing non\-destructive testing techniques for buried pipe assets to enable the condition to be assessed with adequate accuracy. This was highlighted in a paper **\[R5\]**, which reviews the origins and morphology of graphitisation \(including new data sets\), the consequences for defining accurate and up\-to\-date condition assessment protocols and hence the type and urgency of rehabilitation strategies. The work demonstrates conclusively that understanding the integrity/life expectancy of water networks requires non\-destructive evaluation of large diameter cast iron trunk mains, with particular reference to the kinds of defects that are likely to be present and the issues that make assessment difficult.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Thames Water supplies 2.6 billion litres of water every day through 31,400 km of water mains to nine million customers. The potable water network includes 3,600 km of trunk mains up to 60 inches in diameter. A trunk main is a large diameter main carrying potable water under high pressure from treatment works and reservoirs to the distribution network. Trunk mains were laid up to 200 years ago and are predominantly made of cast iron **\[S1\]**. 

 Major cities such as London have significant subterranean property and infrastructure, in particular basements, as well as a high population density. Consequently, a trunk main failure has the potential to cause significant damage to property and major disruption to water supply and travel. There is evidence of a gradual increase in burst rates of larger trunk mains over time, and avoiding trunk main failures is a top priority as evidenced by the launch of the Thames Water trunk main strategy \(2015\-2025\) and associated action plan in 2017 **\[S2\]**. The implementation phase began in October 2017, with the changes and improvements continuing as business as usual thereafter. 

 Thames Water’s Managing Director for water said: “I’m confident that once delivered, our action plan will improve the way we manage our trunk mains and that through collating better information about our network, coupled with better risk modelling, we can reduce the impact on our customers.” **\[S3\]** 

 The asset life\-cycle of trunk mains is not fully understood and may range from decades to centuries. Targeted repair provides affordable and less disruptive solutions to achieve low levels of bursts whilst avoiding unnecessary replacement of all buried pipes. This provides significant operational savings in water and reduced street excavation, raw materials and carbon emissions. 

 Thames Water had a strategy for trunk mains with investment of £147m in the period 2015\-2020 and a further £97m added in 2017. This includes expenditure on increased monitoring, replacement of high consequence mains, information gathering, technology development, development of condition, and deterioration models. Thames Water has been working extensively with the University of Surrey to support these initiatives, in particular with technology development and condition, deterioration and risk models **\[S4\]**. 

 The Thames Water strategic review document **\[S2\]** sets out an investment strategy from 2015 to 2025, including an ongoing programme of work with the University of Surrey to understand corrosion, confirm deterioration rates, and the causal factors that lead to trunk main failure **\[R3, R4, R5\]**. 

 A consequence and probability model has been developed to understand and predict trunk main deterioration for asset management purposes. This allows Thames Water to determine an appropriate replacement rate and level of investment to manage the trunk network effectively. 

 Thames Water’s Asset Investment Manager \(AIM\) Risk Model has been developed in conjunction with the University of Surrey and comprises a consequence of failure model and a probability of failure model. Combining these models results in an overall risk ranking of trunk mains to be created consisting of over 100,000 individually ranked mains **\[S4\]**. 

 The Risk Model allows Thames Water to target investment \(£49m per annum from 2015\-2020\) under multiple serviceability and budgetary constraints, running scenarios to help plan their investment or communicate the cost of improving specific measures to the business. 

 “The outputs of the AIM Risk Model are used primarily to influence investment decisions, however the rankings influence a large number of decisions and plans in the business. As an example, the High Consequence Mains and Valves lists influence operational strategies and steers priorities for maintenance through AMP6 \[Asset Management Plan\].” **\[S4\]** 

 The probability of trunk main failure is dependent on pipe condition, which the work with the University of Surrey has shown to be highly variable and localised **\[R3, R5\]**. Thames Water requires better assessment of the condition of cast iron trunk mains in order to increase the efficiency of mains replacement activities and reduce the risk to their customers and stakeholders. However, there is currently little incentive for the development of in\-pipe condition assessment devices by contractors due to the current rates of investment. To promote such development, Thames Water is now investing in a Trunk Main Research Rig to enable a detailed evaluation of in\-pipe devices without risk to the customers or the trunk main network **\[S1\]**. Thames Water went out to tender for a design, build and operation contract in February 2018. The Research Rig is due to be commissioned in the first half of 2021. 

 Thames Water’s Lead Water Network Scientist has said, “Thames Water's long term partnership with the University of Surrey has been key to shaping our strategy for managing our critical cast iron water and wastewater assets, including our decision to build an innovative £1.2 million testing facility.” **\[S5\]** 

 If initial validation is successful, suppliers will be invited to test their devices on the test rig and devices proving to be successful on the rig will then be tested on the network on buried mains. The University of Surrey research will impact all UK and global water utilities through UK Water Industry Research \(UKWIR\), international access to the Pipe Test Rig and sharing of real\-world results conducted in trunk mains under many cities. 

 In summary, cast iron trunk mains are a critical asset for the water industry globally. The long term, ongoing collaboration between Thames Water and the University of Surrey has led to an understanding of these critical assets’ performance, operational risk and life\-cycle. The results of the collaboration are key factors in the development of Thames Water’s current strategies to manage these assets and has informed the £350m AMP7 capital programme which includes the monitoring and refurbishment of trunk mains **\[S6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Welsh Government’s goal is to have one million active Welsh speakers by 2050. Cardiff applied linguists investigated the current challenges to achieving this goal across several national and social contexts: learning Welsh as an adult, speaking Welsh within families and in communities, and the technology and resources needed to support Welsh language use. Outputs and recommendations from the research led to changes to the national Welsh for Adults curriculum and a reconfiguration of the Wales\-wide Mentrau Iaith community support scheme. They also shaped the Welsh Government’s draft National Policy on Welsh Language Transmission and Use within Families and the Welsh Government Action Plan for Welsh\-language Technology, which culminated in an innovative corpus of over 11M Welsh words. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Supporting the use of Welsh in everyday life is key to the Welsh Government’s goal of one million Welsh speakers by 2050. Currently approximately 45,000 people speak Welsh daily \(2020 Annual Population Survey for Wales\). Cardiff researchers, with cross\-disciplinary expertise in applied and corpus linguistics \(Wray, Knight\), behavioural change in language use \(Evas\), and Welsh \(Evas\), led a series of research projects investigating barriers to Welsh language use. 

 **2.1 Learning Welsh as an adult** 

 From 2010\-12, Wray, at that time seconded 0.4FTE from the School of English, Communication & Philosophy to the School of Welsh to cross\-fertilise expertise and develop Applied Linguistics research collaborations, jointly led a Welsh Government project to investigate ways of improving Welsh language teaching and learning in adults **\[G3.1\]**. Wray conceptualised and designed the project, directed the fieldwork and analysis, worked with external advisors, and completed a detailed literature review into how lessons on effective language teaching and learning worldwide might relate to Wales. The fieldwork identified what was and was not working in current provision, taking in the views of learners \(all stages\), tutors and materials developers across the different providers within Wales. It also identified concern that the Welsh of West Wales was insufficiently represented in teaching materials. The research findings led to the following recommendations **\[3.1\]**: 

-  development of a new national Welsh for Adults curriculum sub\-designed for three regional varieties \(North, South and West\); 

-  enhancements to teaching materials including vocabulary lists and graded readers; 

-  revised training for tutors and new guidelines for course book writers; 

-  more flexible learning opportunities, e.g. informal learning, intensive courses; 

-  the development of a representative Welsh language corpus. 

#  2.2 Language use in families and local communities 

 In 2013, as a direct result of this project, the Cardiff team investigated the role of community\-based language planning in Wales, focussing on three organisations, including the Mentrau Iaith \(22 community\-based Welsh language support providers\). The research found the Mentrau Iaith successful in promoting Welsh language use through community development and language planning strategies **\[3.2\]**. The research report recommended that the Welsh Government: 

-  establish a longer funding cycle to enable more effective planning, target\-setting and impact\-monitoring, with additional funding to support quality and sustainability; 

-  encourage community collaboration between development agencies, to more effectively promote the wider use of the Welsh language; 

-  initiate behavioural change training to assist language adoption. 

 The Cardiff team subsequently undertook a 2015 Welsh Government\-funded study of language transmission and use in families **\[G3.2\]**. The research found that intergenerational transmission of Welsh is not a decision, but an unconscious behaviour **\[3.3\]**. Family structures and linguistic practices are key to improving transmission: for example, living with two Welsh\-speaking parents is likely to increase transmission **\[3.3\]**. The research recommended adopting socio\-psychological approaches and techniques for behavioural change to help achieve the Welsh Government’s goal of increasing the number of Welsh language users **\[3.4\]**. 

#  2.3 Infrastructure to support Welsh language use 

 The Welsh for Adults research outlined in Section 2.1 recommended creating a corpus of the Welsh language, as one means of embracing new technologies in language teaching and support. Research conducted by the Cardiff team revealed that: 

-  Welsh users favoured Welsh\-language interfaces in everyday technology \(e.g. phone apps, computer software, parking meters, cash points\) and learners used them to gain exposure to Welsh, supporting habit change and normalising usage **\[3.5\]**; 

-  improving language choice architecture in e\-service provision \(e.g. websites and ATMs\) to be “friction free” could increase the uptake of language services e\-provision **\[3.6\]**. 

 Corpora are key to machine translation and web search tools, enabling users to access technologies in their preferred language. For the ambitious goal of creating a major Welsh language corpus, Knight led an interdisciplinary team \(including academic expertise from within and beyond Cardiff, and non\-academic partners including the BBC, S4C, and other major publishers\) to develop a new linguistic resource and innovative approaches to collecting and tagging the material. The £1.8M ESRC/AHRC\-funded project **\[G3.3\]** resulted in *Corpws Cenedlaethol Cymraeg Cyfoes* \(CorCenCC\). At over 11 million words, it is the largest corpus of contemporary spoken, written and e\-language Welsh. Collected and tagged in part using new crowd\-sourcing methods, the dataset is integrated into a bespoke infrastructure built to enable the examination of patterns of frequency, register, pronunciation, grammar, morphology and word collocation. Novel Welsh language part\-of\-speech, semantic taggers and tagsets were also created, along with a novel pedagogic toolkit and word frequency lists. All tools and data are open source, to facilitate the future creation of corpora for other languages **\[3.7\]**. 

 In sum, Applied Linguistics research by Wray, Evas and Knight has optimised the learning of Welsh through recommendations for policy, modifications to practice, and creating a major corpus resource accessible to all users and researchers of Welsh.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff research informed Welsh Government policies on language learning, language transmission among families and communities, and Welsh language technologies, as well as the work of NGOs implementing these policies. The *Corpws Cenedlaethol Cymraeg Cyfoes* \(CorCenCC\) provided new technological infrastructure for delivering aspects of Welsh Government policy on technology and language support. A user\-driven resource, it meets the needs of a wide range of stakeholders from individual learners to broadcasters and publishers. 

 **4.1 Improved opportunities for learning Welsh as an adult** 

 The project report, co\-authored by Wray and other Cardiff colleagues **\[3.1\],** was cited in the Welsh for Adults Review group’s report *Raising Our Sights: Review of Welsh for Adults* in July 2013 \(just prior to the REF 2021 impact period\). Welsh Government responded that it was “ *important that the curriculum is revised in light of the findings*” **\[5.1**, p.6 **\]**, and in 2016 the National Centre for Learning Welsh was established to implement the recommendations **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. This Centre is responsible for all aspects of the Learn Welsh sector, from curriculum and course development to resources for tutors, research, marketing and e\-learning **\[5.3\]**. It coordinates Welsh language learning for 13,260 learners across Wales \(2018\-19\), via 11 course providers. Director Helen Prosser noted that “ *the National Centre has implemented many of the research recommendations in the Cardiff University report”* **\[5.3\]**. Providing specific examples, Prosser confirmed that the National Centre has **:** 

-  implemented a new Welsh for Adults curriculum on a national basis with three regional varieties which “ *has resulted in many benefits for students*”. She also noted it “ *led to better tutor training…aligned to the national course*” **\[5.3\]**. 

-  enhanced teaching materials to ensure that *“vocabulary has been given a higher priority in the new courses*”, with new colour coded vocabulary materials **\[5.3\]**. 

-  revised training for tutors and developed new guidelines for tutors creating coursebooks. Prosser stated that “ *prior to the Centre, there was one two\-year course for training tutors. In response to the research recommendations, the Centre has now created a short course called Starting Teaching*” **\[5.3\]**. Accredited by the Welsh Joint Education Committee, the course has doubled the numbers of tutors being trained and ensured there is an increased number of newly qualified teachers available. 

-  initiated more flexible learning opportunities, including informal learning and intensive courses. Prosser notes that, as recommended by the research, national events to support informal learning are now organised by the Centre **\[5.3\]**. 

 Prosser summarised that “ *these changes have produced \(and continue to produce\) benefits for students and tutors of the Welsh for Adults programme*” **\[5.3\]**. 

#  4.2 Improved opportunities for language use in families and local communities 

###  Cardiff research influenced Welsh Government funding for community language organisations and initiated a new 2020 policy on transmission in families: 

###  a. Enhanced operation of community\-based language planning agencies 

 In March 2014, the research on the Mentrau Iaith **\[3.2\]** was discussed in the Senedd with the then First Minister noting: “ *We agree with the review’s conclusions, and we are eager to proceed with implementing the majority of the recommendations*” **\[5.4a\]**. Richard Thurston, Welsh Government’s Deputy Chief Social Research Officer, confirmed recommendations from **\[3.2\]** *“provided the basis for a more strategic approach to the planning of initiatives to facilitate language use at community level”* **\[5.5\]**. For example: 

-  In 2014 the Welsh Government announced additional funding amounting to £750,000 over two years for the Mentrau Iaith **\[5.4b\].** Since 2015 each Menter Iaith has received ≥£60,000 to employ at least two members of staff and increase capacity for new activities, totalling over £7 million funding in the REF period. The funding cycle for the Mentrau Iaith was increased to 3 years from 2016, with a requirement for organisations to include a plan for effective community partnership working, e.g. with Communities First, local authorities, and other third sector organisations **\[5.4b\]**. 

-  Welsh Government added intensive training to effect behavioural change **\[3.2\]** as a core part of Mentrau Iaith Cymru’s role in coordinating the organisations across Wales **\[5.4b\]**. 

###  b. Welsh Government policy on Welsh language transmission in families 

 Based on his research into Welsh language transmission in families **\[3.3\]**, Evas was seconded to Welsh Government in 2017 to lead on implementing the transmission policy plan. Thurston confirmed that Evas’ study was used *“to inform the Welsh Government’s draft national policy on Welsh language transmission and use in families”* **\[5.5\]**. The policy **\[5.6\]** \(part of *Cymraeg 2050*\), went to consultation in early 2020. Delayed due to Covid\-19 **\[5.5\]**, it will be published in 2021. It cites Cardiff research **\[3.4\]** as the underpinning source and reflects the research in: 

-  noting how “the transmission of Welsh isn’t a decision, but an unconscious behaviour” **\[5.6**, p.19 **\]**; 

-  acknowledging the importance of family structures and linguistic practices in increasing transmission and therefore the numbers of Welsh speakers **\[5.6**, p.8 **\]**; 

-  committing to reviewing Welsh Government’s existing work on language transmission to “make sure that it’s based on evidence from behavioural science” **\[5.6**, p.25 **\]**. 

 The policy recognises these principles as the basis for “tools, methods and resources to encourage more people to pass Welsh on to their children as a matter of choice” **\[5.6**, p.6 **\]**. Following the findings of the Cardiff research **\[3.3, 3.4\]**, it outlines long\-term behavioural change techniques to improve Welsh language transmission in families, including a language use pledge programme and developing an online presence to support parents’ confidence in speaking Welsh with their children **\[5.6**, pp. 23\-24 **\]**. 

 **4.3 Improved infrastructure to support Welsh language use** 

 Cardiff research also influenced Welsh Government policy on Welsh language technology. In 2017, Evas was appointed to the Welsh Government’s Welsh Technology Board **\[5.7**, p.30 **\]** to advise on technological and digital issues in relation to Welsh. Richard Thurston confirmed that Evas’ contributions – in particular, *“\[raising\] the importance of reducing the friction that makes it more difficult for Welsh speakers to access services in their language*” – *“transferred directly”* to the Board’s ‘Welsh Language Technology Action Plan’ \(2018\) **\[5.5\]**. For example: 

-  Work Package 7 of the Action Plan focusses on Welsh interfaces for technology users in education settings **\[5.7,** p13 **\]**. Echoing Evas’ research **\[3.6\]**, it outlines steps so that *“students, pupils and staff can use a Welsh language UI and facilities to help create Welsh content automatically and in a friction\-free manner”* **\[5.7**, p.11 **\]**. 

-  Work Package 4 outlines steps “ *to create a friction\-free Welsh language choice architecture*” **\[**proposed in **3.6\]**, referring to the ease and feasibility with which users can opt to use interfaces and technologies through Welsh **\[5.7**, p.11 **\]**. 

-  The Action Plan notes the need for “ *up\-to\-date linguistic infrastructure to enable us to realise the vision of Cymraeg 2050*” **\[5.7**, p.24 **\]**, e.g. dictionaries, terminological resources and a corpus. 

 The Action Plan is already being enacted. For example, Thurston noted that Work Package 7 was implemented from November 2020, “ *with the default interface language for Microsoft Office 365 changed from English to Welsh”* for learners in Welsh\-medium schools **\[5.5\]**. 

 A further significant advancement of the Cardiff research and its impact was the release of the CorCenCC corpus **\[3.7\]** in November 2020. Following the project’s British Council\-funded public launch in February 2017, Knight’s interview on *Radio Wales* was a springboard for attracting the public as crowd\-sourced data\-collectors and analysers \(integral to the project design\). This and similar engagement events have reached policy makers, educators, publishers and the media, and brought many thousands to the website \(167,149 hits by 31/12/20\) **\[5.8\]**.  Welsh Government funding \(£219,964\) was awarded to develop open\-source spin\-off tools that bridge the corpus to learning and technological applications and thus improve machine learning and translation, and the use of Welsh in Artificial Intelligence. These include: 

-  Welsh language WordNet: a database of relationships between words and synonyms 

-  Stemmer: a program that identifies and removes word affixes to reveal the root 

-  Word and term embeddings: probabilistic information to improve the accuracy of how Welsh is interpreted by machines, for use in translation and speech\-to\-text technology. 

 CorCenCC and this satellite work fulfil two policy objectives of the Welsh Government: *“to capture Welsh as it is being written and spoken today”* and *“to release, under open licence, more Welsh language technology tools and resources”* **\[5.9**, p.3 **\]**. The 2019 curriculum for Welsh for Adults stated that *“publication of this corpus is certain to have a heavy influence on future curriculum content”* **\[5.10,** p.36 **\]**. 

 In summary, Cardiff University research in applied linguists made major contributions to Welsh language learning and use in Wales, through interdisciplinary collaborations that: established the current state of language learning and use practices; fed into policy; and developed new tools for learning and studying Welsh.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our impact falls into three mutually reinforcing categories. Since 2014 our research has: 

 1. Enhanced public understanding of the Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site \(WHS\), through the development of permanent and temporary displays at 5 major museums \(combined annual visitor figures over 600,000 per annum\) and a free online course ‘Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier’ developed with FutureLearn \(reaching 64,563 registered users in 170 countries\). 

 2.  Provided data feeding directly into decisions about the management of Scheduled Ancient Monuments and to inform land management discussions with local landowners based on our analysis of the WHS at 10 sites through non\-intrusive surveys, excavation, standing building survey and conservation/repair. 

 3. Democratised heritage practice by running training specifically for local communities, equipping them to contribute to WHS conservation. This work has included the National Lottery Heritage Fund ‘Hadrian’s Wall Community Archaeology Project’ \(WallCAP\) and its 270 registered volunteers, at least 37 of whom were first engaged through our FutureLearn course. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research conducted by the Newcastle team has resulted in a thorough re\-evaluation of the archaeology and history of Hadrian’s Wall and the communities who have lived in its shadow. The work has led to new knowledge of the Wall zone’s buildings, structures and landscapes, but also of the associated material culture and social practices. 

  

 Allason\-Jones’ pioneering research, for example, explored the way that small finds and epigraphy could offer fresh insights into the lives of frontier communities. Her work pioneered an informed archaeological approach to the study of women’s lives in an area previously dominated by male narratives and debates about soldiers and strategies \( **PUB1**; Grant 6\). Haynes, whose work has sought to refocus research on life in communities created directly and indirectly through the Roman state, drove forward new work on ethnicity and identity amongst those who occupied the Wall zone. This was undertaken through studies of groups associated with units that garrisoned the Wall \( **PUB2**\) and through work on personal adornment in the frontier zone. In the latter case, this involved looking at the way that glass, created as a raw material far from the frontier, was refashioned into objects of adornment in the frontier zone \(Grant 4\). Collins initiated research into the longer history of the Wall, employing the close study of small finds alongside a reappraisal of structural archaeology to enrich understanding of those periods of Wall history that had consistently been neglected or indeed ignored, notably the late 3rd\-5th centuries AD and after \( **PUB3**; **PUB4**\). Much of this work was brought together in the ‘Summary of Excavation and Research’ published in 2019 \( **PUB5**\). 

 The Newcastle team has undertaken research in several ways, including substantial excavations in extra\-mural areas, large\-area geophysical surveys of entire settlements, UAV surveys, overarching surveys of stone sourcing and monument building and digital 3D\-capture. Crucially, all these research approaches have been tied to programmes that train and engage volunteers from outside the University sector. Large\-scale excavations at Maryport directed by Haynes have revolutionised understandings of cult areas beyond the fort walls \( **PUB6**; Grant 1\). At Beckfoot and Corbridge \( **PUB5**; Grant 3\), extensive geophysical and UAV \(drone\) survey directed by Haynes \(Grant 3\), has extensively characterised the scale and organisation of two major settlement areas revealing a range of extra\-mural spaces and cemeteries. On\-going research by Collins as part of WallCAP \(Grant 2; Grant 5\) has conducted survey and excavation at 10 sites to date. Research and fieldwork by WallCAP is also directly linked to physical improvement of the fabric and condition of the monument, as well as improved knowledge of historic risks to the WHS.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research impact falls into three mutually reinforcing categories and serves several overlapping groups of beneficiaries. 

 *1. Building public understanding of the Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site \(WHS\)* 

 Most visitors who encounter the WHS do so via one or more of the museum displays located at sites along the length of the Wall. Since 2014 5 museums have incorporated our research into redesign of displays which receive over 600,000 visits a year. At Corbridge Roman Town our field survey results were incorporated into the new museum display, conveying information that the Curator described as ‘fundamental to our interpretative approach in the museum and … on site’, while also noting that our laser scanning work was ‘essential’ for production of a replica ‘vital in communicating ‘colour’ and vibrancy of the Roman period to our museum visitors’ \( **IMP1**; **PUB5**\). Our work has also informed new exhibitions at Vindolanda \(small finds\) \( **IMP2**; **PUB3**; **PUB4**\) and at Birdoswald, where our analysis of data excavated in a joint project with English Heritage provided what the curator terms a ‘key part’ of the new display \( **IMP1**; **PUB1**; **PUB5**\). The Chairman of the Senhouse Museum Trust observes that our excavations at Maryport ‘provided the Museum with data to underpin the redisplay of our collection that will be crucial to our success as an institution in the post\-Covid world’ \( **IMP3**; **PUB6**\). The Great North Museum in Newcastle \(managed by the University\) is the gateway for the WHS and is integral to our engagement strategy. It provides a key venue for temporary exhibitions based on our research, such as the GlobalGlass project’s ‘Frontier Fashion: Glass Bangles of the Roman North’ \(5,045 visitors, October 2017 – January 2018\). By working in partnership with the museum team our research has reached wider audiences through talks, blogs and our FutureLearn course, emphasising especially our work on epigraphic material and how material culture was used in negotiating frontier identities \( **PUB2**; **PUB5**\). 

 Our free massive open online course \(MOOC\) ‘Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier’ ran in partnership with FutureLearn from September 2014\-July 2020. Based on our research, the course introduces the complexity of the Wall communities in Antiquity \( **PUB1**; **PUB2**\), the dynamic nature of the Wall’s development \( **PUB3**\), and the methodologies, from finds research \( **PUB4**\) to excavation \( **PUB6**\) and landscape survey \( **PUB5**\), that continue to transform our understanding of the WHS. The MOOC culminates in a discussion on the challenges of managing the WHS designed to encourage participants continue to interact with the Wall, its study and management. This 6\-week course attracted 64,563 registered users from 170 countries \(approximately 60% of participants were from the UK, 20% from other EU countries, 18% from North America\). Detailed analysis of participant questionnaires indicates 95% satisfaction with the course. Over 98% of active learner participants believed that they learned something new and 85\-95% had shared their learning with others. A survey of participants \(n=3823\) revealed that after the course around 70% pursued further interest in Hadrian’s Wall: some were inspired to take degree programmes whereas a majority visited museums or pursued further reading \(80%\). 35% reported purchasing these reading materials, 30% of whom spent more than GBP30 \( **IMP4**, 6.5.2\). Most participants reported that the course inspired them to visit Hadrian’s Wall itself \(60%\); testimonies provide indirect evidence of the regional financial benefit stimulated by the MOOC \- ‘So, after the FutureLearn course I have spent money buying books, employed local travel agents, some b&b’s and restaurants and found Britain as a travel destination again ... Also our local adult education center thought about organizing a hiking trip there’ \( **IMP5**\). 

 *2. Provided data which feeds directly into Scheduling decisions and land management discussions with local landowners* 

 Our field research has informed strategies for management of 10 sites, 6 of which \(\*\) were listed on Historic England’s \(HE\) ‘Heritage At Risk’ register in 2014: Maryport; \*Beckfoot; \*Rock of Gelt; Cam Beck; Birdoswald; \*Walltown Crags; \*Mucklebank turret; \*Steel Rigg; Cats Stairs; and \*Corbridge. 

 Our UAV \(drone\) and geophysics surveys, together with building fabric analyses, have provided high\-resolution mapping and structural analysis pertaining to both the study of the ancient use of the Wall and to contemporary management and conservation.  Methods were developed in conjunction with the County Archaeologists and Inspectors of Ancient Monuments responsible for the care of the WHS. For example, experimental work undertaken as part of the ‘Cultural Heritage Through Time’ \(CHT2\) project developed an approach which integrated geophysics and digital photogrammetry to monitor the impact of farming practices at Scheduled sites. According to Historic England our collaborative research focussed on Beckfoot, Birdoswald and Corbridge has ’…greatly increased understanding of the extent and complexity of these sites… feeding into discussions about their future management and revisions to their legal protection through scheduling’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 Our Structure\-from\-Motion photogrammetry survey of the Written Rock of Gelt preserved\-by\-record exceptionally important Roman graffiti that is naturally eroding; the site was removed from Historic England’s ‘Heritage At Risk’ register following successful conclusion of the project \( **IMP6**\). The results of the research reached diverse audiences through the mainstream press \(including all UK broadsheets, many EU papers and US outlets including CNN\), and popular media \(e.g. 59,000 likes on ‘Lad’s Bible’ website\). Complementing this, WallCAP has undertaken capital conservation of approximately 660m<sup>2</sup> of degrading or collapsed fabric of the Wall in 2020 at Walltown Crags, Mucklebank turret, Steel Rigg and the Cats Stairs, resulting in applications for 3 of the sites to be removed from the HE ‘Heritage At Risk’ register. 

 *3. Democratising Heritage Practice* 

 The development and delivery of specialised training designed specifically for members of the public has been at the heart of our strategy for research impact. Training activities are directly informed by our research and include participation in our projects. For example, at Maryport 70 members of the public were trained in archaeological excavation techniques between 2011\-15. We subsequently trained 3 of these participants to provide ongoing monitoring of coastal erosion at the nearby Roman cemetery of Beckfoot, where irregular weather and erosion events require year\-round ‘patrolling’ which can only be undertaken by local volunteers. The Chair of the Senhouse Museum Trust \(which has collection responsibility for Beckfoot\) notes that the University’s work ‘led to the recording of the Beckfoot material being put on a more regular and sustainable footing – to the great benefit of the archaeological resource’ \( **IMP3**\). 

 The WallCAP project organised events throughout 2019 and 2020 for members of the public, professional audiences and its 270 registered volunteers. 111 events were attended by 1,564 individuals \(not limited to registered volunteers\), with 73 events coordinated for volunteers resulting in 833 engagements \( **IMP7**\). For example, at Corbridge 71 volunteers participated in a training excavation in 2019 that built on the knowledge many had gained through the Hadrian’s Wall MOOC. The skills and knowledge which volunteers developed by participating in these research\-led events is summarised in the table below.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research of Professor Iain Torrance, Kt, KCVO, into the ethics of moral community formation has impacted upon military policy and funding in the UK and beyond. His work on the army as a moral community and on the covenant between the army and civilians has led to a re\-description of military communities in terms of ‘the military covenant’. During the assessment period, this research insight has significantly impacted Ministry of Defence policy and practice as well as the Armed forces, and derivatively thereby military personnel. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Ethical and theological engagements with the armed forces and military have usually taken the form of discussion of proportionate action and behaviour in the theatre of conflict: accounts of *ius in bello* historically have been framed in a Thomist or Augustinian way through the approach of a cost\-benefit account which leads to a key focus on proportionality. In Torrance’s article \(1.1\), ‘The Moral Component’ \(2000\), he shifts the discussion, and focuses instead on the idea of covenant. He argues that there needs to be a complete reframing of the discussion of just war arguments in terms of the *ius in bello* aspect of the discussion, and in terms of the obligations of a state to its armed forces. Torrance offers an account of *ius in bello* which discusses the ethics and moral formation of military personnel in relation to the broader nation. On his account, the key feature related to dealing with these matters is to rethink the armed forces as a moral community within the state with which the state covenants. Just engagements within war have to rest on soldiers having an internal ethical formation as part of the moral community through which they are formed. The soldier’s offer of service and sacrifice is the core way to think of the activity of the military and the root of the covenant to which the public responds in gratitude, covenanting with the military which itself covenants with society at large. Torrance refers to this idea as *‘the military covenant’*—and was in his research the first person to coin this phrase and conceptualisation, which has subsequently been used across the Ministry of Defence. For him, a covenant is a ‘binding agreement reached without conditions’: covenants are not based on conditions which most legal agreements are. Both parties are beholden to the covenant; but this is not by fulfilment of a legal contract or non\-breach of legal obligations, but rather through the keeping of promise and moral obligation. The fundamental difference between a contract and a covenant is the presence of a transcendent reference and commitment \(a higher good\)—in this instance, the commitment to serve to the degree of offering the sacrifice of one’s life, and the commitment to gratitude by the civilians for whom this is done. This direct utilisation of biblical and theological frameworks of covenant as a means of describing the mode of engagement with *ius in bello* theory and the relationship between army and civilian communities captured the imagination of Chaplain\-General Victor Dobbin. This became \(according to Dobbin and attested in the research of Ingham\) the basis for the current concept of the Military Covenant through its direct influence on Adjutant\-General Sir Michael Rose and, through him, the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence. As the first to employ the idea of a military covenant in this way \(with the need for the society at large to engage in gratitude to its service personnel who sacrifice so much for that society\), all subsequent uses of the concept of a military covenant owe their origins to Torrance’s research presented at an Oxford conference and published in this book chapter \(1.1\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since the publication of Torrance’s research in 2000, there has been continued significant impact arising from Torrance’s conceptualisation of the military covenant. This began immediately and has grown throughout this time to mature in the current REF census period. The pathway to impact between 2014 and 2020, as the work of Ingham \(1.2\) on the topic has confirmed, is that the original research insight around in the conceptualisation of a military covenant was brought to collective military attention directly by Torrance.  His research was directly drawn upon by Adjutant\-General Sir Michael Rose, and subsequently informed all engagement with the idea of the Military Covenant in British public policy. From 2000 onwards, Rose became increasingly interested in defining the fighting force and its moral component, and the relationship between this moral component and society at large. Rose was deeply impressed by Torrance’s contributions to the Oxford conference and the publication of his chapter on this topic \(1.1\), and he and Torrance gave speeches to NATO on the issue. Rose adopted Torrance’s concept, beginning to reshape the conceptualisation of the military and society at large in terms of Torrance’s phrase and ethical concept of a ‘military covenant’, both in terms of soldiering as a moral community and especially the idea of the covenantal relation between the armed forces and civilians. From there, Major\-General Sebastian Roberts then used the concept to inform his reflections on the relationship between the military and society at large, and the concept was heavily promoted by General Sir Richard Dannatt, Chief of the General Staff from 2006 to 2009. The concept coined by Torrance began to have governmental influence under Blair, with the then Prime Minister invoking the need for a ‘military covenant’ in 2007. However, fulfilling a manifesto pledge, it was with the coalition government and post 2015 Conservative governments that Torrance’s idea of a military covenant began to be applied in practice, leading to significant impact in the current REF period on government policy, practice and finance, as well as on third sector organisations, and through this on military personnel and veterans. While between 2000 and 2014,  there had already been significant impact on the military from Torrance’s research and publication, the adoption of his concept has informed government policy directly during this REF census period: Torrance’s original concept of the ‘military covenant’ has moved in its pathway to impact, therefore, from initially directly influencing senior military personnel to, in this census period, informing British public policy, and the ensuing effect of that policy on military personnel and veterans. As General Victor Dobbin has stated: ‘There is no doubt … that the covenant relationship that exists today between HM Government and the British Armed Forces, as well as that between the army and the soldier, stems from the seeds sown by…Torrance’. \(1\) 

 Most notably, as a result of Torrance’s research, a government sponsored national Armed Forces Covenant has been established, using directly Torrance’s conceptualisation of ‘covenant’ as a way of understanding the armed forces and its relation to the state. This has informed military policy and civilian commitment to the armed forces in the assessment period \(2 & 3\). A significant means of bringing impact about has arisen from notable stakeholders investing in the covenant more broadly in British society, aiding and supporting veterans in their transition to civilian life. Since 2015, through the Armed Forces Covenant, all kinds of bodies have signed up to the covenant in the UK as a way of helping veterans and those suffering PTSD, and as a means of understanding the military and their role in relation to society at large. Businesses, public bodies and charities are invited to sign the nation’s commitment to serving members of the armed forces and veterans. Organisations are asked to pledge that together they ‘acknowledge and understand that those who serve or who have served in the armed forces, and their families, should be treated with fairness and respect in the communities, economy and society they serve with their lives’. This reflects precisely the conceptualisation of the covenant relationship between armed forces and society at large, as advocated in Torrance’s research, embodying the covenant of service and gratitude in its self\-description. The covenant has been signed by a large range of governmental and non\-governmental civilian agencies. All 407 local authorities in mainland Great Britain and 4 Northern Ireland councils have pledged to uphold the Armed Forces Covenant, as well as 4,000 organisations, including businesses and charities. By signing the Armed Forces Covenant an organisation demonstrates its intention to support the Armed Forces community and provides the signatory with the opportunity to be recognised by the Employer Recognition Scheme award. The award shows that the recipient is delivering tangible support for the Armed Forces community. \(4\) 

 Since 2013, GBP80,000,000 has been allocated by the government to ensure the continued achievement of the government’s Armed Forces Covenant commitments, with a commitment of GBP10,000,000 per annum to be given to this end in perpetuity \(3\). This Covenant Fund is completely new and is not a replacement for any previous grant schemes or funds. Funding priorities are set annually by the Covenant Reference Group, but are focused around: non\-core healthcare services for veterans; removing barriers to family life; extra support, both in and after Service, for those that need help; measures to integrate military and civilian communities and allow the Armed Forces community to participate as citizens. The Secretary of State for Defence has been required annually during the current assessment period to lay a report before Parliament on the implementation of the covenant. Indeed, the Rt Hon Gavin Williamson MP, Secretary of State for Defence from 2017 to 2019, highlights that in the post Iraq and Afghanistan era UK Armed Forces are engaged in more operations than ever before and ‘the legacy of past conflicts continues to be felt by our people’, but—despite this level of operations—he states: ‘… *the work of the Armed Forces is less prominent in the minds of the public, which is why for me, the principles of the Covenant are more relevant today than they have ever been*.’ \(4\) It is these principles which have led to the continued financial and policy investment by the government in relation to the covenant. 

 Engagement with Torrance’s concept of the military covenant by government and users has increased significantly since these initial projects, and in 2017 the Veterans’ Gateway \( [http://www.veteransgateway.org.uk](http://www.veteransgateway.org.uk/)\) was launched to provide a single point of contact to help veterans access the work of the covenant to find sources of support or information for challenges that they are facing; the Gateway was established through a GBP2,000,000. Military Covenant Grant. In addition, in order specifically to allow the nation to fulfil its covenant obligation to service personnel from past conflicts, the Covenant Grant scheme launched The Aged Veterans Fund as a one\-off fund from the Treasury of GBP30,000,000 to support veterans born before 1950 in their particular needs. It funds non\-core health, wellbeing and social care needs for older veterans who may need some focused support in relation to their health and social care needs. 

 The term ‘military / armed forces covenant’ has also entered political discourse as a way of measuring whether the government and society at large have kept to their obligations to support members of the armed forces and whether armed forces are fulfilling the task they have as moral communities. Through this, Torrance’s findings have also impacted NHS provision, education policy, social and financial support, housing policy and provision and employment support for service personnel and veterans during the current assessment period \(5 & 6\).  Each year since 2012 the government publishes the *Armed Forces Covenant Annual Report* which details of activities associated with the covenant, and the extent to which the government’s commitment to the armed forces and their families has been fulfilled. Analysis of the extent of fulfilment of the covenant as well as commitments for following years are also given \(7\). In April 2018, the government enshrined and focused this commitment to the military covenant in establishing the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust. Through this trust, the government has been to work in an ever more focused way in fulfilling the strategic objectives identified in relation to Torrance’s concept of a military covenant, and has been able to track more fully the impact of  policy and financial commitment on armed forces personnel and veterans as well as the activities and objectives achieved each year in each area of focus for the government’s work with those involved in military service. Indicative items from the 2019 summary in *Armed Forces Covenant Annual Report 2019* \(below\) provide examples of the way in which the covenant is used to group together and measure the effect of governmental policies in just one year. This example is one which is replicated on this kind of scale in each year, detailing the ways in which there has been progress in fulfilling society’s covenantal commitment to service personnel and veterans. All of these actions and impacts are described in relation to, and considered to arise from and contribute to, the military / armed forces covenant—the concept of which was taken directly from Torrance’s research. The concerted and coherent engagement with these themes by the state in this manner has arisen as a means of addressing the covenantal responsibilities between the armed forces and society at large. It is a covenantal responsibility that what had previously been fractured activities had been considered cohesively under the covenant, using the notion of a covenant as a means to assess and measure the whole society’s responsibility to the armed forces, alongside the armed forces responsibilities to and sacrifices for society. 

 1. In relation to the healthcare focus of the covenant: a\) 4,561 referrals were received for the Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service \(TILS\) and the Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service \(CTS\), which provide specialist NHS care pathways just for veterans; b\) an additional GBP10,000,000 was provided as part of the NHS Long Term Plan to invest in these services to increase geographic coverage and service provision; c\) an additional 285 GP practices in England were accredited as ‘veteran friendly’, increasing the total accreditations to 375; d\) NHS England and NHS Improvement, together with the MOD, launched the *Armed Forces personnel in transition, Integrated Personal Commissioning for Veterans Framework* in March 2019; e\) in the Autumn Budget, a further GBP10,000,000 was announced to be distributed by the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust to support veterans’ mental health and wellbeing needs; f\) the MOD joined the cross\-government National Suicide Prevention Strategy Delivery Group to share best practice and ensure a joined\- up and co\-ordinated response towards deliberate self\-harm and suicide prevention; g\) the Scottish Government provided funding of GBP1.4,000,000 per year to Combat Stress for specialist mental health services; and h\) the Veterans Trauma Network expanded into Wales to further increase provision for veterans with Service attributable physical health conditions. 

 2. In relation to the education focus: a\) service children were formally identified as an underrepresented group in Higher Education by the Office for Students; b\) the Service Children’s Progression Alliance established its UK\-wide network, with a further six research\-practice hubs launched; c\) the Service Child Flag Indicator in England was included on all three termly school censuses to help better identify and track service children moves; d\) over GBP23,100,000 of Service Pupil Premium was distributed to over 10,000 schools across England to benefit over 77,000 Service children; e\) the Welsh Government provided an extra GBP250,000 for the Supporting Service Children Wales Fund; f\) the Welsh Government contributed a total of GBP200,442 in the financial year towards the Armed Forces Bereavement Scholarship and the Publicly Funded Further Education/Higher Education schemes. 

 3. In terms of housing and accommodation: a\) GBP1,160,000 was invested in improving and modernising Service Family Accommodation \(a 40% increase on the previous year\) with a further GBP123,000,000 committed for the following financial year; b\) as at 30 September 2019, the Forces Help to Buy scheme helped around 19,400 Service personnel purchase their own property at a total cost of GBP293,000,000 \(an average of GBP15,000 per claim\); c\) following a change in policy in April 2019 to permit cohabitation, 250 service personnel in long\-term relationships or with residential responsibility for a child have been housed, and a further 109 are waiting to move in; d\) the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government launched a consultation on new statutory guidance for local authorities designed to improve how members of the Armed Forces community are allocated social housing and also allocated an additional GBP1,000,000 of bespoke funding to support vulnerable veterans who are or are at risk of becoming homeless. 

 4. In terms of the focus on family life: a\) Flexible Service became law, allowing regular service personnel to ask to temporarily work part\-time and/or restrict their separation from their home base, subject to operational need; b\) The Covenant Fund Trust’s Removing Barriers to Family Life grants programme was created to support the 2018–20 Families Action Plan; c\) the Forces Families Jobs website was launched by the Families Federations; d\) the DWP, MOD and HMRC refreshed their advice on how eligible spouses and civil partners who accompanied their Service partner on postings outside the UK can apply for National Insurance credit. 

 5. With regard to transition and life\-long support of veterans: a\) *The Strategy for our Veterans* was jointly published by the UK Governments and each home nation subsequently conducted its own consultation to inform how they will implement the strategy; b\) the Veterans’ ReGroup pathfinder service for veterans in the Criminal Justice System was launched in the Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire areas; c\) HM Revenue and Customs launched an internship programme for Service personnel in transition; d\) Skills Development Scotland established a network of veterans champions across its five regional areas to support Service leavers and veterans along their employment pathway; e\) the Welsh Government provided GBP500,000 to continue funding for Armed Forces Liaison Officers from 2019 to 2021 \(8\). 

 Indeed, the impact of Torrance’s concept of a military covenant culminated with the announcement on 29 July 2019 by the Prime Minister of a new Office for Veterans’ Affairs ‘to provide lifelong support to military personnel’ in order for society to fulfil its covenant to its military personnel as they return to civilian life. This Office is to work with government departments to coordinate and drive government policy on veterans’ welfare, spanning mental and physical health, education, and employment. The Office has arisen from the work of the Covenant Reference Group and will work in full coordination with it. Furthermore, the covenant continues to be used to measure broader governmental and societal support of the military and the success of such ventures, and a further GBP5,000,000 boost has been given to support the implementation of the covenant with veterans. \(9\) 

 Torrance’s work has not only informed but directly led, therefore, to policy in the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces Covenant as an NGO with policy, social and economic impact, as well as direct impact on military personnel and veterans. Indeed, this work for the Armed Forces was mentioned in the citation for the Knight Bachelor he was given in the New Year Honours 2018. General Sir Sebastian Roberts, KCVO, has stated: ‘No prime minister, no party, no commentator has or can dispute that the very term “ *The Military Covenant” has become the guarantee of proper treatment, universally respected and supported. Every service, every service charity and ultimately every member of the armed forces would attest to its power. They –we—owe Professor Torrance and his Department at Aberdeen an immeasurable debt*.’ \(10\)

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 The social and cultural importance of human\-animal relationships is often overlooked despite the reliance on animals as food, companions, workers, symbols, experimental subjects and their use in entertainment and media. Professor Claire Parkinson’s research on media, culture, communications and multispecies relationships has led to impact in three key areas: i\) informing business, charity, and advocacy groups’ digital content, public communication and campaign strategies ii\) informing government policy iii\) raising public awareness of issues related to food and companion animals and animals used in entertainment. The research has led to major promotional and advertising campaigns related to veganism, environmental and animal advocacy, influenced the long\-term strategy of The Vegan Society and informed the public and policy debate on dangerous dogs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Claire Parkinson \(previously Molloy\) was employed at EHU as a Senior Lecturer from 1999 until 2007 and since 2012 when she was appointed as Professor of Film, Television and Digital Media. Since 2001, her work has been significant in bringing together approaches from media, communications and cultural studies and critical animal studies \(CAS\). 

 Parkinson’s work on anthropomorphism and animals, first published in 2001, has sought to reorient academic debate on the topic. She returned to the topic in 2016 to develop a new critical framework that understands anthropomorphism as contextual, differentiated, and situational. Through this later work Parkinson has called for a more nuanced and pragmatic understanding of anthropomorphism at a time of environmental crisis \[1\]. The work was presented internationally at keynote addresses in Australia \(ISAZ 2018\), Spain \(EACAS, 2019\), Germany \(ISSISR, 2019\) and various invited talks in the UK. Parkinson contends that the mediation of another animal’s experience is always anthropomorphic and can lead to problematic misunderstandings but proposes that anthropomorphism can also be usefully deployed to develop empathetic connections that bridge the distance between Western consumers and other species \[1, 4\]. This argument is fully expanded in her latest monograph, *Anthropomorphism, Animals and Mediated Encounters,* that draws on political economy analysis and ecofeminist approaches to propose a reconceptualization of anthropomorphism which, she argues, intervenes in the practices that govern the material lives of other species \[1\]. Her work in this and other publications has analysed the public reception of messages about animals and the environment to provide key insights into the mobilisation of affective, ethical, and activist engagements \[1, 2, 4, 5\]. 

 Parkinson’s work since 2012 has revealed how media shape public understanding of animal agriculture, animal welfare, ethics and food practices \[1, 4\]. Her work on anthropomorphism and the public reception of media messages about food animals informed the development and methodology of an 18\-month mixed methods research project commissioned and funded by The Vegan Society \[2\]. The ‘Pathways to Veganism’ project was undertaken by a team from the Centre for Human Animal Studies and led by Parkinson \(PI\). The research examined the public reception of health, environmental and animal ethics messages associated with veganism and the cultural meanings attached to meat, dairy and other animal products. From 35 key findings, the research made eight recommendations to aid the communication of vegan messages to non\-vegan audiences and a further follow\-on report detailed the findings of the research where it examined responses to vegan messages about animal ethics in mainstream and social media. Amongst these, the research found that non\-vegans were more receptive to vegan messages about health and environmentalism than animal ethics, and that family dynamics play a major role in sustaining a vegan lifestyle. The research also produced important insights about reception in relation to age and gender and the credible communication of pro\-vegan messages. The follow\-on report on the reception of animal ethics messages made thirteen recommendations, identified a hierarchy of animal imagery, found that participants commonly anthropomorphised parent\-child animal images and identified with narratives that featured parent/child dynamics, and that they actively disengage from distressing animal imagery and pro\-vegan narratives designed to elicit guilt. 

 For the last twelve years, Parkinson’s research has examined the use of animals in entertainment. She produced the first sustained academic work on animal stars which has been more recently extended to argue that forms of animal stardom influence trends in pet keeping that have impacts on animal welfare and biodiversity \[3\]. Parkinson’s research on food and companion animals has provided important insights into how human\-relationships function to reinforce stereotypes and problematic constructions of human social identity \[1, 6\]; how film and other media portrayals shape practices and public debates on companion and wild animals; and the impacts of pet keeping practices on human and animal welfare and wellbeing \[1, 3\]. Parkinson has been involved in research on dangerous dogs since 2004 when she completed the first study on media coverage of dog attacks and dog fighting in the 1980s and 1990s. This research was presented as conference papers in 2006, written up as book chapters in 2007 and subsequently published in two edited collections in 2011 where Parkinson argues that press reporting directly impacted legislation \(Dangerous Dogs Act 1991\) and reinforced marginalised social identities \[7\]. This resulted in the demonization of human social groups and dog types but has not been effective in reducing dog bites. She has argued that ‘stock images’ of ‘dangerous dogs’ used by media and government organisations and ambiguity over the definition of the pit bull terrier ‘type’ have reinforced public misunderstanding of dog bite risk. Parkinson returned to this research to give an invited talk at University of Manchester in 2013 on a history of press representations of dangerous dogs from 1970\- 1991. In a publication the same year \[6\] she examined how pit bull ‘fighting dogs’ are represented in reality television.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

1.  Informing business, charity, and advocacy groups’ digital content, public communication and campaign strategies about sustainable choices and veganism 

 The ‘Pathways to Veganism’ project offered a series of recommendations for advocacy groups, health professionals and campaigners. Veganism has grown considerably in the UK since 2014; however, it was unclear which methods of vegan outreach are successful \[Dii\]. The ‘Pathways’ research was designed to directly address the need for greater clarity around effective vegan messaging. This research was of particular interest to The Vegan Society, whose core work involves campaigns, education, advocacy, outreach, trademarking, and work with policy makers \(Di\). The Vegan Society Research Officer confirms that the ‘Pathways’ research findings have “ *informed The Vegan Society policy, future organisational strategy and research, as well as individual team plans”* \[G\]. The research was key to the development of campaigns in 2019 and 2020. In a letter, The Vegan Society Chief Executive explains: “ *The findings from the research have directly informed much of our campaign work including our Vegan & Thriving and Future Normal campaigns. As a result of the research we have a much improved understanding of perceptions towards veganism, and have been able to develop specific messaging to reach specific audiences*” \[F\]. The 2019 ‘Vegan and Thriving’ campaign, developed as part of the 75<sup>th</sup> celebration of the founding of The Vegan Society was a result of the research recommendations that The Vegan Society should focus on plant\-based nutrition, develop easily adaptable meal plans, work with health professionals, and consider family dynamics, to better communicate with the public about veganism \(Diii\). The campaign referenced the research findings \(Div\) and addressed research recommendations by: updating and expanding vegan recipes; working with health professionals to communicate pro\-vegan messages; and using examples of vegan sportspeople. ITN created a news package with The Vegan Society that featured messages identified by the research to be important to the positive public communication of veganism to non\-vegan audiences \[G\]. The Vegan Society CEO states: “ *The Vegan & Thriving campaign achieved our objective of targeting an older audience with positive messages about the nutritional quality of a vegan diet. Our campaign video received 10k views, and the website received 13.5k unique visitors during the 6 weeks of live activity. Our qualitative feedback shows this information was well received and perceptions towards veganism were positively influenced*” \[F\]. 

 Due to the research on the reception of pro\-vegan animal ethics messages, The Vegan Society invested in the national Future Normal campaign, launched in 2020. The Vegan Society Research Officer confirms that  the content for the Future Normal campaign “ *was developed from the research findings of the Pathways project which provided key insights into how non\-vegans respond to images of different animals \[…\]* *how audiences perceive ‘emotional manipulation’ \[…\], their feelings about vegan celebrities, the types of narratives that non\-vegan audiences identify with or reject, the contexts in which anthropomorphism functions positively, and the importance of family dynamics and parent child imagery in conveying animal ethics messages*” \[G\]. Parkinson and Twine also provided short think pieces for the campaign. The Vegan Society CEO confirms that “ *The Future Normal campaign achieved our objective of reaching those who considered themselves to be animal lovers but are not yet vegan with messages of empathy and compassion. Our campaign film had almost 2 million views, and the website received 78k unique visitors during the 2 months of live activity*” \[F\]. 

 The findings from the Pathways to Veganism project were also used to create a toolkit for advocacy groups and campaigners. The toolkit focuses specifically on recommendations for pro\-vegan and plant\-based stories and messaging. By October 2020, the toolkit had been directly requested by 24 vegan and animal advocacy organisations. The Executive Director of Animal Equality UK states that “ *The comprehensive ‘Vegan Pathways Toolkit’ includes many useful insights that are especially relevant to Animal Equality’s existing and upcoming projects*” \[J\]. As a result of the toolkit and, following a meeting with Parkinson, Animal Equality have made amendments to campaigns.  These changes include adjustments to the ‘LoveVeg’ initiative: “ *As per the toolkit provided by Edge Hill researchers, the new and improved version will provide relatable examples of challenges that consumers may face when transitioning to plant\-based and offer solutions. It will also receive endorsement from scientists and sportspeople*” \[J\]. Other changes focus on anthropomorphism in advocacy messaging “ *particularly regarding chickens and aquatic animals, who are killed in the largest numbers, yet are typically harder to evoke public sympathy for*” \[J\]. Based on insights from Parkinson’s work on anthropomorphism Animal Equality UK made changes to a campaign to change legislation to better protect aquatic animals at the time of killing \[J\]. In a letter, the Executive Director states about the toolkit: “ *These are just some of the changes that we have made in a matter of months and I expect we will make many more thanks to the insights that we received through this report*” \[J\]. 

 Since 2015, Parkinson has advised Planet Shine Limited, a media organisation which specialises in work with high profile ethical brands. Parkinson attended a series of meetings with key personnel from the company to provide summaries and presentations of her research on anthropomorphism, mobilising engagement with animal and environmental messages and the finding of the ‘Pathways’ research. The CEO of Planet Shine has stated that \[H\] “ *The research to which we have had access has been invaluable in that it provides both academic and scientific substance to our creative process which helps to engage our client base, growing our business and increasing revenue, and which ultimately means that our campaigns and film projects perform well*” \[H\]. Parkinson’s research was used by the company in the development of a series of films for Quorn Foods which had a global PR reach of 630 million people. Findings from the interim report of the Pathways to Veganism project that demonstrated the requirement for pro\-vegan messages to communicate the ease of finding vegan food and recipes to address the perception of inconvenience were used to inform the development of a Hippeas x Veganuary film project \[H\]\). The Pathways research findings also informed a feature length film pitch for Quorn foods, and a series of short films for The Vegan Society \[H\]. The Hippeas x Veganuary film project achieved 35,000 views. Parkinson’s research on mobilising audience engagement also informed a film project for the Silentnight Eco Mattress range which achieved 22,000 views. Parkinson’s research has also been the impetus behind the company’s recent rebranding. The CEO states that the rebrand is “ *a direct result of Professor Parkinson’s guidance and advice*”; a result of which is that the company is now “ *targeted to reach 1 million monthly visitors by the end of this year*” \[H\]. 

1.  Informing government policy on ‘dangerous dogs’. 

 In 2018, Parkinson submitted written evidence to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee Dangerous Dogs: Breed Specific Legislation inquiry. Underpinned by her research on dangerous dogs Parkinson’s evidence detailed why the legislation was problematic from its inception, why and how it had failed to protect the public from dog bites and dog bite fatalities \[A\]. Parkinson’s submission was cited in the committee’s final report as evidence that “ *Since the Act was introduced, injury and fatality rates from dog attacks have increased*” which brought into question “ *the adequacy of the Government’s approach to tackling dangerous dogs*” \(B p.5\). Several of the recommendations made by Parkinson in her evidence were included in the final committee report conclusions and recommendations. These included recommending a reconsideration of Section 1 of the Act, specifically in relation to euthanizing a dog due to how they ‘look’ \[B p.30\], to allow rehoming centres to rehome section 1 dogs \[B p.31\], education of children and dog owners, and coordinated communications \[B p.31\]. The committee report led directly to a Government commissioned independent review of the effectiveness of DDA1991 and dog control legislation \(C\). The government agreed to action the recommendations on the education of children, dog owners and coordinated communications \[C recommendations 5 and 6\]. 

1.  Raising public awareness of issues relating to food and companion animals and animals used in exhibition and entertainment. 

 In 2011, Parkinson was invited to be an advisor to the Animal History Museum, Los Angeles. Informed by her research on dangerous dogs and ineffective legislation, Parkinson worked with the Museum to create an online public collection of photos and essays that challenged media representations of pit bulls and their humans. This began as a social media competition and eventually became an online public gallery in 2014. The Executive Director of the museum explains that “ *Professor Parkinson has published research on the failures of breed specific legislation \(BSL\) and the representation of pit bull terriers in the media.* *The issue of pit bull terrier representations was one of the key topics that the Animal History Museum explored. The museum ran a social media competition which asked pit bull owners to send in pictures and stories about their families and dogs. The aim of the competition was to change the way in which the public perceives pit bull terriers and break the stereotype. The competition had over a hundred entries and received more than one thousand comments on Facebook*.” Based on her extensive research on animals in film, Parkinson advised the Animal History Museum on exhibits related to film, media and animals which included working with the curator of the ‘Dearest Creature’ exhibition in 2015. The founder and Executive Director of the museum states: *“we benefitted greatly from her expertise*” and notes “ *particularly her work on the use of live animals in film and the treatment and ethics of animal use, and the history of wildlife filmmaking and natural history documentaries. Claire was the ultimate scholar \[…\] her scholarship was accessible to our very wide audience*”. 

 Based on her research on media and animal agriculture Parkinson gave talks at Green Party Conferences in 2013 and 2014 on how food marketing sustains problematic narratives about animal agriculture, the practices of which are damaging to human and animal health and wellbeing and to the environment \(via carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, water and land usage\). These talks were invited and given on behalf of The Vegan Society. The Vegan Society Research Officer confirms “ *Both talks were very well received, and the proposals put forward enabled The Vegan Society to strengthen relationships with Green Party representatives*” \[see letter J\]. In 2018, Parkinson was interviewed about her research on Dangerous Dogs legislation for Knowing Animals, a premier animal studies podcast with an international audience \[I\]. This podcast widened considerably the international public audience for Parkinson’s research on dangerous dogs.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young \(MODY\), is a form of diabetes caused by mutation in a single gene that requires an expensive genetic diagnosis. It is difficult to recognise, so the majority of MODY patients are misdiagnosed as the more common Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.  Misdiagnosis matters because MODY has specific treatment requirements and importantly these patients do not need insulin injections. The Exeter ‘MODY calculator’ helps clinicians select patients who should have diagnostic genetic testing by giving a probability of MODY based on clinical features. It has been **used to improve diagnosis over 170,000 times in 187countries** and is **recommended in national and 3 international guidelines**. In the UK alone, 74% of clinicians referring for genetic testing report using the calculator. By increasing the number of patients with a correct MODY diagnosis the calculator leads to **better treatment and clinical care, improving outcomes for patients and saving money for the NHS**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 People with diabetes need to know which subtype of the disease they have in order to receive the best treatment. Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young \(MODY\) is distinct from the commoner Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes as it is caused by a mutation in a single gene \(ie. monogenic\). MODY accounts for 3.6% of young\-onset diabetes **\[3.1\]**, amounting to more than 25,000 individuals in the UK alone. Exeter pioneered research into MODY, working in this field for over 20 years, and has led much of the work into the diagnosis, treatment, and management of this disease. A diagnosis of MODY is only confirmed by a genetic test, but this testing is expensive \(about £650 per patient\) so its use is limited. Therefore, approaches to help target testing at those most likely to have MODY have been needed. 

 **2.1.  Identifying patients with MODY is challenging** 

 The vast majority of patients with MODY are misdiagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, with over 80% of cases estimated to be undiagnosed in the UK in 2010 **\[3.2\]**. Clinicians have limited experience of MODY as it is far less common than Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and was only recently recognised \(first genetic cause reported in 1992, NHS diagnostic testing did not commence until 2000\). It can be difficult to distinguish from other forms of diabetes as many of the features overlap. Traditionally, MODY was defined by age at diagnosis below 25, strong family history of diabetes, and evidence of non\-insulin dependence, but these criteria miss over half of MODY cases **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.2. Developing a calculator to determine the likelihood of MODY** 

 To improve the detection of MODY in clinical practice Dr Beverley Shields led the development and validation of a probability algorithm for MODY, which incorporates clinical features such as a patient’s sex, body mass index, glucose control \(HbA1c\), and age at diagnosis, in order to calculate the likelihood of them having MODY **\[3.3\]**. Combining information from multiple clinical features was highly effective in discriminating MODY from other forms of diabetes. The model was translated into an online calculator and app that enables users to input routinely available clinical characteristics and obtain an immediate probability score. This helps clinicians decide whether to send for molecular genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. 

  

 **2.3. A diagnosis of MODY influences treatment** 

 Exeter researchers have demonstrated that patients with MODY do not require insulin injections and can successfully stop them **\[3.4\]**. Specific treatments are indicated depending on which MODY gene is found to be the cause. In individuals with MODY caused by mutations in the *HNF1A* gene, patients can be successfully treated with sulphonylurea tablets **\[3.4\]**.  In a second subtype, caused by mutations in the *GCK* gene, patients can discontinue pharmacological treatment without any deterioration in control of blood sugar **\[3.5\]**.  In addition, patients with *GCK* MODY who are not treated for 50 years have no greater risk of microvascular or macrovascular complications than people without diabetes, confirming that pharmacological treatment is unnecessary **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1 MODY probability calculator has improved diagnosis of MODY** 

 The impact on improving diagnosis is seen in the referrals for UK genetic testing for MODY. The MODY calculator is very widely used by UK healthcare professionals with 74% of UK referrals since August 2014 stating that they have used the calculator **\[5.1\].** The referrals that have used the calculator are more likely to receive a positive diagnosis of MODY than those who do not use it \(32% v 24%, p=0.001\) **\[5.1\].** The number of cases of MODY diagnosed in the UK has increased threefold since the online calculator/app has been made available to clinicians and 3860 individuals have now received a genetic diagnosis. 

-  **MODY probability calculator is widely used in clinical practice worldwide** 

 The value of the MODY calculator to clinical decision making is best demonstrated by its widespread use worldwide.  Exeter’s online MODY calculator can be accessed for free on computers and mobile devices via the Exeter Diabetes Research website \( [www.diabetesgenes.org/exeter\-diabetes\-app](http://www.diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app)\) **\[5.2\]**. Since February 2015, the website calculator has had been used over 170,000 times, with 65% of users of the calculator being from outside the UK **\[5.3\]**. The MODY probability calculator has been accessed by people from 187 countries across 6 continents **\[5.3\].** 

-  **Mobile phone App incorporating the MODY probability calculator is extensively used.** 

 An App developed for use on mobile phones to help clinicians get rapid access to the MODY probability calculator in clinic has been extensively used. The calculator is available as part of the Diabetes Diagnostics App on both iOS and Android platforms and has been downloaded over 14,000 times in over 70 countries worldwide. **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **MODY probability calculator is a CE marked device** 

 The calculator constitutes a medical device and has a CE marking that demonstrates its compliance with strict regulations. CE marking involved a rigorous process of clinical evaluation, thorough software testing, user testing, and risk mitigation and thus provides reassurance of quality to healthcare providers **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.2. Recommended in national and international guidelines** 

 The MODY calculator is widely recommended for clinical use in national and international guidelines to ensure the correct diagnosis is made for young people with diabetes. The calculator is promoted in four independent guidelines: the 2019 World Health Organisation guidelines for the Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, the 2020 Association for British Clinical Diabetologists \(ABCD\) Standard of Care guidelines, the 2020 American Diabetes Association’s position statement on paediatric diabetes, and the 2018 International Society of Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes \(ISPAD\) Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines **\[5.5\]**. 

 The 2020 NHS UK National Genomic testing criteria for monogenic diabetes use the MODY calculator to identify which patients with diabetes should have NHS diagnostic genetic tests as an appropriate and accurate approach to identify patients most likely to have monogenic diabetes **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.3. Outcome for patients with MODY has improved, as a result of correct diagnoses** 

  

 The significance of the MODY calculator is that it helps patients get the correct diagnosis, and this means patients get the right treatment plus other important clinical benefits: 

-  **Improved treatment** – The clearest improvement in treatment is to be able to stop insulin and maintain excellent glucose control in the commonest subtypes of MODY.  Patients with *HNF1A\-*MODY or *HNF4A*\-MODY are very sensitive to sulphonylurea tablets and those diagnosed with the *GCK* subtype of MODY require no pharmacological treatment. In a prospective observational UK wide study carried out by the Exeter team, 78% of MODY patients on insulin successfully stopped their insulin treatment with no deterioration in blood sugar control **\[5.7\]**. 

-  **Improved clinical care** –Patients diagnosed with *GCK\-*MODY are at no greater risk of microvascular or macrovascular complications than the non\-diabetic population, even 50 years after diagnosis and consequently they do not need any clinical follow\-up **\[5.8\]**. 

-  **Family member follow\-up** – As MODY is a genetic disease and runs in families, a diagnosis of one individual can help determine the cause of diabetes in other family members. A recent audit **\[5.1\]** identified that a median of 3 further family members are referred for genetic testing following each diagnosis of a MODY index case. Eighty six percent of these family members subsequently receive a genetic diagnosis for their own diabetes and are able to modify their treatment. 

  

 **4.4. Cost savings to the NHS** 

  

 The MODY calculator is saving money for the NHS by reducing the numbers of expensive inappropriate genetic tests and by helping patients get better cheaper care once a diagnosis of MODY is made. 

 Using the MODY calculator, which is free and easily accessible, allows a rapid assessment by a non\-expert healthcare provider to assess if testing or referral to secondary care is appropriate.  In the UK with the assistance of the MODY calculator the positive diagnostic rate for NHS testing is 32% almost 10x higher than the 3.6% that would be seen with non\-selective testing. By targeting testing at only those at the highest probability of MODY, fewer expensive genetic tests are negative, increasing value for money. The ability of the MODY calculator to do this is why it is now incorporated into the NHS UK National Genomic testing criteria for monogenic diabetes **\[5.5\]**. 

 Targeted MODY testing using the calculator helps increase the diagnosis of monogenic diabetes which saves the NHS money by reducing the cost of treating and monitoring raised blood glucose levels and avoiding the additional expense associated with treating diabetes complications. A health economic model published in 2015 from the Exeter team, showed that a targeted testing approach based on using the MODY calculator in all patients diagnosed with diabetes under 30, could save the NHS £20\-40 million due to the substantial savings from change in treatment over the lifetime of patients **\[5.8\]**. Correctly diagnosing *HNF1A* MODY in a patient previously thought to have Type 1 diabetes can result in considerable direct cost savings ranging from £400\-£2300 \(mean £660\) per year, because they can be treated with tablets in place of insulin therapy. Diagnosing *GCK\-*MODY results in substantial savings as treatment, monitoring and healthcare appointments are not needed for the remainder of a patient’s life.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This research empowered communities in the poorest parts of the world to engage actively with Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\) that provide lifesaving aid. It demonstrated that local languages are crucial for NGOs to build strong relationships with communities and ensure successful delivery of development projects. Yet, remarkably, NGOs and government donors have historically regarded translation and interpretation as a low priority. NGOs serving hundreds of thousands of people in Malawi and Peru adopted the recommendations, which has led to improved community engagement with NGO projects and more positive practical outcomes for such work. The research has been promoted as a vital contribution to UK government aid policy through Parliament and the UK’s national academies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Dr Crack specialises in the study of NGOs in international development work. She particularly focuses on NGO accountability, which is commonly recognised to include the responsibility of NGOs to be accountable to communities that receive their aid. Crack has built a research profile over the last decade through publications that draw on numerous in\-depth interviews with key practitioner informants to analyse the challenges for NGOs in meeting their accountability commitments. 

 Development NGO policies tend to claim that they seek to be accountable by: a\) ensuring that development projects are designed according to the preferences of communities; b\) empowering communities to participate in decisions about project delivery to promote a sense of ownership; and c\) inviting communities to provide feedback about projects. 

 Crack’s research has consistently identified systematic failures in practice in meeting these goals \(R1\-R3\), with failures in language\-based understanding at the core of many problems. While language is essential to communicative processes, the actual language policies and practices of NGOs have scarcely been studied, despite the fact that NGOs operate in territories of high linguistic and cultural diversity. The present research is the first to have explored how such policies and their consequences affect the capacity of NGOs to be accountable to communities. 

 To undertake this study, Crack co\-designed a three\-year AHRC\-funded research project \(G1\) with Professor Hilary Footitt \(Reading, PI\), Dr Wine Tesseur \(Research Assistant\) and the NGO INTRAC. The project involved extensive archival research and dozens of interviews with NGO workers, donor officials and translators/interpreters in the UK, Malawi, Kyrgyzstan and Peru. 

 The project found that NGO senior management often regard translation/interpretation as a marginal issue, and that the same is true for the UK’s Department for International Development \(DFID\), which is one of the largest donors to NGOs \(R4\). This failure to recognise the importance of language in development work leads to serious and significant consequences. 

 The research demonstrated a consistent view amongst NGO fieldworkers based in developing countries that effective local language communication is vital in establishing relationships of trust and respect with communities. Fieldworkers report frustration with the lack of clear guidance from donors and NGO management about how to translate development concepts, leaving them to invent ad hoc solutions that may not convey the NGO message effectively. The concern that translation difficulties marginalise the very people that are supposed to benefit from NGO work is widespread amongst such frontline staff, as is the perception and experience that this can lead to project failure. 

 In deriving policy\-oriented conclusions from this empirical study, the research team argued that NGOs cannot be accountable to communities unless they address these issues \(R5\). They produced a report written for policy\-makers and practitioners \( *Respecting Communities*\), which included several evidence\-based recommendations \(R6\). 

 Recommendations for donors included: 

1.  Invite NGOs to include translation/interpretation costs in their budget. 

1.  Ask organisations to state their language and cultural policies in their applications and value NGOs that have these policies. 

1.  Ensure that monitoring and evaluation frameworks encourage NGOs to reflect on how language issues affect project outcomes. 

 Recommendations for NGOs included: 

1.  Include costs for translation/interpretation in the budget. 

1.  Translate materials into local languages so communities can participate in projects in an informed way. 

1.  Encourage staff to acquire additional language skills. 

1.  Incorporate language considerations in project design.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 NGOs in Malawi, Peru and beyond, serving hundreds of thousands of people, adopted the project’s recommendations. The results are improved quality of data, increased levels of community understanding, and a greater sense of local empowerment. The project’s recommendations are included in high\-profile parliamentary and scholarly reports on language strategy targeted at the UK government. Government and DFID representatives have met with the research team to identify how the recommendations can reshape policy. 

 **Impact of NGO recommendations** 

 Crack worked directly with NGOs through the research process and after the development of the findings, sharing conclusions in accessible forms and advising on the development of the project recommendations into concrete changes in policy and practice. Following the publication of the final project report \(R6\) she revisited her Malawian research participants in person to provide organisation\-specific advice on implementation. Crack continues to develop these relationships with a view to continuing downstream impact, and has recently begun a formal consultancy role with Tearfund, one of the UK’s leading development and relief NGOs, advising on the creation of a new translation policy. While this will deliver future benefits, a range of concrete impacts have already been achieved: 

 *Recommendations D&E: Funding language costs and translating materials* 

 Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and highly dependent on foreign aid. NGOs play an essential role in delivering basic services. One of the organisations that Crack worked with is the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, which recently received over USD500,000 for human rights projects in Malawi. The NGO shared the *Respecting Communities* report with its donors, who responded by allocating funding for language costs. The NGO then translated its materials, and reported a remarkable improvement in community empowerment as a result: *‘Beneficiaries are able to grasp the concepts, knowledge and develop the skills required for development at grassroots level…For instance, the people in Chitipa District specifically in Nthalire requested for Standard Operating Procedures for Proactive Disclosure of Information in Public Health Services to be translated into their local language.’* \(S1\) \(August 2019\). The participant states that the research has led to an enhanced sense of confidence and ownership among communities over the development process, as well as a change of mind\-set among staff working for the NGO as they *‘are keen to learn the languages spoken and understand the culture of the people’*. 

 Another organisation that worked with Crack is Trocaire, an international NGO that serves 181,000 Malawians. Crack’s main interlocutor, \[text removed for publication\], was able to draw on the findings of the research in order to negotiate internally for funding to translate a training manual: *‘Our volunteers have expressed that the translated manuals are very useful and are contributing to better programme results because they are able to facilitate gender equality discussions in an informed way … which has strengthened the case of allocating funding for translation of materials for programming in our organisation’* \(S2\). The organisation, which spans 17 countries, is now translating material into local languages in the other territories in which they work, referring to Malawi as an example of international best practice \(August 2019\). 

 *Recommendation F: Language acquisition* 

 Kusi Warma is a Peruvian NGO delivering health and education projects to over 12,000 children. Because of this research, they introduced a language policy to their operations \(S3\) \(June 2018\). Notably, as part of this, they paid for their fieldworkers to study Quechua. Kusi Warma now reports: *‘Our direct work in the communities, continually and respectfully of their local culture, speaking their language \(quechua\-speakers at the Andes\), establishes trust bonds with families, that contributes to the improvement of practices for the good growth and development of children’*. \(S4\). 

 *Recommendation G: Incorporating language in project design* 

 Crack worked with the Malawi Sexual and Reproductive Rights Alliance that includes six nationwide NGOs. Because of the research, they have translated advocacy messages, focus group discussion guides and questionnaires into Chichewa. This has *‘helped us to start getting data that makes a lot of sense and meaning from our project beneficiaries…The research has also helped us to reach our advocacy targeted audience’* because the translations have significantly enhanced local understanding of the NGO’s messages \(S5\) \(August 2019\). They now plan to translate these materials in the minority languages of Sena and Yao. 

 **Impact of donor recommendations** 

 In 2015, the UK enshrined in law the commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on development aid. A significant amount of aid is channelled through NGOs. The research fed into a long\-running and high\-profile political debate on aid effectiveness, and in particular, the ability of NGOs to deliver inclusive development. 

 In May 2018, Crack and Footitt presented their research findings to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Modern Languages, at the invitation of its co\-chair, Baroness Coussins. The donor recommendations emerging from the research were incorporated into the ‘Government’ pillar of the APPG’s National Recovery Programme for Languages published in March 2019. This document, officially endorsed by the British Council and the British Chambers of Commerce, called upon *‘Government, civil society and all stakeholders to act now to reverse this national crisis \[in the UK’s languages capability\]’*. \(S6\) 

 The APPG pressed for a governmental response on our report by tabling a written question in Parliament \(S7\). As a result, the research team met with the Minister for International Development, Lord Bates, to identify how our recommendations could inform policy review \(December 2018\). \[Text removed for publication\] confirmed the following month that he had *‘shared this \[Respecting Communities report\] with colleagues who are updating our guidance on programme design’* \(S8\) \(January 2019\). The reach and significance of the research findings were also demonstrated in a joint report by the UK National Academies \(British Academy, Academy of Medical Sciences, Royal Academy of Engineering, and Royal Society\). This urged the government to adopt a national strategy for languages, citing the *Respecting Communities* report as evidence that this strategy could strengthen the UK’s work in international development \(S9\). DFID’s own staff publication, *The Programme Pulse,* also highlighted the contents of the report. \(S10\)

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Through the advancement and application of Computable General Equilibrium \(CGE\) modelling, Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute \(FAI\) has strengthened regional policy\-making by enhancing analytical capacity and knowledge within Scotland \(Scottish Government, City of Glasgow Council, Scottish Policy Foundation\), Northern Ireland \(Northern Ireland Executive\) and Europe \(European Commission\). By enabling effective and efficient regional economic modelling and multi\-sectoral analysis, this research has supported and strengthened evidence\-based policy development in response to a range of pressing issues including climate change and Brexit. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 The shift toward decentralised economic policymaking across Europe over the last twenty years, including UK devolution in 1999, has required a significant upscaling in regional economic research modelling capacity. Responding to this need, Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute \(FAI\) has developed and applied sophisticated macroeconomic models of regional economies to better understand how these economies work, the impact of policy choices on economic outcomes, and the links between rates of economic activity and wider objectives, such as CO2 emissions and household inequalities. By providing a rich picture of a local economy, its linkages to its near neighbours and the policy environment, Strathclyde’s Computable General Equilibrium \(CGE\) models are ideally suited to the study of regional economies. 

 Since 2000, three core strands of research have been undertaken leading to the: 

-  Advancement of CGE modelling to enable ever more accurate representations of regional economies. 

-  Modification of general frameworks and application to pressing regional economic policy questions. 

-  Creation of accurate frameworks that capture the interaction between policy choices over regional economic activity and wider society objectives. 

###  Advancement of CGE modelling methods 

 Seeking to push the frontiers of CGE modelling to enable ever more accurate representations of regional economies, Strathclyde’s fundamental research has enabled the creation of many of the tools now used by organisations across the world to understand regional economic trends. The Strathclyde research developed from establishing some of the very first imperfect competition models back in the 1990s, through to the latest sophisticated developments in the field including multi\-regional modelling. Since 2000, this work has included incorporating insights from other branches of economics including forward looking expectations \[ **R1**\], price\-inflexibilities, and behavioural economics \[ **R2**\]. In addition to pushing forward model sophistication and realism, these frameworks have been applied to a range of important regional economic issues such as the importance of revenue flows from renewables for local economic development \[ **R3**\], the  impact of expectations and business confidence on economic resilience. 

 Multi\-regional macroeconomic models to aid understanding of how national policies can impact upon regional outcomes have also been developed. Most recently, this includes modelling to explore the specific impact of the UK withdrawal from the European Union \(Brexit\) on Scotland. Here the spill\-over effects from the impact of Brexit on the Scottish economy proved to be substantial relative to the direct effects from Scottish\-REU trade linkages, so that a single\-region analysis would have substantially underestimated the adverse impacts of Brexit on the Scottish economy \[ **R4**\]. 

###  Modification and application of general frameworks 

 Motivated by engagement with experts and key stakeholders, a second research strand has modified these general frameworks and applied them to pressing regional economic policy questions. In particular, drawing upon wider expertise on regional public policy, modelling was undertaken to explore the implications of different fiscal structures at a regional level, in part motivated by the trend to decentralise more tax and spending powers to regional governments \[ **R5**\]. Strathclyde’s analysis demonstrated that with conventional wage bargaining and a strong migration response, fiscally neutral ‘expansions’ can lead to contractions in the host region unless government spending is sufficiently highly valued within the migration and wage bargaining processes. Analysis of a wide range of possible regional fiscal policies was subsequently undertaken and combined with microsimulation to identify the detailed effects of a Universal Basic Income. 

###  Creation of frameworks to capture interdependence across policy domains 

 A third strand of research has focused on creating accurate frameworks that capture the interaction between policy choices over regional economic activity and wider society objectives. As concern with distributional, environmental and economic considerations has grown, Strathclyde’s research has extended and developed regional models to capture these, with a particular focus upon sustainability and energy efficiency. This multisectoral approach is necessitated by the huge variation in energy and emissions intensities across sectors \(and indeed within the electricity sector, given the focus on renewables\); the composition of output really matters. Capturing aspects of inclusive growth required incorporation of disaggregated households. The resultant framework enabled the nature of any trade\-offs or complementarities \(double or higher dividends\) among policy goals to be explored, including consideration of the conditions under which energy efficiency changes could potentially improve emissions, equity and the level of economic activity \[ **R6**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Supporting regional policy\-making through the advancement and application of Computable General Equilibrium \(CGE\) modelling, since 2014 Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute \(FAI\) has: 

-  Informed the Scottish Government’s Community Energy Policy Statement \(2015\), Energy Strategy \(2017\) and Community and Renewable Energy Scheme \(CARES\) which has contributed to the achievement of renewable energy targets. 

-  Shaped the Scottish Government’s policy response and preparations for Brexit following the EU referendum in 2016, informing ‘Scotland’s Place in Europe’ 2016 and 2018 position statements and the 2016 Scottish Parliament Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee inquiry. 

-  Enabled policy development within Glasgow City Council in relation to the Glasgow City Region deal, Brexit, Covid\-19 and net\-zero emissions targets. 

-  Facilitated third sector policy analysis and debate in partnership with the Scottish Policy Foundation, including influencing the David Hume Institute’s *Wealth of the Nation* reports and supporting the establishment of CBI Scotland’s new productivity index. 

-  Enhanced debate around the Northern Ireland Protocol and informed the Northern Ireland Executive’s policy priorities and Brexit negotiations. 

-  Strengthened policy analysis and evaluations undertaken by the European Commission through the development of its RHOMOLO CGE model. 

###  Scottish Government 

 According to the Scottish Government’s Chief Economist, who leads a Directorate of approximately 100 staff providing economic, statistical and research advice on all issues relating to the economy, the embedding of Strathclyde’s CGE model of the Scottish economy since 2011 has significantly enhanced their analytical capabilities and knowledge. With ongoing input from FAI researchers to build in\-house modelling capacity and extend the original model, including ‘research on a new two\-region \(Scotland/rUK\), and variations that capture work on energy policy, agricultural policy and fiscal policy‘, the Government is ‘now running the model fully and applying this approach in a number of areas’ \[ **S1**\]. This has enabled them to support ‘policymaking at the highest level in the Scottish Government from migration issues, where it informed the  [*Scottish Government policy position on calling for further powers on migration*](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-population-needs-migration-policy/), through to childcare, energy, labour market policy and citizen’s basic income’, which references the model throughout \[ **S1**\]. This is acknowledged by the Head of Enterprise and Innovation, who led on developing the Government’s evidence base to inform policy decisions on both energy and climate change. Confirming that the macroeconomic modelling framework ‘was used extensively to explore different energy and low carbon policies’, he notes the importance of Strathclyde’s contribution: ‘This work was supported by colleagues at Strathclyde who worked closely with our team on model developments. This included developing links between our own TIMES Climate Change model and the Strathclyde built CGE model. All this work and the analysis that followed helped to inform our 2017 Scottish Government Energy Strategy’ \[ **S2**\]. 

 Analysis undertaken by Strathclyde has also directly informed policy development, a notable example being the 2016 report for the Scottish Parliament on the *Long\-term Economic Implications of Brexit.* As outlined by the Chief Economist, the route from research to policy influence is clear: ‘Following publication of FAI research into the potential impacts of Brexit on the Scottish economy in 2016, we worked with the FAI to incorporate their findings into our analytical work, including working with them on developing new scenarios for our own internal analysis where they offered valuable advice. This informed the policy position set out by Scottish Ministers in ‘Scotland’s Place in Europe’ published in December 2016 and provided the analytical framework for our subsequent analysis and advice to Ministers in ‘Scotland's Place in Europe: people, jobs and investment’ published in January 2018’ \[ **S1**\]. 

 This is also confirmed by the Director of External Affairs, who credits Strathclyde with enabling *‘work on Brexit and Scotland’s future population strategy’* which subsequently informed debate and decision\-making \[ **S3**\]. A key example of this is the 2018 ‘Scotland's population needs and migration policy: discussion paper on evidence, policy and powers for the Scottish Parliament’, which  supplemented analysis undertaken by Strathclyde for the Scottish Parliament Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee in 2016. According to the Committee Convenor, the resulting report on the long\-term implications of Brexit made ‘a valuable contribution to understanding the specific impacts in Scotland, particularly in relation to our key economic sectors’ and convinced them of the need for additional work ‘to promote a further understanding of the potential impacts of the different trade models in Scotland and the policy decisions that would best protect Scotland’s interests’ \[ **S4**\] 

 Alongside this, research published by Strathclyde as part of the ClimateXChange initiative \[ **R3**\] played a key role in shaping energy policy. In the words of the Head of Enterprise and Innovation, it ‘had a major influence upon our understanding of the scale of potential economic benefit from community and locally\-owned energy. This was a key part of our evidence base in the Scottish Government’s ‘Community Energy Policy Statement’ published in 2015, which set out our ambitions to support community energy projects’ \[ **S2**\]. This was used to justify the Government’s support for community energy, including through the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme \(CARES\), enabling Scotland to exceed its 2020 target of 500MW of community owned and locally owned renewable energy capacity \[ **S2**\]. 

###  City of Glasgow Council 

 Recognised for its contribution to policy development at national level, Strathclyde’s CGE modelling has also enhanced analytical capacity and knowledge within Glasgow City Council. As outlined by the Director of Regional Economic Growth for Glasgow City Council: ‘In the context of the GBP1,100,000,000 Glasgow City Region deal, and the need for better understanding of the Glasgow City economy to support policy development, we commissioned the FAI to develop a city\-region Computable General Equilibrium model’ \[ **S5**\]. Developed in 2019 and now embedded in the  analytical toolkit used by officials in the Council and City Region Intelligence Hub, ‘this modelling framework has been used to not only inform our work on the Glasgow City Region Deal, but in other areas of work, including our response to Brexit and in assessing the impact of COVID\-19 on the Glasgow economy’. Stressing its ongoing importance, the Director affirms that ‘the work of the FAI has played an important role in informing our long\-term economic development strategy for Glasgow’ and that ‘going forward, we will be using the model in a number of areas, including informing our goal of becoming the first net zero city within the UK \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Scottish Policy Foundation 

 To extend the benefits of CGE modelling to the third sector, Strathclyde’s model of the Scottish economy has been shared with various non\-governmental bodies. The main thrust of this has been through the Scottish Policy Foundation \(SPF\), an independent, apolitical grant\-making charitable foundation working to promote honest, insightful and objective policy research to the people of Scotland in order to inform public debate. As well as acknowledging FAI’s ‘major contribution to the quality of public debate in Scotland’ through its day\-to\-day work, including substantial engagement with the business and policy community, the SPF Director confirms the difference that the modelling framework has made since 2017: ‘We have worked in partnership with the FAI to make their Computable General Equilibrium model of the Scottish economy available to think tanks for research purposes, boosting the analytical capacity of these organisations beyond recognition. This framework – alongside general analytical support from the FAI – means that think tanks can develop and test their policy ideas as never before. This partnership has already enabled the David Hume Institute, the Institute for Public Policy Research and Shelter Scotland to undertake research that has addressed some of the key challenges for the Scottish economy’ \[ **S6**\]. Furthermore, they ‘estimate that the monetary value of this research and modelling work that FAI has completed on behalf of the David Hume Institute, IPPR Scotland and Shelter Scotland is over GBP50,000’ \[ **S6**\] 

 According to the Director of the David Hume Institute, gaining access to the macroeconomic modelling framework in 2018 enabled it to examine *‘the different avenues through which productivity could have an impact on the economy’* \[ **S10**\]. This resulted in the publication of two reports, both of which acknowledge Strathclyde’s substantial input: *Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge* \(2018\) and *Wealth of the Nation: Who will do the jobs?* \(2019\). Reflecting on the significance of this, the Director notes: ‘The modelling research was integral to our final report and greatly influenced our conclusions. As well as being very widely covered in the media, the report was well received by the policy and business community. Following on from the report, a new productivity index has been established by CBI Scotland \- which I know that the Fraser of Allander Institute are helping to develop – supported by 24 recommendations for government’ \[ **S7**\]. This work also ‘directly led to the David Hume Institute raising significant additional funds for future work’, with GBP300,000 of funding being secured. The Director asserts that ‘our association with the research track\-record and reputation of the FAI was a significant factor in being able to secure these funds’ \[ **S7**\]. 

###  Northern Ireland Executive 

##  On the recommendation of the Scottish Government, in 2018 Strathclyde was tasked by the Northern Ireland Executive to build a bespoke sub\-national CGE model that reflected the unique conditions of the Northern Irish economy. With ongoing support and training from the FAI team, this regional model has been used to understand different EU exit scenarios and guide appropriate policy responses to Brexit, including mitigating any challenges and taking advantage of any new opportunities. Confirming this, the Chief Economist within the Department for the Economy \(DfE\) states: ‘The research of the Fraser of Allander Institute \(FAI\) has been critical to improving our ability within the NI Executive to better understand those challenges and opportunities. This included some of the first published analytical insight in the much debated topic of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Ultimately the work with FAI helped bring new understanding around EU Exit alongside helping us in DfE and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency \(NISRA\) develop new analytical capabilities that will be used to inform economic policy for decades’ \[S8\]. 

###  European Commission 

 Stretching its influence beyond the UK, elements of the FAI CGE model have been integrated into the European Commission’s RHOMOLO Spatial  Modelling Framework which supports EU policy makers to provide sector, region and time specific simulations on investment policies and structural reforms. As noted in the 2018 technical report, *‘the RHOMOLO model has been used with DG REGIO for the impact assessment of Cohesion Policy and structural reforms, and with the European Investment Bank for impact assessment of EU investment support policies’* \[ **S9** p.4\]. Key Strathclyde contributions include enabling the separation of investment from saving decisions and the introduction of a fixed real wage assumption that allows it to operate as an extended I\-O based demand driven model. These are acknowledged by the EC Scientific Officer for Regional Economic Modelling, who affirms that ‘the research that has taken place at Strathclyde in developing methods and techniques for regional CGE modelling have been essential building blocks for the RHOMOLO CGE model and for other regional modelling frameworks’ and that without this ‘it would have taken far longer to develop the sophisticated model that we have in place today, and which we use extensively in our policy analysis and policy evaluations’ \[ **S10**\].

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Teesside University on the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness and the effectiveness of jet lag treatments has led to changes to evidence\-based public health guidelines for the UK and USA. Our evidence synthesis research on physical activity and cancer risk, and high\-intensity interval training and fitness, critically informed the official Government physical activity guidelines for population health in the USA and UK. Our evidence synthesis and randomised controlled trial research on jet lag led directly to the co\-production of changes to the guidelines for the management of jet lag in international travellers \(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ‘Yellow Book’, Civil Aviation Authority, the National Health Service, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\).

 Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impacts in this case study are underpinned by our evidence synthesis and randomised controlled trial research, focusing on the association between physical activity and colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness, and the effectiveness of jet lag treatments. 

 Insufficient physical activity is one of the major behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Our research examined the associations between different levels and types of physical activity and health outcomes in two areas – colorectal cancer and cardiorespiratory fitness. A systematic review and meta\-analysis of the association between leisure\-time physical activity and colorectal cancer risk was conducted in 2008\-2009 and published in 2009 \[3.1\]. We estimated summary risk ratios for uppermost vs lowermost categories of physical activity. To quantify dose\-response, we applied a novel bootstrap resampling method to explore risk ratios as a function of cumulative percentiles of physical activity distribution, as heterogeneity in methods of measurement of physical activity levels meant that there was no common metric across the studies. For colon cancer, the research found that greater leisure\-time physical activity was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in men and 14% in women. The dose–response analysis revealed linear reductions in risk of colon cancer with increasing leisure time physical activity in both genders. 

 Increased cardiovascular\-respiratory fitness is strongly associated with reduced all\-cause mortality. Our systematic review and meta\-analysis of the effects of low\-volume high\-intensity interval training \(HIT\) on fitness in adults was conducted in 2013\-2014 and published in 2014 \[3.2\]. The research showed that low\-volume HIT produces substantial improvements \(6\-10%\) in the maximal oxygen uptake of active non\-athletic and sedentary people. Subsequently, the notion that HIT could be a viable physical activity option for public health benefits was advanced at a debate at the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Meeting in 2015: <ins>High\-intensity exercise as a public health strategy?</ins> This debate was reported in a full journal article \[3.5\]. 

 Jet lag is due to the internal body clock\(s\) of an individual being out of phase with the environmental timing of light/dark and meals after a flight that crosses three or more time zones. In 2017, airlines carried 4,100,000,000 passengers worldwide on scheduled services. The precise incidence of jet lag is unknown, but it negatively affects a substantial proportion of travellers, with symptoms including sleep disorders, daytime tiredness, exhaustion, attention, concentration and memory problems, gastrointestinal problems, and anxiety. We conducted a critical review of jet lag research between 2013 and 2014 \[3.3\]. As part of this review, we undertook an insightful cumulative meta\-analysis that showed the reported effectiveness of melatonin for alleviating jet lag symptoms reduced substantially over time, as higher quality and larger studies were published. This is an example of the ‘decline effect’ in science, where initially large beneficial effects in small early studies are later shown to have been exaggerated substantially. We also led the very first randomised controlled trial on the effectiveness of artificial bright light for reducing jet lag symptoms after a transmeridian long\-haul flight \[3.4\]. We showed that the proposed benefits of bright light, suggested by animal studies and laboratory simulations, do not necessarily translate to clinical/ practical usefulness following an actual transmeridian flight. Previously, guidelines for the treatment of jet lag symptoms have not been informed by higher\-grade evidence. The key novel work that we have undertaken since 2012 is the scrutiny of evidence translation from laboratory studies to real\-world jet lag treatment.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The underpinning research has resulted in changes to evidence\-based public health guidelines for physical activity and jet lag for the UK and USA. Our research has critically informed the current Government physical activity guidelines for population health in the UK and USA. These guidelines are the primary, authoritative, evidence\-based resource for health professionals, policy makers, and individuals on the recommended levels of physical activity to promote population health and reduce chronic disease risk. The development of the guidelines follows a similar process in each country. First, a panel of experts is assembled to rigorously review and scrutinise the evidence base on the relationship between physical activity and health. These experts place primary emphasis on high\-quality systematic reviews. Subsequently, recommendations are drafted, reviewed critically, and finalised. Relevant, high\-quality research used to underpin these recommendations is typically cited in the accompanying scientific reports and working group papers. The live debate at the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Annual Meeting in 2015, and associated paper \[3.5\], acted as a catalyst for the subsequent impact. For the Senior Policy Manager at the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care: ‘the live debate and subsequent paper created a substantial buzz on social media among physical activity scientists, policy makers, and public health commissioners, and stimulated thinking about the potential for very vigorous intermittent physical activity to be included for the first time in the UK physical activity recommendations for public health’ \[5.1\]. 

 Our meta\-analysis \[3.1\] has informed the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. It is referred to eight times in the Cancer Prevention chapter of the scientific report underpinning these Guidelines by the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee \(PAGAC\) \[5.2\]. The report states: ‘one meta\-analysis estimated dose\-response by percentile of physical activity, and found a linear reduction in risk across the 20th to 95th percentiles and estimated risk reductions between these two percentiles of 0.13 in men and 0.14 in women. This same meta\-analysis plotted risk for colon cancer by leisure time physical activity in those studies with MET\-hours per week or MET\-minutes per week data, and found dose\-response risk reductions in both men and women’ \[5.2, p. F4\-17\]. Based on our research, the PAGAC concluded that the evidence grade was ‘strong’ for a dose\-response relationship between increasing physical activity levels and decreasing risk of colon cancer in men and women \[5.2. p. F4\-57\]. Consequently, the Committee recommended that all individuals should be encouraged to engage in the recommended levels of physical activity to reduce risk for developing cancer \[5.2, p. F4\-59\]. 

 Additionally, our meta\-analysis \[3.2\] informed the 2019 UK Government physical activity guidelines. It was cited \(reference \#47\) in the Expert Working Group working paper for adults, presenting the evidence underpinning the guidelines \[5.3\]. Specifically, our findings were used to evidence the benefits of high\-intensity interval training \(HIIT\). Regarding HIIT, the Working Group report states: ‘multiple meta\-analyses and systematic reviews have demonstrated that HIIT has clinically meaningful effects on fitness \(14, 46, 47, 57\), adiposity \(14, 33, 48\), body weight \(25\), and insulin resistance \(25\)’ \[5.3, p.10\]. The final recommendation in the adult guidelines relating to high\-intensity interval activity is: ‘each week, adults should accumulate at least 150 minutes \(2 ½ hours\) of moderate intensity activity \(such as brisk walking or cycling\); or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity \(such as running\); or even shorter durations of very vigorous intensity activity \(such as sprinting or stair climbing\); or a combination of moderate, vigorous and very vigorous intensity activity’ \[5.4, p. 10\]. 

 Importantly, the 2019 update is the first time that HIIT has been included in the UK physical activity guidelines as an option from a menu of choices, based on its demonstrated efficacy in our meta\-analysis and other rigorous evidence syntheses. A Senior Policy Manager at the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care stated: “The rigorous research by Professor Batterham and colleagues on high\-intensity interval training added significantly to the emerging evidence base for the health benefits of performing very vigorous intensity activity in short bouts interspersed with periods of rest or recovery, which led directly to this form of activity being incorporated as an option into the final recommendation for adults” \[5.1\]. 

 Our research has also informed changes to publicly available guidelines on the management of jet lag. The underpinning research provided a completely new insight into jet lag management and was critical of laboratory simulation studies \(including animal studies\) claiming ‘cures’ for jet lag. Prior to the impact of our research, recommendations for managing jet lag symptoms from multiple authoritative sources contained several non\-evidenced claims about treatments and did not focus directly on circadian rhythm disturbances, tending to confuse jet lag and travel fatigue. Following the publication of our critical review and meta\-analysis \[3.3\], we completed an audit of guidelines on jet lag management in the public domain. Guidelines from the following bodies and authorities were scrutinised: The Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), The National Health Service \(NHS\) Health A\-Z Portal, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). We contacted all these authorities enquiring whether they would like us to help formulate guidelines that have a more robust evidence base. We separated those approaches with a good evidence base, for example, appropriately timed light exposure, from those with a weak evidence base \(e.g., dietary manipulation\) and sent the research to these authorities to support our enquires. 

 Previously, jet lag guidelines were not underpinned by robust evidence from studies in humans. Our research led directly to new guidelines from the following authorities, informed by high\-grade evidence. The CDC is the leading national public health institute in the USA. Their ‘Yellow Book’ is published every two years as the definitive reference for health professionals providing care to international travellers and is also a useful resource for any member of the public interested in staying healthy abroad. We co\-produced the new 2018 and 2020 guidelines for travel health with a Health Communications Specialist at the CDC. Our research \[3.3 and 3.4\] was cited and informed changes to the previous guidance \[5.5\]. For example, it was advised in 2016 to “spend time in the afternoon sun”, which was revised to more specific advice on light exposure, including referral to our study on supplemental bright light \[3.4\]. As of February 2019, views for the jet lag page in 2019 and 2020 \(1 Jan\-21 Oct\) were 11,160 and 10,781 respectively \[5.5\]. 

 Similar changes, informed by our research findings \[3.3 and 3.4\], have also been made to the jet lag guidelines produced by the following UK authorities. Working with the UK Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), we co\-produced new guidelines with the Head of Aviation Health Unit at the CAA and a Specialist at KLM Airways Health Services. These guidelines were made available on the CAA website \[5.6\]. The Head of Aviation Health Unit at the CAA has confirmed ‘that the information on the link on the CAA website is based on the publication Atkinson G, et al., From animal cage to aircraft cabin: an overview of evidence translation in jet lag research. European Journal of Applied Physiology, 2014. 114\(12\): p. 2459\-2468’ \[5.7\]. 

 The NHS Health A\-Z Portal \(previously <ins>NHS Choices Health A\-Z</ins>\) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) have also revised their guidelines on managing jet lag \[5.8, 5.10\]. We reviewed the <ins>NHS Choices Health A\-Z</ins> guidelines as part of a topic review, with reference 3.3 informing the revisions to the NHS Health A\-Z Portal \[5.8\]. This work was acknowledged with a formal letter from the Reviews Editor for Health A\-Z which clearly stated that \[3.3\] ‘was used as a source for the review’ \[5.9\]. In 2019 we co\-produced the Clinical Knowledge Summary \(CKS\) for jet lag management. Our research \[3.3 and 3.4\] is cited in the references for the summary and forms part of the evidence base underpinning the specific recommendations. In his testimonial the Medical Director and Editor for Clinical Knowledge Summaries wrote that “We at Clarity Informatics are very happy to confirm that Professor Atkinson and his colleagues, Prof. Batterham and Dr. Thompson, were instrumental in providing this content and feedback for the jet lag topic” \[5.11\]. 

 Overall, our research has informed and changed national and international evidence\-based public health guidelines on both physical activity and jet lag.
